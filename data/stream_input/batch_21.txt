B00R3LDL64|4|Boyfriend loved it!
B001EZ3SVI|5|Easy installation, great product. I bought this for my father to haul his boat. He said it was very easy to install and was thrilled with the product!
B00TG8C8PW|4|It's ok for the price
B002WBRRHE|5|love this. makes shifting much easier
B003UI1UHQ|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B004RSZOU2|5|Love this cover. It is exactly as advertised. Gets the job done for me. Fits perfectly on my 2001 Tacoma Crew Cab
B003G9G75O|5|Work out perfectly for my water heater
B00282YGGM|4|Good product
B00FGDEV9M|5|Good product and worked well with no problems.
B00DUFC8ZM|5|This was a birthday gift for my husband, he loved it and the price was very reasonable.
B00HI34B2U|3|Poor fit... Really disappointed because DashMat is sort of THE brand for this type of product. The upper or forward strip is at least an inch short from side to side, depending on where you place it.<br /><br />The main cover is about 3/4&#34; short and the round side window defrost vent is misaligned by 1/2&#34;-3/4&#34; (see attached photo).  Also, there is a 1&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; square cutout in the center of the forward strip (see attached photo) that clears nothing on my 2013 Passat SE - Could be for some sort of light sensor on another year model, but this seems unacceptable since they are supposed to be made for a specific year and model vehicle, which they ask in detail at ordering time.The stitching and material quality are fine.<br /><br />Additionally, the forward strip covers the dash mounted tweeters in the forward corners. NO MATTER WHAT DASHMAT OR ANY OTHER REVIEWER for this product says, covering any part of your speakers, particularly tweeters or midrange WILL AFFECT the sound quality. This material is NOT acoustically transparent like speaker grill cloth. This is absolutely true in my case... the high frequencies are notably muted.<br /><br />If the size was right, this would be a 5 star review even though it also covers the dash speakers (its supposed to protect the whole dash, right?). Reluctantly keeping it because I need a cover to keep dash from cracking in the long run. Disappointing since I waited specifically until I could get a DashMat brand for my car.
B0091U4XBC|3|I bit harder to install than the rear splash guards - and directions not as clear.  I ended up making a mistake on one side that was of no concern - but with better directions I would have never done that.  Also small and non-pliable.  Just a bit more coverage - and looks great.
B007KLW0BE|5|Worked perfectly!! Thanks!!
B0021KVFG0|5|Easy instasll
B001QIUGVI|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00UAC8XFW|5|It's easy to install if you have limited knowledge of electrical/motorcycle matters, like I do. I just watched a YouTube video and voila! It's a necessary addition to your motorcycle if you take longer trips. Purchase the USB extender and you'll never be without a charged device.
B001E9UWDG|5|Excellent
B00895EX7Y|5|An excellent buy.  Performs as well as non-ANR headsets costing twice as much.  Reasonably comfortable and the PTT on the right earpiece works well.
B000M2QQUO|5|These bonnets fit on my older 10&#34; Turtle Wax buffer no problem. I haven't sent them through the wash or anything, but my immediate impression is that they are pretty good quality. For the price, you can't beat 'em. The elastic band makes this bonnet easy to put on your buffer and keeps it where it is supposed to be.
B00534635Y|2|This is not like the non fleeced one that actually stays on your head while riding with no helmet
B0000AZ7ZP|5|Excellent product and instructions.
B000AME50O|3|I have used Nu Finish on my last three cars and am very satisfied, with the exception of the recently tried paste. I purchased it locally as the liquid was out of stock and I was too impatient to order the paste on Amazon. BIG mistake, where the liquid is easy to apply the paste is not. It is much more difficult; it takes more time and a lot more muscle.  With the liquid I do one coat followed by a second three of four weeks later, though in all truth one coat seems to last at least a year.
B00I8IPD8K|3|Good. Material strength lacking compared to Mopar.
B00062YY6I|5|product good
B00KTI9UQ8|5|GOOD
B000CF7CVI|5|I LIKE IT
B002XM5G70|5|Great product and easy to install
B00BAZD74K|1|Not the bulbs they say they are. I ordered 10k and didnt get 10k. Not worth the money at all
B00JL6MXAY|4|Worth the price.
B00T6JEGZ6|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B009Y7MJVS|5|So much better than the velcro
B004VND17Q|4|nice metal frame. easy to spot our van in the sea of many !
B0058EDJ42|4|Good quality
B0040TA6HE|5|Great deal. Nice product.
B00FVZG7C4|5|5 ***** seller and product
B00QQUBEBM|4|Fits perfectly. A lot better than elbow burn. Would buy again
B001BAL7W8|4|Does the job but should be less expensive for the size.
B006YWYCVG|5|Fit right on easy to install
B0006I0N3U|4|These will do the job.  They seem a little cheap, and only time will tell how long they last.  A little bigger than the ones I had, so I had to drill a hole in it to attach tot he trailer using the same holes in that.
B00AJPMPTK|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B000GU0MMU|5|Sucked the oil right out of my 2004 Malibu VLX boat. You will want to warm the engine up a little more than normal if the air temp is cold. It became slow when the oil became thicker.
B0032J1KAK|5|helps a lot!
B0074C77NA|5|Excellent package.  My son got this as a birthday present and he worked on his car himself.  He's a teenager who drives a fast a furious type low rider Honda Civic and he cares more about looks then maintenance or safety so I was happy to push him in the direction of keeping his car operational and safe.
B00TSPLUE8|5|Excellent
B003HC3UVY|3|Works as intended. Definitely not impressed with fit and finish. Looks pretty good though.
B0012ZITJQ|3|Cost me 35 us dollars. Don't see anything worth 35 dollars. But it beats going to the store and trying to find it all myself.
B000CKTJTQ|5|Just what I needed.
B0068FV596|4|Well designed product, but would not work for my application so I may have to return them.  Each plate has a pattern cast or machined into it so they're easier to align and won't shift. Comes with a few lengths of bolts for height combinations.  I can't comment on the durability of the material or finish as I wasn't able to put them into service
B00N48QOIC|5|Awesome
B00318NQFY|4|Perfect fit and brighter than my last bulbs....Wish it came with connector grease or it would be a 5+
B00CBYRKCY|5|Top Rate Product at awesome price. I put them on my 1998 Mustang GT. I've seen the same exact licensed product on other purchase sites for over $100. These arrive professionally packed, shipped FAST with tracking. I had the Hot Wheels trunk emblem and wanted to complete the set. Now I have my own little Hot Wheel :) They stick VERY WELL, are sturdy and easy to put on. Don't hesitate.
B000F0X5BG|5|great product, helps reduce heat inside my SC2
B007TY0YYC|5|Looks so nice. It makes such a difference if your signal is foggy or cracked. Instant upgrade that makes front end look like new.
B00M9WUBBA|5|Easy to use and a good price.
B008641QB4|5|Very nice fit thank you
B000IYRODY|5|Fit perfectly, works fine.
B001KO0P64|5|Perfect fit and very easy to  install myself
B000IYNVEU|5|Good price and good quality. Plug and play.
B005D5T6C0|5|Incredibly broth and clear. Fits perfectly.
B001942DLK|5|Great routers a perfect fit for my 2008 Toyota tundra they are super easy to install yourself I had no issues.
B0002JN2EU|5|Great product at an exceptional price. I use Sea Foam on my 2007 Vw Passat with turbo and have had exceptional results period.My regiment is one can in the gas tank with fill up for clean injectors and the correct number of onces 1.5 / quarts of oil directly in the oil between 30 to 50 miles before you change your oil & filter.<br /><br />Do not add Sea Foam to you oil at operating temperature it sill evaporate and you get zero benefit. Add it to a cold engine and then drive between 30 to 50 miles and your engine will clean it self. Its a wonder product! I used in an old John Deer lawn tractor and it was fantastic !!!!
B001AIZ5HY|5|Great product, Lens look brand new.
B00DJFRD2G|5|Exactly what I expected!
B00AVOAUN2|5|Smooth transaction, genuine Honda OEM fluid, received as promised.
B0000AZ3Q4|1|Wanted to clean up the back of the boat & installed this vented cap, filled in old vent hole, & now it hardly will take fuel without blowing everywhere. Takes forever to put fuel in. Never had that problem before. Can't hardly wait to remove & put old back in. People behind me at fuel dock probably will be happy too
B00OUM8GLY|5|I love this sunshade!.  I've had the kind in the past that had two<br />sunshades and they did not fit in the windshield correctly and the sun came<br />in the car around the sides.  They also would pop open when I folded them.<br />The Skorch sunshield has &#34;flaps&#34; around it and it covers the entire<br />window.  It also folds all in one swoop into a small square and then the<br />elastic keeps it from popping open.  I really like it a lot and I would buy<br />it again.
B00CQ7W3CI|5|I'm very happy with these grips.  I installed them on my V-rod Muscle, and they look great.  They are slightly smaller in diameter than the stock pieces, and the callouses on my palms I had started to get are going away.  Overall: great looks and greater comfort.
B004YWSUTI|4|no issues as expected.
B000JL95TC|1|Didn't read the ingredients when I bought these; didn't realize they were full of pesticides and the smoke would be dangerous to inhale.  Threw them away.
B00GYHUDVE|3|I got this in black squash and it smells great but it leaked or evaporated all over my glovebox. One day it was there then it was empty.
B000143LHY|5|Hard to find locally, works better than anything else I have tried.
B001DN1L6K|5|I'm a firefighter and wanted to use it for my scanner. Works great takes 5 min to install. I'm not sure how well it'll hold up in the winter but  it works. Only thing is for some people they might say it's too big. Not bad tho for my use
B001KQP51C|4|Came as directed, came in on earliest delivery date.  Only thing is there was the gasket but no nuts and washers as told in here. Not a problem long as you take your time getting the old ones off. Other than that it is as described.
B00HYI2CB6|5|fits perfectly on my nissan!! really helpful!
B00JK322MW|5|These Booster Cable (Jumper Cable) no matter what you call them they're really heavy-duty with 12 feet of reach they get the job done. No more having move you car front bumper to front bumper boost someone you can park side by side an still get the job done .
B00B8SYNUQ|2|Colors started flaking off after about 2 months of use
B00029J5FA|5|Came in a pair, natural aluminum finish, not the gold in picture, not that it would matter.<br />The largest size before a hollow screw is needed.  And one of the tools in the arsenal of items required to tune a new Holley carb out of the box.<br />I order stock jets and both sizes over and under stock, several power valves and squirters for my new carbs. Eventually will have enough small parts to tune friends or customers holleys on hand.<br />Holley carbs need tweaking, they are not an out of the box and go item, too many variables, need to know your vacuum at idle in gear if automatic for the power valve, have to read plugs for jets, have to play with pump cams and squirters to get bog out, or springs on secondaries if bog occurs there.  Takes some time, but after you master one, they are as easy as a Q-Jet...
B00BFLVVU6|5|it's been a while and this thing is still kicking. Track bike so it sits a lot and I put a battery tender on it every once and a while.
B0106V5174|5|Awesome. I will buy as a gift . Great price and quality.
B00CMP3Z4E|5|So far this thing is great!<br /><br />Had it for almost a month, and used it to jump three separate cars. All are 4 cylinder engines, so I haven't tried anything larger than that, but as easily as it has worked for me I would expect a 6-cylinder engine would be no problem for it either.<br /><br />It is very small and lightweight for a portable jumper, and even after two jumps on a full charge I had barely used any of the stored power. It charges quickly, has a useful indicator light, and the flashlight/dc input is a nice touch. I imagine this will make camping mattress inflation a breeze.<br /><br />Overall, very high quality product, would definitely recommend.
B00D8TWSTQ|1|Agree with the others that the &#34;for prison&#34; is way too small!  Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this!
B008XNRENW|5|Toss'm up on the shelf and forget about foul odors again!
B0027QWNGO|5|Looks nice and it's sturdy enough to work as an extra drink holder.
B000GHT7YM|5|My fault probably but these are a bit narrow for my  use. I should have read the dimensions better .PS. Don't be asking me a lot of questions, call the company they are very nice and get paid to answer questions.
B000VLF9NQ|5|Top quality. Super pleased I bought this.  Putting this on by myself is a breeze and the fit is like OEM fit. Being able to choose my particular vehicle for fit was a plus.<br />The first night I put it on we got a major Georgia flood and I didn't have any indication of a leak. If you are looking for a quick cover that looks good, fits good and easy to store, I recommend adding this to your accessory list.<br />Awesome find!!
B00ROVNZ1O|3|Good
B00B8Y0QPG|5|Easy to install - looks great!
B001EOYIS6|4|Decent product for the money.  I like it.
B0009H5W5W|1|Does not work as advertised.
B0082LJMC6|5|Blew two cans on the finish of my motorcycle - gave me exactly the deep &#34;wet&#34; gloss I was looking for.
B007EHOWNI|4|work's like it should
B00P8ALHEU|4|Fit fine reception average
B003V57NUQ|1|I installed two sets of racks initially for my kayaks thinking that this more affordable and clearly well reviewed item would be sufficient for my needs but as I was coming home from a trip, two of the straps ripped and the kayak flew off my car into oncoming traffic on the highway. Though at first it may have seemed sturdy, after only a couple hours of use, it completely failed me. The foam is also cheap and started to rip and wear away after a few hours of driving. Also trying to return these cost as much, if not MORE than what you purchased so be wary of their return policy. Will not purchase again.
B00DXNGIES|5|excellent cover
B00BG90DR4|5|Exactly what I expected.
B000C7FCTK|5|Needed this for my Buick Reatta - a rare car for which few aftermarket options are available. Seems to be getting even better with age now that it's been in for nearly a year. Go for it, you won't be sorry. Just make sure you have a good mechanic who is talented at hiding the refill nipple.
B001PYNZ16|2|Put this on my 1990 Ford E150. Had a leak from the start. Tightened and retightened the brake lines multiple times trying to stop the drip. Finally figured out that it wasn't the brake line connections it was the screw in plug with an o-ring on the bottom of the unit. Looked at one at the parts store and they don't have the leakey screw feature. If you look at the nub sticking out from the bottom and it has a screw plugging the hole either go get one that doesn't or put some kind of sealant on the treads before you install. The o-ring alone didn't do the job on mine.
B00UIPOB1Q|5|Beautifully done.  Easy application.
B00XL1GX0G|5|Looks great. Installed in about a minute.  I like this one because it has the Toyota name on it.
B00EJWYKQU|5|High quality product, made in Germany, fits perfectly.
B009I69SAK|5|fit perfect  no problems  on installing  this  had to find new bumper bolts no problem there looks like a new truck
B000C8RATE|5|The items that arrived is as described.
B00J00X3NW|5|Best oil on market today
B0041CC89O|2|Great for a bit, but the foam around the face comes off. Will not purchase again.
B00CHDB124|5|fit perfect no problem install it
B000CQRTVK|5|These installed without any issues and they work well.  I haven't had any squealing at all, not even during the break in period.
B00YHYGGMG|5|These lamps were a plug & play replacement for the backup bulbs on my 2011 Ford Flex. Nice bright white light, noticeably brighter than the original lamps. For this application these LED lamps were perfect. [[ASIN:B00YHYGGMG JDM ASTAR Extremely Bright Canbus Error Free 3014 Chipsets 194 168 2825 W5W T10 LED Bulbs,Xenon White]]
B00TGHDWBW|5|product as described. Shipping was faster than advertised
B006GWVBQ8|5|This product is awesome. I had tons of hard water stains all over my black boat. I sprayed some Hot Sauce on the boat and it immediately looked like brand new! I was so surprised! It also smells very good. Will recommend this product to everyone! AMAZING!
B007KOT1OA|1|Ordered 2, only received 1. Black coloring was very faded and had white streaking throughout. I was only out $6 over this, but still disappointing.
B003YJIIJO|4|Right after I ordered this the picture was incorrect.  It showed to circuit breakers in the pic but description stated one input, one output.  I tried to cancel the order the next day and was informed that it was already shipped and I would have to pay for return shipping and a 20% restocking fee.  Luckily after talking to Xantrex directly I found that this one will work for my application and I used it.  It is heavy so may need 2 folks to lift into tight space but install was quick and easy but mine what a replacement so I did not have to wire anything.  Very happy with the product but with the restock fee you may want to make sure the part is what you need from this seller..
B0000ATZDE|5|Very well made would highly recommend
B00H5F2DJY|5|High gloss finish. Really adds to looks of the bike. Very satisfied. Took awhile to arrive, but worth the wait.
B0078M4T3M|1|The bull bar came in from amazon great. But after installing on a 2015 f150 you can't see the black horse.
B0045UY8KY|1|Didn't hold up AT ALL and had gaps when wiping!
B00EVFEBKU|5|not only is it one of the best foldable solar panels have both 5 v and 12 v outputs and customer service is outstanding
B00061SGJ0|2|Bought this tool base d on review to replace the ball joints on my 2008 Jeep Wrangler. It broke after just one side. Had to rent one from the local autoparts store to finish the job.
B005YCZ59A|4|slightly unstable buy it though.
B001EAQTRI|5|Fixed feedback issues I was periodically experiencing using the aux input on certain stereo systems with my Galaxy Note 4. All wine/hiss/pop interference has stopped. Overall very satisfied.
B008BOG0PG|5|This oil makes my Jeep 4.0 inline motor with 175k run smooth.
B000ETAPX4|3|So little spray in a big can
B00IMMDH5I|5|Great price...saved me money
B000NVW1LM|4|it did not stop the leak , but it did slow it down to a drip or two a day , it was a couple tablespoons a day. So I would say it is 90% effective for the front main seal leak, on my Mercedes CLK 320 . .
B002P8J2HW|5|Product as advertised.. Fit perfectly.. Great price.. Works great.. Buy this!!!
B00M7RERPS|4|Very handy product. I use it at least 3 times a week while working from my truck as a laptop computer platform. Easy to store away when not using.
B007V9N3S4|1|I bought this grill 2 in a half years ago.  It is laying on a road in Texas somewhere because it fell off my truck.  The mounting brackets on this grille are crap.  Please do not buy this piece of junk.
B0013LDNEK|5|I ordered saddlebag brackets for my 2002 Honda Shadow VT 750 Ace. They arrived in about a weeks time, and I had no issues on putting them on. They even shipped extra bolts of different sizes to get the write fit.... Thanks do much.
B00AC5J4FK|3|The mount itself is excellent. Great fit and finish. The brake lamp assembly connector pins were not crimped on correctly to the wires which took me some extra troubleshooting to figure out. Wound up soldering pins to wires. Now works great. The wiring diagram was incorrect. Incorrect color description for wiring diagram. Figured it out by swapping leads until brake lamp worked as described.
B00DP7HPB2|5|These are the real ones made in Australia. They are very sturdy and easy to replace.
B009ZPH4HS|4|Don't fit exactly but can be trimed
B000BQYA7W|5|Great Product. AAA++++
B00C1CEJKW|4|its ok
B00Y4GY6Z6|5|Looks good on my jeep good product!
B00BR035VS|5|I make a number of long trips each year. After my first out-of-town flat tire and finding it difficult to locate a tire dealer who would fix the flat after I had used the inflator kit with the &#34;goo&#34; it puts into the tire, I decided I really need a spare tire. This kit is Kia OEM and not some knock-off. The cost for the kit with the tire mounted on the rim and inflated, plus shipping was the same as the price for the kit alone from the dealer. Dealer would have charged an additional $100 to mount the tire and install the kit. Installation took 5 minutes and anybody could easily do it.
B006QJG3AA|5|I have a glass stove top that I could not get clean even with a razor blade. This loosens it and then I scrape it with the razor blade. It looks so much better. Will keep using it as necessary!
B005LGYB44|5|Perfect fit. Great price. Came on time
B00EFDYFHW|5|Worked perfectly.
B00GRHRTEU|4|Easy to attach and detach. However, my driver side one blew back on the drivers side as soon as I hit the highway. The whistling sound is there but doesn't bother me with the wind and music. They get the job done in making my jeep legal and that's all I really wanted them for anyways.
B000CONV3C|2|The green filament is stuck inside the paper, the inside of the paper seems to have adhesive, which it shouldn't. I had to try several times to remove a piece of the filament without breaking it, really frustrating. Why is this 8 bucks???
B004J4FJHM|5|just what we needed to transport our car.<br />very safe.
B00GS9ENAK|2|After a hour plus of trying to get this filter to seat in it's intended spot it would not fit. Could not get it to fit so I lock it into place. Broke my back and dripping sweat trying. I returned and ordered the Mann Filter. Went right in and fit first try. Buy the Mann. I have a 2011 E350. MADE IN CHINA.
B002950DFG|4|Mount fit my 2011 Hayabusa like a glove but you have to rig away to mount your phone or GPS.  I used Velcro and it works well.  I found an old phone case that I wasn't using and put the Velcro on it and the face of the Tank Mount.  Phone stays in place without issue.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It fits my Rav4 window perfectly. Super easy to use and I noticed the heat reduction the first day, as my dash is almost black. Thank you!
B005QE7EPY|5|I like, and it really fits our Camry perfectly.
B00ARJPKGS|5|Saved over $125.00 by purchasing this part for my 2003 impala. Through amazon vs. car quest. Fit perfect in my 3.8 ltr.
B000A0EJ9S|5|Affordable and gets the job done. I change the filter ever year. No issues. Installed in a 2003 Honda CRV
B00EEX80SS|5|Excellent merchandise and price. Fast shipping. Got me back up and going.
B004HNT4WQ|5|Very easy to use, the locking mechanism works smoothly and reliably. The keys are standard quality, nothing wrong here either. Buy it you will no be disappointed.
B00T2GT9L4|4|As always, Anker makes the best. Have not used the car starter yet, but the battery has been awesome to have as a backup. It has a high quality feel to it, heavy to the touch. The case it comes is is also well built and easy to just throw in the truck.
B00B2I2EK8|1|This did not fit my Tucson, please pay attention.
B008B0OHBE|4|No instructions, just a parts list in the box, so they lose a star.  Probably added an hour to the install because of that.  Had to grind on one of the yokes to get it to clear the drain plug on the shifter side.  If you're not mechanically inclined, you may need help with the install.<br /><br />Functionality is great, they work as intended.  Get yourself a set of Kuryakyn pegs though.  I had trouble keeping my feet on the o-ring pegs that came with the kit.  The bar is 5/8x5/8 square with a 1/4 bolt.
B00JMHHF9Q|5|Works great!!!
B00FRT77GO|5|Looks good on my Dodge Pickup
B00062W5TG|3|Not as good as the old &#34;Bugs-Be-Gone&#34;
B00VUTXLII|5|Installed in a 2006 Chevy trailblazer that had been having issues with the fan for years. First just level 5 wouldn't work for about 4 years. Finally the rest started going out. When I took it apart the blower motor resistor and wiring was all burnt up. I replaced it and it has been working good for months.
B00IZCNN72|5|just what we needed, great description
B0041CDPQO|3|works good
B00267PZUK|5|Ford's design of the 3 valve Triton engine spark plugs has made MANY people unhappy! But Lisle's answer to Ford's mistake is AWESOME. Now this tool system is well designed and easier to use than the first system I tried. I won't name them, but I will highly recommend Lisle extractor system. What I found out about Lisle tools company while using their extractor shortly  after I made a mistake removing one of the plug ends. I thought I would have to pull the cylinder head because of my mistake. But I was SO WRONG, and best thing was that Lisle has brilliant people on staff to help knuckleheads like me! Before calling Lisle I called nearly all my tech friends to see if they had any ideas, even someone who has done some of the 3 valve Tritons was stumped as well. Then I remembered reading in the instructions, it said to CALL THEM before you remove the cyl head or in my case try another dumb idea... I left a message at the number in the instructions. About an hour later someone from Lisle called me, ask what the problem was. He then gave me another way to fix my mistake, and exactly how to remove the broken spark plug tip that I thought was impossible to fix. Glad I called, it saved me hundreds of $$ just in parts!<br />With that help, I was back on track and I was able to finish the extraction very easily and only cost me an extra $8.00! I shudder to think of the time and parts for removing and reinstalling the cylinder head to fix my screw up. But with Lisle tech help in LESS THAN an hour my mistake was corrected!!<br />I now have a new favorite tool company, and they will be my first choice in the future! And all this time I thought competent customer service and care after the sale was gone forever. Thank you Lisle!
B0052SF0LO|3|not as good as the one from Costco
B00JA80PEO|4|I have never owned another bluetooth headset so this is just going by this headset and not comparing it to a cena.<br /><br />I would give it 3 stars but its so cheap that the savings earned it an extra star.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent for what youd expect (If youre listening to music, youre just gonna hear the music, its not gonna sound good, but youll hear it, which is better than nothing for sure.<br /><br />So as for talking to other people... I dont know if this can communicate with other headsets directly.<br />But talking to someone else who has one of these is pretty decent, not too much delay.<br />The main gripe about this is that you can only talk to one other person at a time.<br />It gives you instructions on how to pair headsets together but its just setting it up like this.<br />Person 1 and Person 2<br />Person 2 and Person 3<br />Person 1 and Person 3<br />The three of you can never talk together at once, you have to switch between people which is lame.<br /><br />The workaround to this is that because you can pair it with your phone, you can just have each person pair it to their phone and then enter a 3 way call.<br />Talking to someone via a phonecall is a lot worse than talking directly headset to headset.<br />The quality is a little lower and the delay is huge. Its about 3-4 seconds from the time you say something to when they hear it which on the road is a long ass time.<br /><br />My main use is just listening to music which I would say make it definitely worth the money.<br />And if youre only talking to one other person then its awesome for that too.<br /><br />But honestly if I knew the 2 person limitation thing I wouldve just spent the extra money and got a Cena probably. But for its price, and those 2 functions I give it 4 stars.
B00JBHXZGE|5|Great deal and awesome color and construction, very happy with this purchase, can't wait to get them installed.
B00GQG1SWQ|5|I buy into the idea that the English know something about making gear for riding in rain, and so added this jacket to my collection. I've just gone through a Sydney winter. Here you can practically ignore the temperature much of the year, though winter rides can get cold at elevation or on rainy days. Most of my rides are long Saturdays in the saddle, 8 to 10 hours on a good day, and I really feel the cold after a while. For that reason, when it gets below about 55 degrees, I start to take it seriously. But with this jacket I've been able to ride down to mid-40s without any trouble. It is my go-to jacket for cold and/or wet days. I haven't experienced any leaks, and so don't bother wearing a rain shell on top. Furthermore, the fit is loose enough to allow significant layering underneath. I can ride in much cooler temps than I could with previous jackets without feeling like I've added excessive bulk. In fact, this winter I only used my heated jacket-liner once. Now my feet and hands (my thumbs really) get cold long before my upper body.<br /><br />I'm not sure how helpful the Outlast layer is because when it gets cold, I always wear a couple layers underneath, so the Outlast doesn't come anywhere near my skin.<br /><br />This jacket makes few concessions to warmer weather. On one ride, the weather warmed up from the 50s to the mid 70s. I had a layer or two underneath, and became aware of the heat as I got closer to home with its stop and go traffic. Any more time on the bike and I would have peeled off some layers. With other jackets, the vents would have been enough to cool me off, but this one doesn't allow very much air flow.<br /><br />It has decent safety features and offers plenty of pockets. The build quality looks to be good. It shows some dirt, but not badly. It has a lot of snaps+velcro on the pockets, which differs from my Motoport jacket (only hook and loop on the pockets). Pockets appear to be waterproof.<br /><br />I decided to get a bad weather jacketafter experiencing serious discomfort several hours from home. So I resolved to buy something good, and wasn't in a mood to be dictated to by price. I went to my local BMW dealer, assuming they had the best gear sold locally, but had major problems with the fit. I'm on the lean side with fairly thin arms and have, over 30 years or so, increased my waist size by two inches (or maybe even 3) . Much to my chagrin, when I tried on BMW jackets with my heated jacket underneath, if it suited my thin arms, there was enough room in the torso to accommodate a child's helmet. I tried on their whole range and found nothing that worked. This jackets allows me to wear a thick underlayer or two without becoming bulbous but also works with just a thin layer underneath.<br /><br />I'm tempted to say that you can't miss the bright yellow, but I'm sure drivers will find a way.<br /><br />In the end, I'm really happy with the jacket and would recommend it to those who ride in bad weather.
B008Y9F0MM|5|OEM part.
B004471XLA|5|Great product and I received it so soon I was shocked.
B005N6WZ36|3|This tank appears from the picture to have a gold or cream cast to the roses. The roses are a dull grayish tan, with brown edging.  No gold or cream color.  I was disappointed by this, however the overall design is still likeable.  Fit definitely runs small, juniors sizing not women's, which I expected from some of the other reviews of this clothing supplier.  Straps are not adjustable
B00KL3ALGO|5|I think these are great!  After purchasing others that used suction cups that did not hold the shade snugly (so they fell off), I decided to try these!  They work great, and stay on the window until you pull them off (tested by our toddler grandsons!).  It would be nice if they were a wee bit larger but they do the job as they are!  I may order another set for our second car!
B000ZANC8W|5|Great covers very comfortable
B00332DA4K|5|Looks awesome on my Jeep!
B0002MABGE|1|Missing 2 pieces.
B000EVYGV4|5|works great. easy to use.
B005VPS2TU|5|Fit perfectly, much cheaper than the $150 the dealership wanted.
B009YFR73U|5|Works well
B000FPZSN4|4|Almost perfect fit, but it's hard to find components that fit perfectly in 30 year old cars.
B005CNNLRY|5|Product delivered on time and as promised. Installation was quick and easy with no issues. The material has grip so your feet don't slip and the bottom has little spikes that keeps them in place. Very pleased with my purchase.
B00HUYK9TG|4|Great
B00029WYEY|5|Easy cleaning kit with spray oil easy to use a must with the K&N filters..
B001O0XKR0|5|Worked well.
B0007XQ3UQ|3|Honestly, not much in here that isn't in the glove box manual. I was surprised, as the motorcycle versions of these guides take you down to the frame and are illustrated beautifully. I could not resolve my AC problems with this book and I doubt you can solve any but the most rudimentary issues with it.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Bought 2 of these for my 2 cars. Thought I was not going to need them- now I do not know how I lived with them. They are light and very easy to put in the windshield and out. Works VERY WELL!!
B00DD10CUQ|1|Very thin and cheaply made.  Didn't stay in place.
B000RY8V5A|5|Great product and great quality. I only had to make 1 minor tweak for it to fit. I'm VERY happy with how fast Amazon sent it to me. :-)
B000ALDRK4|5|works  great
B003AT8HVC|5|Nice
B00WH1ZC80|5|Thumbs up!!
B0002STR22|5|I'm alive, and I sprayed lacquer through 1.0mm nozzle at close distance
B006OQ35GU|5|Makes flushing tanks simple. My trailer has the flush option. Hook up the water drain until clear. No piles in center of tank.
B009DK3TPG|5|Excellent 100%
B00WR6ZRG2|5|Works fine...no problems so far...only setback is the warning lines seem to be just a tiny bit inaccurate, but not enough to justify a lower score.
B0012PSZG8|5|Perfect fit, well built. Note - came with BLUE cover as opposed to black pictured.
B000C2WIHE|5|Quality part! Worked well on 2004 trail blazer.
B00STXAXJ8|4|Very nice quality. Not too thick or bulky...yet not thin. Front mats and cargo fit perfect but took a star off because back seat floor mats are way too small for my 2014 jeep grand limited.
B00AWXZJPQ|5|It is a very nice product.  No flaws, highly polished.  The only issue I find with it is the keyed hitch pin that came with it.  It is about 1/2 inch too short to fit my class III hitch pin hole.<br /><br />I would buy this again.
B003IS3HV0|1|Don't know what all the great reviews are about. But it made my leather darker but not evenly also leaves sticky stuff but it dose leather seem plumper as long as the stuff is on it but it sticky but soften. If you rub aqafor or vaslin on your leather Prob dose same thing. Should not be called conditioner more like leather vaslin. I'm starting to think all the great reveiws are bots can't trust anything theses days but read the 1 star reveiws before buying I don't listen now I returned it after my 1000 buck leather chair is all sticky and dark spots
B001UOS8RM|5|As expected. Easy install.
B001BBSD9C|5|As described. Balance is real. I'd had my doubts but my bike is a bit smoother. Haven't had a need for the sealing part yet ( no nails or such) but I feel better knowing I have an emergency plug and air kit. Recommended. I'm pleased with this purchase.
B000BUQOCC|5|Bought this after a weekend of dry camping when the family was &#34;sick&#34;.  This did a thorough job of cleaning the black tank, and the smell is finally gone!  Has good pressure and the on-off switch on the handle is very convenient.  No leaking problems.  Will use this on a regular basis to keep the smell down.  The only downside I saw, I couldn't fit the want down inside the Johnny Chock I bought.  Guess I will have to put the handle side in the Johnny chock before I hook up the hose.  Minor inconvenience
B0006SU3QW|5|I just sprayed my Pelican case Pick & Pluck foam with 2 cans (needed to make sure it worked ;-) and boy did it!
B00SVNRJKC|5|very nice
B0009IK5VC|4|Worked great at first but seemed to wear out quickly. Felt like I should replace the wipers after 6 months. However not bad for the price.
B000AZ7SS2|5|Truck smells like new again
B00120JYDQ|5|easy to install and looks good
B00T0IE1DA|5|The storage bins that fit these cubbies are these ones: [[ASIN:B00RM0UPZG Sorbus® Foldable Storage Cube Basket Bin (6 Pack)]]<br /><br />They're not the greatest quality fabric or stitching, but they're only $25 for six and they're very sturdy.
B00VDR6YEK|5|Great brightness, FAST shipping! These lights are amazing
B00B2AG2Q8|5|Very easy to install and we'll worth the money. They worked perfect when unhooked for the trails on Drummond Island. Aired down to 10 PSI and unhooked my sway bar links and the rocks, mud and trails were fairly easy to navigate.
B0014FGVVW|5|Saved my tail and was very easy to use.
B000F09CF4|5|This stuff works.  I don't know how but it does.<br />The liquid is rather thin and flows easily.  I use a precision oiler and the two get along fine.<br />thank you
B000EOEX3M|1|Please don't buy from this company!  We ordered this part and it didn't fit right at all!  It rubbed, we had to order it from the dealer and paid for installation twice!
B005UZK77G|4|Does what its supposed to do. like the price
B00EA2VMTW|4|Was easy to install especially for someone who knows nothing about cars! But all you need is a screw driver! I just don't like the color of the light tan, its kinda tacky. 😂😭😭
B00FBKSBA0|5|So This is my second time buying this product and I love it yet again. The install is simple. But this set came with more the older one I had, unless i wasn't paying attention to the smaller bulb for the high beam. But still great color, easy to,install. Was in a front end collision so needed new ones.
B00009AOCF|4|Cheap packaging, great product
B00WRI7GIM|4|great tank for the money 0 to 90 oms sender Love the #10 A&N fittings
B00BN45AYI|5|Thanks
B00UWERA1Q|4|arrived sooner than expected. nice quality product
B00TUFJ25K|5|Fit my 155c perfect.  Steering is just like new. Great product.
B0052UBO62|5|It worked.  It was easy to program, and now I have two functional key remotes for my 2004 Xterra.  Perfect.  Even came with a battery!
B00EVQHQ6K|2|Very bulky
B00021XQLC|5|Also as good as DOT straps at a fair price
B001O0XMHS|5|I've used wagner products before.  They are great..
B00BLBLMP4|4|First way better pricing than anyone locally for these not that I should be shocked. My only complain is one of my tires has a very slow leak and loses about 10psi over a 3 week period so I constantly have to top off the tires or I get a low tire light. That could be from the garage who installed them doing something wrong though.
B000C9MZ02|5|Quality product. Exact fit for my GMC K1500.
B0012RI5IO|4|good
B004SFKJIQ|5|I went with the reviews and what the Camco people said. I put it in the dressing room of a horse trailer. I was just a little tired of the blue portable hot things you see everywhere. This is wonderful. If you cannot handle 5 gallons, use less and empty it more often. It does not develop an odor and comes with several packs of stuff to put in to prevent that.
B009DK1XFE|5|Did not expect much for the price + shipping.<br />NICE NICE NICE<br />Have not installed so not sure of fit, hole locations etc.<br />But the finish, look and condition are all excellent.  even matches color of original (grey)
B00HD50BEK|5|Works
B000CPI62W|5|Very solid. Big improvement over my last hitch.
B00TT7RWYC|5|I installed the Led kit in about 1 hour and Boom! my ride is glowing to the music<br />Thanks OPT7 flawless manufacturing keep up the good work
B00171V1WC|3|Works fine
B0073WEZU4|2|Didn't work well if you do not have xm radio.
B005BNZ59M|5|great
B0013FY5ZC|5|I got this item on time everything was on point. I would order again if I had too.
B00W47NSYM|5|works as described and matched my dark brown leather prefectly.
B00B9H5DYG|5|This was the exact perfect fit. Dealership wanted $250.00 to install a new handle on my 2008 Chevy Trailblazer. I purchased this from Amazon,  paid a Mechanic $30.00 to install. Overall savings $175.00 = a happy me!
B00493S6CS|5|After replacing my brake lights on my 2007 Chevy Colorado they still were not coming on.  This was the next solution in my troubleshooting research as was an easy fix.  Took less than five minutes to figure out how to twist into place.  Thank you for providing the solution and making the road a safer place.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Shade is easy to use and works great&#34;
B001KZ2JVC|5|Father's Day gift.........my dad and his corvette love it!!! Make sure to condition it prior to use as instructed and if you care for it as instructed these will last forever!
B001GJ3EJS|1|To tiny for the job
B007EEXIXG|3|you have to be careful not to stretch the product or else you'll always notice a slight difference in the color.  looked good, i had it on for a couple of months and took it off and switch to plasti dip.
B00A2QBN12|3|material is not as solid, but works.
B01092IEEM|5|It's was excellent  product and I love it
B00OJ8VGZ2|1|I ordered this for my 2014 Ford Explorer.  This must be the worst design I have ever seen.  The problem is how it attaches to the sides.  It uses a small plastic clip with velcro attached that you hook between the glass and the side trim panel.  In theory this will work, but is not easy to take out once installed.  I tried to install and could not get the passengers side in but I was able to get the drivers side to clip in.  The really BIG problem is there's no easy  way to remove.  I had to go get a screwdriver to pry it back out.  Do this a few time and your trim will be destroyed.  In my opinion this is a huge design flaw.  It would have been better if you could have put the clips in and then just attached to the clips using snaps or Velcro.  That would have been much easier to work with.  I would not advise anyone to buy this product.
B00I15ATQQ|5|works great
B00ORCF01Q|4|Placed one on each outside mirror of my Jeep Wrangler YJ.  Looks nice!
B0049QQ8LQ|3|It fit perfectly, installed in less than an hr but only lasted 3 yrs. I have to replace it again and am buying another one.
B000ETQMIQ|5|Nice compact design. Bean bag keeps it in place and the inside plastic liner prevents liquids from leaking out onto the car floor
B004I1F3AE|5|I paid $200 to a local mechanic to change my headlight bulbs. Within a year one burned out. So... Thanks to YouTube and this headlight, I replaced the whole light myself. My old one was foggy and this one fits perfectly! I will be ordering the other side in the future. Very satisfied.
B00GJQSS62|4|Very nice cans but I decided to go with something I could dual-purpose (Pelican Cases). These are pretty light but don't have handles or a hinged lid. The aesthetics would have been better than my pelican cases, I'm sure.<br />You must drill your own mounting holes, measure twice.<br /><br />This company obliged me with a return once I opted for the Pelicans instead (didn't even unbox the Tusks).
B00BJP89US|5|Great, they work like a champ in my 2010 BMW 535i. Thank You
B0002MSY7C|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B001NYYREC|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B0002MSY6S|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B0007XS06Q|5|Worked Great!
B000TPC7HU|5|The tape was great. We actually found that we needed it wider fir the area I was coverings. Thank you so much!
B000NWA8HU|5|Easy to install and works like a champ.
B004VFSLP6|5|works like a champ
B000CBOVO8|5|just what I needed.
B000NJ14CG|5|Very happy with my Awning Knobs
B0055F5050|5|worked as great expected
B000I4JPZE|5|Haven't had to use this yet but it appears / feels heavy duty. Cheapest price was found here on Amazon. Will update in the future if / when I use it.
B000GRS2GG|5|Fit our trike like it was custom made. Very happy with this purchase.
B004ZBD69M|3|After three months of almost continuous daily abuse, the material looks as new as the day we purchased these covers. That's Good. Unfortunately, they are just a bit too small for our RV captain chairs (they were very difficult to put on & they will not stay tucked-in despite the plastic stays.) That's Bad. Perhaps even worse is that I hadn't thought about how the elasticized hem would bind-up the chairs' skirts. That's just Ugly.<br /><br />I'm continuing to use these covers until I can find a suitable replacement. They just don't work well for the standard captain chairs in our Forest River motorhome. Even so, I do think they are a very durable option for smaller captain chairs that do not have skirts.
B00KAFOHUE|5|Love this bumper sticker!!!! I get a lot of compliments on it😍
B001CEG90I|5|Standard Fram quality, fits well, filters well, a good replacement.
B008YFTKMW|5|These lights plugged right in maybe took about 10 minutes. They are a lot brighter then the stock lights and they look better.
B00Y5IDYYC|5|just what i needed
B0013V6NBA|5|Just what I wanted.  Looked all over Arizona swap meets and could not find until I got home and order from Amazon.com. I just need one more for front of vehicle.  Plate is very lightweight but holds up well and doesn't need to be heavy.
B00032KBFE|5|Locking fasteners screws are good and they are easy to install onto the licence plates, works good and looks good.
B00SBZRKEU|1|This thing wouldn't pump 2.5 gallons in a day? Piece of junk! I can barely tell if anything is running through the hose. Don't waste your money
B00032KC3K|5|Great screw covers and fits good and looks good, easy to use and place.
B00TJHR1FM|5|Good for the money
B00B6DGCQG|5|It fixed the noise (thumping over bumps) that was driving me crazy. Changed the strut mounts 1st and that helped a little but the main cause were the front sway bar bushings which by all appearances, seemed to be fine. Apparently they get stretched out and do not hold the bar snugly. Additionally, these replacements seem to be more durable unlike the OEM bushings.
B00B81DSNG|3|Marginal qualify for the money.  These are nylon-based and have all the stitching however you have to do the install yourself they're not slip on and require you to staple them to the seat. If you're not qualified upholsterer this is harder than you might expect and you could have gaps in the seat or come up short on one side and long on the other if you're not ultra careful with how you do it. Again no leather is present here this is just all nylon material. How do you reach the price of this much money I have no idea but they do.<br /><br /> Yes, I got suckered into buying these myself think it would match my bike very well however I opted also for the rear seat cowl which is a 2 second upgrade and far easier option to put on. I would recommend probably using an upholstery shop to install these because it does require stapling and it does require some minor experience with understanding how to do the corners.  If you're not experienced you may experience a lack of quality on the edges which is not going to look good on your 5-figure Honda Repsol 1000 CBR.<br /><br />Again,  this is not a 10 minute installation. You will need to spend some time read the directions and understand how to staple this and whether or whether not to remove your existing seat cover in order to get a tighter fit. In some cases the sea cover might even remain on depending on how much a gap you want. These are pretty neat looking, they do add looks but May prove to be slightly slip year then other materials if you're wearing leathers.<br /><br />I'm not sure I've ever seen a pair of these untracked day but you may be able to use them I'm just not sure. I've never seen any racer anywhere using the seat covers at the track.<br /><br />Are they worth $250-$300? No. Are they worth $100? Yes.
B00G0P0ER8|5|The part is exactly what I needed and fit like a glove!
B002MQD3EU|5|Great buy for anybody that owns a Vega helmet easy to pop in and replace
B0073JI1NE|5|A perfect metal key for my Infiniti G37.
B00U0N3XLU|5|Good lights. Had to beat for the money! Thank you for great service!
B000842AAQ|4|Before I bought this, I read most of your reviews and bought it anyway.  After wrestling with it to get it over the exhaust pipe and getting the bolts started (the bolt holes lined up ok), it came out pretty nice.  It would have been easier with an extra person and if I'd raised the rear end.  It does sit a little low like some of you have written, but that hasn't caused any problems yet.
B003CW56LQ|5|Great product, fits car perfect.
B001BK04B8|5|perfect fit and clear optics
B000BMWXZM|4|Thank you!
B006QH56E6|3|I had one of these for just over 2 years and it worked great.  Great battery had no problems until it completely died with no way to jump the special battery. Tried to charge the dead battery for 1 hour just for it to act like a dead battery.  Four different people with professional car jumping equipment tried to jump it and failed.  I used mine quite a bit with up to 5 hand held devices charging on it on a regular basis about an extra 6 amp draw on top of using the air conditioner, lights, etc. It would occasionally get low in power when it would warn you by almost shutting the car down ( engine stutter just before becoming stalled with a dead battery ) no warning light.  I think this battery gives normal power right up to the last 20% of power when the power output drops suddenly and does not easily trigger a battery warning light (I never got one).  A normal battery before it dies would cause engine shutter often and or a warning light but this one acted 100% normal and died completely with no warning. I used to go burn through batteries every 16 months (DieHard Gold) and before that about every 14 months with interstate.  I had the battery tested it was at 9V at 1amp after charging for 1 hour.  Will work well for normal users, but be aware if you draw a decent amount of extra power on a regular basis it could die on you with no way to jump it.  I required a tow and spent about 8 hours before I could get this hard to find replacement battery in Chicago.  It would have been 4 hours but the part of town I was in did not have taxis that would come.  Still I did get another one to replace the burned out one and it was still under warranty so it was a free replacement by optima.  In my opinion the best battery available for normal users.
B00199HXA6|5|Perfect fit
B00650NY6G|5|5 stars
B000CMHVG2|1|Didn't work. Had to return.
B000C9DHHM|3|This product didn't plug into my 04 GMC Sierra after they said it would work. Disappointed. Even though this product wasn't compatible with my truck, I returned it and received my refund 30 minutes after the product was left at the UPS store. So, that's a plus.
B000M5WT8Y|5|Very good prduct
B00KNMKRU8|5|Works great charged a yellow top battery and it works.
B00C5RHTG4|5|It is ONLY the outside part..
B000CD6HN4|5|Excellent wipers - no steaks
B004UQV3II|3|Didn't last very long.
B009S954J6|1|These did not fit my vehicle.
B0099M6HBG|5|ok
B0059XCVVO|5|Awesome product and fast shipping
B00FXIFBLC|5|Very Nice<br />Great Price
B002HGFRNU|1|I had one of these chargers for about two years, when it died I ordered another one. I use it to charge and maintain the batteries on my golf cart. The  second one I ordered died within a month, I ordered a replacement charger and it died within two weeks. I noticed these newer ones would run very warm, my old one never did. I have given up on these for use on the golf cart.
B00VGVI6S0|1|It had a rip in it the day after I installed it on my 2001 Eldorado and I never did get any seat belt covers.
B00KYXATX6|1|What a POS, rarely works, get a couple pumps to crap out a piddly amount of grease then nothing. Pound on it, pull the spring loaded lever in and out, grease goes everywhere I don't want it to, swing it around, throw it against the wall ,same issue. Now I gotta go take a flying lucas and flush my POS.
B002PB1L50|5|excellent
B005JPJECQ|5|It's very hard to beat Meguiars products. Works great on my small flex rotary polisher.
B00KSDSYCK|3|These are great for after the beach or the gym. But they leave a LOT of lint on the seat. And the photo looks like they're fitted to the headrest, but they are not.
B000E28COK|3|I thought I would get the &#34;O-RINGS&#34; too.  I did not.  otherwise I would have given it a 5 star
B001GH5PWY|4|Nice big switch,  used it for my fog lights on a motorhome instead of the small switch suplied by Hella. Wanted to be able to hit it without looking around.
B00HVHN8E0|5|Worked great...avoided buying new remote.
B0023VKWUC|5|Perfectly fit my car, and was in first rate condition.
B004J0V6OG|4|Quality looks great.  Only four stars not five because the screws used on this product do not match with the OEM screws that mount the fans.  The OEM used sheet metal screws.  This unit uses metric machine screws.  I can't tell you what size of machine screws you will need because I just happened to have the correct size in my junk box of screws but they were definitely metric.
B00HE9319C|5|Exactly what we needed at a reasonable price....Fast shipping too
B0094ECRAO|4|Well, it's a nut. My only complaint is that it's a smaller size than the stock nut, so you have to have two large sockets that are not commonly used sizes to replace the old nut with this one.
B004RFKBEO|5|We sre using this on our RV. We have put 3 bikes on it with no problems. Easy to put together. Storage might be a problem for the winter, it won't be easy to break down.
B005RNEH5O|5|works great
B005ZWM0R4|5|Excellent product for the price. Easy to implement and use. I was able to be up and running in less than 5 mins. It was interesting to see all the details it actually provides about my car. Clearing codes is also very straightforward.
B00COQD9PG|5|Previously, I can't tell you how many times I've had to straighten out my license plate when it got bent just by backing our trailer into our driveway.  Getting it up nice and high is wonderful.  It looks good on our home built teardrop camper. Also when I wired up the light I'm much more visible at night.  This should be standard equipment for all trailers!
B00TEA5PZC|2|Pros: 1. Frame itself is high quality material and good workmanship. 2. Amazon Prime shipping is fast and easy.  Cons: 1. Screw covers are poor.  Several were difficult to separate out of the package.  Almost all the caps were difficult to install flush without a rubber mallet and some Red Devil grease.  One cap would not install flush at all. 2. If you ever need to remove the covers to replace the license plate, good luck doing so without ripping the screws out of the bumper.  I did exactly that when trying to remove the cap that would not install flush.  So I had to install the front plate frame without the screw covers, which does not look very good. 3. The screws are not universal and do not fit the rear plate for a 2001 BMW 325.  The heads of the screws that fit are too small to mount the frame without the screw covers.  That is more of a BMW problem/eccentricity, but it exacerbates the issues with the screw covers.  So I have the frame mounted on the front without covers and on the back with covers.  Not the look that I was hoping for, unfortunately.   The frame itself is a 5 star product.  The screw covers are a zero.  The overall product rates 2 stars.  I will end up replacing these frames once I find something that works better.  The screw covers should be designed so that the cap screws onto the base.  This would be much easier to install and remove.
B007TD1WIK|4|Especially like the compactness of it with the accompanying plastic pouch.
B001EOYK0W|5|this was great, made the installation very easy
B00UIBUL6Y|5|Works great
B00KCQSOAA|1|They are so easy to damage just got mine and it's already wore some
B003CEN0U8|4|Good gauge for car tires as well as presta gauges on mountain bike tires.
B0049QMFQS|5|so far so good...
B00BF2SXZQ|5|Great Exhaust System. Doesn't make that Noisy Sound that you hear from those folks whom love that kinda stuff.
B005CNNMSC|5|EXCELLENT!  Fit nicely and holds water and salt very well!
B00D6JTTTK|4|Super fast shipping. Great product!
B00CFM9QLA|5|This is the best I have come across that is collapsible/lightweight. I love mine!
B00VSWTJME|5|Excellent product.
B000CQOIV4|4|Good wrench.  Can hurt your hands if you really torque your hitch ball nut.  The metal kind of cuts into the palm of your hand.
B00HNHVURA|5|Exact fit, excellent!!!
B00VQK3ZBE|5|Excellent service and the part works flawlessly.
B005ZOXYHW|5|Led lights OK.
B004JBI93Q|5|Great , fits perfectly at my Acadia , the dealer was asking for 140,00 that's right 140,00, got a great deal at Amazon for 1/3 of that.
B00MWNZ51C|5|great work
B00M9MH85W|5|Completely in love with these grips!<br />If you have any specific questions let me know and I'll be happy to answer..
B009VOQ05U|5|perfect for our kayaks
B00CHDB03Y|5|fit perfect  no problem  install it  match great
B004BCA9B8|5|Made it really easy to quickly diagnose a possible problem in my truck wiring - I'll keep it on hand all the time now.
B00IVP0TWK|5|Great product
B00MQDI650|5|Works
B000C660MY|3|I was pleased with the quality of the shift cable except for one problem, there was not a groove machined in the end that attaches to the shifter. So I could not install the locking clip that connects the cable to the shifter with out modifying the part. Over all I am happy and would have given it more stars if I didn't have to modify it.
B005UGHIP4|5|AAA
B00SNLIHVW|1|BEWARE! iJDMTOY does not stand behind these LED lights after they fail in less than 4 months! They state that the the warranty is only 90 days, so they obviously well know how long these junkers are good for. In this case, the poor performance of the product is perfectly matched by their poor customer service. AVOID THIS LED &#34;UPGRADE&#34; UNLESS YOU ENJOY THROWING AWAY $35.99. 0 STARS!!!
B007I91EJ2|5|Just as described works  perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends
B000VKTUJQ|5|For 6 bucks vs 35 at dealer this filter is great.  Didn't realize how dirty my old cabin filter was until I took it out.  This was an exact fit and the musty smell was gone almost immediately. Will definitely buy this product again.  Super fast shipping as well.
B00XY615LU|5|Good
B00E1SM9TW|5|Great value fits perfectly
B00W9HSLHG|5|Great fit
B001G4AL4E|5|Excellent
B003UFSG9E|2|You don't get what is shown in the picture.  The die that you get will only bend 90 degrees not the 180 degree die shown.
B000B8UPMO|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B00XBEJZA8|5|I'm so excited about this, gifting it to my uncle! It is really nice looking and the quality looks good!
B004GZ7972|5|excellent
B00FJUZY8Y|5|First of all, you do need a rubber hammer to assemble this thing, but once is together, it is very sturdy and tight. I have lifted the cart from its top tray fully loaded and the vertical tubes don't come out. I recommend this product.
B004I17Q86|5|excellent
B00HJDUNWQ|5|Work perfectly.  Have had them for a few months. In my WRX, I needed to put in the load resistors to fool the flash controller into thinking they were filament bulbs.  Once done, all was good.
B00SIPDAWE|1|PUT TTWO IN A SINGLE CAB TRUCK AND DID NOTHING WAS STIL HOT AS EVER COULD BE FAN IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND IF NOT IN DIRECT LIGHT WONT TURN ON
B00UY2COP8|3|We have a 3 car garage with an 11' ceiling.  I can't get the lasers to point far enough apart to hit both cars.  The white LED light is really bright.  That's great for after install, but during installation it was blinding me every time I had to look at the device to try and point the lasers.  I've given up trying to get it to hit both cars.  I'm just going to have to point it at one car and get a different one for the other car.  So lame.  It should be easy enough to make the lasers able to point in any direction.  grrr
B00QQ6V7N6|1|this not cree,fake cree
B000WJA5ZY|5|Solid.  Arms are made of metal so they won't flex like similar ones made from plastic.  No matter what you expect from this, you'll still be surprised at how sturdy it feels and how well it's constructed.
B00A82B8HY|2|was a great battery it was to big I didn't measure it right when I ordered it
B00B30QOWY|5|We bought this for our 15 passenger van that our children have named the Stormtrooper! This was perfect and great quality!
B006U42QUC|5|Fits perfectly.  Work good!
B000OF7MMA|1|Junk. Didn't fit when it said it would. One size fits none.
B00COYP3H0|5|These levelers are the best of the best when it comes to needing help with camper stabilization.  We got a crappy orange set from the dealer when we bought our camper and they did not hold up to a fraction of what the Lock Blocks could.  Of course, common sense needs to be used in the fact that these will not hold up on sand without a piece of wood under them.<br /><br />We did have the opportunity to use these one a very jagged rocky surface with our 19,000 pound GVW camper.  I was terrified that they were going to break under the weight of the camper and rough terrain, but they held up very well.  A few of the bottom levelers were a little bent, but after a few hours they straightened out like new.<br /><br />We have 2 sets of the red ones and 1 set of the yellow color.  it has been 9 months that we have been fulltiming with these and so far, a few of the red ones have began to fade from the sun exposure. The yellow set have had no issues at all.<br /><br />These are a great investment and come in very handy for whatever Mother Nature and &#34;roughing it&#34; will throw at you!
B002NV8EHK|5|Works perfectly on my 2000 Subaru Outback Wagon. Slim profile. Sturdy design. Just got back from 2000 mile roadtrip with trailer. No problems.
B00EHIPUHE|5|Good
B004JHBKLS|5|perfectly fit my CT200h and the price is cheaper than my walmart
B001UOVYHS|5|These went on with a little bit of work.  They are very solidly attached to the car if the clips are used with the supplied screws.  I don't expect any problems with these as they look and feel sturdy.  They are beefier than the ones for my 2014 Prius.  Well worth the $40 or so dollars.  Took about an hour with removing the rear tires and pacing myself.
B002P8R8R8|5|Easy replacement and it connected and worked once installed.
B001U3LZU0|5|What can you say it's Mothers at a great price
B00X123OPC|2|Sheds.  I spent more time cleaning up after the brush than cleaning the leather.
B00CUKXZD2|5|Direct fit, easy to apply, and no leaks. Buy Hondabound high-temp silicone gasket with this to place in the corners of the U shaped parts of the gasket and cover, to prevent leaks.Getting the old washers off the cover bolts takes some doing. I used a pair of channel lock pliers on mine and it worked fairly easily.  Be careful to apply the spark plug cylinder gaskets inthe right direction. the flat part goes against the cover.
B00A9T28S4|4|This will not do nearly as good of a job as a mechanical system.  That being said it worked well for what it is.
B00NNXRT3W|5|It was great and arrived on time and look great...!
B013RGT072|5|Love love love and I keep the top wash so I have a very neat ashtray for a very nasty habit!
B00GRSOJSS|5|as advertised
B00VMUA82W|4|Worked ok. But wasnt quite long enough to get to my battery. Have a 19 foot boat and batteries are located about 17 feet back. So where you hooked battery up to was to short
B00MQI01D0|5|I just got this in the mail. They let me customize it just how I wanted! They had good communication and respond quickly. The kit itself I am very happy with the paint is really good for the price! I'm not sure on the fitment yet I have not installed.
B001RBCU90|5|Okay I was hoping for black to be there but there is all white ): I got it the same day as said yay (: It looks exactly like the picture, it's definitely a 5 star.
B00KTIQQK6|5|Worked great! Had to find specialty Philips head eye glass screwdriver to open my old one and close the new shell. And had to find mini key ring to put on the corner bar u cant see from the pic. The bar that holdsthis ring Is what broke on my orioriginal one and had been using a lighter leash to hold it on key ring. Just had to remove small metal piece from old shell put it on new shell and was good I kept the chip in the original rubber jus moved it into the new body didnt use the new rubber the chip didnt want to seperate from the old rubber and wasnt damaged so I jus used it felt great added new energizer battery like new super far reach too!
B00LUPOSD4|5|The fact that they're nylon makes them all the sturdier.  Didn't bend or break when working on my car.  Worth the few extra bucks over the plastic ones.
B000B8JUGQ|4|its ok
B00OJIHIYA|5|No comment.
B004H2PET4|1|I thought the product was black. It came silver. When i spoke to the rep in emails he said &#34;the part is reflective black&#34;. I bought 2 sets. Because my wife and I have one red camaro and one white one. When I took the first set off because it was silver we thought make the second would be correct. No still silver not black. We took pictures and sent in because of the color difference. So we both feelbit was a waste of our money. True enough it wasnt a lot spend but it would have been great to know its not going match before we bought it.
B0013ZGZ9Q|5|Very nice battery.
B00R94YUOM|1|Not what I expected...I was hoping for something that snapped into place. This is just something you stick to your door with an adhesive. Very cheaply constructed also. Looks like a happy meal Toy.
B002692308|4|Product is just like OEM as advertised, installed easily and looks good. To future purchasers: when installing this product, insert the bottom catches first and rotate the bezel in to catch top clips. Not five stars as delivery was a day late.
B005JPJNVI|5|Love it .buffs well
B00JOOKO22|5|Love this product. I had it installed in my 06 Tacoma by Best Buy. They did a great job with the install of the camera and a new stereo with screen. The image is great and the colored distance guides are very accurate. It works at night. I use it when I pull in the garage to make sure I'm in enough. The addition of the lock for my tailgate is another great feature. Not sure how long the mechanism will last, but I don't have to lock it very often. Great product.
B00KRHOBBU|1|Cute but did stick
B00X3YGCMU|5|This pump works very fast compared to my previous fuel pumps .  I suggest that you view the transfer right away.
B007S0LDME|5|TROUBLE FREE
B001FIDNGO|3|breaks easy though
B003N9MQCK|4|They work fine.  I was hoping that they would keep contents cooler for a longer period of time.
B00CJ69F2W|5|This system works well. I have a 2009 Toyota Sienna and I never cleaned it in the 6 years. And the paint started to show it. I have some rough spots with rust because of the lack of care. So I thought I would try this system. Wow! Obviously this is not going to get rid of rust but I hope this will lessen the spread of it. Check the pic for my results.
B00HGIWFRA|3|For the price  they were great deal. bright enough to see in daylight as well
B0006HOT8G|5|Fits my stock 01 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo Wheels just fine.
B00N31SB0Y|5|my old one is still in good condition on the  process of returning it
B000BZIQ4Q|5|Much nicer than the Mopar bearing. Casting is better quality and the bearing face looks better made as well.
B00YXGHR9E|5|Excellent fit, look, and customer service. 10 stars would be closer to my satisfaction level
B0002TDUW4|5|Super fast shipping excellent!!!
B007HSLRJG|5|Looks cool on my rifle case. Sticks well.
B00AJZFI44|5|Much much cheaper OEM replacement parts for Mercedes and Mann filter is the best option for any German cars!
B001KS63NO|4|working so far have not really used the A/C or heater that much, will know when cooler weather sit's in and use it more.
B00CHD6PJ8|5|Fit perfectly. Installed easily.  Great value, cost only 40% of what the body shop's part supplier quoted.
B00EDFM83A|5|bulbs work as I expected
B001O77CMW|3|This box would be OK in a pinch.<br />Worth noting:<br />The only &#34;brake light&#34; portion is the small red rectangle above the handle... NOT the red strip around the case.<br />Don't expect great quality/ attention to detail... plastic seams don't join comply... the box lacks proper fit and finish.<br />The liner is NOT included; you have to pick up one of these separately for $20.<br />The handle system is a bit clunky to me. I just picked up a seahorse case with basic latches instead.
B00OIAB1YC|5|Great price, easy to install and works great!
B000SOFLHK|4|Purchased two of these funnels.  They work as described with some exceptions.  If your fuel tank fill position is not level they may tend to come out when you are pouring in the fuel.  Attempting to use this on a Kubota tractor it is a slow process compared to a normal funnel, but then if you want to eliminate water contamination in a diesel engine...it's a good thing.  For a small tank it's a good thing, but for a larger tank (20 gallon etc)  it is slow.  I use it mainly for diesel fuel when fueling tractors and mowers.  Glad to have them as I feel it is a good preventative measure.
B0050M7V78|4|Simple kit, and very easy to apply the products to my vehicle. packaging feels cheap, but the product provides ample protection to the leather in my vehicle.
B0038BBJ5I|5|I like the clear lense vs the look of the stock lens, which after ~16 years was quite frosted.  Great product and was super easy to install on the truck.
B00KCR7PM2|5|Beautiful, comfortable and easy to install.
B010JRKAIK|3|Doesn't attach well at the very front of the front door pieces since there is only the Window rubber gasket there. My previous one was longer and molded to the mirrors. Also not as deep. Wish I knew were the car's previous ones were from
B00KTHWGQA|5|Had it programmed at the local Chevrolet stealership and it works perfect.
B0002SR4Q8|3|did not fit the filter on my truck, a little bigger would be better.
B000OZS9Y0|5|Worked like a hot dang. .. don't use on 3&#34; tube your going to have bad time. . 2&#34; perfect wrap  around
B001ROTV0I|5|After some shopping, I settled on purchasing this cover. I am glad that I did, this cover is of excellent quality and it looks great. Highly recommend it.
B001AGT7C0|5|I was replacing a complete exhaust system on a Scion XB; from the &#34;Cat&#34; back. I also purchased the matching muffler. The installation was pretty easy. I was lucky enough to have the use of a lift. My resonator pipe was rusted out right before the resonator itself. All that needed to be done was to cut off the pipe just before the resonator and to disconnect the clamp that clamps the resonator output pipe to the muffler. Im MY case the muffler was changed as well. You will need a &#34;doughnut&#34; gasket and clamp to transition from the resonator to the muffler. The clamp, also as walker part, is fairly expensive for an OEM style clamp. I don't recommend a cheaper clamp for the job. The resonator simply slips over the existing pipe coming off the existing catalytic converter. Don't cut it too short. This connection can be clamped with a regular &#34;U&#34; type exhaust clamp. A bit of exhaust putty will ensure that there are no leaks.<br />One area which may seem a bit intimidating is disconnecting the old resonator from the rubber mounts. This is best accomplished by using a bit of oil or grease on the area where the &#34;shaft&#34; and knobed end go through the rubber mount. This will help ease them off. If that fails, hack saw the knobed end off. Dont cut the rubber mount. The new part installs easily.<br />Walker is the only company making these replacement parts. They are a good company with a good reputation for quality products. i don't expect this to last as long as the OEM but its not a new car. The OEM lasted 10 years and 150,000 miles.<br />My only wish is that walker would make separate pipes and resonator and muffler, instead of having them welded together as a unit. The fact is that the PIPES where what was causing the problem. The muffler and resonator were still in great shape.<br />Fortunately the cost for the complete units is not too bad when you buy them here on Amazon. These are the same parts that would be used by a muffler shop, sincewalker is the only replacement. If you can do the work yourself, you will save quite a bit.
B001O0TZ7E|5|Word great and saved us a trip driving around to auto parts store.
B00TO7MXGO|3|I have to return these cover because they would not fit my rims on my Chevy Silverado because those rims do not have have deep lips to allow wheel cover to fit.  These covers look great and I was disappointed that I had to return them because I could not use them.
B0085YIC6W|5|I bought these a gift for my mother. She really liked them and they fit perfect.
B00KWLL600|3|does work
B01092I9LA|5|nice material  easy to put on  stays in place  looks great!!
B00T47K604|5|Great
B004A69HTK|5|my truck needed them and so far they are doing great
B005KDOAP8|1|a waste of money not any brighter or LED looking than any aftermarket bulb.
B000BROIQY|5|Heavy duty and fit nicely
B000C9KTAK|1|Pic shows three, you only get one
B004H78NQ0|2|They look great, but they will get stuck on your air valve.  I had an incredibly difficult time taking them off to fill the tires.  Needed WD-40 and pliers to unscrew all four, which ultimately resulted in damaging the caps.  Just went back to the old ones that never stuck.
B00JID2LLG|5|THAY LOOK GREAT AND EASY TO PUT ON.ALSO REALLY FAST SHIPPING..
B00BJHS6RM|5|Growler laws only require breweries to label the bottles they sell. Bringing in your own growler bottle does not require ANY sort of label to be applied for you to leave the establishment with alcohol.<br />http://www.ttb.gov/beer/beer-faqs.shtml<br /><br />This growler works great. Nice big lid that's easy to grip and it stays cold and sealed for a very long time. Absolutely no issues to speak of.
B00G0P0GHQ|5|fits like original.
B000NOBIFO|1|This is not sheepskin and nowhere in the ad does it say it's not! It's a cheep faux fur and the velcro is only stitched on one side. Very cheaply made product.
B000UK89JE|5|Should be just what I need! Installed in a jiffy.  I had to wet it with air filter oil but no biggie. Had some on hand.
B001IUV1CM|5|Works well, very solid. Been hauling my dirtbike to races for over two years now with this carrier. Def worth the money.
B0030DKDY2|5|Good quality and easy to put on.  I would recommend.
B000C2YWXC|5|My integra idles normally now that the massive vacuum leak caused by a snapped in half pcv valve is fixed. Not leaking oil is also good.
B00ATWLY0E|3|The cover fits on my 2012 Nissan Altima's wheel and attaches with no problem. The problem is that it doesn't stay in place, and tends to shift and I turn my wheel; which makes trying to drive a little dangerous.
B00480J4J6|5|Bought these for our 2006 Toyota Prius, and have put nearly 30,000 miles on our car since installation.  They work great.  The biggest challenge was changing the bulbs.  There are lots of do-it-yourself videos on YouTube, but expect a lot of frustration.  The metal &#34;clips&#34; on the Prius lights were a nightmare.  That has NOTHING to do with this product.  I recommend it, and should our Prius lights go out, we'll get these again.  They seem pricey--until you find out what a dealer charges for the same item.
B00A3V3WY2|5|life saver if you need to avoid a chain breaker.
B000LG8GI6|5|Excellent ! About shipping very fast service, about programming very easy and dindn't take to long, I am very happy is working great.
B00W4IDIGE|4|I love ez-lip products because they add a great look to the car without breaking the bank, however I was a bit disappointed by the new PRO and all it's promises.<br /><br />It is definitely bigger and so it looks good but I don't know about stronger. I grazed a curb once and god cuts and tears across the surface. It's understandable that the lip isn't indestructible but for being so low and supposedly strong, this shouldn't be happening so easily. Maybe after many hits, sure.<br /><br />So if you do any sort of scraping as is, you may as well go with the original to just protect your bumper for a low price.
B0068FVAS2|5|Got it!!!! Thank u
B00DCULNXS|5|Worked exactly as described. LED flashers are working perfectly.  Happy with choice.
B002F9JW26|5|awesome primer
B000BRFQLK|4|I probably should have measured but this makes the door stick our by a large margin.
B004VS0XWC|5|These window rain gaurds really make a difference. These are OEM, which look the best in my opinion. Install is very straight forward and add a good look to your impreza. They also let you put the windows down in the rain. I can confirm that these deflectors fit 2008-2011 Imprezas.
B0024GTYTQ|3|For 21 year old girl it`s better a L size. The design is amazing
B0024E6RZ2|5|good product and fast service.
B000BNKW90|5|Perfect fit for 2005 Ford Explorer Sport Trac.
B00EECL7OS|3|The bulbs are a good fit, just like OEM.  I didnt have any problems installing them.  I wrote Kensun to ask about the color temp being a little lower than i was expecting & Kensun sent me a new pair right away.  Customer service is top notch & I will definitely be coming back to buy from Kensun again in the future.  highly recommended.  Edit 1/2017. After 1.5 years they have both blown out.  not a very long lifespan considering my factory ones lasted about 8 years.
B000C8PAA0|4|works fine
B00RHMPR7A|5|When it comes to having external portable battery power, I’m sort of obsessed. I have a bunch of different size batteries for charging my MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad, but one I have never had was a battery that could charge my iOS devices and jumpstart my car. Well that was until I received the Elivebuy Multi-Functional Car Jump Starter External Battery.<br />As they call it “the Swiss Army Knife of portable power,” it’s an insanely strong battery made to stay charged in standby time for 3-6 Months. With a capacity of 10500 mah and at least 1000+ Charge Cycles. They say you can charge an iPhone 6 almost five times or jump start your vehicle up to 10 times on a single charge. I was able to charge my iPhone 6 Plus five times and it still had a bit of power left.<br /><br />As for as jumping my car, I lucked out while reviewing this battery because my SUV is suffering from a completely dead battery and I’ve been driving my truck. Maybe lack of time has kept me from going to get a new battery, but the situation worked out by giving me a way to try out this battery’s jump start ability. I can happily say it works and works very well. I did not test it ten times in a row because that would be silly, but I can say it allowed me to turn the SUV over without any hesitation.<br /><br />The battery comes with a nice plastic box to carry it around and different charging cables. From the old 30-pin adapter to the new Lightning cables for iOS to the Jumpstart cables for the car – this kit as it all in a nice and compact case.<br />Some of the built-in protection features include:<br />UL Certified High Quality Li-ploymer Battery<br />Protection: The jumper cable has four built-in rectifiers to prevent voltage feedback from coming back into the Jump Starter once a vehicle engine has successfully started. The reason for this design is to prevent the device from catching on fire.<br /><br />This is an awesome product and I’m super happy to have it to add to my collection of portable power.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;ceived at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

B00JN1XGRG|4|I would easily give this 5 stars if it were a perfect fit for my 2005 Mustang.  However, the rubber base just doesn't quite match up with the car's antenna base and upon tightening it all the way down, the rubber base bulges a bit too much and looks cheap.  I fixed this by removing some of the rubber base until I got a more uniform fit.  It's not perfect, but it looks tons better - I get quite a few compliments (when people actually even notice it!)<br /><br />As for performance, there's been no difference!  I still pick up all the channels I did before and just as clearly.  Works very well!
B000EALHHG|5|This works great on a number of things. I've been using it for years. I am so glad that I can purchase it on Amazon.
B0007QRLF4|5|When they say forever black...they mean it....ur shirt, your paint on the car and your hands!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Use super caution when putting it on your vinyl stuff ( JEEP )  works great, brings back the black and will ruin your best shirt too....
B0010GI5SC|5|Perfect replacement
B002PQOC8S|5|Fit great! Very bright! A great deal! I searched through all the cheaper replacement fog lights here on Amazon and decided to go with these after reading the reviews and I am pleased with this decision.
B00P1JFWVM|1|Absolutely Awful!!!I Bought 2 for my DRL CONVERSION ON MY BENZ AND THEY BOTH BURNED OUT AFTER 1 WEEK!!!!!!!
B004C444KC|4|Nice gloves, but definitely for the cooler season. Immediately ordered another pair of Milwaukee Motorcycle Clothing &#34;fingerless&#34; gloves for the rest of the summer and early fall.
B00CJC1UM4|5|Perfect fit! Great quality and sound. Only thing missing is flange bolts and insulator support.
B00HUM55GA|5|I had a hard time find a shade that would fit my Chevy Sonic. I ordered this one & it fit's perfect and makes a world of difference in the temperature in my car here in the South. Can't live without one of these.
B00RULROTM|5|This decal is hilarious, I love it and so does everyone else who sees it.
B000BUQODG|5|Easy to install
B00GSAUHB8|5|If you're in the market for a sun shade you should consider this one. I drive a Volkswsgon Beetle and the front window is the shape of a bubble so sunshades don't fit well. They can be too big or too small. This one fits perfectly in my car as you can see in the pictures. It also keeps the car relatively cool. I live in AZ which is the 2nd hottest place next to the sun so believe me I tell you any thing that can lower the temperature of my car is a winner for me. It's light but durable. They provided a bag to with the shade but I have a hard time getting it back in the pouch. That would be my only complaint. I just hold it up and slide it in next to the console and passenger seat. My purchase came with a sticky mat that will hold your phone in place. I haven't put it in my car because it's summer and I'm afraid of it melting. When the temperatures cool I'll put it to good use. I'm glad I got to try this out as a discounted price.
B009GMFXDC|5|my husband was so surprised & loves it too!!
B001C9G7NC|5|The product arrived on time, cheap of course it's made in china,he!he!he!
B000VU57YS|5|great fit for 2015 Sierra SLT Double CAb
B002HXY7S4|5|Purchased for a 2012 Nissan Xterra. The directions are general for different sizes with different securing mechanisms, but easy to figure out. Followed the advise of another reviewer and just used the 2 center screws for installation. I do not recommend drilling holes into the hood of your car! With just those 2 screws, the shield holds fine, there is no vibration at highway speeds, and looks great.
B01236ZHT2|5|The ink looks almost purple. But it is pretty badass. Fits around my head well, not too tight.
B00HNMLQAG|5|I am ready to dismantle my dash assembly.
B00802GIW4|5|So nice. The hid light so bright cool. 😎👍
B011NSMS3E|5|The mask arrived very quickly, within a few days! I got two of them in case a friend wanted to wear one for Halloween or something and it fits great! The material is light and stretchy, it looks really cool with a hoodie and some sunglasses. Overall I would say it was a good buy.
B00DT5HRBI|3|It came quick! I definitely appreciate that, however, it is thin and feels almost like it's not real leather... I did try it on with both a regular button up short and a medium thick hoodie and had to play with the straps to get them right... it's ok buy I think I am going to sent it back and get just a one piece vest... it's one those things that you just don't know till you know... I like it but prefer a one piece instead...
B0004ELKC4|3|Used on boat upholstery not sure how effect it will be even though being told it's the best product ever
B00GRY31JA|4|Good quality seal and has new clips. It fit well.
B00A1H52FU|4|So so don't like the state name onit
B000CINDQ8|5|Good product, recommend
B004ZT6HIQ|5|good item, good seller
B005CD0T10|5|Excellent product. Easy to set up. Maintains my 4-wheeler battery like a charm. Good purchase!
B004XOR926|5|Interesting construction, it is a two piece unit. The cone and barb are separate from the threaded nut allowing it to be taken apart without disconnecting the hoses. You still need to back up the fitting with a second wrench.
B00G25GOCA|5|It's great for hose repair, worked great for me.
B003IS3HV0|1|Sticky sticky sticky. Like other reviewers said this product leaves a very sticky mess. And it smells just like honey, I swear I just put honey on my expensive leather car seats. Now it sticks to every part of your skin that touches it. Extremely uncomfortable. Huge mistake, very disappointed. I can't believe this product has so many good reviews.
B0010E1M02|5|Very delighted, direct replacement cabin filter,came with proper install instructions.
B00120FTFI|5|I was worried about buying this filter because the product image isn't the right shape for my 2006 Kawasaki Ninja 250.  Since the model number (NU-2366) was the correct one, I decided to buy it and cross my fingers.  Thankfully, it is the perfect shape and size when it arrived!  Filter was easy to oil up and get inserted into my airbox.  The filter comes with no plastic framing on the outside like the product image suggests - just a foam filter like the factory original.  Mine came in a seafoam green color with the 'Uni' logo on the face of it.  It shipped in manufacturer's cellophane packaging, which included instructions and two vinyl stickers.
B000C9TUZ0|5|Perfect fit.
B00NCI1ORK|1|Fell apart in 3 weeks
B000OAG2DK|5|quick delivery and it works great
B0066CP998|1|replace the power cord with 8 gauge wire for best safety and performance works well after modification. before I thoughy about throwing it out the window.

B00EQ2AR56|5|Comfy helmet, great for riding in the heat and in the cooler temperatures. Well balanced, and great looks. No complaints, I own two.
B004E8NL7I|1|USB part works. The outlet part did not work, especially when I needed it.
B00W4GTIFQ|3|This product was small to my car.
B003N9HIXC|5|My son loves it!
B00RFCDN6O|4|These are light weight but certainly adequate for my purpose.  I wanted to get a car that I bought for a friend that was a great deal for my daughter who will be returning home in a year.  So I turned in the plates and took it off the road but wanted to jack the car up to get the tires off the ground.  I bought two pair of these jack stands which worked out just fine.
B007AAUTG8|2|After 1 year use the lens fogged inside and I can't get it clear
B00LNOY5WG|5|Direct replacement
B008YY9I5W|1|Represent your ignorance with this sticker!
B000C841M8|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00WUG1A74|5|Great LED.  Super bright for headlight use on my Subaru outback.  Highly recommend.
B0002SR7TC|5|I bought this to change the oil in my boat and have been happy with its performance. Took ten min to suck out cold 40w
B004Q83TGO|5|Keeps my battery charged and ready to go when I'm on the rig. I hard wired the plug on my battery and just plug up and throw the charger in the back seat of the car. When I come back a month later I unplug and crank my car and leave. Forget the jump boxes the battery dies on those just like in the car.
B008ACHYFE|5|Custom dynamics came through again! Easy install and very bright. The only chance we have on the road is being seen. These lights really fill the bill!
B00756KOTO|3|It says that we can get the whole set and on one of the notes it says it only one headlight fits the left side.<br />So I'm wondering if it's only gonna come with the left headlight?
B001DH8218|5|Great products
B000CQI202|4|Nice quality
B000630DA8|5|Item as described. Fast shipment!
B00DBN5QSY|5|Awesome, these look awesome on my rims.will buy again. Thank you highly recommend these
B00KO6UF1E|5|Works well.
B00VXDYMXY|1|A good stretch would be that the item is water resistant.  This item is no where close to waterproof. Item is of cheap quality but functions as advertised. I would have rated as 3 stars but false advertising puts this item at 1 star.
B000760FWU|5|Works great!
B00T7IAOD4|5|[[ASIN:B00T7IAOD4 Rubicon Express REA1011 Oil Pan Skid Plate]]<br />Everything was straight forward. All bolts came out as explained with no leaking of any kind. Plate went over the stock oil pan with ease. VERY tight tolerances, which is impressive. So glad I didn't have to drain my oil to install this. I can't wait to see what else this company makes.......
B001S30GZW|5|Excellent price on this!
B003IRBTYS|5|heavy duty, perfect
B00IN4MHM4|5|Great kit, included all the right seals and bearings for a complete center rebuild.  It does not inlcude the outer bearings, which is described in the kit.  Worked good 2000 Big Bear 400
B006VFR37G|5|Great quality. Great price!
B00UNTU3VO|5|This duster is wonderful !  Does a wonderful job dusting my Jag !<br />I received it promptly and packaged well.<br />Highly recommend.
B00MNMVOP8|5|These are great TRD frames and fit the license plate appropriately.
B011NSMVZ4|5|this was a gift for my daughter and she loved it.
B00YI3IGA6|4|Fits nice, provides a very dark backseat area.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Great service!<br />The windshield sun protector is a little big for my car, a Toyota Yaris (hence the 4 stars). It would work great on medium or big cars.
B000BYGF18|1|Says it fits my 2008 elantra. No. My car has no distributor. I was just clicking around products and saw this. Had to add another car to the list of wrongly OK'd parts.
B007NVRZ0C|1|Such a sad attempt at a chest protector, expected more from evs.
B00MUF1APW|5|Purchased to replace my back-up lights on my 2004 Toyota 4Runner.  Very easy to install and very bright.  They are a nice true-white color instead of the slight blue tint you see with some LED's.  I have purchased several other JDM ASTAR bulbs and will continue to purchase from them.  Very impressed.
B000CACMMM|1|First zipper broke the first time I used it, and now after 3 trips the second won't zip either
B00II99ORU|5|These are great replacements for the 11w Malibu landscape lights.  They last a year plus and do not pulse.
B00V9DZ58O|2|i don`t usually give a bad review,this product did not work,it was 2 3/4 inches and did not tighten far enough.
B0081ZYPFW|5|Excelllent.
B006J0887M|1|Doesn't fit M4 (and I assume other 4 series) key fobs...its too short.  Very cheaply made, threaded screw constanly comes undone and cover just flops around.
B00Y0MWLZG|5|Wanted these for my car for awhile...excellent fit!
B00XXLZ5T4|5|GREAT PRODUCT, WORK GREAT INSIDE THE CAR
B00J2PL774|5|They were perfect u like them a lot thx
B00UW4DJF2|5|I ordered this product because I have a SUV that requires a jump start about once every couple of months. Package was received promptly and showing a full charge.  The accessories are very well thought out, with the only missing charge adapter being the new Microsoft Surface power adapter. (it has adapters for multiple USB and apple configurations.<br />Less than a week after receiving this, my jeep would not start (again, yes I need a new battery). The scorpion worked as advertised and started the jeep right up, and still showed a nearly full charge.  This is definitely in my top 3 emergency devices for my jeep.
B00RBW43MG|2|white comes out as light blue, bummer!
B00DQ6SIG8|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B000FQ1VGQ|5|months later and they still look great
B00EF3P63O|4|I ordered the 48.5 inch roof basket for a trip from Upstate NY to the Outer Banks with my family.  Three of us drove and two flew down.  I got the roof basket and a Roof Bag to put all the extra baggage in for the trip.  When it arrived some of the powdercoating was chipping off so, because I want this to last I did scrape and sand, prime and paint the entire basket before installing it on my car.  I figure, for the price I wasn't too put out by having to do this.  Besides, I used a matt finish that I like much more than the semigloss.<br />The rack is sturdy and although I can not fully open my moonroof due to a slight amount of noise I can crack the vent with no issues.  And as an added bonus, the roof bag I purchased, the Cross Country 11 sf RoofBag, fits like they were made for each other.  1700 miles and not one complaint about noise.
B001R6CMLG|5|perfecrt
B004C22VOK|5|Yes, it's pricey but worth it!!! I have power gains in all gears especially 5th where I lacked the most.
B000FIY08U|5|works as expected.
B0026THWBS|2|Have yet to find a grip glue that works on these new silicone rubber grips. Gotta safety wire them.
B000YC8MXQ|5|Easy to install..fits exact. .good product!
B0042KJV9U|5|it does what is supposed to do, so far no problems.
B00A14ODXK|2|Hasn't worked well since I bought it, gotta keep clicking it to get it to work
B00BJCN08M|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B000GZBZOE|2|I love window shade vents ! However avs has terrible packaging and quality control. Two of my vents were missing tape in certain places and all four were scratched from rubbing against each other in the manufacturers packaging. The fit was spot on, but for the money I would expect non damaged and complete items.
B001RM4R86|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00CWMRZEI|5|little modification and works great
B009I3CLU2|5|Was a good product and fit perfect. Very good quality out my steering wheel one looks great

B0006Z9SQQ|5|Great product and fast shipping I would recommend purchasing it.
B00PM2UECK|5|Very good prices on great product
B0050ZCRSS|4|It is nice and what I expected just wish I didn't have to remove the factory heavy duty tow hooks in order to install it. It isn't strong enough to pull some one out of needed. But looks nice.
B000NW4NXA|5|The perfect part
B00HFRLPJ6|4|Looks nice. Fits perfectly. Could be sturdier, but it's cool.
B002M57UFY|5|Good replacement.
B001FCB4JS|4|It works okay.
B0081H7E58|5|Firm and  immediate shift, takes care of the factory servo sloppy shifting.
B000GTVEBE|5|Fit my bike well, and stayed in place. Even when I rode through three hours of rain in Atlanta Ga. trying to get home to VA.  My bottle worked better than one that came with it. Holder held the weight without any problem.
B001FLC69Q|5|Excellent
B007SKAKPU|1|Will not read codes on my 2007 Honda (Linking Error).
B007C7GBB6|5|Positively secures your ball, receiver and load!<br />I highly recommend!<br />You may need longer bolts for your receiver and in Stainless Steele has this device arrives with zinc bolts.<br />The size is 8x1.25x what ever length you need (Metric)
B00W1ZNVBC|5|This is just what I needed work out great
B00C7Y99BI|5|perfect
B006FUT154|5|I bought this after brushing my car against a pole. 90% of the transferred paint came off almost immediately and the rest came out after careful buffing for about a half an hour. I put small dollops of compound on a microfiber cloth and rubbed lightly in small circles. The trick is to make sure you change to a clean part of the cloth every time you put more compound on and to not work in too large of an area at a time so that compound doesn't dry out. I'm very impressed with the results - check out my before and after pictures :)
B00WOT3YM6|1|I used it once and the digital readout 'conked out'!  I set it for 33p.s.i., it ran for less than a minute and shut off!  When I checked with my pressure gauge, the tire only had 28p.s.i!  Tried again but it wouldn't run!  I had to set it to 36p.s.i. to get to 34 and manually back it down to the desired 33p.s.i.  Same problem with my fronts to reach 30p.s.i.  By the time I got to the last tire, the digital readout had stopped working completely and I had to run it like a manual inflator and back the pressure down.  On the bright side, the seller, P.I. Stores, was terrific!  Sent an email explaining the problem and got a full refund within 24 hours!  I give them 5 stars for customer service!
B00WA4AMYS|5|These liners are TERRIFIC! Cheaper than Weather Tech yet the same quality and coverage. No brainer...
B00L2LTQOM|2|The stencil/pattern provided doesn't line up with holes??? Makes me wonder about every thing else with this product....
B00ONHIJSG|5|fits perfectly
B00N4M95XO|5|Really lights up the light gray interior.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Great sticker very easy to apply
B00AC5FE2M|5|The leaks are gone, what else?
B006YU7G8E|5|I bought a used 2005 Acura TSX with 89K miles. The powersteering fluid probably was never changed. I used a Turkey baster to pump out old fluids. The old fluids were SUPER DARK BROWN ! I will buy 3-4 bottles to multiple drain and fill.  I could already feel improvement from the steering wheel. When i take a long sweeping corner, i used to feel steering wheel pushing back and then sloppy again and then some resistance again. It feels like the PS pump is pushing more fluids randomly making the steering feel weird and not consistent. Now after one bottle, i notice the steering is more smooth during cornering!
B004MUG5LC|5|The fosit was exactely what I was looking fore.  Eveything fit perfect it was also tge exact color.
B00DSOUG5E|4|its nice we like how we can talk to eacher
B000C9WJ3A|5|Fit perfectly in my 2014 Acura MDX. It is made in Poland and has a high quality finish
B00M4LNS4S|5|They fit perfectly on my 2004 Infiniti G35X. They sound great and it's a nice HP gain.
B00796UQHA|4|Purchased for my 2012 Nissan Xterra because the original antenna threads were stripped, so I figured I try something a little more streamlined. This is definitely sturdy, and looks great on the car. As for performance, I've tried it at different times of day with different radio stations (RF is affected by that). I definitely noticed some loss of reception with 1 of 6 of my preprogrammed stations in different areas of town. As it's not my favorite station, I'm okay with it! I'm still keeping the original just in case.
B00KLKV1V6|5|Great deal that I got with this carburetor and it's not the original brand but it worked great, but it was a great prices because at the dealer it was way to expensive. Also I had some questions and they answer my emails quick.
B009DKE414|3|The product works fine but the case was broken upon arrival.  Had to put it in immediately or would have returned it.
B000IXRMSM|3|Does the job and hopefully fixes my coolant drop problem in my 2005 Tahoe.  Edit: (1-5-17) After one year the threads started to bugger up. I used it with a new Dorman recovery canister but the cap just popped off. Bought a new ACDelco recovery canister from dealer and found that the same cap was very hard to screw on. So scratching my head I went to the dealer to buy a new cap and noticed that they were both RC98 but the dealer one screwed on very easy and tightened completely. Either the Dorman bottle screwed everything up or the cap I purchased here was a fake.,
B00HJ15AJ4|5|Craftsmanship is good, a nice weight, not flimsy, looks great!. Using it on the front only for now...the top may cover too much of the tags on<br />California plates?
B007GGO4BC|5|Nice
B00HS5W1Z2|4|We had to grind the sides of the pads to make them fit. About the rotors it's to soon  to tell but so far sogood.
B001JT98IQ|2|This ashtray doesn't hold smoke inside properly. Structural failure!! It's twist locking structure makes a gab between the lid and body so I can see smoke comes out of gap clearly.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Nice Quality
B001RVGBLI|3|Kinda small
B00D8YKIXY|5|Exact fit works great.
B000C59ZUY|5|A huge improvement over the OEM design. The extra bolt makes it much easier to take on and off and the ability to add grease should prolong its life.
B000COCRJ6|5|Working great for a few months now and were easy to install. Appear to be good quality.
B00J59SMBG|5|Good for the price!
B0052FRP06|5|very fast and good quality
B006EH9WUC|5|Works great
B000GD5FMY|5|They don't keep 100% of the wind in...but they do one hell of a job for their price.
B000CD5Q6S|5|Worked perfectly. Exact part I needed.
B005R3SRX2|5|Very good socket holder... However order directly from them at nearly half the price. I would never by from these guys... Trays coat $25 a piece directly from Mechanicstimesavers.com
B00D2LOJZ6|5|fit perfect, easy install,
B00RJKB2FQ|5|Installation was easy and the quality was great for the price.
B0050V15AS|4|gives a sufficient amount of  lumen's
B009DJYMU8|5|Arrived quickly. Fit perfectly. Looks great. It's a 20 year old truck and I didn't expect it would be so easy to find this part. Yay!
B01171RQV6|5|Such a handy product!  It fits perfectly, no need to glue anything, the pre-applied tape is incredibly strong, so I am confident that it will stay for a long time!
B00PYCXMYA|5|Buy it .it works great
B00A5UEOLG|5|Makes much better use of the space in my 2013 Tacoma.  It was installed in minutes and I now have spots for all of the crap that used to all sit in a jumbled mess in the middle console.
B0054RG2H4|5|good
B000BNS7Y2|5|accurate
B004VG0N38|5|Recommend
B00AQZB0V2|5|fit like a glove and is working good. I got it fast.
B000IE0F12|5|Thanks still retain sharpness
B000COD2AY|4|It's a solid hunk of steel and will replace the rear bracket on your existing A/C to make the installation of headers easier. It doesn't include instructions or additional bolts, but it does what it needs to do. In my application, '78 K5 Blazer, 400 Sm Block, 4WD, driver side, the Power Steering pump is under the A/C compressor. You'll need to run down to Lowe's, or other hardware store, for a 3/8&#34; x 1/2&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; Steel Spacer (Hillman No. 137133, $1.42) and re-use the #1 bolt with that spacer. Works perfectly - Hedman, you should include it... (Photo: Spacer on the Left, This Bracket on the Right.)
B002MEZQQ0|3|-Sounds like a disgruntled bear who woke up from hibernation.  Low grumble not load.<br />-I installed most of the system myself.  However, had to go to the garage to put the rest together.  Extension from cat to muffler didn't fit right. Had to cut a straight piece and put it together.  Thus the three stars.  Product description says exact fit.<br />-Everything else is good.
B00480J4KA|5|This bulb is a VERY close match to the color and brightness of the other headlight bulb in my 2001 Acura RL (which was replaced by the dealer years ago--also a Philips bulb).
B00OLVGGZM|5|Fit great does what I want
B008427D88|3|They're OK.
B001P1Z5LW|5|1
B000IEF61G|1|DOES NOT COME AS A SET. When they say order the bundle you would think they would include the set for the back. Why would anyone need only one mat for the back. They call it a utility mat but they push the set for the purpose of using it in the car. Nice sturdy mats but not happy I have to spend another 10 bucks. I give this one star because of the deception and not a bargain.
B000TV59EC|5|Pretty good TP for the RV.  Doesn't seem to be bothering the sensors on the tank either.
B000B8N3GE|5|Just as you would hope for. Good solid fit, easy on, easy off.
B000GZQOAE|5|Arrived several days before expected, cool !
B00873J0YY|5|perfect for our kayaks!
B000637TNM|5|Great stuff. Highly recommended if you love your car.
B007WIB5E8|5|Fits perfect.
B00P6WZ87C|5|fast shipping and perfect fit
B0006MTROC|5|worked as expected
B00029WZV6|2|Starve my turbo for air and melted.
B00I0L7ZZ4|5|Great product great price
B0088BX0IM|3|Surprised to find out a lot of it is made of plastic with a &#34;chrome&#34; finish.  It works okay and does the job.  Can't get the handle bars tight enough without fear of cracking it.
B008GW27S2|4|First of all, I purchased these headlights on a Sunday from an online auto parts retailer for just over $300 and I had to call them on Wednesday to find out they were never in stock to begin with and that it would be 2-4 weeks to ship!  So I asked them to cancel and refund my money (which I am still waiting for 3 days later) and ordered these on Amazon on Wednesday @ 3PM using Prime Shipping and they showed up the very next day at no charge!  Exactly why I use Amazon even though they were $356.<br /><br />My car is a 2005 Mazda 6 S 3.0 V6 which I have had since it was brand new.  My stock headlights had become so UV damaged that I couldn't even tell they were on at night.  Not to mention my car has always had a problem blowing the low-beam H1 55W bulbs on both driver's and passenger's sides.  I had probably gone through 12-14 bulbs in ten years.  The dealership told me they couldn't find any reason for the issue.....yeah right.<br /><br />So, I saw these and decided to give them a try.<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />____________<br /><br />Remove battery terminals, negative first, then positive.<br /><br />Remove front bumper including wheel well clips, bolts and the screws that hide in the wheel well close to the side marker lights.<br /><br />Unhook the side marker harnesses as the bumper starts to slide off.<br /><br />Remove the bolts holding the headlight in (two top, two bottom, one through the white plastic bracket on the side, and one plastic clip on top).<br /><br />Unhook the factory wiring harness by pressing down on the tap and carefully pulling the plug out.  Be careful as some cars with age will have brittle wires!<br /><br />Remove the black plastic frame on the bottom to re-use on the new headlight.<br /><br />Plug the new harness into the factory female end.<br /><br />There are two red and two black loose wires (that power the Halos) that you need to tap into your parking lights to operate.  I couldn't find which wires were the parking lights so I just tapped into the side marker harnesses since they are just hanging right there.  I put the reds from the halos to the green/black wire and the halo black wires to the black/red wire.<br /><br />Reinstall the headlight clips and bolts and the bumper but test the lights before by hooking the battery terminals back on and turning on the lights.<br /><br />Troubleshooting<br />_______________<br /><br />Now when I plugged in the new harnesses, I ran into some issues.  The turn signal wasn't lighting up and inside the cab, the turn signal was blinking and clicking fast pointing towards a bad bulb.  That wasn't the case.  The headlight plug-n-play harness was not connected all the way.  I honestly had to take channel locks and squeeze them together and then I heard the last pins click together.<br /><br />After a test drive, the LED strip on the other headlight went out.  Same thing, the plug-n-play harness was loose so if I push them harder together, it lights up.  I think I will have to zip-tie the male and female harnesses to keep them firmly together.<br /><br />Will post pictures up soon<br /><br />UPDATE 9/25/15<br /><br />These headlights are doing great.  I did have to take them out one more time right after initial installation and take the harnesses apart.  I had to bend one of the pins slightly to make better connection on the car's end of the harness.  I also sprayed a little contact cleaner in there and haven't seen any problems yet.  I have gotten several compliments on them so far.
B001OCVGXS|5|Product arrived the NEXT DAY! It had a couple of small dings, as others have reported, but not a deal breaker. Also came with 4 keys, which is great if you're a contractor with multiple people using the vehicle (I'm not but it's still cool). I have a 2014 Ford F150.
B00GEIX2H0|5|AAA
B00QI6S68S|3|JUST OK
B00I5ABEB6|4|Very good product have had them for a year now. Also one just got a small leak other than that works great for the price cant beat!
B00KG14LBM|3|Good quality and heavy way better then the cheap ones I was buying I want another but there out of stock. It's a bunch of crap waiting for it to come back in stock and then jacks the price up 20.00 downgrading on that.
B0023080E8|5|Good levers do the job
B001F2I7SE|5|I installed 2 of these directly over the Maxxair 12V Roof Top Fan?Vents.  They were easy to install and will make cleaning the tops of the Fan/Vent tops much easier to clean..
B006B28RX8|5|easy install and the pads are better than OEM. I used them on a 09 road king
B0048LIKUY|5|works great
B0002SR4Q8|5|This is a well-made item. If you have a truck like a RAM 1500, like I do this won't fit. If you have a bigger vehicle, try the Lisle 63250 Wide Range Filter Wrench. GREAT filter wrench.
B00062Z92G|5|Great plugs, corrected high end misfiring issue in Supercharged 1994 Mazda Miata and on a 2008 VW Jetta 2.0 T FSI Bothe the Miata and the VW Jetta take the same size plugs as per my contact with Zex directly. Highly recommend!!
B000E28C7M|5|Only filter for a Harley
B00OZD5NP0|5|they are dual beam
B01078GH6A|5|The bag works well with my wife's car.  It fits between the rear seats so the kids don't throw trash on the floor anymore.  When the product arrived, the disposable bags were missing and I wrote to the seller.  I have to tell you, Richard from Drive Auto Products was awesome.  Not only did he send me bags, he insisted on refunding our purchase.  I thought that was way above and beyond for customer service.  We didn't go looking for a refund, just the bags. We are more than satisfied with the product and the thoughtfulness of Drive Auto Products, especially Richard.
B006QH6XQG|5|Works great
B000WEKPG8|1|So disappointed with this product and service. The driver's side did not fit properly and seemed to be formed differently from the passenger side, which fits fine. It bound so tightly on the window that it screwed up the window regulator which I had to have fixed. My mechanic tried to heat and reform the shield so it would fit better, and broke it in the process. He called WeatherTech, which basically said tough luck, and wouldn't even sell him a single replacement piece - he had to buy both sides. The replacement piece has the same fitment problem/defect as the first one, and it binds every time the window travels. WeatherTech - vaunted as this high-value / high-quality company, sucked on product and service on this one. Thanks to Amazon's return policy, when I received an order of WeatherTech floor trays that was misshapen, I was able to return it. Should have learned from that experience, I guess....I won't buy another one of their products or ever recommend them.
B00064331I|1|Bad product - hard bristles, and they come off very easily
B00MGSC2IW|5|Cheapest place I've found for these Mopar filters.  Oreilly's was wanting 170 bucks for some other brand filter, sure glad I found these.  Will be purchasing these from now on.
B00LMTNCQC|5|Love the look of the lights, they are a pain to replace but they are awesome. Just ordered 12 more.
B004I12T42|5|Fit my Tacoma perfectly and looks like the original on the other side. Much cheaper than the dealer. Couldn't even get a used one at the junk yard this cheap. I'd buy it again if I need another in the future...but I hope I don't back into anything else.
B00YDDPH26|5|You need its
B00ANO7JSE|3|Wound up not needing this part and waited too long to return it.  Our fault but this makes us question whether it is worth it to purchase car parts online.
B000HDIP9I|5|Works away better then the stock one on my taotao scooter
B00AVNC2HA|5|Perfect match and plenty of product!
B003TTL0TE|5|Great product and fast shipping I would recommend purchasing it.
B013LTJJZS|3|To bad they didn't design these right for a 2015 RAV 4, they could have been a great buy. There is a step in the door sill frame that doesn't match this scuff plate that you can see in their picture. This causes it to sit uneven to the frame, along with the rubber edging being as thick as the 2 sided mounting tape, I had to remove their mounting tape and apply some thicker tape to make them stick<br /> Also the stamped lettering is not as defined as it looks in the pic, nor is there a shiny surface to the tops of lettering as it appears to have, it is all the same brushed look. Overall the quality is not bad for the price and I decided to keep them. Just wish they had formed them for the vehicle they are intended for.
B008G21WWO|5|Easy to replace and bulbs already installed.  Best  deal for an oem style look. Comes in boxes with lots of foam protection wraped nicely.
B0042B4B3U|4|except that it comes with a cancer warning. Wear gloves when you use this!!
B004XG3TBE|5|Al I have done is replace the cable on my winch with this synthetic one. it was a simple change over and I love the weight reduction. Installed this on my Smittybuilt X20 1200 lb. winch without any problems.
B00EZ4PSBS|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B007GR8NIQ|3|I really like these jugs, unfortunately they leak worst than a two year old in a saggy Diaper, couldn't understand why, my two older jugs I own work wonderfully, ended up calling Tuff Jug, talked to a Wonderful woman there, after explaining my problem and a little show and tell about the Cap She said the jugs I purchased were missing a rubber seal on the Jug Cap asked for my name and number and said she would send out a replacement. BE Warned, She said I wasn't the first to purchase these jugs thru Amazon and them missing the rubber seal.  these Jugs are worthy of 5 stars my first two were, only gave them 3 three stars because I had to contact the manufacturer to get a Rubber seal that should have been with the product I just purchased.
B00HDMEUCW|5|Love this product.  Machine-washable and it stays in place.  Know what I'm getting my friends for Christmas!
B003VAWMFC|5|Easy to install!!
B00KTEMGL8|4|This is a great little charger, with compressor and USB port to charge devices.  It is light weight and holds a pretty good charge, depending on how often you use it.  It has saved my bacon on several occasions,when I have left the car headlights on and it is easy to use.
B00PD5MA14|5|Easy to install and comes with plenty of tape to go around tail lights more then once if you wanted to.<br /><br />Once these are on seems like they ain't coming off lol.<br /><br />Very happy with these!!<br /><br />Shipping was about 2 weeks, came from China so don't expect to be able to track it with the # they provide. Earlier then stated though by 2 weeks!
B00LY6FX1A|5|The product looks exactly like shown here. Fits 20X20 pillow vety well. Haven't washed it yet.
B003E2WQE4|5|Works great I haul my 04 yz450f no problem with minimal rocking.
B001GH5ORK|5|I purchased these for my 2010 JKU Rubicon.  I have felt with hood bounce for over a year now, I was always working the hood was going to fly up and off. I installed these and the hood does not bounce or hop at all. A great after market upgrade.
B006VB8JTQ|5|Works pretty great. Set aside a couple of hours. Do each step right. And when you think you're done on each step, sand for a few minutes more. What's nice is you can't sand too much--the more you sand, the easier the next step is. There was more than enough material here to do two cars in my case, so I'll also do my mom's car since her headlights are trashed. I'll have to do a clear coat so I'm not doing this again in a few months, but it looks great and really does work. No gimmicks, just good old elbow grease.<br /><br />Be patient, respect the process, and you will see results.
B00CSCWOA2|4|ok
B0062O53S2|2|These ride harsh and jarring in my 1995 XJ6.  When I'm able to drop $250 for a pair of Bilstein, these will meet the dumpster.
B001F0M7L4|2|Did all the work of installing and it didn't work the gage hoes up and down but does not work In middle.
B008D5D3YY|5|Love it!
B00I5F9ZZS|5|Excellent
B00KTHZJ1O|4|Ordered two 'cause I thought my one stock remote/key was toast.Took my stock one to a Radio Shack...yes Radio Shack,they soldered the battery &#34;clip&#34; back down stuck a battery in there and Voila!!Fixed for $10 bucks!!But I might still get these cut/programmed.
B003IS3HV0|1|This product did not make a bit of difference on our leather seats. It looks great when first applied, little shine, but once it dries, there is no difference. The seats looked even drier than before, I tried on a pair of leather Shoes again same results. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this product.

B004M7VF2O|5|Good product, recommend
B000F5DQWY|5|I hope the next idiot that pull out in front of me on my bike has had his heart checked out, because this baby is gonna make him wish he hadn't.
B007ROUW2I|5|Received in a timely manner and it works perfectly.
B00A15F71Q|5|Took some time for shipping from overseas but worth the wait. Was hard to find this item locally. Quality product at a low price. Would buy again.
B0085XV9JA|2|Cord too short, came with no installation instructions.
B000CMHVJO|1|Not easy to install.
B001C6Q8CK|5|perfecto
B001FS4TWQ|5|Great Product.  This hose has an adapter that fits perfect on the original hose of my Ridgid vacuum. The various hose attachments allow for vacuuming all part of my cars and performs as I hoped it would. This was a great investment.
B00069D55M|5|Worked great.shipped on time
B0009IQZPW|5|Worked well for applying wax
B00CFBT8GO|5|Fits first gen 2.7 Tacoma engine. Mine is a 98. Amazons part finder does not list it. The gates site does however. Trust gates and buy it if you need one for this application.
B010H0QV00|4|If you need a tire gauge, this tire gauge will serve you much better as a multi-tool Swiss knife of sort car gadget.  I have a tire gauge before but this meant to be store where you can easily reach it - maybe in the center console.  In case of an emergency, glove compartmentmay be not the easiest place to reach and who knows if you can even open the glove compartment door.  With a fl;ick of aswitch, it will reveal a winshield hammer.  Tempered car windows are much tougher to brake than you can imagine. It needs a tool similar to this hammer.<br /><br />It also has 2 kinds of LED lights. White LEDs for flashlight and red for reading maps or just plain reading in the dark.  The multi tool also has a safety belt saw if you ever get trapped in your car.  The other tools are screw drivers (small), scissors and pliers.  I wish there is a small knife but no.<br /><br />This gauge runs on 5 AG13 batteries (included).  Quality and packaging is OK.<br /><br />Sample item was provided to me for review and evaluation.
B0006JLU1I|5|We ordered these new Camcos, after finding that our original camper covers were broken from a few small branches hitting the top of the camper.  We have had them installed for a few years and just a few weeks ago our Camper was in 100mph (Glen Arbor, MI) winds and hail.  I was away from my camper at the time on Mackinaw Island, MI.  When I returned thinking the worst, I got on top of my 36' RV and many of the plastic cover on the sewer were broken, however the Camcos were un-harmed (I have two openings with these on top).  I then noticed holes in my awning and a pile of ice pellets next to the camper.  So, these are very durable and am very happy with these and we still get great sunlight in.  Thanks Camco!
B00TLQP2DE|3|Do you have gun metal color for that decals?
B00BMDYWTY|5|Great product and a way to learn up the engine bay
B00INL0YHM|3|BE ADVISED THE LAST TWO SETS I RECEIVED WERE WIRED BACKWARDS - meaning the BLACK is positive, red is negative. Only by accidentally wiring them backwards did I find this out and that was after I sent the first ones back. (unlike a conventional bulb LED's do not work without the proper lead going to the positive) These are the RED ones, the white ones I ordered were wired correctly. This wasted a lot of my time waiting on a project I wanted to have completed by now...<br /><br />Otherwise they seem OK
B000BUTD9I|5|We love this for camping and we use it for picnics too!
B001A6H4H0|5|Fit perfect
B001DKR3C4|3|Chrome is not chrome
B00E1SQIT4|5|good deal
B0067UEA30|5|Looks good and works like it should, installed without trouble.
B001TXUBH4|1|Didn't fit Durango tank
B00BNVJYMU|5|great product for your Mazda Car, get the best not the rest
B009C9BOUA|5|THESE ARE GREAT AND PRICED RIGHT. ONLY ONES I COULD FIND WITH THE 2 INCH HOLE IN THE END.
B007GRW1OI|5|Great your decals are
B00GBRG4TC|5|Just as good as an OEM.
B0026CC75Q|1|Don't know how I missed it but these thing are mounted with adhesive to the paint on the car.  Yes, I said they stick to the paint.  I am sure it will look wonderful when they come off and I have to start scraping the paint to get the adhesive off.  I have Weathertech on my other car which mount inside the window channel.  I tried to save a few bucks with these but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  Now I have to go buy the Weathertech and am out $54 that I paid for these.<br /><br />Do not buy these if you are concerned about gluing stuff to you car's paint.
B00MB0EXGE|5|So cuite!😊
B004QK809S|5|Fits perfectly.  I wear a 7 5/8&#34; hat size.
B00XYHA21S|1|Does NOT come with Harley adapters!!  Have a Harley?  Don't buy this!!  Low quality mirror, hazy and unclear. Vibrates like crazy. And way too small. Not a quality product. Looks ok. Got skulls? Not an exact Willie G match. Not recommended
B00J5SP6NE|5|These were delivered quickly, the instructions were very clear, the installation process was easy, they work great, and the price was reasonable.
B000UOWVNK|5|Pleased. Seems exactly like the OEM. Fixed a loose pulley after 150,000 miles on a 2005 Chevy Tahoe. A relatively easy install. Just remove big accessory serpentine belt and then remove small AC belt. There are then 2 bolts. Just takes about 20 minutes start to finish if you have the right tool and 3/8 socket extensions,
B002HSQKA2|5|High quality for the price. Light and extreamly comfortable. Sits very low on the head.
B00VX2NOK2|3|programming was a pain but once that was complete it worked well.
B000UPNYUI|3|Do not buy these for your headlights. I was stopped twice by police in Mi and they stipulate that it's against the law to use the color yellow for the headlights. Removed them and put in a different style that is really great and much much brighter.
B00BTLEJXI|1|Was supposed to come with 5 headrest covers and only received 2. One of the two has a big tear in it. What a junk birthday gift!
B009AQS4IU|5|Love it! Very nice on the car
B00BYH6C1E|5|Wow wow wow<br />That should explain it all<br />This product is a must .....
B00GAPJQAE|1|Dose not fit 1990s f150s
B00DZHXTKI|1|I've used Mother's clay bars exclusively in the past. I thought I give these a try. They are horrible!!! They take nothing or at least very, very little of the impurities off the paint. These are not worth any amount of money. I would also like to mention I used the same lubricant with these as I did with Mothers.
B004VQMT6W|5|Set up easily. Mounted nice and sturdy. Felt like it was made specifically for my Journey.
B0010E00T6|5|Perfect fit. Buy this together with the engine filter and it's a 5 minute job, 0 tools required. Save yourself the hundreds of dollars the dealership or auto repair store will charge you.
B00JLN5WTQ|4|These struts seem to be durable. We'll see what the warranty means. I'm told by the mechanic who installed it that there is missing attachment plate which causes a rattle, but otherwise, he was pleased with the part.
B00PDRX6FQ|5|Beautiful case but it covered up my tag on the front plate so I had to put it on my back plate. Love it!
B005G8D8CS|5|Great product! Seller is awesome!
B000VKRQ60|5|Excellent
B00NT5VDZ4|4|I liked the look, but wish it had padding.
B000GT3TKS|5|worked perfect.
B00CFQSFQ8|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00HZ873UA|5|I am very happy with this product it made a big difference in power for my 2013 RAM with the 5.7 hemi. Initially it failed because they did not have the program available for my truck but they had it available in 2 working days it downloaded and worked flawlessly. Be patient they will take care of you.
B001DU73PQ|5|Perfect! Great price!
B00IMK5XVQ|5|very heavy duty. It works well.
B00N1E6QK0|5|Very nice looks & keeps the rain out when having the windows open slightly.
B000HE2VF6|5|Goid pruce and have held up to my weekend shade tree cark work
B009CYGBHG|1|these are the cheapest crappiest things I have ever bought...what a disappointment...I actually threw them in the garbage after seeing the horrible quality. The materials are the cheapest they could find i think.
B012F503FE|4|Nice price
B008I6NXX4|5|Used this to replace the OEM that burned out. This saved me over $100. Used it on a 2013 Town and Country
B004A6K58C|5|Perfect fit in my 2001 dodge neon
B0065SZU8I|5|Quick ship good for reconditioning antifreeze
B001V3959W|5|My husband loves these! They are great inexpensive sunglasses.
B000GV1DEA|2|Jury is still out, installed in 71 BMW R60/5, took her for a spin, shut her off and a no start no spark.  Installed original points and condenser and fired right up.  dynatek says it's because I grounded unit to battery post instead of case.  Although that Lil tidbit is not written in their instructions.
B000IG208Q|4|big, clear, no warping. bell usually makes a good mirror.
B00XCCQ2V4|5|Looking good
B00HJBUST6|5|When you install fender flares on a car use a blow dryer to soften the plastic so that it's flush with the fender shape.. They are primarily used on lowered cars to disguise the rolled metal fenders.
B00X7JY8HM|5|I received this for free in exchange of my review and for me This Car Sunshade Grande' Jumbo III by X-Shade is Great, perfect this summer, perfectly fits to my car. Well I was wrong about this SUNSHADE ( looks really can be deceiving ). So when I received this it was in a small pouch and I thought im gonna be disappointed but I was wrong, The size is perfect to my car, and this is easy to assemble because its foldable and pop-up style and with a pouch that will keep it organize. And this is really perfect for now a days perfect for summer days ,it helps your car away from the sunlight and maintain your car for being cool, and this is really proven by me. So its not too late yet to grab your Car Sunshade Grande' Jumbo III, its really worth it
B00HEAMAFM|5|Priced right, part was delivered promptly, much sturdier than original part, easy to install. Anyone could install this thing.  I'm EXTREMELY satisfied.
B00C4YPKQ4|3|Does the job but a little 'tippy'.
B000C5SG40|5|Works
B00CFPSEZ6|4|Great product. Fast shipping. Would buy again,thanks.
B00MVMRS6O|5|A cheap insurance policy on a motorcycle. Do not leave home without them. I installed 3 of these with a control flasher. I feel much safer now. Love the price and they work well
B0115Q14Q6|5|This is a very nice license plate frame but pay attention to the version that you order.  I got the one with the secure covers and they mean what they say.  They are extremely secure.  Fortunately I realized that after I installed the first one and didn't install the other three.  I did manage to remove the cover without destroying it but scratched the frame in the process.
B0049JVD7W|5|hi this was just what I needed !!!!!!
B00CLRRI6E|5|Used the door latch on sliding glass wardrobe in bedroom of motor home. So far works fine but we will see when we go south for the winter when it is in frequent use.  Hint: make sure that your doors are lined up before applying.
B00Q1NQ6Q2|5|great horn
B0006IX7W4|5|These work great.  Can't roll them up in the awning, but they are much easier to install than the fabric ones.  This makes it OK to remove them each time and then put them back on again.
B008G3K76K|5|Perfect fit.
B00NXL4F4A|5|awesome light
B00F1FKSD8|4|Works, it filters air. Have not noticed a change in MPG or engine response, which I didn't expect. It is not a full cold air intake, just a better air filter. I think anything else would be placebo effect. However, it is still a much better air filter than the factor one, and I always put them in my vehicle.
B003LI2W90|5|Easy to put on and perfect for Auburn fans like my husband
B00EVQHGOC|5|Product as usual from Hot Leathers. Great product and delivered timely as always.
B000C7XOOU|5|Works well.
B00WAORHEG|5|Great  love them fit perfectly highly recommend for my jeep friends
B001U61DOK|3|Bought this in 2012 I think and one of the zippers on the back seat cover broke off when putting the cover on. Other than that it has lasted some time and it's just this year that it started cracking up.
B00C5IBUI6|5|Personally installed two struts and am very pleased with the results and products.
B00SH1SN6C|3|I found out after I had received this that this is a Lithium Polymer or LiPo battery.  While this battery can deliver the 300-400 amps it is very dangerous to store in your car unless you have a metal box to store this device inside.  There are plenty of videos on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3hCqjk4yc  The device will actually start a car without needing the car's 12V battery and it still had 4 bars on the battery status.  BUT LIPO CHEMISTRY IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DURING CHARGING.  Even when not charging and just sitting around in a trunk, they will sometime go into what is called &#34;thermal runaway&#34;.    Look at the photos to see how I'm storing this in the car.  The device is wrapped inside a welding blanket (I had one laying around) rated to 2000 deg. F and then placed inside a steel metal box (with small vent holes) with a latch.  IMPORTANT: ALWAYS CHARGE OUTDOOR AWAY FROM ANYTHING FLAMMABLE.  This way if the LiPo spontaneously combust, it won't burn the whole car down.
B00CELZABW|5|shipped quick and it is the exact color
B00BMRRZ94|1|Will not work on my new Atwood Model GE 16 EXT wrench has incorrect angle Socket works best!
B000BO6MBG|1|I will write a review for the unfortunate product.<br />This space was wider use of the product.<br /><br />I used it for only one week.<br />The [Roof Top Cargo Carrier] raveled at the material.<br />So, The sleeping bag was wet on the inside.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Loved it.<br />Finally own one.
B001A6JH02|4|Great bag. It has lots of room. The only issue is, it seems, the straps is coated with some kind of sticky material and doesn't feel comfortable for touching it.
B0068ERR5I|5|work good
B00IPJ1HG4|5|Works great. Sealed bearings and wheel seals.
B001DCN1S2|5|Worked well, easy to install
B00AZMBE7Q|5|My wife buick rides like new. Plus I did not have to use my old springs and strut bussing and bearings. I set the camber with a camber tool. Car setting on sliding pallets. .2deg +/+-.5deg. Used 2 lazer on at rear wheels to get the frount wheels = . Only had to adjust the left tie rod end. Car does not pull , and steering wheel  was perfict. Used a toe tool to get it 1/16 in&#34;in. I'm going to by some alignment tools from amazon  later on. Maybe a 4 whel set up.
B000F167YW|5|FITS NICE AND PROTECTS THE DASH. SHIPPING WAS PRETTY SLOW BUT WORTH THE WAIT AT THIS PRICE
B00098PO3G|4|I used this to change my MX6's 23 year old stained carpet from tan to black.  I removed the carpet from the car, Purple-Powered the whole thing then scrubbed it down with a brush.  I then let it air dry.  2 light coats then 1 cover coat did the job.  I used a stiff bristle brush in between coats to lift the carpet fibers and get better coverage.  It turned out great!  Took 3 cans plus a little out of a 4th.  I give it 4 out of 5 since it did leave the carpet a little rough feeling.  Time will tell how it holds up.
B00LO0M918|5|Not one bad one in the bunch.  They have a + and a - side so, as others have said, if it doesn't work, reverse it.  I bought 20 for my camper and even with all the lights on the fan on the converter never goes on.  Makes dry camping less stressful.  No dead battery worries.
B001KS86YI|5|No complaints here.  The price was right, it fit just fine, and with a little effort on my part (and Gorilla Glue) the mirror seems just as good as the original, at a fraction of what it would cost to purchase the whole window assembly -- never mind paying to have it installed!  I don't understand the complaints from folks who thought the adhesive strips were lacking.  Well, of course they are -- it should have been obvious at first glance.  So why wouldn't you just take the extra step of applying some glue to increase the bond?  Here's what I did:  Cut up the adhesive strip into 4 small, equal size pieces (Use the areas on the plastic base as a guide on how large to make them).  After removing any old glass pieces  and adhesive, use a good glue like Gorilla Glue and apply the four adhesive strips to the plastic base (Be sure to follow the instructions for the glue.  Gorilla glue uses water as a binding agent, so dabbing the surface with a moist cloth before applying the glue does the trick). Put another thin layer of glue on each strip, then place the mirror on top of the strips. Use a clamp to lightly hold the mirror in place. I actually used a snack chip bag clamp - worked like a charm - lol!  Leave it overnight to dry.  The next day, remove the clamp -- the mirror should stay solidly in place.  Hope this helps someone!
B00DFV131G|2|*NOT* one-size fits all, as this is too small to fit the Shoie RF1200 faceshields.
B00NZP2K14|5|Well made and sturdy it will look great on my car.
B000BPTVTK|5|I love this stuff. I live in Tampa, Florida where for 6 months out of the year, it rains almost every day. And not just a little sprinkle, a heavy, torrential downpour. If you have to get out and drive in that, you need to make sure you have a windshield treated with Rain-X, good windshield wipers, and this stuff in your washer fluid. I even buy the Rain-X washer fluid and STILL add this to it. It's awesome, I can drive through a hurricane without my wipers on (not recommended). Seriously, if you have to drive in the rain, get this product. Almost every time I drive I just go ahead and spritz the windshield just to add a little coating to it, and it never lets me down in the rain. Also, you can measure it out if you want, I just dump the whole thing in the washer fluid tank and it's never caused an issue.
B007Y5AHP2|5|great
B001539B7O|5|No fan, so it's totally quiet! Perfect for charging phones or laptops.  Has been working fine for 5 months, buying a 2nd unit for another car!
B007POF6C6|4|Nice
B00IO3KQPO|2|Crazy expensive to return this item.  It was very hot in the car and not worth the money.  I have a 20% restocking charge and shipping both ways, which makes this a very expensive mistake.
B000BN3A4Y|4|Thank you!
B00FW6ZS2M|5|Love it.  Light only lasts for 20 min and only runs in battery power.  Will not work on A/C power
B00XT97SMC|3|Considerd ordering this...but the ONE review REALLY makes me reconsider!!!
B00B9DEDNC|5|It works.  Pulls the dust/dirt off.  Not really enough to do a full job though.
B00NRFYKTC|5|They really mean it when they say pinkish-purple! They look amazing and were a lot of work to put on, BUT I could not be happier with the final result!
B0006SU3QW|5|I love it. But I bought it at Lowes for $5. AND I bought two so make that $10. I haven't used both, though. This is what ONE can, can do. And yes all four tires are straight black, no silver showing. I really recommend. Oh and be sure to use about 2 layers. One thin then one a little bit thicker. That way you can spray on the other tires as well. I still have left over spray in my first can. I won't stop using it till it all runs out on me.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Traveled 2000 miles through some rain and no leaks. Easy to install and load. Probably holds more for its size than a rigid roof top carrier because it is fabric and therefore &#34;flexible&#34;. Expected some wind noise, but not much. Quality seems good. And easy to store...fits into a small 12x12x12 box. I wasn't sure where I could be able to store a rigid container.
B009DA95M2|3|Shoei only warrants their helmets for 5 years from date of sale or 7 years from date of manufacture, whichever comes first. The helmet I got was manufactured in November of 2012, so clearly these are OLD STOCK which isn't indicated anywhere in the item description.  I have a call into them to see if they have one manufactured within the last 60 months, but I doubt it.
B006X0QKD2|5|Exactly what I expected. They fit the public storage locker I have nicely.
B00JW1WM2C|1|Like the previous buyer, this does not fit the 2007 Jeep Compass. The two back outlets do not match up with the hoses in the car.
B00514AS8E|5|Great addition to the bike!! Flashing brake light is a major safety upgrade and with the integrated turn signals I can delete the ugly stock ones.
B00ELHNEQ0|5|Received with no damage.  Was cheaper than local auto parts store.
B007XE8C74|5|Arrived sooner than expected and works just as I had expected. Very pleased with my purchase just wish I had ordered it sooner to use at work.
B00R1V5NLC|5|Look fantastic and easy to install!
B002PUTC0M|4|Would be better if it turned itself on when you went to measure the air pressure
B0002MG2IK|5|ordered noon 8-27 heating unit heating by 4pm 8-28 thanks dinosaur and amazon
B004EI6A8K|5|It paid for itself as I extended the battery by a year (so far).
B0010DY4J4|5|arb makes a great product !  Love this tree saver.
B00AN5T08U|3|Brakes are great so far. 3 stars because the rear pad retainers did not fit well, had to reuse the ones that I had.
B00OP9Y436|1|Bought new cv joints for a grizzly 700. The part came in broken. I didn't know it till after I installed them. The dealer I didn't want to take it to informed me of this. Waste of money and even more since I have to take it the dealer. Thanks
B00VX9VH9U|5|Lots of Storage!  Stayed on the tank during the 8 hour ride with out an issue.
B000C7WWTS|5|Almost impossible to find anymore. Great for anyone trying to replace the factory fog light switch on a 88-94 Silverado since this is the original switch.
B007Y87T1O|5|Great price
B000C9GYTA|5|factory controls. no problems and easy install.  If there is a better option I never found it.
B00TOFAS7M|4|Good over all
B000XRHRZQ|5|They do the job in a very simple but tried and true way.  Just what I wanted plus the price was even better.
B00OKLTCOU|5|Just what we needed. It keeps the sun off of you and works great. Fits perfect.
B0009H52AC|5|Best filter per dollar period. 'Nuff said.
B00JF8YCCK|5|great. fast shipping and easy to install
B00BCRMAAS|1|DONT BUY THESE THEY LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES SHOWN. They are ugly I can't even find words to describe it.
B000PG6OW2|4|nice product.....certain rims may not have a good firm grip using this tool...but all in all, works well
B00JJFSS74|4|Bought as alternative for my original vinyl armrest.<br />Delivered quickly.<br />My upholstery had some problem with, but the fit nicely<br />I like the quality and recommend it
B001AWIIC4|5|Quick shipping looks great good product
B0000AXYA0|5|This is the greatest stuff to prevent corrosion and it works well as a lubricant too! I use it for everything I want to protect from moisture.<br />It leaves a waxy film and lasts. Works good to keep automotive electrical connections from &#34;greening&#34; as well.
B0079GQKDE|5|Fantastic tool! Need it for rare Girling and Dunlop brakes that can not be marred. Best brake spreader around, best price here and one day delivery!
B00ZPIRFF0|5|Great fit, fast shipping,and keeps my winch dry
B00I5WXAS4|5|Good quality
B000CN4XWQ|5|bien
B00KULMDPE|1|IT says it fits 2013 Hyundai Elantra, but it does not fit, and since the return time is out, i can't return, one star !!!
B009FC8C5Y|5|Top fit like a glove! No hassle and looks good! Big difference...Makes jeep look like new again!
B001BK24UM|5|Perfect fit, and clear optics
B00A8MZ7IA|5|awesome
B005U803CM|5|Exact fit as stated.  Fast shipping.  Very satisfied.
B00ARUR0VK|5|Good product.
B004INAQN6|5|Product of very good quality.
B00CJOB752|5|I like it... I really do. It does what is supposed to do and it has the &#34;LOGO&#34;.
B00JX70NOY|3|Quality is OK but the cable is to short. The delivery service offer was 5 to 8 days but, it took nearly a month.
B002XLBMZQ|2|The unit works well, and looks good.  But after just 1 tow, the 2-5/16 ball is not starting to rust.  Not at all what I expected after just 1 tow.
B00I24ZRGI|2|I recently purchased a 2016 Mini Countryman S and so the door handles are deep.  I followed the instructions which says to heat the magnetic side for 35-45 seconds but the protectors will not adhere.  I will try one more time but it does not work, then I plan to return them.
B000C9NP1U|5|Happy
B000GTS75A|5|Needed to break up the outer primary and give it some depth. Looks good.
B000C769BA|1|Typical Rayworstos product, needed extensive clearancing of backing plate to fit. If you buy ten you may get lucky and get one that fits. Good Luck!
B004C20ZRK|5|Nice fix sounds great yamaha stryker looks cleaner
B002VY315O|5|Pretty easy to get right, just take your time. Go ahead and buy two rolls if this is your first time because you'll undoubtedly do something wrong and  need more. But thats not the products fault, it just takes one or two tries to get the hang of it. Plus theyre super cheap.
B0041TJPUW|5|Perfect fit
B0009IK81E|5|Exactly as described. No issues
B00X9K88V6|1|Once you unpack it and read the instructions you will see that it only works if you apply pressure to it. I pressed against it as hard as i could when sitting and nothing ever happened. No massage movement and no heat. I had all the settings on high. I am returning it.
B0068ERO1A|4|Good quality - pants are very long
B00CEXKAHO|1|I have bought 2 sets of these for my mother's Sonata. Both have cracked on drivers side only. We buy AVS vent visors for all our vehicles. These are the worst ones ever purchased.
B00DPYAGVG|5|Really Awsome
B00PYCXGQE|5|All the products purchased works well with the polisher. Car looks great
B00WMPERJQ|3|Unfortunately this coil was defective, thu out an error code when my engine was running on a hot day, which then caused it to sputter and shutdown.  The good thing is that &#34;Parts Player&#34; promptly refunded the purchase price, although I did have to pay for return shipping, it would have been nice if they covered that too.
B00480FIEG|5|5 stars
B0016IHFGC|5|I had no cold air, only hot air coming out of my 2007 Isuzu Ascender front passenger vents.  I replaced the bad actuator with this one and automatically started getting cold air coming out of the front passenger vents and rear vents.  Required me to cut a piece of metal out next to glove compartment to get to left screw but that was the only way to get it to come out without taking the whole front dash apart.  Saved Money$$$
B005XBG6HW|3|It's okay!
B000FQ7Z8Y|5|These have been on my Jeep for a few months and still look and work great!
B000C9QPCQ|1|China made
B00LX6QM9S|5|NEAT STICKER
B00869WCH6|5|Great product
B00NRVCOZS|5|Second set I've purchased from this company for another car, and it doesn't disappoint. 6000k lights cut through the night and shine so much brighter and nicer than the factory bulbs. Easy to install and trouble free so far. Great value and solid product.
B004WMOK4Y|5|workes good
B004GFTC0E|5|I tried this type of lens polishing kit a few years ago (different brand) and was not impressed.  This 3M kit is MUCH better for a few reasons:<br />1.  Its works with a power drill so polishing is more consistent<br />2.  It comes with several different grit papers so you really get a good result.<br />3.  Very complete kit.  Even comes with good masking tape to keep from scratching paint.<br />4.  Comes with a UV protectant.  This is an important step because this keeps the lens clear longer after the polishing.<br /><br />I did both lights on my 2002 Honda Odyssey in less than an hour. (and I took time to watch the online videos)
B00DIDBJRE|5|great products
B007WMY64A|1|As soon as I put this on I got car jacked.
B0031G8GME|5|Easy Installation, great product
B0048FEL7G|4|Pretty good.  the sticky things they give to secure work okay..
B013I1E9LI|5|Fit my jeep wk grand Cherokee equiped with the mercedes 3.0 om642 crd along with the nag1 transmission. I paid no attention to the marks on the dipstick and just used a ruler to measure fluid depth. In that transmission fluid level is dependent upon temperature, which varies.
B00OZXP3BY|5|Look great, fit great and less expensive then aftermarket mats.
B004SJIEOI|5|Great price and fast shipping. Thank you
B00CEP3A0Q|4|Works as intended
B00L7E80IW|5|I love these for my car
B00DYSDHCI|5|Impressive performance. Thanks for all .A+
B006X8AVKW|5|The instructions were easy to understand, product came with no damage and looks awesome on the Tahoe
B003UVCY00|5|I love it !
B000BYGGVC|5|Prompt delivery, I love these plugs, Great Price.
B003IOKPLO|5|Useful tool for my Garage.
B000BYGD2O|5|awesome
B009JXYBLS|5|Heavy duty well made product at a surprisingly low price. Immediately took care of the error message. They do become quite hot and should be mounted on metal as a heat sink.  Would recommend to others.
B00BGTL9GI|5|Works great.  I'm only passing 50 amps through it though.
B002XM4ZTK|5|just what we wanted! thanks
B008EG66BO|5|item fit perfectly on my 2014 Sienna LE and much cheaper than the fram filter @ Walmart.
B00B071BV4|5|It's so wonderful cup, Like I wanted !!
B001CEJH0W|5|Took the &#34;wet sock&#34; smell out of my car in just a few days.  I will buy this cabin air filter from now on.
B008G32R9K|5|Installed on a 2001 Tahoe. Really cleans the front bumper up. Came with bulbs and looks good!
B0010DZZVK|1|Fitment guide is incorrect. Does not fit a 2010 Toyota 4 Runner.
B00354MY3Y|5|Great well built product, looks nice.
B00J4TW2SQ|5|I only have about 250 miles on this scooter but so far I'm not disappointed.  Starts quickly and runs very well.  This came in a metal frame on a wooden pallet.  I put it together alone but I would recommend at least two people do it.  The front wheel has to be installed and I caused some slight damage to the threads on the bolt that fastens it to the forks.  I have forgotten how much it weighs but it is hard for one person to remove it from the metal shipping frame. There are no written assembly instructions.  I was almost finished with the assembly before I realized the assembly instructions were on a DVD.  The only real problem I had was putting on the headlight assembly.  Incredibly aggravating.  The screws are too short and the metal clips fall off.  I finally got it in place and you probably wouldn't notice but it still isn't exactly right.  You need a modest tool set and some experience doing this kind of stuff, otherwise I would suggest you get some help.  One more thing.  There is a small creek behind my house and the scooter wound up in it, completely submerged.  I couldn't get it running again and could not find anyone in Chattanooga or Huntsville that would work on it.  I finally found a place in Rome, Ga about 65 miles away.  They got it running again ($190) but when I got it home the turn signals  stopped working.  I took it to a local shop that works on mowers, 4-wheelers and anything like that (jet-ski, etc).  He has had it about a month trying to get a flasher for it.  Talked to him today and he is still waiting on the flasher to come.  So, I can say it is a good scooter as long as you don't submerge it in water!
B007Q0ZQGK|5|Great
B00651CLCS|5|Fast delivery. Easy install. Nice product. Very satisfied.
B001QIJZRO|5|My husband loves his helmut, fit was great
B000KL72DC|1|I thought this was a custom-fit piece, but I was misled.  Before I installed it, I had to cut a slot for my accelerator, and the rear mats didn't fit at all.  I could have bought cheap mats at any auto parts store with the same result.
B00Y04WSKC|5|Multi-function Jump starter, great product!<br />After checked this product by referencing the Manual, I realized it is really a multi-function product, and I would like to share with you as below:<br />1. 12V output: for starting the car, but have not try this function yet.<br />2. Air outlet: for tire inflating, have not try it yet, but I tried to connect the trachea and then, switch on the button, air outlet normally, as I do not insert the other end of trachea into tire export, so, the barometer is not work.<br />3. 19V output: for charging the notebook, I tried to charge my Dell notebook, and it work properly.<br />4. 5V output: USB interface and a 3in1 USB cable included, for charging smartphone, tablets or other 5V electronic devices. I tried to charge my iPhone 5s, and it is OK. Although it is to big and heavy to be a power bank for charging smartphone or tablets, but, it is convenience to charge smartphone or tablets during driving or outdoor travelling.<br />5. Flashlight: it comes with illumination function, and the LED light has 2 status: lights on, fast blink and slow blink. Fast blink lighting can be as Alerts.<br />Its input is 12V/1A, and it is easy to charge it fully, after fully discharge the jump starter, it take about 2~3hrs to full charge it.<br /><br />All in all, this multi-function jump starter is great, worth buying!
B00DQ6SIG8|5|Installed this on my 2015 Teryx. Took a little bit longer to install than expected but it is worth it. Hauled on an open trailer in fully closed position and worked fine. The mounts attaching to the roll cage a very durable.
B00SXEQ8MY|5|just bought second one. good product and source.
B0078SMQSQ|3|Its a sticker, what else do you say.
B00L2PRVVS|5|For bicycle engines motor, when your Woodruff key were out make sure the replacement key fit wide,long and tall ,because there are a lot of different key sizes ,and you want the key to fit tight in the wide,long ,and tall aspect.If the key don`t fit tight you will have to change again because the impact it receive every time it start will were out the key faster than the more wider one that fit tight .You can measure with a micrometer once you find the correct one,for future references.
B00NUKVJW0|5|Arrived quickly and fit great.  This was an exact match for my 2001 Damon Escaper MH.
B004WMF9DK|3|They look good, but fit is terrible. They are loose and when you hit a bump they will shake. Tough getting them installed. Easily adjustable, though.
B000994BUM|4|Very happy with the color and depth of the metallic look. Sprayed over a gold metallic base coat. Spry nozzle a bit wonky - some spit and splatter. Overall got the job done and am happy with the result.
B007H2ROQ2|5|Perfect replacement for the electrical access door on my '87 Fleetwood Prowler fifth wheel.
B001R5VVTQ|1|This product is very disappointing. The locking mechanism works poorly, i.e. the key is unable to turn it easily. Furthermore the accompanying keys are made of very soft metal and break off while trying to turn the lock. I found I needed to cut the cable to release my items. This lock and cable where worthless to me.
B00DHQIUK6|5|I have an 06 350z coupe and this fits like a glove. Far better quality than the other windshield shades, and well worth the extra price.  If you have tinted windows and combine it with this, it will definitely keep the inside temps down.
B00HZ3H6ZC|1|wish I would have bought the rebuild kit instead.  I bought this for my 650r.  the diameter of the fuel tube is Way way smaller than my original valve. (its like more than half the volume as the factory valve) Other review said this wasn't a problem for him.  The 650r goes 100 mph off road (gps-ed mine on a dry lake bed), I'm sure his doesn't anymore.  I'm sending it back and ordering the rebuild kit for the original.
B009XIX6S8|5|This was a product that was bought by my son and he uses it almost on a daily basis. I was afraid it was going to be so dark he would have to change it for night and day but he states it helps with the sunlight but does not affect him when he uses it at night time. He can still use this dark faceshield at night. A+ Seller and packaged nicely for delivery.
B000AMBOI0|5|Very good product.
B00NQGDIOU|3|Didn't fit as well as I thought they would but I made adjustments to them and look nice.
B002DQC00M|5|Wife has an easy time fitting this in her 2015 Q5, and it really drops the temperature when the car is parked in the sun.
B0059JGTQG|5|I have used them before, bought the cleaning kit too when needed, more CFM than factory filter.
B00Q7K3SZ6|5|Good product, recommend
B00J0K48GS|5|Looks cool on my rifle case. Sticks well.
B0010DXYHW|5|Did the job
B00JIGJKP8|5|Blue blue
B003VAWXME|5|used many of the parts to repair and existing one, good price compared to buying a complete unit
B00BC372EG|5|Great helmet.  Cant beat the price
B00JQI4H2Y|5|These are great.  I was able to get kayaks above the garage door to maximize the space in a small garage. They take a little fiddling to get the knots right, in the correct location and to get the straps adjusted.  The only complaint is the stupid metal buckle on the strap is totally unnecessary and can scratch a boat; I wrapped these with white electrical tape. I slide the boat through the straps without using the buckle. I would have preferred the option to get a buckle-free strap.
B00CC2ZBIU|5|First please spare us and do not install this light kit if your vehicle does not have projector lenses factory pre-installed already.<br /><br />I am not a car guy so my brother-in-law installed it for me on both of my cars, and it is just like the original HID kit that is a part of much more expensive option on our cars (+$4000 for '12 Hyundai Genesis tech package). Please do not expect the lights to auto level themselves like the OEM ones do, but you will receive just about the same light quality from this product. One problem my brother-in-law ran into was that the cable going to the second (further) headlamp was about 1.5 ft too short on both cars. However, this problem might've come from the way we mounted the ballasts and not a defect. Otherwise, I and my wife both have had those kits on our cars for over a year and a half and they are fine. The ballasts may seem like they are a little bulky compared to their &#34;slim ballast&#34; line, but there is no substitution for good stuff that keeps on working. I read many reviews and comparisons between the &#34;regular, thick&#34; and &#34;slim version&#34; ballasts and seems like the first give you better performance over time and much better quality of light output. I have this coupled with a 4200K light bulbs and after this time I still get even (same color temperature) output on both cars.
B004940ZSK|5|great
B00WFYI30I|5|Love then best pods I've ever got
B00UEABOLK|5|Bought this for my wife and it works great, gonnacorder one for myself next
B000HPNWAI|4|This is one. I needed 4 and bought 2. If you need 4 then buy 4. Not sure why it was so confusing that this is only one item.Great otherwise.
B00AWN39T4|5|I absolutely love them am looking for floor mats to match the seat covers and a steering wheel cover to match as well if you carry those please let me know I am interested in them.  the seat covers were easy to install and made a world of difference to my seats and the appearance of my truck<br />Thank You, Becky
B001UGJQB2|5|easy to use
B000C9KWES|4|Ordered a bunch of AC Delco Pro. Replacement Parts for my steering system. All work well, seem sturdy, installed properly, and have proper ball joint rubber caps. Only complaint was the factory grease- half the parts had next to jone, the other half had none. Take advantage of the grease points and push out the stock crap for some decent grease.
B00VELE71W|5|VERY BRIGHT LIGHT! LOVE IT!!!
B00Y75QZD0|5|Works great!!!
B009F10S3Y|5|It was really easy to install, after installation it has protected my bumper from scratches. It sticks on really well and I would definetly buy it again.
B00BCRMBGQ|4|The reason this review got a four star rating is the covers had a chemical smell that had to be aired out first. They did fit well on my ford focus seats and made my interior look much better. The price point was impressive even when compared to the discount I got to review them honestly. Transporting around pets make this an important must have item and would contemplate another. This seller I have bought items from before and is very wonderful to work with and look forward to buying from in the future.
B00W6IZAWM|5|I purchased the wrong item. I email the seller bout my mistake and they what was possible to fix my mistake...all and all i was very satisfied with the results. I will definetly purchase in the future
B000EDST1K|5|Travels well on top of the stove.
B000HBNV58|5|I used this product to quiet my very noisy old neighbor. The old bags were really loud before the application and this grease silenced them. They are still silent six months later.  Note: This is a work of fiction and parody of another reviewer's work. I do not condone violence of any kind, especially to the elderly.
B00RD982MO|2|i love ozium products but after trying the gel for the first time I have to say the spray much more effective. this wont last nearly as long as the spray will, and i couldnt really smell it after only days.
B004K9I7NO|5|Works great
B0062O3MX0|5|Lovely light T-Shirt. Love it.
B000NOUQRA|5|Wonderful little step stool .
B00FGDEX18|5|Good product and worked well with no problems.
B008QWAUR2|2|I did not purchase this. But got a genuine dual cup holder for half the price. To me, too expensive for what it's worth.
B0059KLTR4|5|You get what you pay for ! I have used all kinds of vinyl products on multiple vehicles for both accenting and business logos. 3M is the superior product. YouTube will show countless examples of How To and outcomes. DIY people ! It is a very forgiving product. If you mess it up, its just vinyl !  You can fix it.
B013XSCHXI|5|American flag -check<br />Support the Second amendment - check<br />American flag WITH Second Amendment statement = Awesomeness<br />I don't know if it's gets any better than this! This is a high quality sticker with thick vinyl and good adhesive. The colors are vibrant and the wording... Well you know where I stand on that. Show your support for your country and your liberties our founding fathers wrote for us. I recieved this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. USA!
B008B03HG0|5|Love them
B00YVQD4A2|5|Does what it is supposed to do. I have a pair of thin frame glasses and some thicker Oakleys and they are held well in this holder.
B006B2261C|5|Partially my ignorance. But, I wish they were more direct about the fact that you need TWO of these kits to repair your bike. I highly doubt that anyone ever rebuilds just one of their carburetors.....but, maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Anyways, once I ordered the 2nd one, worked great!
B007J7DPN6|5|Look great in my Equinox.<br />GO FLYERS!!
B00J4H7YUY|5|Elegant
B00TP11HTS|5|It is everything it wa advertised to be.
B002BB1G4K|5|It was a nice addition to my Bike!! Thanks!!
B000WJIRGI|5|Look great on my 2014 Street Glide. I installed 12 inch apes making the stock mirrors useless. These were perfect. Good quality. They are slim but side to side view is good.
B004RT1IGU|5|Excellent product!  Speedy delivery!
B00LH1N8J6|1|Bright? NOPE!<br />Hassle to install? Incredibly so!<br />Would I recommend them? Never.<br /><br />Do I actually need to toss these and go back to my old school halogen bulbs? YES! These lights are so dim I cannot drive this car at night for time being.
B00T4X9AVE|1|It falls apart and the USB connection is not tight enough to engage the charger.
B000VKTUJQ|4|bargain compared to store choices. Half off.
B00WYO2R6K|3|Started a dead battery, charged my Samsung and tablet and that was about it.  It's a good little unit and rather impressive when starting a car, BUT it in no way lives up to the claims made about it as far as the number of times it's capable of charging.  I'll keep it but it would be nice if there were some honesty involved..
B00W4IDIGE|1|I own a crz and the front bumper has a lot of bends, I purchased one and prepped the surface properly and it came off. I purchased it again and used 3m primer after prepping to make sure it would stick will and used a heat gun and it still came off.
B007Q4T6I0|5|Perfect match to HID low beams
B009DJK81K|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B001GC2LVM|5|Wow, what a great product. no more fighting 2 x 8 boards. heavy duty and the options for backing on the levelers make it so nice. I highly recommend these levelers.
B00SSD6MOO|5|Fitment  is awesome and the look is to
B002P8R4CC|5|great fit!
B00MT0NC1S|4|My sons loves the minions
B001J62TIU|5|perfect fit and codes disappeared
B00JQYODFE|5|All porcelain and we'll worth the money if you like the larger size toilet. Love it! Just note packaging is not the best. First one arrived broken.
B000BQWLE6|5|have bought many and give as gifts to anyone who rides in our vehicle and says they like it! I even line it with a twist tie bag from Walmart...fits perfectly and keeps it clean! easy to wash up and clean if it gets dirty too.
B00GRHRTEU|1|These are weak and you can tighten all you want but they will move at 55mph. Not suggested AT ALL.
B0041PHXDC|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00029WSWC|5|Got it as a gift
B00TYZLD0S|5|Worked like a charm for my fianc&eacute;'s 2015 Macan.
B00FQ0ROZS|3|One of the lights didn't match out of the three. Also all four lights had scratches and dings, seems like I received used lights.
B007BLMXBU|5|working good so far after my complete tune-up I've been getting 5 extra miles per gallon thank you
B000HAEPSG|5|Great item to add when getting car cover, this will protect my husbands GTO from the weather and we will not have to worry about the cover blowing off in the wind. Thank you
B00ZZO0448|4|Nice warm light just a tad dim for me but it works id probably get cool white next time
B0022ZQZMS|5|This is a replacement for the original cover. Seems to prolong the time needed to clean my air filter and I have ridden in heavy rain with this cover
B008EEYTQA|5|Parts went on without a hiccup. Functioning flawlessly. EXCELLENT PRICE
B00JJTZQQ6|4|Nice replacement ac compressor, just make sure to add the recommended ac compressor oil to it, as it comes dry before installation.
B00HT5MBKG|5|Fantastic
B006NZTZLQ|4|Check out my cars for problems and then Fix them right a away.
B003PJ9KAY|2|I have a 1985 mercedes 300TD wagon and this is the correct hitch for my vehicle (I called to confirm as well), yet there is a design flaw that requires modifications to your vehicle in order for it to fit on, as well as not bang on your exhaust.  they had to sand down on the interior to get the new double bolt brackets in, and I had to buy new exhaust hangers and weld a dent into my exhaust pipe for it to fit.  the 'S' bracket bends way too close to the exhaust pipe.  they could easily change how it's bent and it would be no problem.  so be prepared to spend a little extra time and money to get this to fit.  it's a solid hitch though and there aren't many other good hitch options for this car.  I've been in contact with curt and they aren't all that concerned because they said they sell 1 every 2 years of this model.  so it's not a big concern, like say if it was an F150 hitch that they are selling tons of.  he said they would need my exact same car in their factory in eau claire Wisconsin, so their designers could see it and change the design.  so just heads up that this hitch isn't quite designed properly for this vehicle.
B001BNHY1S|5|Great quality for a low price!
B000FIA11K|5|If I was to buy thus at a box store it world cost three times the cost.  It is also hard to find this unit without a light!  We do not need more light on when we are trying to sleep in our RV,
B0040CWVBU|5|Perfect!
B000F1X7FE|5|Very pleased.. Good fit & affordable.
B00OYKXUZY|5|Got them on my 2005 Honda Rincon 650 and there much better than stock ones!!
B001B77XIS|5|Looks identical to the factory model, much quieter than the original, works great
B00GSAUHB8|4|Good product! !
B00FADIYZK|5|Perfect
B0067UCSTS|5|It did the trick, for a much lower price than the parts store. Be aware that there are two versions of this hub, and the only difference seems to be how the ABS sensor connector is held on to the knuckle. This one comes with a plastic clip, but some cars have a metal one which is not compatible. Just pry the metal one off the old hub and attach it to the connector on the new hub.
B00EOX2QJC|2|Interior Dimensions in description are NOT correct.  Actual Dimensions are closer to 10.75 x 7.25 at the bottom of the box.  I gave two stars because this would probably be a good battery box for a Group 24 battery, but I planned on using it for two U1 batteries which would have fit great if the dimensions were correct.
B000UMGKGG|2|Well just my luck I recieved a faulty unit. Everything works as described other than shutting the alarm off. You are suppose to be able to turn off the alarm by pushing disarm or any other button on the remote. &#34;IT DOESN'T SHUT OFF&#34; until the time cycle runs out. I was issued a RMA # by bulldog to return it for repairs, so I guess Im out shipping cost as well.<br /><br />Dave B.<br /><br />Update: I sent the unit back to Bulldog and they sent me a replacement within a week. The new alarm works as described and I haven't had any problems with any of the functions. Things happen and I guess this one got by the QC department and a bad unit got shipped out. In the end I had to put up with a little frustration and it ended up costing me a few extra dollars to return it but I did get the problem solved and I'm happy with the product. If you buy this alarm and are fortunate enough to get a good one I think you'll be happy with it as well.<br /><br />Best Wishes: Dave B
B000M5UD1E|4|Brighter light for more cash...what a new concept.  These hurt oncoming drivers eyes at night but I have them on mostly in daytime and seldom drive this car after dark so they work great.  I bought these to compensate for driving lights since there was no place to mount the lights I bought.  Mission Accomplished!
B003Y80JW4|4|Good cable for basic riders. I should have gotten the better quality cable,but I was in a time jam and didn't look for the internally lined housing cable.
B00PB6G9ZS|2|Worked great for awhile, but stopped working after about 3 months
B00BTGSID0|5|We generally wash all of our vehicles at touch-free car washes and pull over and hop out at the end to quickly dry with microfiber cloths.  We try to always leave a good stack in the trunk.  I've tried over a dozen different manufacturers and these have worked best for us.  I can do a full wipe down, leaving no streaks, in just under 2 minutes!  Thank you Chemical Guys for offering such a great product!
B00PNUIKDG|5|I was in a hurry to get out of the car and pulled the handle just as I was turning the keys off.  The timing is critical.  The handle will normaly unlock the door if it's locked and you pull it, but if you manage to pull the handle while your unlocking (thanks auto unlock) you can break an inside part of the handle, and then it doesn't feel like it will open anymore.<br />However, you can pull the handle like normal, even though it doesn't open and then pull the unlock a little farther than normal and you can still get your door to open without having to roll down the window.<br /><br />To replace take out 4 screws in the interior door panel to remove it: one on door latch side, one on bottom middle of panel, one in the arm rest under the rubber pad, and one in the lock trim ring (use a knife or fingernail file to pop off the screw cover.)<br />I used a set off nylon trim tools to pop the interior panel off, then took out one hex head screw to remove old lock, installed new and put it back together.<br />Good as new, repair time less than one hour.
B007T8UXYY|5|Works great!
B00Z8MKB5Y|5|good good good
B00MO0XQ0U|5|Husband very happy, came on time, great price!
B00FRHOLK6|5|Huge improvement over OEM, I love rain-X products.  Easy to install too.
B00O84WNNG|2|Using it as a maintainer, I believe it has overcharged several batteries and ruined them.
B00LV8P744|5|One for grandpa and one for grandson...super nice jacket...well made
B00S113OMQ|5|Excellent product
B007H9ZTOE|5|It's a good Cup
B004OFNJZ0|5|Good product, would purchase again!
B0047RZRFU|4|I only rated it four stars because when I received them, two out of the four bulbs did not work. I contacted the seller and they eventually did resend me two bulbs as replacement. It took about a month to receive them due to the out of country shipping. No complaints other than that so far, but it's only been a month since I put them in. Time will tell, but four bulbs for less than $5, who can really complain. The auto parts store sold similar bulbs two for $13.
B00HTP8N0I|5|if you gotta tie something down get these
B00J262R9A|5|Even better than I hoped it would be. Lot's of options and settings. Put it on a 2000 F250.
B002IG1WJC|5|So easy to install. Makes getting my jeep so much easier.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Well worth the money. Installed in a 2001 Tahoe mirrors and interior overhead light. Great product !
B00498CONA|4|Very limited flex, easy to kink
B004AIXXES|1|These pads did not fit my vehicle as it was indicated they would. They are the wrong shape, they would not be possible to install without grinding down about 1/4&#34; where they contact the hub center. I will not grind down a brake component to get it to install, I am returning this. Had they fit, they looked like they would have been a quality pad.
B000FGCYT4|1|This product in no way fit my scoot. one of 3 holes matched up,the part of the filter that should have mated w/ the base for the cleaner mount didn't even make contact. I ordered a K&N from a dealership and it fit as it was supposed to.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Nice
B001JT5TQQ|3|A little cheaper looking than I had hoped. Also the one I received was made by Bell. Like the cheap bicycle stuff at Walmart Bell.
B0046R1548|5|Worked just like the factory clips. My car is in the sun so most of the original clips broke when I removed the emblem strip to replace my headlight. These worked great.
B002X6VXL4|5|Gotten me out of 3 situations already this thing is great. Air compressor makes it for me. Dead batteries and flat tires will not stop you anymore.
B00K0IHI1Q|1|These do not fit a 2015 Subaru Forester.  Returned.
