6300214400|4.0|&quot;The Search for Spock&quot;, while not up to the par of the previous Trek movie, is nonetheless one of the better films in the entire series, despite the fact that the title character barely appears. Making up for his  absence, though, is the return of his father, Sarek, as well as the  heart-tugging ending on the planet Vulcan. Slightly marring the film are  Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon captain (just can't picture Reverend Jim  as a Klingon!) and a different actress playing Saavik instead of Kirstie  Alley (from Trek II), who was born for the role. However, these are minor  detractions. Seeing the destruction of the beloved Enterprise, being  watched by the planetside crew, is worth the price admission (or rental  fee), alone!
B00000G3PA|1.0|Anybody with little logical sense would just shake his/er head through out the movie.  Because it totally doesn't make any sense.  Who the hell would send &quot;oil-drillers&quot; to space and save our world.  Com'on, Man!   Give the human race some credit.<br />This movie is totally US-centric.  If  &quot;OUR&quot; earth about to be destroyed, it's everybody's business.   France, Russia, China, UK, Italy, South Africa, etc., blah  EVERYBODY.  You  think they will just sit back and watch US to kick some asteriod's  butt.<br />Anyway, I have to give some credit to the special effect.  It's  cool!  I have to give -10 to the screenwriters, who have lots of insulting  sense of mankinds.<br />Have fun!
6300213803|5.0|This is perhaps the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie, with a terrific plot, exciting battles and a heart-tugging ending. To top it off it features Ricardo Montalaban's reprise of one of Trek's grandest villian of  all, the ruthless and terrifying Khan, as well as the appearance of Kirk's  former flame and their grown-up son. This movie kicks off a trio of  interconnected Trek films, which together make for one of the most  memorable screen series of all time.

B000001FY9|5.0|A friend and I were driving back from Chicago when we started talking about CDs that are essential for any GREAT collection. While our preferences varied for the most part, this was one we definitely agreed  upon. This album is a fantastic collection of the works of a true musical  legend. I recommend this CD highly for any Reggae fan, or lover of great  music. Enjoy!
6305291489|5.0|My opinion of this movie only says one thing: it was FANASTIC!!!!! I enjoyed how one character plays two girls. Also, I think the actors and actresses who were chosen did a super job. For anyone who hasn't seen this  movie, here's what it's about: Two girls, (Hallie and Annie) are suprised  to find out that they are actually twins! The girls meet at camp and decide  to switch places. Hallie goes back to England as Annie and Annie goes back  to California as Hallie. For the rest, you'll have to see this movie  youself. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes humerous movies. Anyone  who's never seen this movie, please rush to your local video rental store  and rent        &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;!
B000002BPS|5.0|There have been many naysayers with regard to this band and this album. Don't believe them.  Offspring's first major label release, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; is a great album. Listen to the album, and be amazed by  the bands undeniable wit and tunefulness. Sure, this recording may not be  as punk as Smash as well as any of their earlier  recordings, but it might  very well be their strongest effort from start to finish.  They may have  moved to a major label, but the only real difference is the tighter  production. Besides the production, the songs are tighter and stronger than  ever before. The punk sounds of &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;,  &quot;Mota&quot;, and &quot;All I Want&quot; &quot;and the more  rock-oriented sounds of Gone Away&quot;, &quot;I Choose&quot;, and  &quot;Amazed are all fine examples. Overall, whatever your musical taste,  the Offspring's &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; should bring a smile to  your face.
0783231032|1.0|I agree with those who say that this movie, while stupid, is still funny.  No one, though, has said how truly bad this DVD is.  I have about 150 in my collection, and &quot;1941&quot; is one of the worst for video quality.   The print is murky and scratched.  Colors are faded.  It almost looks as  bad as a VHS tapes; in some ways it's worse.  On VHS, at least there is the  excuse of that being why the quality is bad.  On DVD, Universal has only  itself to blame.  Others in the Universal &quot;Collectors Series&quot;,  like &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot; have been great  examples of what DVD can do.  I know that &quot;1941&quot; was delayed a  couple of times due to production problems.  It probably should have been  canceled, or at least held up until a full digital restoration could be  completed.

B00000ICD9|5.0|I became totally immersed while watching this movie. Robin Williams took me on his personal journey of 'heaven' and 'hell' and I came out the other side a changed man. My concept of the 'here-after' changed radically after  this film. I watched the movie at the theater, bought the book, and am now  waiting for the May release of the DVD version of the movie. I'm also  renting it this weekend. I wish I could give it 10 stars!

0380789019|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful book.  This is the first Neil Gaiman book I've read; in fact, the first I'd ever heard of him was when a local PBS station broadcast the Neverwhere mini-series.<br />Gaiman does an amazing job of  presenting a bizarre, frightening world from the perspective of a rather  ordinary fellow who wants little more than to be perfectly ordinary.  The  book manages to be clever, funny, and eerily unsettling all at once.<br />If  you enjoy science fiction narrated with a clever tongue, you MUST read this  book.
B000002UAR|5.0|Having being a teenager every new Beatles track was a wonder to me. I remember distinctly playing Revolver for the first time; my friends and I normally a very talkative lot, sitting silently, gazing at the spinning LP  wondering if we had been transfered to another planet! The impact it made  on us was enormous.The feelings it left us with stay with us to this  day.Wonderment, joy,sadness, and above all others, humbleness. If I play  Revolver in my car I can have travelled 50 miles without realising it. The  oddest thing though, and having been a Beatles fan from their very first  record, is that after all these years the songs still sound  wonderful.Virtually all of them! My favourite track is 'And Your Bird Can  Sing'. Once, and only once, I saw The Beatles, Rolling  Stones at the  Hammersmith Odean(London) on the same bill. My wish, and goodness knows I  tried, was to get in on one of their recording sessions under any pretext  but despite all my cunning plans it did not work. I once wrote to John  Lennon(when he was in Paris with Yoko Ono) and got a roughly scrawled reply  on the back.I also once bumped into George Harrison in Henley-0n-Thames and  did not recognise him! It was the person I was with nudged me and told me  it was him.Short hair and scruffy.Quite amazing...... Anyway, 'Revolver'  will live with me as their greatest work.Who agrees?
6305127689|5.0|This movie has always been one of my top favorites both for just being a great movie to one of the best for sound. The launch off the flight deck at the beginning of the movie is one of the most awesome visual and audio  recordings of a carrier launch that I've ever seen. I haven't stood on a  carrier deck during a launch but this is the closest I've been. I fell in  lust with Kelly McGillis in this movie and have loved her since. And, as a  pilot but not jets darn-it, I loved all the flying sequences.
B00000IBRX|5.0|I will remember this movie forever.  This movie was so full of touching moments, incredible scenery and sincere acting.  It is not a children's fairy tale.  This movie is for adults who want to be think, reflect and be  moved.  Unless you are completely unfeeling, you will cry. The movie moves  you through most every emotion.  This is a sit down and watch it withough  interuptions movie.  You will think about this movie for days afterward.   This is a must-own movie.
0790736233|5.0|Like a lot of movies, (Titanic, et. al.) I've noticed a common thread: you either love it, or hate it. And, to be sure, everyone's a critic. But Contact is definately one of my favorite movies of all time. (Alongside  such Classics as the Star Wars Trilogy and E.T.) Frist, it really got me  thinking about extra-terrestrial life. To this day I still wonder if we're  the only ones in this vast universe of which we belong. As someone who  enjoys astronomy, I can testify that after seeing this movie when it came  out in 97, it was one of the few I actually remembered a lot about,  something that very few have done. (The Breakfast Club being another) The  reasons are this, from the outset, I could tell that Elle's father  encouraged her to chase her dreams, unlike Drummond, who constantly hounded  her about how she wanted to spend her life. She wanted to be the one to  discover the &quot;sign&quot;, and when she does, who comes along but the  very same person who chased her from Aricebo, to the VLA, and was close to  having her booted from there. When she finally does, who wants to claim the  glory? Drummond. Remember all the times in the film he took charge  of the  whole thing after Ellie discovers the signal? (Press conference, etc) That  to me subtly shows him saying &quot;You were right, I was wrong.&quot;  Next, the people at Hadden Industries were reluctant to &quot;foot the  bill&quot;, and Ellie made the point that what would have happened if the  Wright Brothers hadn't had the courage to pursue their dreams of flight?  Next, to me it really raised some questions about &quot;matters of  faith.&quot; The religious extremist was so dead set against the idea, and,  I'm sure you know what happened. To me, that shows that despite some  people's intentions, it's not all for the best. Perhaps showing a bit of  intolerance for other views, and a narrowness of vision.  Finally, I was  struck at the very end, where they bring up the issue of 18 hours of  static, not to mention the response of Joss in the the face of the  committee's disbelief: I for one, believe her. That shows that when  everyone else is against you, there will be that one person or group of  people behind you, no matter what happens. To me, the fact that she was an  athiest really didn't matter, when there was so much more overlying the  whole movie. Sure, the effects at the start and near the end were good  nonetheless, but they, to me, weren't the whole movie. I guess I saw so  many different levels when I saw this movie the first time, and the other  times afterward, and that's why I found it to be very enjoyable, and  memorable.
6305291489|5.0|I saw Father of the Bride one and two.  They are my favorite movies.  When i heard the makers of those movies had created a new film, i was at the movie theatre as fast as i could.  it was just as i had suspected.

0871137380|3.0|A well researched book but it makes you wonder why Mr. Bowden didn't take the trouble to contact/interview any of the Malaysian soldiers that took part in the rescue. The Malaysian embassy in Washinghton could have  provided him with some assistance. After the incident was over, numerous  accusations were thrown at the Malaysian troops involved. The most common  which appeared in several leading American newspapers and magazines were,  &quot; the Malaysians were late&quot;, &quot;the Malaysians weren't trained  properly&quot;, &quot;the convoy got lost&quot;,&quot;language  problems&quot;, etc. The plain and simple fact is had the Malaysian troops  not arrived, more Americans would have been killed.
0060168366|1.0|Paul Johnson is a British journalist who also is an amateur historian.  In this book he sets out to write a comprehensive history of the US; however, his book is marred by serious shortcomings.<br />The most obvious failing of  this book is its abundance of factual errors.  Previous reviewers have  noted whoppers like Johnson's conflation of Civil War Gens. Joseph and  Albert Sidney Johnston.  Such errors abound throughout.  Opening at random  to the description of the Constitutional Convention, I quickly found  Johnson erroneously describing Alexander Hamilton as &quot;leading the  federalists&quot; during the convention; in fact Hamilton was absent from  much of the convention and had little influence on its outcome.  In the  same account Gouvernor Morris of Pennsylvania is misidentified as a  delegate from New York.<br />It is true that in a book of such length and  scope, even a professional historian could make errors, but the number of  Johnson's mistakes and the ease with which many of them could have been  avoided suggests that he did much of his writing and research  sloppily.<br />While the factual errors are the most apparent flaw in AHotAP,  other shortcomings are more serious.  Johnson repeatedly displays poor  judgement in choosing which events to emphasize.  He discusses minor issues  and events at great length while giving short shrift to much more important  topics.<br />For example, writing about the Civil War, Johnson gives much  attention to the actions of Col. John Mosby, an irregular cavalry leader  who had little effect on the course of the war, while giving much less  space to Grant's campaigns in the West from Fort Henry to Vicksburg, which  were extremely important, and in some historians' view decisive.<br />Turning  to the post WW2 era, Johnson repeatedly trivializes major social movements,  while magnifying trivial issues.  The environmental movement gets a mere  two paragraphs, and these merely to lament that it &quot;added to  [America's] problems of competing in the world.&quot;  The environmental  degradation which gave rise to the movement is barely noted.  But Johnson  has time to run on for pages about the &quot;political correctness&quot;  issue, a teapot tempest manufactured by right-wing pundits.<br />The civil  rights movement fares a bit better--the entire period from the Montgomery  bus boycott to Martin Luther King's murder gets a whopping two pages.  Even  so, the focus is almost entirely on King; Malcolm X, for example, an  important and complex figure, is summarily, and inaccurately, dismissed as  a &quot;black racist.&quot;  People like Fannie Lou Hamer are non-persons  in Johnson's account.  But he has space for a rhapsody of several pages on  the &quot;power&quot; of Ronald Reagan's humor (humor that was in most  cases, like the &quot;there you go again&quot; quip made much of by  Johnson, scripted by the Gipper's aides).<br />A third weakness is the  incompleteness of Johnson's research.  On many subjects, his notes reveal a  failure to consult major, standard works on the topic.  For example, no  serious treatment of the rise of giant corporations can ignore the books of  Alfred Chandler.  No one could fairly criticize the foreign policy of FDR,  as Johnson does, without at least consulting the standard works on that  topic by Dallek and Divine.  And any treatment of the Cold War worthy of  serious attention must at least take into account the arguments of  revisionist historians like Williams, Kolko, Gardner and Alperovitz.  Yet  Johnson appears never to have read any of their work.<br />Of all AHotAP's  faults, the most glaring are Johnson's dubious interpretations and  judgements.  Events are frequently viewed through an ideological filter,  leading Johnson to conclusions that are almost impossible to justify  rationally.  The Great Depression, for example, would have ended, according  to Johnson, by the end of 1930, had the government not interfered with the  &quot;self-adjusting&quot; abilities of the economy (self-adjusting  abilities which even conservative economists like Milton Friedman now admit  do not exist).  Prior to the civil rights movement, Johnson tells us,  &quot;blacks had failed to participate fully in American political  life,&quot; as if blacks were not voting by choice, not because a mix of  law and terror prevented them.<br />Johnson's most warped judgements, which  border on hysteria, concern President Nixon and his crimes--crimes which in  Johnson's view were, as he says of the &quot;plumbers&quot; illegal acts,  &quot;activities of an entirely justified nature.&quot;  Watergate is  portrayed as an effort by evil liberal &quot;witchhunters&quot; to drive a  good man from office; Nixon's central impeachable offense, that of  obstruction of justice, goes entirely unmentioned.  Also absent is the  famous &quot;smoking gun tape,&quot; which proved that Nixon was complicit  in the Wagergate coverup from the start, and by providing such proof,  caused most Senate Republicans to turn against Nixon, and caused Nixon to  resign in the face of certain conviction and removal from office.  Johnson  simply pretends that this sequence of events never happened, and  misrepresents Nixon as resigning &quot;in the national interest&quot; even  though, as Johnson distorts it, he would not have been convicted.<br />This  book's shrill, tendentious nature make it entirely unsuited as an  introduction to US history, and to anyone with knowledge of the subject, as  I have, it is often genuinely painful to read.  Doubtless many  conservatives will find it congenial reading, since it tells them things  they want to hear (the previous reviewer who acknowledged how glad he was  to see a book that trashed FDR was tacitly admitting this).  But a  historian's job is not to comfort his readers in their prejudices, but to  respect the truth and present the truth as best he can.  Paul Johnson fails  completely at this task.justing&quot; abilities of the economy (self-adjusting  abilities which even conservative economists like Milton Friedman now admit  do not exist).

B000002BFZ|5.0|I have herard a lot of things about the weakness of this album and must say i don't know what they are talking about.  This album rises above all their others with messages within messages on the deeper meanings of life,  such as in presents tense, who are we, and in my tree. But still they  retain the more powerful hard hiting sound, combined with a anti-addiction  message in habit, and the chaotic pounding on lukin.  I thought eddie's  morrison like spoken word on i'm open was a very nice bookend to the the  song realease me off of ten, and could definitly hear the intense influence  neal young has had on the boys.  this album has a greater spiritual tone  than most new pop music and it has brought me through many a hard day.

630245333X|5.0|My guess is, this great film got bad reviews from the critics. <br />I can't imagine why.<br />THE BLOB is a remake of the original Steve McQueen movie. The plot deals with the town hoodlum, who makes a terrible discovery....a  government experiement that started out as a biological warfare virus, but  turned into something MUCH more deadlier.<br />For me, this film really works.  The government conspiracy themes, the &quot;town in utter chaos&quot; theme  and the general gore of it all are ingredients for a fine horror film. Even  though THE BLOB has that late-80's horror atmosphere, the plot devices get  past all that and make a HIGHLY enjoyable and entertaining  movie.<br />Reccomended.

The tale of Tim  McVeigh's nosey next door  neighbor.<br />For every tooth filing, nail grinding moment on this album  there's the ballad that can reduce even Hitler to a blubbering sentimental  lump of frail human vulnerability.  <br />The last three songs compliment each  other in a beautiful, mystical way; FILIPINO BOXSPRING HOG being a  foodaholick frenzy.  Then after dinner and a few drinks, mortality comes up  around the campfire.  TAKE IT WITH ME being a sweet optimistic view of  death and clinging to the things you love.  Then the joyous COME ON UP TO  THE HOUSE ends with the welcoming arms of heaven. You know,  I'm not a  religious man but after my third listening I'm a bit more confident that  the universe isn't such a cold place after all.<br />Has Tom become the Tom  Waits machine?    well.................yes.  But it's a machine that stands  along side  human kind's greatest mechanical creations; The Saturn rocket,  The great pyramid, the garden weasel. The Tom Waits machine however has one  thing that the others don't; HEART. This dose of medicine only comes along  once every five years or so and sure........it tastes kind of the same,   but it sure is good for what ales ya

After the horrid gay transvestite musical number, the movie becomes merely  dull.  <br />I never was much of a Shakespeare fan because the languange has  changed so much over the centuries, but this movie took what was basically  a decent play and made it into some sort of twisted West Side story  wannabee.  <br />If you love Shakespeare, you'll probably like this twisted  version.  If you don't really care for the Bard, then avoid this one.

0385493800|5.0|John Grisham appears to be a wealthy author who also walks the walk.  More and more his books have been extensions of his value system and it looks to me like that value system is remarkably durable. Combined with what appears  to be a reluctant faith in the essential goodness of people, Grisham's  values come through with a sort of missionary zeal in &quot;The  Testament&quot;.  This will likely be far from his most popular offerings  because he makes the usually unforgivable move of turning the spotlight on  the most wretched of Western pursuits - inheriting well - and contrasting  it with less-than-third-world Brazilian rainforest culture.  In anybody  else's hands, this would have been preachy but Grisham does a masterful job  of pulling it off.  And, as usual, he does it with a twist.  Bravo.

One has to wonder why  almost no songs from &quot;October&quot; were included;not even  &quot;Gloria&quot;.  Perhaps U2's new audience wouldn't appreciate the  overt references to God on &quot;October&quot;; then again, perhaps U2  don't. Just about the only saving grace for this album is the surprise  inclusion of &quot;October &quot; at the end of the disc, which is  virtually the only reason this album gets one star in my book.
B000001E7T|5.0|This album is just about PERFECT. Anyone into blues/rock or just rock or blues - MUST OWN THIS. PJ Harvey is so talented and why not have her best album?!?<br />There is no right answer except that if you do not own this -  you must buy it - NOW.<br />PJ HARVEY RULES!
6300151379|5.0|I am one of the lucky individuals who actually owns a copy of this masterpiece.  I recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, adventure and Henson.  The music is wonderful, the lines are funny, Henson's creatures  are loveable and the plot is one to cherish for all times.  I am interested  in getting Henson to re-release this incredible movie.  Anyone interested  in helping, please contact me.  Also, if anyone knows if this movie is  based on a book, please tell me!!
6304308388|5.0|This movie is so entertaining and funny, you almost forget the incredibly cynical view it presents of corporate life, infidelity, ambition,and love.  Ironically, its that very cynicism that makes the comedy so biting and  memorable.  Jack Lemmon has never been better and anyone who's ever worked  in an office will recognize some if not all of the characters.
B000001FAC|5.0|Very interesting and perceptive comment from the fan from South Dakota below, who compares &quot;Fillmore East&quot; to &quot;Kind of Blue.&quot;  As every admirer of Duane Allman knows, he was a huge jazz fan, and  particularly loved, and was influenced by, Miles and 'Trane.  In fact, if  Robert Palmer's liner notes to the recent reissue of &quot;Kind of  Blue&quot; are to be credited, Duane was listening obsessively to  &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; at the time of the &quot;Fillmore East&quot;  recordings; and a close listen to both discs reveals &quot;Kind of  Blue['s]&quot; influence. Be that as it may, the music on this live disc is  simply staggering.  I've been listening to it since the day it was released  (do any of you ABB fans out there still have your pink-label  Capricorns?)and I'm still in awe.  Every tune is astonishing, but  &quot;Elizabeth Reed&quot; attains a realm of transcendent excellence where  only giants walk.  Much is made, deservedly, of Duane's slide work, but  I've always thought his fretted work is superior, and his solo on  &quot;Elizabeth Reed&quot; confirms my conceit. No guitarist of whom I'm  aware, certainly no rock guitarist, could or can match the sheer ecstasy of  Duane's playing on this track.  It has no equal. Of course, the rest of the  band is hardly just loping along behind him.  The thunderous, churning  power of the rhythm section (Jaimoe, Butch, and Berry) provides the perfect  support for Duane's cathartic, wailing blast. That's an example of what was  truly great about the ABB: They were a genuine ensemble, within which the  playing of each brilliant individual supported, complemented, and inspired  the others.  I truly envy any prospective buyer who has the opportunity to  purchase &quot;Fillmore East&quot; and listen to it for the first time.  If  you are one of those lucky people, do yourself a huge favor and buy this  CD. After a listen or two you'll know what all the fuss is about.
0385493800|3.0|Grisham's lack of character development in this mulit-continent, far-fetched, legal travelog left me wanting much more.  I have read all of his previous books and usually enjoy climbing inside each character. With  'Testament' he gives the reader some teaser information and then fails to  deliver. I wanted to know more about Nate and Rachel. I felt the reader was  introduced to a splattering of characters, but was left feeling most were  superficial and 2D, very unusual in a Grisham novel. I was left wanting  more.
0780623703|5.0|When I saw this movie i was totally in to it. All the Cast was excellent. Toby Maguire was excellent and Joan Allen as the housewife. William H Macey was very good and Reese Witherspoon was also good. the Humor in the movie  is very funny and the visual effects i don't know why this wasn't nominated  for Best Visual Effects because they were excellent. The Music score from  Randy Newman was very well done and all the music was excellent in the  movie. This is one of the years Best films  Why this wasn't nominated for  best picture i will never know all i know this should have been nominated  at least if it won good if it didn't Saving Private Ryan should won it  instead of Shakespeare In Love i mean please it was good but not that good.
0375707972|5.0|I could not put this book down. This book is one that should be included in any book discussion group's agenda. Thought provoking and a reminder of the Holocast and the personalization of actions sorrounding this horrendous  event in history.
6305265488|5.0|This is one of the year's movies. I don't know where to start because there are so many good things about it. For starters the performance from Drew Barrymore is excellent. The lush cinematography, the costumes are  excellent and the performance from Dougray Scott was very good. The music  from George Fenton is excellent in the movie that is why i bought the  Soundtrack. And the performance From Anjelica Huston is even better than  Drew Barrymore don't get me wrong her performance was excellent to But  Hustons performance was wonderful I mean how classy can you get. With  Huston it is bound to be classy with her in this role. Although i wished  They had used The Mummer's Dance and Fabel that was used in the movies  trailer. Director Andy Tennant has has made this movie something Wonderful  to watch even though a simple story it is smart and very romantic.  Barrymore and Scott make a wonderful couple. So if i were you i would go  see this wonderful movie i did because i respect Drew Barrymore a lot and  she is a good actress. Even Anjelica Hustons performance is worth the  price. As i said Ever After Soars
6305229449|5.0|Mulan, in my opinion, is the strongest animated feature made by the company in a long time. The last couple of movies were not the quality I expect from Disney. Mulan had a strong plot and good songs but not too many  that would distract from the storyline. I loved Eddie Murphy as &quot;  Mooshu&quot; and was glad they had a flawed and realistic heroine who  struggled with herself instead of looking for someone to kiss her.
B000002GEV|5.0|This is an almost flawless Supertramp album, brought down only by a few weak and long-winding tracks, which is reminiscent of their earlier work. The vocals are incredible, the lyrics and tunes are an exceedingly dark  blend, the piano on the last track is haunting. Though all of the tracks  don't fit well together, each provides its own individual pleasure. A  masterpiece, without a doubt, and perhaps the band's best album.
6305265488|3.0|This movie was charming.  Drew Barrymore was cute in it.  Dougray Scott was handsome. But the story wasn't that great.  It was predictable of course and besides it kind of hit the viewer over the head with political  correctness! A better retelling of the Cinderella story is the novel Ella  Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine.  Somebody should make that story into a  movie.
0385311400|2.0|Although I don't believe that I could ever write as well as Ms. Gabaldon does, I think that the main problem with this book is the lack of direction.  Outlander was motivated by Claire's determination first and  indecision later to return to the 20th century.  Dragonfly in Amber  contained the drive of Claire and Jamie to save their loved ones from the  folly of Charles Stewart.  And Voyager had the search for Ian and the  unraveling mystery of time travel.  In DOA there is little motivation for  the characters to do anything.  The plot seems to be a quiet time between  major events in the characters lives.  Nothing that lends to the story as a  whole. <br /> Brianna and Roger's jump to the past would have made more sense  if there had been more development of their personalities.  In this case  Brianna is portrayed as a shadow of her father in almost every way.  Roger  isn't as shallow, but he shows no emotions other than frustration or lust.   Neither of these characters can stand alone. <br /> What I missed most was the  careful flashbacks and the banter between characters.  There were none of  the little explainations that occurred in the previous books.  These  explainations revealed a lot about each character through seeming  insignificant moments and tied their thoughts to their actions.  I hope  that the next book will have more of these things.<br /> A note to Ms. G.,   please don't bow to the advise of your current editor/publlisher!  You have  many, many loyal fans; and we are buying the books- not them!!
0316743003|5.0|This book tells the tale of how a group of 75 engineers came up with some of the greatest aerospace technology the world has seen.  In particular, the information on the SR-71 is incredible.  It's geared towards the  non-technical reader, which is OK, but I would have preferred more  engineering details.  My only complaint is the outdated cold-warrior tone  of the author in certain places.  Overall, a must-read for the aviation  enthusiast.
078401213X|5.0|Pi is a movie for the thinking man, and definitely not for the squeamish.  Both Orwellian and Kafka-esque in its mood, the film is photographed in black and white, which only enhances the moods of paranoia, delusion and  grandeur which Max exhibits.  The soundtrack will probably irritate most  viewers...much of the music sounds like nails scratching on a blackboard.   However, the soundtrack greatly adds to the story and accentuates  everything which Max experiences throughout the story.  Pi has some deep  concepts as well.  Many of us probably detested math, algebra and  trigonometry in high school.  Yet, Max explains mathematics as a form of  communciation in which everything can be expressed.  Too bad I never had  mathematics explained to me in this manner.  I might have shown more  interest in my homework.  Max's genius leads the viewer on a pathway to  hell as Max attempts to break the enigmatic code of &quot;216&quot;, and  fight for his life against Wall Street corporate thugs seeking his secrets,  and Ultra-Orthodox Hassidic Jews attempting to discover the secrets of God.   This is some deep stuff.  I strongly recommend the DVD version of Pi.  If  some of the material is too deep or cerebral, the Director's commentary  will answer many unresolved questions.  The deleted scenes are also an  added bonus.  Although definitely not for the mainstream movie fan, Pi  offers a great deal for the sophisticated viewer.
B000002UAU|5.0|There was no such thing as simul sync, or multi-track recording as we know it today.  Technically, had it all be done before?  Yes.  But as a body, this was the graduation ceremony that seperated the Beatles from a  &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now&quot; period in their short career.<br />I  always get a laugh from those who blast four of the most successful artists  of their time.  The fact that a couple of the below reviews blast this work  overlook the fact that it still generates millions in records sales every  year to new generations of listeners.<br />I've produced records for 30 years.   Oh, that Hill fella down below did it all and more?  Maybe he shoulda  tried rock n' roll.  I never heard of him.

B00000D9TQ|4.0|As a conservatory-trained musician, I have come to see some most impressive dimensions of Phil Collins' music. His rhythms are inventive and thoughtful, and many of his melodies are simple and transcendant in  structure. His albums always have a great sound - good engineering and  mixing, etc. <br />I like most of the tunes included on this album, and I  appreciate the inclusion of several songs that were written for movies,  etc. but have not been included on Phil Collins albums before.  <br />&quot;True Colors&quot; has a great sound and has become a personal  favorite. However, I was disappointed that as the new tune on this album it  was not a Phil Collins composed song. I'm also disappointed with the song  choice from the Both Sides album. &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Cannot  Turn Back the Years&quot; were worthy of inclusion over &quot;Both Sides of  the Story.&quot;<br />The only other problem with this album: Phil has written  so many great tunes that it probably required a double album to really be a  true, complete Greatest Hits album. Regardless, it is a wonderfully  reminiscent collection from an exceptional musician.
6302136105|4.0|I'm an Oliver Stone fan and a Doors fan so maybe I'm a little biased, but I thought 'The Doors' was an extremely entertaining movie.  It wasn't Stone's best picture, but it deserves 4 stars for Val Kilmer's performance  alone (I feel he should have been nominated for an Academy Award).  I have  no idea what Morrison was like in reality, but the man I've always imagined  him to be was captured to a tee in Kilmer's excellent portrayal. Warning to  biography hounds... this is a movie, and a pretty fun one to watch at that,  but its not a documenary. You shouldn't view this movie if you're  expectations are set on finding factual information.  The truth is, only  Morrison knew what was really going on in his head.  But if you're wanting  to check out an entertaining interpretation of the truth, give 'The Doors'  a try; it might expand your mind!!
0788811002|1.0|This sequel is as awful as Simba's Pride was good. The animation isn't convincing, neither is the music. But compared to the story this is only the tip of the iceberg. Even if you have only LIKED Pocahontas 1, do  yourself a favour and skip this one. Although I'm normally a big, big  Disney fan myself, in this case I can just wonder who approved this story.  What the hell happened to: &quot;No matter what happens to me, I will  always be with you - forever!&quot; And now Pocahontas falls in love with  John Ralfe, unbelievable!
6304288433|5.0|THIS IS  A SEQUAL TO ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILMS OF ALL TIME AND IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FIRST ONE YOU MUST SEE THE SECOND TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE PLOT..GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!5 **************************
6304711891|5.0|From the opening scene to the credits, this movie is non-stop entertainment!! Not only will it keep you on the edge of your seat with the visual images, the sound is unmatchable! If you watch this movie in  surround sound, you will be ducking bullets in your own living room!Best  action movie I have ever seen! Outstanding performances from Cage, Connery,  Harris, and Biehn. I watch this movie over and over, and never get sick of  it. Definately a must for all action buff's collections!!!!!
0780622650|4.0|First, let me say that its good to see an update to the old show.  Second, this is really a fun movie, its not a deep movie - it will not change your life, or cause you to have a religious experience.  That said, it has quite  a few things going for it.<br />Third, Gary Oldman is excellent as the  incomparably naughty Dr. Smith.  He lights up every scene he is in - and  &quot;steals&quot; every scene also.  His condescending tone to everyone,  particularly Matt LeBlanc's Major West is chillingly delicious.<br />Fourth,  the rest of the cast is very good, especially Mimi Rogers as Mrs. Robinson  and William Hurt as Dr. Robinson.<br />Fifth, the story is kind of goofy -  actually only the last quarter of the movie - the first three-quarters is  nicely done.<br />Sixth, the sets are very beautiful.  I particularly like the  design, both interior and exterior of the ship.  That ovoid theme is very  distinct.<br />Seventh, the special effects are the best I have seen in a  while; we have Angus Bickerton and Lauren Richie and their crew to thank  for this bounty.  Every effect appears perfect - and there are a lot of  effects!  I am guessing, but I think the effects were done with Silicon  Graphics Inc rendering software and hardware.  If true, then more movies  should be done with them.<br />Eighth, the DVD image is pristine, and we  require it so with so many top-flight special effects.<br />Ninth, the Dolby  Digital sound is every bit as pristine as the image. NOTE: this is a DVD  disc to use to evaluate equipment by,  and show off your equipment with.
6305265488|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting was great and I loved the story. It was very romantic and I highly recommend this movie.
0800137884|5.0|This is officially my favourite movie of all time. I am sure that if Keanu Reeves hadn't have been in it, it would have received far more oscar nominations. Suberb acting on all counts except Keanu and a beautiful love  story thrown in. If Dracula really looks like Gary Oldman then I'm  reiventing myself as a blood donor.
B000002KOQ|5.0|In retrospect, &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; lacks the cohesive feel of Mitchell's later work.  &quot;Court &amp; Spark&quot;, &quot;Summer Lawns&quot;, &quot;Hejira&quot; are classic works that really penetrate  when listened to as a whole.  They tell a story from Joni's always unique  perspective.  &quot;Ladies&quot; however is more of a collection of songs.   No real thread ties them all together except for maybe Joni's lamentations  on lost romance (the forlorn &quot;Willy&quot; and the doomed  &quot;Arrangement&quot;).  What &quot;Ladies&quot; does offer though is  some beautifully crafted songs and marvelous arrangements...spare yet lush.   The opening of &quot;Rainy Night House&quot; dazzles the listener with  Mitchell's exquisite piano-playing.  The piano is used here more than on  subsequent albums.  One wonders why she has almost abandonded it in later  years.  &quot;For Free&quot; confronts Joni's growing fame and fortune with  her need for anonymity and creative freedom.  I thinks its safe to say that  no matter how successful Joni has become, it did not hamper or debilitate  her creative side.  &quot;Ladies&quot; contains three standards: &quot;Big  Yellow Taxi&quot;, &quot;The Circle Game&quot; and &quot;Woodstock&quot;.  The coda to &quot;Woodstock&quot; is pure '60s psychedelia: Joni's voice  swooping and diving all over the place.  It's killer stuff.  And despite  it's age &quot;Woodstock&quot; never sounds dated at all. (The same cannot  be said for some of her mid '80's work:  you can hear the creaks in some of  that stuff.)  &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; is the perfect album to get  to know the music of Joni Mitchell.  It's agressive in the sense that she's  always pushing the envelope on tunings, arrangements, etc yet it still  remains one of her finest collections from her early years.

0451167716|1.0|How Francis Ford Coppola found the inspiration for his two masterpieces is beyond me. The Corleone saga became Shakespearean only in Coppola's hands. Puzo is a hack, like John Grisham or Anne Rice. Paramount sought to turn  this book into a cheap exploitation film, a crucial fact to ponder when  appreciating the novel's &quot;greatness.&quot; Name one other novel of  Puzo's that is even faintly memorable; chances are you cannot. He owes his  entire reputation and fortune to the (early) genius and ambition of  Coppola.

6300214028|4.0|Beatty has made a rather remarkable, extremely ambitious film. Due to its (necessary) length and the unwieldy subject matter, there are inevitable flaws; yet the strength of the performances (especially Nicholson's,  arguably his finest) make it moving and always interesting. For those who  wonder why so many intellectuals were drawn to communism, &quot;Reds&quot;  provides ample answers, as well as illustrating how Bolshevism evolved into  the nightmare of Stalinism. Beatty deserves all of the accolades he  received.

That is why I recommend South Saturn Delta and First Rays of the  New Rising Sun.  Pali Gap is a brilliant instrumental, supposedly recorded  impromptu when Jimi and his band continued jamming after recording Dolly  Dagger.  Lover Man is also a great song; Jimi changing the words but  basically keeping the music to his arrangement of BB King's Rock Me Baby,  which you can hear Jimi play at the Monterey Pop Festival.

B000002GYR|3.0|Have to say this is the album of Tom's I play least.  Wasn't realized well enough - - - sure, there's the classic &quot;Ol' 55&quot;, &quot;Old Shoes&quot;, &quot;Midnight Lullabye&quot;, &quot;Rosie&quot; and  &quot;Martha&quot;, but the style is cramped by a too omnipresent  orchestra, and the album seems too forced to make Waits  &quot;radio-friendly&quot;.  It's a good thing Waits lost Yester as a  producer and moved on to the much more compatible Howe for his second (and  much more recommended album) &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot;.   &quot;Closing Time&quot; is his first album, true, and does feature some  great songs, but I would have to recommed it for completists only.  Waits  is like good liquor or wine, I think . . .

B000001E29|4.0|Not an easy listen . . . loud and horrific and fragile and beautiful all at once . . . it has the madness and tendnerness of an e.e. cummings poem, had cummings gone the way of Poe.  Not a fan of Burroughs, the album  occasionally gets lost in its own self-conciousness, and is occasionally  self-indulgent (read Waits' &quot;artistic&quot; liner notes) . . . but at  its heart, it's just Waits, through and through, which deserves close to 5  stars, if not the whole.  Songs like &quot;The Briar and the Rose&quot;,  &quot;Lucky Day&quot; and &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; are harrowing  little folk tunes (one intentionally reminiscent of the ol' tune  &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;), and &quot;Russian Dance&quot; is a gloriously  sad instrumental, so aurally masterful, you can almost see a bunch of drunk  serfs dancing their miseries away.  A give-and-take album, but, as usual,  you always get more than you expect from Waits.   The many musicians give  their heartfelt all.  Worth the effort.
0792151720|5.0|Great costumes, great acting and great special effects. I liked the fact that they cast lesser known actors and actresses. I think this added a sort of &quot;freshness&quot; to it.

0385493800|3.0|This book should have been placed in the &quot;Religious&quot; section. The initial chapters were among the most compelling I've read in quite a while, but the pace fell off badly after that. While the premise was fairly  intriguing, the heavy-handed emphasis on religion spoiled it for me, and I  found the radical changes in the main character's attitude and motivations  highly implausible.

Seeing John  Prine in concert is like having a talk with an old friend who has been  through some bad times, but ultimately found happiness. Sort of.  He  remains a powerful figure in music, with &quot;Lost Dogs and Mixed  Blessing&quot; one of the great 20-years-after albums of all time.
6303036570|5.0|This movie was very well-made.  Al Pacino's portrayal of Carlito Brigante was excellent.  I highly recommend it!!!
B00000DFMM|5.0|This German band made one of the best albums to come out of the 80's in their genre of music.  They had a beautiful sound which to this day stands the test of time.  P-Machinery has never sounded better and Dream Within A  Dream is a timeless classic.  If you listen to the samples on Amazon and  think you're gonna like it, you almost assuredly will.  One other thing;  this album sounds twice as good at night.  I remember driving down Pacific  Coast Highway at midnight with no one else around and having a view of the  Pacific Ocean out my right window while I was listening to Dream Within A  Dream.  It's one of the few listening pleasures that I still remember to  this day.
6300182452|5.0|This movie, arguably one of the finest ever produced, is not only a re-examination of the Western genre but also a damning indictment of modern society.  Eastwood uses the familiar charcaters of the Western to tell a  deeper tale.  He exposes the hypocrisy inherent in our society by showing  the cowardice of the townspeople who are to afraid to act directly against  the villains.  The Stranger forces the townspeople to wallow in their own  degradation by forcing them to accept his increasingly harsh dictates in  return for protection.  Ultimately, the town(society) collapses because it  is unable to accept responsibility for its future.  As the Stranger rides  out of town, the midget asks him his name.  When the Stranger replies that  his name is already known, he is telling us that willfully turning our eyes  from the realities of our world is no defense from their consequences.
B000003CKH|5.0|This band has got to be one of my favorites and I was pleasantly surprised from the reviews on this site to see how many people agree with my opinion on them.  I'm very happy to know that Cake has such a devoted following,  because they absolutely deserve it.  They are one of the most original,  musically talented bands out there.  Listen to them once and you're hooked  for life.  I've found myself to listening to a CD by them three or four  times in a day!  And they never get old!  There are some very catchy songs  on this album.  Pick up their other CD's as well,  if you enjoy good music.
078322706X|5.0|The entire audience was enraptured with this movie. After three hours, the only disappointment was the movie had to end. Brad Pitt was phenomenal in wearing the face of death. Like Sense and Sensibility or Dangerous Liaisons  (another really spectacular movie), the subtleties were unfortunately  unappreciated by many.
B000000P11|5.0|This band was one of those rare gems that never got the attention of the masses.  Probably because instead of making great pop songs that sounded good on the radio, they made great music that one had to go beyond the  radio playlist to discover.  This album, Strange Times, captures The  Chameleons when they were at their zenith.  For those of you who feel  lonely or isolated, you'll swear this album was made especially for you.
1559408855|4.0|Savage, primitive, egoistic, racist and full of  wonderfully brutish and base imagery, this version of De Sade's infamous work is seeming to ask our own American government to ante up for its own silly, reckless, closeted  sexual antics and abuse of power. Not for the weak hearted or politically  naive.
0375707972|1.0|I really disliked this book.  This was described as a book which you could read in two nights yet it would haunt you for weeks afterwards. It took me many more than two nights to plod through this book.  I thought the style  was extremely dull and difficult to get through.  The only thing that  haunted me about this book was how truly bad it was.  The character of  Hanna as a war criminal turned child molester who jeopardizes her own trial  because she doesn't want to expose her lame secret is supposed to provoke  deep thoughts and discussions?  Please!
630518299X|5.0|Jim Carrey was brilliant in his role as Truman Burbank, the star of the Truman Show. This was Carrey's finest performance in his for the most part great career. (The Cable Guy stunk. Bad.) Without a doubt, the Truman Show  is the most original movie I have seen. (EDtv is a Truman Show wannabe)  Burbank was adopted by a tv corporation and had his entire life aired. The  ending is no surprise, but that doesn't stop the enjoyment. If you haven't  seen this movie, please do. You don't know what you're missing.
B000001DTM|5.0|We have all run into the problem of stale music. You find a good album, play it for a while and then it becomes dull and boring. This happens with albums from almost any artist. But &quot;Actung Baby&quot; will never fall  into the category of dull. The album is nearly  seven years old but still  sounds fresher than  most albums in the top 100. This is a masterpiece in  the truest sense. Every listen brings out new sounds which creates a  greater appreciation for the album's overall quality. &quot;Tryin' to throw  your arms around the world&quot; and  &quot;So Cruel&quot;are two of U2's  greatest ballads. Music fads and fashions will come and go but &quot;Actung  Baby&quot; will never grow old.
6304078145|4.0|The subtleties within the series of vignettes contained in this picture will be lost on the narrow-minded. The double-entendres and self-mocking performances of the cast are delightful and, given the egotistical natures  of many of its &quot;stars&quot;, are surprisingly funny rather than  overbearing. If one enjoys &quot;black comedy - a la 'The War of the  Roses'&quot;, one will get a kick out of this flick. I laughed til I cried.
6300151379|5.0|This is an excellent movie for children 7 ages and up.  My family has just discovered that it is no longer available at the video store (someone stole it).  It is about a young teenage girl who wishes away her bothersome  sibling only to have the magical characters of Jim Henson make her wishes  come true. David Bowie is excellent as the leader of the band of wicked  (Henson) kidnappers. Good vs. Evil, love and redemption, it's in Labyrinth.  Be careful what you wish for! Please, oh please, let this be re-released.  My children, ages 12, 9, and 7 years would be forever grateful.  DVD would  just be the best.
0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt delivers. The writing in &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is crisp and clear, and the story keeps the reader turning the page. Whoever awarded the Pulitzer for this book called the right shot.
B00000IBRX|5.0|The movie was great! It is filled with various emotions of what is life and how our lives touches others' lives as well.  The movie showed the power of life and love.  Overall, I believe the movie captured the  experiences we go through in life.  When we fall in love, family, children,  tough times and the good times of our lives.  To find eternal happiness in  loving each other is a dream come true.  We all have our destiny in life,  make the choice to live it to the fullest!
B000002HPV|5.0|After listening to Bjork's previous albums, I never thought she would be able to top herself. Homogenic proves me wrong. This is the sort of album that will be playing in your cd player for years to come. A must have for  any music lover.
6305128952|4.0|Hey guys, want to finally impress your wives/girlfriends and finally justify your costly DVD and &quot;home theatre&quot; set-up to them? Buy this DVD - they'll love you for it!
078401213X|2.0|Patterns are everywhere, true enough. Eighth grade mathematics class starts to reveal this to all but the most blind of children. An intriguing premise for a movie? Indeed. That (and all of the glowing Amazon reviews)  prompted my purchase of &quot;Pi&quot;. I must say that visually, the movie  is a treat, and I watched it all of the way through. It is a movie that  showcases the director's vision and abilities, but it is ultimately  nullified by a cast of characters that could easily be bested by the  literally two-dimensional troupe of &quot;South Park.&quot; My  recommendation to director Aronofsky: Remake the movie from the point that  the main character trepans himself... make the movie about the rediscovery  of his madness, make him more human. That &quot;Staring Into The Sun&quot;  bit is nowhere near enough.
6305095574|5.0|Sam Raimi made this super low budget horror,cult, film.It stars Bruce Cambell in his debut.It is very gory and stands up to its R rating but its a extremly scary welldone midnight horror flick
0783204914|5.0|This was the first Al Pachino movie I have ever seen,  and I fell in love with him, his acting was fantastic and it is no wonder he won the academy award for his acting. His protrayal of a recently blind &quot;war&quot;  hero,  it was classic. This bitter man stirs up all kind of emotions in us  as we see him shut everyone out of his life,  like his neice who takes care  of him despite the unkind treatment she  rechieves from him. But lets not  give Pacino all the credit because Chris O'Donnel was also really good. His  protrayal of a timid prep school student employed to watch a blind bitter  man for thanksgiving because he could not afford to go home, well it's  excellent,  which is saying alot considering he had to act with the  greatest actor.  Like come on no one can convince me that the hotel room  sence with the gun and the &quot;trial&quot; scene back at the school  weren't two of the most moving scenes in movie history. I truly think that  one could not have done it.  Well lets could you imageine this movie with  Leoardo DiCaprio,  and Dan Akrod instead,  yeah right.
0792151712|1.0|After seeing this movie in the theater I was called every name in the book by my sister,  well because she believe I was heartless because well SORRY girls I did not shed one tear! HELLO, we all knew what was going to happen.  SURPRISE! The boat sinks and a bunch of people die. Yeah sure that scene  with the mother reading to her kids good night boohoo what did you want to  see the kids and the mother fighting for their life, she showed to be the  most intelligent lady there.  I don't mean to sound heartless but to get my  emotions going I need alot more then DiCaprio's cardboard acting and boyish  good looks(agh!)and to keep me interested in a movie.  The only thing to  cry about is that I actually paid to see the movie. The one star is for  Kathy Bate's humorist protrayal of 'the unsinkable Molly Brown and Kate  Winslets strong move into American film. As for the Academy Awards is  concern any of the other four nominated movies were light years better(most  notably The Full Monty),  and Mr. DiCapio well what ever made you believe  that you should of been nominated. It was proberly young girls thinking  with their hormones and not their hearts.  This movie was nothing to get  excited about.  If you don't believe me then watch the Posiden Adventure  and decide for youself.  Also I am not 100% anti-DiCaprio he did turn in a  some what good performance in A Man in An Iron Mask.  If you think Kate  Winslett did a good job of the tragic victim of love then you should watch  Sense and Sensibility and Hamlet both of these movies were much better and  her performances in both were also much better then Titanic.  Don't get me  wrong I have nothing against a good cry I just didn't find it here.
0871137380|4.0|BHD is a truly harrpowing and deeply deatailed account, which runs the risk that the tight focus sometimes gives the impression there was more carnage than the final stats confirm, thus approximating one supposes the  combat experience on the ground.  The situation certainly gives food for  thought in the context of current US-led NATO actions.  I would have liked  the author to look at the disaster from the point of view of incremental  small events.  IF that first Ranger hadn't fallen, if his chalk hadn't  tried to evacuate him, would so many men have died?  The lesson of  lesadership here is not just that the staff decisions and mission planning  were faulty.  Some of the problems were self-created by the Rangers' creed:  like the airliner that crashed while the flight deck focused on an  insignificant trouble light, the Rangers' early attempt to evacuate a  wounded comrade was a key tactical decision which had it's own almost  inevitable role in the fatal knock-on consequences.
B000002HPV|5.0|its to new and refreshing and we dont need that . We need more music like eve 6 or brittany spears and anything on MTV. Im Being Sarcastical. Go Godder gooder!!!!
6302597544|5.0|AC/DC at their best.  Not only is the music and performance great but, the filming is excellent.  Check out the camera mounted under the stage on a movable track that looks up and follows Angus from the floor.  Check out  the camera angle from inside a Marshall stack. I could never count all the  cameras at this comcert.  A must see for the music and for the excellent  production quality. My neck still hurts.  And I love it..
B00000ICN5|5.0|This remastered CD puts a fresh face on Stevie's first studio albumn.  Great clarity and HUGE tone are the standard.  The great DT thunder-shuffle is clear and distinct (although the bass lines sometimes get mushy), and  Stevie's playing cuts through it all like a hot knife.<br />The bonus tracks  are great, and include 3 live cuts.<br />Thanks again to Sony, Epic, and  Jimmie.  RAVE ON!
B000001ESP|5.0|I'm one of the few Rush fans who believes their best efforts were in the '80's.  Sure 2112 was a milestone for them, but Moving Pictures, Signals and Grace Under Pressure were their best albums.  Beginning with Moving  Pictures, their musical maturity went beyond experimenting and into  knowingly producing complete music.  Peart is arguably the best pure  drummer of his generation; and I don't know of any other who can write with  his level of intellect.  If you want to listen to magic, check out how  Peart changes cadence, tempo and rhythm on Vital Signs, Limelight and Witch  Hunt.  For a real treat to their musical genius, get the Signals and Grace  Under Pressure CDs.
0060392584|5.0|Ok, I'll try not to say to much...this is the best book i have ever read, i bought it 2 weeks ago, i've read it 6 times, i dont want to sound like i'm obessed but i love this book and every time i read this book, i  understand this book more and more and i just love Marilyn Manson more and  more!!! this book is so amazing!!! The people who think its evil, are the  people who have the most reason to read it, it will change your mind so  much, it explains everything and all the stupid rumors about Marilyn  Manson!!! and their music F*CKING ROX!!!!!!!
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of being a Wallflower was a truly amazing book. I'm not much for reading, but I couldn't put this book down. It is basically a wonderfully written update to the Catcher in the Rye, but with many more twists in the  plot. I would definitely recommend this book.
0671027344|3.0|Very hilarious writing, very hilarious plot, my only complaint is that it was rather too hollow.  I mean, yup the morals were kind of messed up, and this book follows a boy who's just too unusual to understand.  Any hoot, a  fine introduction by MTV (the only reason why I read this book and how I  ever heard of it).
B000001E7T|5.0|An excellent album. Nothing more is to be said except that the guys that gave it bad reviews got it wrong: The man from Oregon bought a pirate cd, and the Jamaican misread the name and thought it was P. J. Marley... such a  weirdo!
6301236947|5.0|This movie illustrates all the good things that were brought to filmmaking through the influence of music videos in the 1980s. The sequences shot at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona are amazing. Cinematography by Jordan  Cronenweth is wonderful during those color sequences. The music is great  throughout.<br />Many people argue that MTV and music video directors hurt the  film industry by over popularizing fast cutting and flashy visuals ( at the  expense of content ) but this movie demonstrates how the best of music  video techniques really pushed the medium of film forward. I grew up in the  1980s and this movie is one of my favorites from that period. I would  recommend it to anyone.
0375707972|5.0|I can't believe how compassionate and sorry I felt for such a strong willed, sometimes disturbed, and finally SS Nazi worker woman, who came across so cold and obnoxious at times.Unless you read the book this would  be hard to understand. <br />Although I felt more pity than love for Hanna  especially through the court proceedings, I found myself really admiring  her after all the contributions she made in prison. <br />As naive as it  sounds, I was really hoping that Hanna would admit her illiteracy in court  and be able to go free. <br />I think Hanna never believed things would get so  out of hand leading to prison, but I think if she was to do it over..she  would do the same thing.<br />One area of the book I found difficult to  believe was that Hanna actually would send these girls that read to her to  their death just because they would expose her illiteracy. Maybe at this  point I was in denial because I felt so bad for her in this occupation. I  just wanted to think more of her. <br />Hanna could of truly contributed so  much more to the world if it was not for her illiteracy that caused a  series of negative chain reactions including her death. <br />I wonder how  Hanna's life would of been if she was literate!!   HAT'S OFF TO OPRAH !!
B00000AFGM|5.0|I am so pleased to hear this more pleasing sound of Manson. This album is GREAT! I LOVE &quot;The Great Big White World,&quot; &quot;Rock is Dead,&quot; &quot;Posthuman,&quot; and &quot;I Don't Like The Drugs.&quot;  I love it when the chicks in the background start singing! It cracks me up.  I didn't think that I would ever like Manson - but this album is good,  really good. Thank GOD that he changed.<br />Rating: A
0060977493|2.0|I dont understand why folks in india made such a big deal about this book. I think that is why many of us read it here becoz there was so much publicity given to it. I found it hard to remember the names  of the  characters and consequently did not know who was who while i read the book.  pb
B000001Y2U|2.0|I like the new glam-rock Manson much better. This music is so loud that all that you hear is a bunch of dischordant noises. &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; is excellent, but even that can't save this cd. Marilyn was  too homoerotic with the artwork, it is REALLY Satanistic, and well, it just  isn't that good. &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is perfect for him. Him and  his band sound fabulous. I truly hope that they stay that way. They should  never return to this phase. It's disgusting.
B000001FAU|5.0|This was the first Rainbow L.P. I ever heard, and I still think it is the best. Tarot Woman is a breathtaking opening track, and it gets better with each track. Of course the best Rock/Metal track of all time is on this L.P.  I mean Stargazer. (obviously) The album sleeve is also  very special, so  much so that I have a 16&quot; sqare oil painting of it hanging proudly in  my lounge. I believe that Ritchie was at his musical peak during this era,  and my only regret about Rainbow is that it looks increasingly unlikely  that they will tour again in the forseable future.
6303109950|3.0|I would have to agree with the majority of the respondents, that Val was incredible.  I heard he starved himself for a month to actually look like a TB victim.  Unfortunately for Val, he was the only believable character.   He also had the best lines, &quot;Frederick Fu__in' Chopin&quot;, &quot;I'm  your huckleberry&quot;, &quot;You're a daisy if you do&quot;, etc.  Russell  is lame, and overacts his part.  I think, no matter how frickin long it  was, Wyatt Earp (Costner's movie) was better, with the exception of the  performance of the actor playing Doc Holliday (although Dennis Quaid was  pretty fair himself).  This movie seemed to appeal to the younger MTV  generation, who grew up with the &quot;Gang Bangin&quot; mentality that  this movie seems to glorify!  Kilmer 5 stars, the rest of the movie 2  stars!!!
6304539282|5.0|I am the biggest STAR WARS fan in the universe. These are the best movies that have ever been made. I would like to thank George Lucas for making such great movies. (And to the wonderful STAR WARS authors of all the STAR   WARS books.) P.S.  I can't wait until THE PHANTOM MENACE comes out! Does  anyone know exactly WHEN they're going to come out? I'm dying to know!
0767827015|5.0|After seeing this movie, my best friends and I were speechless!  There was so much to think about.  None of us could comprehend the worries and issues that Tre and his friends dealt with on a daily basis.  I have a hard time  watching this movie now because of the way it tears at your heart!  Even  now, after seeing it a few times, I still sit for hours quietly, thinking  it over and over.  Singleton did an incredible job, and in my opinion,  deserved the Oscar.  In total disagreement with one of the other  respondents, I did not like this movie for the rap music and the cool cars!   I liked it for its great story and how &quot;deep&quot; (to borrow a line  from Ricky) it was!
B0000004V2|5.0|Just buy the damn album.  If you don't have this album by now, you are missing out on a phenomonal adventure through life.  Lyrics, Music, there are no flaws in this album.
630508999X|5.0|This movie is as good as the original Scream. The witty writer Kevin Williamson does another great job. Wes Craven, Neve Campbell and the rest of the cast do as good a job as they did in the original. Everyone should  see this movie. It doesn't get the credit it deserves.
B00000099Y|5.0|One of the few CD's that can actually bring me to tears.  It cries out to be listened to many times in succession. Some of the very best vocals singing some of the deepest and soulful lyrics of our time with incredibly  rocking tunes!!  We own and revere all of their music, but this CD is very  tight and mature.  The whole CD is really an artistic movement.  SEE THEM  LIVE!!! You will be transported.
6304675399|5.0|This film has an original story, great screen play, good directing, and a great cast. It is probably the scariest movie I have ever seen. I recomend it to anyone.
B00000I8UE|4.0|Cassandra Wilson replicates the yearning melancholy of Miles greatest tunes with this batch of covers and original tunes in Miles' style. Yet Cassandra gives each tune her personal touch. The mesmerizing high point is  Wilson's bluesy &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come.&quot; Also enjoyed her  cover of the great Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Time After Time&quot; (which Miles  recorded in the 80's). This CD is more cohesive than Two Moon Daughter and  ought to earn Wilson even more fans.
B000002JR8|5.0|when i listen to 5 minutes alone, i'm broken, and shedding skin, i just want to kick someone's a$$! Its unbelivable how pumped up this band gets you. I have much respect for Pantera and I hope to get to one of their  concerts over the summer. Keep on rockin!!!!
6304539258|5.0|George Lucus Dream brought to life. I am of of the million diehard fans for starwars because lucus had many limitations and made a brilliant movie. I list this as one of the classics. I recommend this to any one who as  never saw it(I write reviews for the Long Island Film Society and I am also  the founder)
0449000729|4.0|The first half of the book was excellent, but began to peter out as it progressed. You sensed that the author was trying to finish the second half as credibly as he could and the narrative drive of the tales slow down.
1560689986|5.0|It's a very intelligent film about Brian who is believed by the people of being the Messiah.
0553108034|5.0|George Martin has delivered a novel every bit as worthy as its predecessor. He picks up right where he left off, and there is not a want for more action, to say the least. He brings the characters to life, making  you feel you are a part of each one, or each one is a part of you. Although  each character has his or her own basic storyline to follow, he ties them  all together in a magnificent way. <br />One thing I would definitely  recommend, read A Game of Thrones again, to bring back a lot of those small  story details you might have trouble remembering otherwise. Of course, that  shouldn't be a problem for most folks, since the first novel in this set  was fantastic as well. <br />He relentlessly advances the story, without the  usual pitfalls some other authors find themselves trapped in. If there was  one thing I might have wished for in this book, it is only that it was a  whole heck of a lot longer! He has certainly not set the series up for a  conclusion anytime soon. <br />With magestic elements taking up a larger role  in this latest offering, you find yourself truly set in an age of heroes  and villians, triumphs and tragedies, magic and adventure. You will want  for nothing throughout this novel, except the next installment!
1559408855|4.0|Pasolini was murdered by one of the actors who played a captive.  After seeing this film you'll know why.
0375707972|4.0|I haven't taken the time to read a book for about three years.  When I started reading this one, I couldn't put it down.
6302814359|5.0|The two main charactors played by James Karen and Thom Matthews carry their over-the-top performances into Part 2.  I miss Linnea Quigley who did a great job as &quot;Trash&quot; in Part 1 and what's his name who played  &quot;Nedermeyer&quot; in Animal House.  Same basic plot line as Part 1  with a few of the best lines repeated; &quot;Watch your mouth if you like  this job!....LIKE THIS JOB!!?&quot; Lots of fun!  I wish I could find a  copy of Part 1 also.  A must see for horror/comedy cult fans.
0780622650|1.0|This was one of the first DVD's we rented. What a total waste compared to the great but campy TV series.  William Hurt must have been hard up as this is far below this actor's standards.  Consider the excellent movies he has  made in the past.  The entire movie was about as exciting as a turtle on  valium. The actor (?) who played to campy evil Dr. Smith was about as  exciting as a stale salad bar.  <br />It's a pity that the CD was read only.   I can think of hundreds of far more constructive things that could have  been put on it instead of this dreck.<br />What a shame it is that the lowest  rating that I could give this moviedisaster is one star.  That is really  being generous.
B0000062GE|4.0|Darkest Days is pretty good.  There are a couple of annoying songs in the middle-end where it's super mellow and, quite frankly, pretty boring.  (Drowning)But it's still a pretty good album.  Save yourself, you complete  me, tracks one and two are really good.
B000001Y42|4.0|Limp Bizkit combines the hip-hop funk guitar rock of bands like 311 and Zebrahead with the hard edged noise crunch of the new metal movement bands like Korn and Deftones.  Lead vocalist Fred Durst tries a little too hard  to show that he's down with the rap world (FRED, SHUT THE F--- UP!), and  the tunes start to duddly out in the second half, but this album is still  filled with loads of great booty-shakin', butt-kickin' noise.
B0000025RI|5.0|This album united rock with pop with soul.  Still fun to listen to.  &quot;Wanna be starting something&quot; and &quot;Lady in my life&quot; are the best tracks.
1573220485|1.0|All this talk about gen x'ers experiencing life second-hand, sampling what little is left from the emptied plates of bygone boomers, does not excuse (nor make a case for) characters drawn so thin as to defy the description  &quot;sketchy&quot; or, for that matter, any description at all. What can  one say about characters (lots of them) who remain utterly undistinguished  but for name and gender? That they are absolutely uniform in their shallow  banality? And that the cringe factor when they speak is utterly unmatched  in the literature of my experience, past or present? Or, perhaps, this was  Mr. Garland's intention? To portray vapidity by the avoidance of awareness?  Is the imitative fallacy no longer referred to at least once in each young  writer's education? Should a story about boredom(esp. a groundbreaking  experimental post-post-modern one) then be boring? Does a sly hatred of his  characters and an ironic awareness on the part of the author of just how  excrutiatingly measly they are, indeed, it all is...these days ...does this  pass for art? Maybe. Everyone seems to think so.
6301658795|1.0|I was looking for a video of these artists performing.  Instead, this is primarily a video showing scenes of Newport and apparent clips of   folk that were attending this event in various parts of town.  The music is in  the background and  there are scenes of artists performing.  After paying  what I paid for this video, and seeing what  was presented, I was totally  dissatisfied.  This video is like a tourist advertisement for Newport,  not  a jazz concert.
B00000IIXH|5.0|Springsteen strikes again and adds credibility to his already credible career.  It's amazing that such jems as &quot;Restless Nights, My Love will not let you down, Brothers under the bridges&quot;, did not wind up on  previous albums.  Tracks 18 will tie up The Boxed-set in a nice little  Taste of Rock-n-Roll Hall of famer Bruce springsteen.
6303461484|4.0|The cast is excellent in this movie.  It is a true story, and is more believable (mostly due to great acting by all involved) than most video verite.<br />This movie is worth buying even if you have not seen it.  You  will not be disappointed.
B000002OX7|5.0|This album defined my freshman year in college, and remains my ultimate &quot;desert island disc&quot;.  I've worn out two vinyl and one CD of it, and then bought the remastered CD.  The material is the strongest of the  Who's career, which is saying quite a lot, considering their catalog.  For  my money, &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; is not only the most apt  political song ever written, but the most powerful rock anthem of all time.   I bought the CD for my 17-year-old son, who is as crazy about it as I  was.<br />If you don't simply love this album, you just don't like rock.
0783228007|1.0|In between acting in Don Siegel's classic DIRTY HARRY and directing the stunning HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, Eastwood performed in the boring and bland JOE KIDD.  Director John Sturges, who had once helmed such classic action  pictures as BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, appears not to  have cared one bit about the film and directs sluggishly.  Even the action  scenes, what few there are, drag.  Eastwood's character is a pale version  of &quot;The Man With No Name&quot;; he goes through the motions of the  legendary persona, but without the mystique.  The picture has some pretty  location photography, and the climatic set-piece of a train crashing  through a saloon is quite clever (although completely out of place) but  ohterwise, JOE KIDD is a snore.  Clint completist only need apply -- the  appeal of a DVD edition may make them fork over the cash, but it'll  probably collect dust on the shelf.
B000002H2H|5.0|Although not as great as Master of Puppets, this is also wonderful. Buy, enjoy it, and LOVE THEIR 80'S STYLE.
B000002BE9|5.0|Can't wait for her next CD. I bought Fiona's TIDAL because I liked the cover and the 3 listening samples; never heard of her, or any of her work.  I've had the CD for about 3 months and she is the vehicle that led me to a  number of new (to my ears), very talented female  songwriting-singer-musicians.  Fiona is definitely one that searches her  soul and finds questions AND answers.  She and Natalie Umbruglia are the  best.
0425152251|5.0|For a starting the idea of this novel is great, because it's a mixture of a story with the most resumed history of philosofy, since greek philosofers up to contemporary philosofers. The story tells how a teenager discovers  the world around her taught by a philosofer that suddenly appears in her  life and teaches her not to live in the mediocrity of humanity, to delve  deeply in questions as who you are, or how the world began. This book is  great for teenagers because it helps them to think different and to analyse  all these types of questions and not to become into pragmatics.
6305291446|5.0|I HAVE ONLY TWO COMPLAINTS FOR THIS MOVIE.  1.  MICHAEL WAS TOO WEAK!!!  2.  THE ENDING!  MICHAEL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENDED THAT WAY.  My thoughts are that the screenwriters should make Keri Tate have hallucinated  everything after Michael was carried out on the stretcher.  She was  dilusional throughout the entire film anyway.  HALLOWEEN 8 BABY!!!!!
0060977493|5.0|I'm appalled with the review written by the woman describing it as being about &quot;the voodoo movement in India.&quot; Where was the substance for that comment? It was beautifully written. Every moment that I wasn't  reading it I was looking forward to picking it up again.
0440131480|5.0|Vonnegut's specialty is belittling the human race and he does it well in this book.  This book is full of Irony and absurdity.  If you like to question yourself, mankind, and your place in the world;  read this book.
6305268835|1.0|This movie is just plain not funny.  You would do well to buy something else.
B000002BYD|5.0|I bought Yield the Tuesday it came out, and it is still in my cd player. Stone and Mike are incredible throught this entire cd. Eddie is just Eddie as usual, which is an incredible singer. When I write reviews, I usually  point out specific good songs, but this does not apply to this album, it is  all good. Personal favorites include &quot;In Hiding&quot;, &quot;All Those  Yesterdays&quot;, &quot;Lowlight&quot;, and &quot;MFC&quot;. If you only  buy 1 cd, I would recommend this. This one is up there with Ten and Vs., no  doubt. Pearl Jam proves once again that they are the most incredible band  of the 90's.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Very few artists in a life time of the history in music have accomplished what Steve Ray Vaughan did in a short life. Stevie was a master. Stevie was an artist that played the guitar with such emotion and feeling that you  knew he was not holding back. At times it would seem like no one existed  around him while playing. He had the ability to draw you in with his music  and not let go.      His emotions , real emotions , were played to  everyone. Sometimes it was joy , other time it was complete agony. Each  time he played , it would not be different. Some of the things he did  boggeled my mind. I could not imagine how Stevie could play so fluent with  a guitar behind his head ; remenisent of Jimmi Hendrix. His playing ,  music, emotions would bring a tear to my eye and cause the hair on the back  of my neck to stand up.

B00000I924|5.0|JUST LISTEN...THIS IS A MORE TEXTURAL JEFF BECK ALBUM WITH ALL THE CLASSIC BECK DYNAMICS AND THE KIND OF GUITAR PLAYING ONLY JEFF BECK CAN GET AWAY WITH.
0393317552|4.0|yes, it was wordy and long. but it was a real page-turner; once I started, it was so fascinating I couldn't put it down until I had read the last word.  diamond weaves a compelling tale, because it belongs to all of us.   give it a try!
B000002BVN|3.0|This album just does not measure up because of the remixes and the songs Morphine and Superfly Sister.  Blood on the dance floor was an awesome song with a catchy beat.  Morphine was just not a good style for Michael Jackson  to use it just is not a style that I think works for him.  Superfly Sister  needs to go it seems to me Michael is trying some new styles I just hope he  knows that the styles for Morphine and Superfly Sister are not going to  help him with his future work.  Ghosts and Is it Scary are awesome songs  telling the press off for the false rumors and just straight up lies about  him.  This album is good to buy for Michael's devoted fans. I hope that  Michael's new album measure's up to Dangerous or the HIStory album.  I will  buy it because I am a devoted fan and have loved him since I was 3, but I  still want him to give me the best in entertainment in music.  I know he  can if he puts his heart in to it like he has on all of his past albums.
080013799X|5.0|bla bla bla its the best. bla bla bla i liked it
B00000269M|5.0|Bad is a really great album.  I guarantee anybody who buys this album will like at least 9 out of the 11 tracks.  The best is definetely Smooth Criminal.  This is one album that anybody who gives it a chance will  definetely like.  Michael could not have had a better follow up album to  Thriller than this,  it is a perfect transition to get to his new and even  better album Dangerous.  Michael believes that you get better not worst and  he has surely gotten better everytime.  HIStory was the best and then  Dangerous, Bad, Thriller, and then Off the wall.  I didn't count Blood on  the Dance floor because it is not a complete album, but still a good album.  If Michael ever reads this I want him to know that America still loves him  and he needs to tour here once again I promise he will sell out anywhere he  goes!  Trust me Michael!
6303421563|5.0|I've been in the US for 2,5 years watching movies 3-5 times a week, and still find &quot;The Professional&quot; as one of my favourates
B000002UAU|5.0|Five stars cannot express my love for this album. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.  I;m not going to descirbe my analysis of the album is detail.  That would need a page all its own.  All I'm going to say is that 'A Day in  the Life,' 'Fixing a Hole,' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,' 'She's Leaving  Home,' and 'Within You Without You' are brilliant beyond brilliant.
B000002H97|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourite albums. It has to be heard to be fully appreciated. Get it and you will not be disappointed.
0671027344|5.0|This is the best book I've read maybe ever.  And its the only book to ever make me cry.  Everyone must read this book.  It deserves to sell more copies than the Bible.
0780623703|5.0|This picture astounded me with its lavish visuals and incredible performances (particularly Tobey Maguire, William H. Macy, Jeff Daniels, and Joan Allen).  I had heard the bad reviews and the good reviews.  As  printed in Entertainment Weekly, Roger Ebert gave it an A+!  I didn't hear  his in-depth review of it, but I can agree that it was excellent.  I  especially love the scenes where they cross the black-and-white with color.   I don't want to give away any more of what the previews have, but now  since its on video, go rent it (or buy it when the price goes down),  although it was incredible to watch it in a theater.

6305171769|5.0|A dying franchise after some awful sequals, 3-6, Halloween H20 brings back life... and death into the series. It brings back everyone's favorite scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis as her highlighted film character of Laurie  Strode, the innocent sister of a homicidal maniac with a fetish for  mutilated teen carcasses. Unlike Freddy and Jason, Michael Myers is still a  worthy stalker, ( though I have to say Wes Craven's New Nightmare was a  superb film ). Also along with Jamie Lee's stunning performance and  revival, some new blood is drained in. Josh Hartnett is so-so, a reasonable  actor ( what the hel's with his hair!!!), Michelle Williams I like, but she  didn't have much of a character to experiment with. Jody Lynn O'Keefe (SP?)  had a shocking scene and had humorous lines, along with L.L. Cool J who was  much better than I had expected, and that Adam Hann Byrd guy, a bad actor  and ugh, he didn't fit into this film well. Oh well though.. he died.. so..  onto the next. Adam Arkin was great and his death was well played. But the  true shining parts were every moment of screen time with Jamie Lee curtis,  her 'Psycho' mother's appearance, Janet Leigh, and the return of the nurse  from the first and second. Those moments already give this film a five.  Also here's a tip, see one and two definately, 3 through 6.. well yo'll  regret it.
6300151379|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST CHILDREN'S MOVIE'S. NOT ONLY THAT BUT A FUN MOVIE FOR ALL AGES. I AM 16 AND I DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE UNTIL LAST SUMMER AT MY BROTHER'S HOUSE WITH HIM AND MY SISTER-IN-LAW!! THE COMPANY NEEDS TO  RE-RELEASE THIS MOVIE IT WILL MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY!!
B000001Y5D|5.0|This is the best album I've ever owned, but I need to correct something, the lead singer is not dead!!  Don't worry.  Her name is Linda Perry, and she has 2 (TWO!!!) solo albums which are both excellent.  In Flight and  After Hours.  Check them both out.  4 Non Blondes can also be found on a  lot of soundtracks(Waynes World 2, Airheads) and tributes(Encomium: A  tribute to Led Zepplin, If I Were A Carpenter: A Tribute to the  Carpenters).
0887307396|5.0|This is one of the most important business books written in the last decade.  The characteristics defined to select the most successful companies are excellent  measures of quantity and quality.  The key idea,  that success does not depend on having an early vision and charismatic  leaders but on identity, culture and commitment to the company steer us  into different paths for future success.  It places the focus, not only on  the executive team to set the tone, but on the hiring process and the  freedom people are given to create.  Executives who want their companies to  stand the test of time cannot hire people who are &quot;stalled&quot; or  foster a &quot;stalled&quot; culture.  I am acutely aware of this since I  just finished reading The 2,000 Percent Solution by Mitchell, Coles and  Metz, which describes these stalls.  The Bureaucracy Stall, for example  describes a company that held a meeting to discuss the fact that they hold  too many meetings!  The Unattractiveness Stall describes a company that had  huge excess waste and no one worked on the problem because the waste had a  bad odor!  Many companies today are not learning how to take advantage of  the Internet, because they don't think it will effect their business much!.   This is The Disbelief Stall   Breaking down these stalls and developing a  culture and identity to solve problems and make progress will result in  success at many times what the historical trend has been.  These companies  do not make continuous but slow improvements.  These companies will know  how to jump to a new level.  They will define how business is done, who  will lead and how much progress can be achieved.  Read Built To Last to  understand the lessons of the past and the direction for the future.  Read  The 2,000 Percent Solution to learn how to incorporate these directions  with a practical process to recreate or approach the ideal way to do what  you do, freeing up time and resources to do so much more.
6300151379|5.0|I love this movie. Only movie i really like with David Bowie in it.Great acting..and i ever got bored with this movie. I hope that it comes back out soon cause i would love to own it.And has great music..i have the  soundtrack.
0385493800|5.0|It's a little unusual for a book to be thought-provoking and fun to read at the same time, but this book is both!<br />Lot's of adventure and suspense.  A good look at life...as it is and as it could be.
6303213650|3.0|Jennifer Jason Leigh is so amazing in this movie. This movie tries to be one of those old screwball comedies from the 30's and 40's. It does it very well and Jennifer Jason Leigh does it perfectly. Her intelligent, loud,  deep-voice, fast-talking, wise-cracking, head-strong character reminded me  so much of Katharine Hepburn in films like &quot;Holiday&quot; and  &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. She even got the accent right. I  thought there could never be another Katharine Hepburn, but Jennifer Jason  Leigh has almost nailed it. Amazing! Who would have thought that that young  blond actress from &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; would have come  so far? I'm really impressed.
6301942647|4.0|'Dreams' is a strange film consisted of a number of short stories. At first, one might thought that Kurosawa was going to incorporate Japanese myths and legends as the theme of the composition (with the eerie 'Sunshine  through the rain' or even the rather modern 'Blizzard' episode of the  film), but as Kurosawa moved his composition further into the film, the  theme of LIFE emerged. Though he touched a rather bizarre combination of  questions in the different stories (some of them does sometimes seem out of  place, though this may be the case if the study of life was what he was  analyzing), Kurosawa was interested in the idea of life being 'short': not  eternal. From dead peach trees that lead to the discovery of a new one,  proposed suicide of a child, ideas of death and its appropriateness with  age, all the way to notion of death being inevitable, thus should be  celebrated (the last narrative of the film), this is a very complex study  for understanding the futile attempts of humans trying to improve life  through inhuman technologies, and a lesson in viewing the ambiguity of life  and its end. By the way, Scorcese's appearance in the film proved to be  quite interesting.
B000002KYB|5.0|Love over Gold has been one of my favorite records for more than 15 years - I still also own the vinyl version. This is easily the best CD ever recorded by Dire Straits and I don't get tired listening to it. Whenever I  am in need of relaxation, this album does it for me. In my perception a  definite must for fans of expressive music.
630264366X|5.0|Like Ian Smyth from Australia, I think this is an outstanding movie and should be viewd by all those who were too young or not born yet during WWII. I have shown it to everyone who comes for a visit and all of my  friends, family etc.  There are those in this world who think the Vatican  did nothing during the war, not so as the picture shows.  And there where  many others who in their own way risked their lives to do the same.  For  me, it is a 10 Star movie!
6305229449|5.0|I like the part where the bad guys are down in the snow and they come back up again and when Mulan kills the master of the bad guys.  I like when Mulan gets back to her daddy with a necklace and a sword.  I like when  Mulan gets her dad's armor on and gets into the army and she pretends to be  a boy and nobody knows it.  She's pretty and she's strong... that's what I  like about it.  Everybody should buy it because then they could have it in  their home and be happy and watch it and keep it.
0385493800|1.0|I have read all of Grisham's books.  This one, in my opinion, is not of the same caliber as previous books.  The characters are weak.  There does not seem to be a clear direction for the story line. It is like the author  has been &quot;reborn&quot; and this is an attempt to incorporate these  beliefs into a best selling novel.  I will certainly wait before purchasing  his next novel until readers have shared their opinions.
6300274195|5.0|My 3 year old LOVES this movie.  She had never yet known what a circus was, but we took her for the first time last week after she wouldn't stop talking about this movie and the elephants, giraffes etc. While the film  has a few very emotional scenes, it has been great to see my daughter  understand how people (&amp; animals) have feelings by the way you treat  them.  She is much more loving toward our dog now and talks to him like a  person.  We have about 15 Disney movies and given her choice, it's always  Dumbo, Little Mermaid, Lady &amp; the Tramp and the Aristocats.
B0000046PE|5.0|This C.D. set is one of the finest I've ever heard. I borrowed it initially from a friend, and listened again and again. I don't think I can tire of Ella Fitzgerald.
0375707972|3.0|I have read most of the Oprah book choices and have enjoyed most.  This one is an easy read and gives some food for thought.  Since I am able to pass the book on to other's who are interested in reading it I don't mind  the expense...otherwise I would have to agree with the reviewers who  suggested getting it at the library rather than buying it.  <br />Personally I  believe anything I read is beneficial if for no other reason than it makes  me think.
B00000I924|4.0|My favourite Jeff Beck recordings have always taken a little bit longer to sink in,and this one in most part is no exception! Of course Angel , Declan and Another Place are archingly beautiful and plaintive, anyone who loves  unique tone and gorgeous melancholy will fall for them.Tracks 1-5 &amp; 7  have got me dancing around like a mad idiot at the moment so it will take a  bit longer for these to really sink in,I just have to let the body burn off  some of this Beck induced manic energy.Tracks 8-9 are a bit underdone in  writing and arrangement,with a bit more of an oblique perspective,something  further could have been done with those two.The inside photo of Jeff and  that great looking Bulldog says it all, Jeffs' eyes speak from the soul,for  which I am respectful.
6304298285|4.0|The characters where great and fun,as the story.Very charming,emotive and completly funny.A Hollywood style great movie.A new concept of Coppola's films.It's cliched but enjoyful.
0553502271|5.0|A wonderful story with a lot of starch in it and obviously a lot of research went into the story.<br />By far his best.
B0000042BZ|5.0|This video is not Rigoletto at Verona, it is the opera produced as a film in Mantua, the actual setting of the opera.  The town, the river, and the splendid ducal palace are the settings for what is really a gorgeous and  thrilling production.  In addition to Pavarotti as the duke, the cast  features Ingmar Wixell as a superb Rigoletto and Edita Gruberova as an  ethereal and convincing Gilda.  The horrors of the story are powerfully and  movingly played out through tremendous singing and a terrific production  job. Fabulous, and haunting.
0375707972|1.0|Boring!  I am an avid reader who has read--and enjoyed--nearly every Oprah pick.  However, I can't understand how this book was chosen.  The first half of the book trudged along, while the second half was completely  unbelievable.  When I finally realized that Hannah's true  &quot;secret&quot; was that she couldn't read, I thought, &quot;So  What?&quot; I think the main problem was that the characters were so  two-dimensional that it was difficult to care about their dilemmas.  I  actually had 20 pages to go, and I never did finish reading this.  The  moral of the story: Don't assume an Oprah book is a great book--she makes  mistakes too!
0783216084|5.0|Jaws is the best movie ever!  The first time I saw it I was 11, and I was terrified!  I was crying, and I had to sleep in my mom's bed with her.  I must have woken up ten times during the night because of nightmares!  But  when I finally woke up in the morning, I thought it was the best movie that  I had ever seen.  It is so amazingly scary, but don't worry, it is great.   If you haven't seen it you are really missing out!  See it!
B000002JS6|5.0|To all True Believers. This is one of three necessary albums for all those who call themselves AC/DC fans. The other two are Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. Rock On!
6304639457|4.0|Well, first of all, where is Stand Back?  It could have taken the place of Bleed To Love Her, or Go Insane. I have no clue why Lindsey brought his solo stuff into the reunion tour.  Stevie, on the other hand, made Sweet  Girl perfect for Fleetwood Mac.  On the other hand, it could have been a  little more like her demo version.  GDW ROCKED!!!!!  Dreams was a little  corny, and Temporary One was ok.  Tusk was good, but they should have  included Not That Funny...It was a number 1 live hit in the 70;s, so why  didnt they include it?  I LOVE SILVER SPRINGS!!  That is the highlight of  the whole video.  Rhiannon was cheesy at the beginning...they should have  used that time at the end, to make it like the version on the Fleetwood Mac  Live album of 1980.  But it still was good...who said that old foogies cant  sing?
B000001DYY|5.0|No long-winded review here. This record moves me as few records do. I never want it to end.
6304466498|5.0|From &quot;Barf, give me a reading&quot; to &quot;I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate,&quot; this movie is hilarious. Every line has a purpose, and you have got to watch and love this movie.
6300183513|5.0|Rear Window it at the top of my most liked movies list. It is the perfect suspense story. Jimmy Stewart stuck in his apartment in a wheelchair with his leg in a cast and nothing to do but spy on his neighbors to pass the  time makes a most interesting background for murder. I also have been  wanting to obtain a copy of my own.
0385493800|2.0|Not up to Grisham's earlier efforts. None of the usual plot intricacies which have marked his other books. The main character was interesting but neither he nor any of the others were as developed as I would have liked. I  felt the book &quot;stopped&quot; rather than ended. Very unsatisfying.
B000002RXS|5.0|There are several great versions of Carmen.  Others include de los Angeles and Beecham, Maazel with Domingo and Maginnes, and even the old recording with Fritz Reiner has something to recommend it.  However, this recording  has to be on the top of any list.<br />The role fits Callas to a T.  Pretre  does a wonderful job conducting, and Gedda is excellent.  But it is Callas'  ability to get into the skin of the character and radiate Carmen's  sexuality and unpredictability, as well as her despair and desparation,  that makes this version special.<br />So if you want to own just one  version, and you must have the finest modern sound, get the Maazel.  On the  other hand, if you want the most interesting conducting, get the Beecham.  But if you want the most interesting Carmen, get this one.  Serious opera  lovers who understand that the fullest appreciation of a work comes from  hearing different excellent versions will eventually buy all three.
6305308659|5.0|I watched Pleasantville not expecting too much, and so I was delightfully surprised to see such a hip, knowing, intelligent, and just FUN movie. I don't really care what people say about the heavy-handedness of the  symbolism, it definitely worked for me. I am guessing it will be mostly  political conservatives who dislike this movie, since they so fondly  remember the &quot;family values&quot; of the 50's while totally  disregarding the concomitant social problems, inequality, and prejudice of  that era. Still, this movie is not contemptuous of that decade, and does  not at all favor &quot;now&quot; over &quot;then.&quot; Rather, the  director Gary Ross casts a revealing light on the 1990s and 1950s in order  to say, &quot;Look, things may suck now, but the 'perfect' '50s were better  in some ways but worse in others.&quot; People who are nostalgic for that  era, and look back on that decade with rose filtered glasses (and this is,  perhaps coincidentally, one of the symbols of the movie), will no doubt  dislike the central message of the film (like David Lynch, Gary Ross seems  to be peering at the dark side that hides in the &quot;perfection&quot; of  the suburbs, or in this case, in a 1950s TV family similar to Leave it to  Beaver).  Similar to the Truman Show, the film is saying that the cost of a  &quot;perfect&quot; society (i.e., socialism) is freedom. And, like in the  Truman Show, the main characters long for freedom and will always choose  freedom over a &quot;perfection&quot; that was just an illusion to begin  with.<br />Pleasantville is a film, like the Truman Show, that rewards  multiple viewings. The DVD is exceptionally good, and proves that New Line  continues to lead the pack in producing quality DVDs (unlike, say,  Paramount). I for one cannot wait for David Ross's next picture, and hope  it is as much a labor of love as Pleasantville obviously was.
0345350499|5.0|Excelent book, the best by this author.  The book is SO good, you might never want to finish it.  If a book could have a soul, this one would have an enlightened one.  Don't miss the glorious experience of reading a really  fine book. Buy this book now I tell you, it may be what your doctor wanted  to prescribe agaist dullness.
0783233477|5.0|I had high expectations for Meet Joe Black and I have to say they were fulfiled after seeing the movie.  If you enjoy good acting, a great romantic and comedic storyline, then this you will like this film.  I have  to admit that at times the film tended to get a little long, but just as it  starts to drag something comes along to pick up the storyline with a new  twist.  If you can get through the film, the finale will leave you in  goosebumps.  You won't be dissapointed.
6302877849|5.0|A fan of action films will undoubtedly side with The Road Warrior as an all-time great.  And that person would not be wrong in doing so, either.  In  my opinion, The Road Warrior stands beside Hard-Boiled as the greatest  of all action movies.<br />But I think what so many people fail to consciously  recognize is how The Road Warrior stands the test of time not just as an  action film, but as a film, a term which is not limited to genres and  categories.  The Road Warrior transcends the conventional action film by  creating a completely believable setting of the cliched post-apocalyptic  world.  The setting is imperative in a film like this; and Max's world of  roads and desert wastelands is as believable as the far more popular one  that happened &quot;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far  away....&quot;<br />The Road Warrior is not to be missed, not only by action  fans, but film fans.
B00000AFHM|5.0|One of the best albums of the year - a friend introduced me to this band and they have been on my CD player ever since. Laid back melodic music with fantastic vocals. Different and highly recommended.
B000002B5L|2.0|I was expecting a great deal more.  For the most part the album is one-dimensional.  The drum-tracks are void of authenticity which evokes memories of karoke-night.  The music numbed me to sleep to the point that  if there is a message on this album I certainly missed it.<br />I would rather  hear Wyclef pick up the guitar more, and hear greater input from Lauryn  vocally.<br />After all the hype, and Lauryn Hill's Miseducation album, I come  away from this one feeling very disappointed.  I hope Lauryn has  established herself where she will not have to resort to this type of  mundane production.  Let's face it; the two best songs on the album are  covers.
B000002L9M|5.0|Depeche mode has got to be the coolest band on earth! Very experimental which works excellently
B000002572|5.0|What can you say about an album that you can literally remember where you were when you first heard it?  This classic rock masterpiece has so much substance that it is not only a great achievement in the history of music  but it has become legendary as well.  Tom Scholz and Brad Delp are a  perfect match.  Soaring guitars and crystal clear vocals make this album a  must have. Listen to the record and slip away. DC, Austin, TX

6305265488|5.0|The sheer volume of reviews for &quot;Ever After&quot; will tell you of its popularity.  I am a 41 year old mother of two children.  I actually saw it in the theatre twice before purchasing the film.  It's one of those  movies that, when it's over, you feel great inside.  This particular  Cinderella reinforces some valuable lessons to women and girls of all ages,  including the need to find your happiness within and the importance of  never relying on someone else to make your life better. For all of the bad  breaks this young girl had in her life, she maintained an incredible  outlook and an unrelenting kindness toward others.  It's always nice to see  the good guys (or, in this case, girl) win.  I recommend this heart warming  story for all ages.
B000002IKR|5.0|This is a great CD with great guitar riffs but it sounds like they're recording it in a bathroom.
6305308659|1.0|Hate me if you will but I hated Pleasantville. <br />I didn't think this film was for entertainment at all. It felt like a political brow beating. To say that being immoral will better your lives is just the sinners way of  justifying their own bad choices. Now I don't have to agree with the  ideology and morals of a movie to enjoy it or appreciate the message or  statement but this film and story was so flawed in it's delivery that I  found it to be of very little worth. <br />If I really expected all films to  match my own personal beliefs or convictions in order to enjoy them, I'd  probably not like very many films. I know that there are many lifestyles  other than my own. I expect to be shocked, scared, enlightened and  otherwise affected when seeing a movie. In the instance of Pleasantville, I  was simply insulted. <br />Masturbating will make me a better person, huh?  Having rampant sex will enrich my life while remaining morally clean means  I'm a hate monger and my life is drab? Please. <br />The film depicts people  who are in black and white until they show their &quot;true colors&quot;  and experience a new emotion. Usually one that is completely out of  character for them. This is literal as all of the people ARE characters in  a sterile 50's tv show. There's a major flaw in this concept played out on  the screen. Once Joan Allen turns color after discovering that her husband  isn't needed for sexual gratification, she is chased around and taunted by  some boys who remain black and white despite this current action. The towns  mayor turns color after emitting anger and hate. Why then did these boys  not turn color when they were acting out their emotions? They weren't  exactly living up to the standards of Pleasantville. And what about the  rest of the towns people who stood in judgement of the &quot;colored&quot;  people. Are these not converse emotions as well? <br />Parallels are attempted  to be drawn between the treatment of the now &quot;colored&quot; people in  the film and the actual colored people from the same era in our real  history. This is not accurate. In the film, it was the immoral acts and  sins of the people that brought about a change in them, making them appear  in full color. They were persecuted and even kept out of certain  establishments. In real life, it was not the behavior of colored people  that brought about the bigotry. It was the ignorance and hatred of others  projected on a whole race, regardless of their morals or behavior. To  attempt a comparison of the two is asinine.  <br />This movie was just an  attempt to give a stamp of approval to doing whatever you want as long as  it &quot;feels good&quot;. <br />I may be taking this a bit far but if you  really enjoyed this movie, perhaps you should look at your own life. Did  you enjoy it because it gave validity to your own follies? Because it says  that to be morally clean is a bad thing and, if you believe that, you won't  have to face the fact that is wrong? Think about it. <br />If you liked  Pleasantville and didn't like this review, consider  this: Gary Ross wrote  something that is dear to his heart and he spoke his mind. I too wrote  something that is dear to my heart and I spoke my mind. I too hope to make  films one day. When I do, they'll reflect a part of me. Some you'll like,  some you won't. But that's what movies are all about. Pleasantville  deserved to be made as does every film. I look forward to Gary's other  ventures as a director. He did a fantastic job of bringing Pleasantville to  the screen and the message was loud and clear. <br />Until next time, I remain  in black and white, and I still love you. Wait, does love make me  technicolor worthy? Let me know. I may change hue yet.
014028009X|5.0|I found the connection between Pride &amp; Bridget Jones' only after I sat grinning as I pondered the last chapter.  I received the same warm, cozy, I'm-not-the-only-one-out-there kind of feeling as I did when I read of  Elizabeth and her stony faced soul mate.  The parallels began with the  introduction of the stand-off'ish new Mr. Darcy, and continue throughout  the book, ending with, well, let's just say Eliza, I mean Bridget finds her  Darcy to be quite a savior... Austen fans will know :  )  Bridget Jones is  a heroine of the best type - she seems real.  While some people may not  enjoy her self loathing or manic attitudes about weight loss and her  compulsive nicotine habit, I welcome you to take a few steps back and tell  me you don't know at least one woman who shares her traits.  Helen has  given us Jane Austen in the Ally McBeal - Demi Moore - Cindy Crawford world  we live in....THANK YOU HELEN / JANE!
0345363132|5.0|This was my first adventure with this author -- and I am hooked.  It was difficult to put this book down. The characterization was incredible.  She presented a credible and sympathetic view of one of the most maligned  historical personages (in this book's view).  My only experience with King  Richard is through Shakespeare's Richard the Third. Frankly, I'll take Ms.  Penman's view.  I have already begun another novel by this author.  Cannot  wait to read more!
0606001743|1.0|I wouldn't even give this book 1 star. IT was horrible. IT was boring. IT was over-exaggerated. It is total communist propaganda. John Steinbeck was a communist and he is trying to infest our lives with his ideals by making  everyone hate owners, and want to strive toward a collective society.
B000002VTE|5.0|From what I've heard from other people who have listened to Spiritualized's music, they either love it or loathe it.  This is unquestionably my favorite Spiritualized album.  It's the first album I  purchased of theirs, and I still think it's superior to their previous  efforts.  It may be described as repetitive, but it's never monotonous.   The title &quot;..floating in space&quot; suits it perfectly.  It's  overwhelmingly vast (it could fill the universe) and still hits hard.   Whether you want the blues-y mellow feel of Cop Shoot Cop.. or the choral  Cool Waves or the foot-tappin I Think I'm In Love, this album retains its  beauty throughout (aside from The Individual which I always have to skip  over).  I love Jason Pierce's voice also; it fits the songs perfectly.
B000000OSW|5.0|I'll avoid the trap of defining old-versus-new Peter styles, but I will say that this is Peter at his most mature, intelligent and compelling.  What made the album so important then, and still now, is its effortless  ability to synthesize the cerebral and the emotional within its themes of  interpersonal relationship.  Moreso than Gabriel's other albums, 'Us' is a  complete journey, almost a narrative, that allows the listener to fully  interact with the landscape of desire, affection, loss and redemption that  it explores.
0375707972|5.0|This was a powerful and thought provoking novel, particularly in light of what is currently happening in the Balkans. After reading this novel, I remain haunted by its themes of the shame, guilt, and numbness felt by  those dealing with the aftermath of genocide.
B000000WCV|4.0|So a lot of people in house and techno these days are starting to complain about stagnation and unoriginality.  Whatever.  For music that depends on sampling, that could be a death knell.  Daft Punk succeeds at poking fun at  precisely that kind of diatribe, and creating an album that's at the same  time super-high-camp/retro-kitsch and compellingly psychotropic listening.  The Parisian scene is rife with artists (Air, Dmitri from Paris) that seem  to be having a grand old time poking around the cultural machine that we  call 'nostalgia' while giving us something to shake it to at the same time.  'Homework' isn't the best techno or house album of the past few years.  What's great about it, is in reinterpreting the joys of disco through  electronic sensibilities, Daft Punk contextualizes the house and techno of  the past few years, against a broader background that has been the dance  music of this half of the century. 'Homework' is not about the specific  locus of this year, or the  past few years, but how much this particular  place we inhabit owes to the old school.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I guess what some people call contrived I call sheer unabashed musicality. A rich dosage of a great American songwriter.
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coehlo is an excellent author who takes his readers on a spiritual journey.  This book makes you feel better about yourself and the possibilities before you.  It shows you that no mountain is too tall to  climb, no obstacle to difficult to surmount.  Read it if you want to live  better.
0679737456|3.0|I have to say, Carey is a good author, but this work was slightly boring, and &quot;cheesy&quot;. Not a book I would tell a friend to avoid, but also not one I'd tell them to read right away. If you are looking for a high  school growing up story, this is probably a good choice for you.
B000000P17|5.0|this is a great album. I dont know what all the fuss is about. it's a tribute to all the great punk bands of the seventies. I love It!!! the last &quot;hidden&quot; track alone is worth  paying for this masterpiece!!!
0307120007|5.0|What a sweet, charming classic! Simple pictures. soft textures. Worth every penny! The baby you know would thank you!
0451160916|5.0|You could picture it all in your mind.  I could see the mallet swinging.  Smashing the (bone. blood.) walls.  Do not read at night.  I could hardly sleep for fear of evil monsters.  My house isn't an inhuman place that  makes human monsters but none the less I was quaking all the way through.   Read it during the day if you scare easily but read another book at night.   That way you don't lie awake thinking of redrum.  And most of all, do NOT  read it in the bathtub.  You will be afraid to close both eyes at the same  time.  King described the dead people in the bathtub most vividly of all so  you'd know what I mean.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|Emma goes riding.  Emma shoots.  Emma gets stuck in a bog and is rescued.  If Emma had such an exciting life, she would not have needed to try to mold Harriet.  Gwyneth Paltrow delivers an adequate performance, but  demonstrates that she is entirely clueless about the humor in Austen's only  decent novel.
6305001200|5.0|This is the best movie ever made. I see it at least once a week. It is about a very coolboy named Danny who fell in love with a goody-goody girl. Everybody should see this movie.
0440219078|5.0|I really liked this book, for a couple of reasons.  One is that it subtly incorporates the concept of traditions and urban legends.  Because this community didn't have any folklore, just rules and regulations, there was  nothing to tie the community together.  The only reason why the community  felt any connection was because they were ingrained with the sense that  they were a part of the community since they were born.  But what community  were they really apart of?  Without the stories that are passed down from  generation to generation, there is no real link.  There are superficial  links, necessary for order and survival, but when you come right down to  it, there is nothing.  This book reminds us of that, and teaches us to not  take our roots for granted.  The other thing I like about The Giver is that  it makes the reader pause and reflect on his or her own life.  What would  we do if we didn't have any choices, not even what we eat for breakfast?  I  for one would go crazy.  It makes us appreciate the choices we have in  life, even the ones we really don't want to make.
6305342776|4.0|Finally the Black Hole returns!  No more trying to steal old VHS copies from the video store or transfer tape to tape.  The visuals are stunning, the music is awesome and the story, just so so.  Buy it NOW!
B000007OY0|5.0|I think the key message in this movie is that our legal/penal system is not perfect and innocent people have been and currently are put into jail. It raises all kinds of moral and ethical questions, and should get you  thinking about everything from how the American penal system does not help  to rehabilitate prisoners to the moral issues surrounding the death  penalty. And all of these thoughts are triggered by a beautifully acted and  directed film. I think like &quot;It's a beautiful life,&quot; this movie  is way ahead of its time and will be fully appreciated by future  generations and not completely appreciated by our own.
B0000027I6|5.0|Amused to Death develops the concept of televised war as entertainment, including the power and danger of television. It's infused with a great sense of irony and an occasional bitter humor. If you can ignore such lyrical gaffes as &quot;She had almond eyes / she had yellow thighs&quot; (from &quot;Watching TV&quot;) -- pornography apparently seemed the only approach available for writing about the Tiananmen Square massacre -- and Waters's tendency towards bombast and melodic repetition, there are insights here, and some touching songs as well. Ironically, the album's best and most powerful song, &quot;Three Wishes&quot;, isn't political at all (OK, there's a quip about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict).<br /><br /> By the way, if you're looking for Marshall McLuhan references, look elsewhere. Neil Postman's book Amusing Ourselves To Death doesn't seem to have been as influential on this album as Roger claimed.
B000000ISM|5.0|This is simply the best rock album ever made! Everything is just perfect: sound, production, vibe...DEF LEPPARD WILL REMAIN AS THE GREATEST ROCK BAND EVER
6300214419|4.0|Although this is a movie about a relationship which was impossible to carry out (both were married), you could see and feel the love and tenderness they felt for each other.  Love knows no boundaries and as time  went by they conquered all their feelings and found each other again,  knowing that this time they could be together and nobody or nothing would  be in their way.
6303855466|5.0|I sometimes think professional reviewers are overly serious - they rarely give top ratings to comedies.  In this case, Maltin appears to have totally missed the point.  Although there is a light hearted approach to the  situation, it is basically about a community coming together on a project  to save something which is enormously important to their sense of self.   While we do not see the horrors of World War I, it is definitely a factor  in setting the story, since, as the narrator says, the project might not  have happened if it the war and its losses were not threatening the very  existence of the villagers' world. The humor in this movie is situational  and develops largely from the quirks of the characters.  It is well-played  all around. As for the accents, if you can understand PBS British imports,  this one will cause no problem.  The Welsh accent is musical, and is easier  to follow here than some Irish accents.
0788812408|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was when I was eight years old. I can remember being in Disney World and seeing a preview for it in one of the stores and trying deperately to remember the words to Part of Your World.  Now I'm eighteen and just watched it again last weekend. It's a great film  and one I know that both boys and girls enjoy. I highly recommend this  Disney Classic.
0671665707|4.0|After reading Wiseguy, I thought I would never be satisfied by another true-life mafia book again.  Leave it to Pileggi to prove me wrong.  Casino is not as good a book as Wiseguy, but I enjoyed hearing the story from many  different sources (ie. Mafia team-members, FBI men, acquaintances).  This  helped to remind me that these were real people and these things were  really happening.  I don't believe that &quot;Lefty&quot; was an angel, and  the testimonies by other people reinforced that belief.  It's a shame that  someone of such ability could sink so low in life and be treated like such  a pariah for who he did business with.  Allen Glick is another character  that I was glad to learn more about after the ensuing scandal.  Tony  Spilotro got his come-uppance as should have been expected.  If real-life  crime fascinates you, Nicholas Pileggi is the author for you.
6300274268|5.0|I had seen this movie before when I was younger, but I recently took a greater interest in the story because I read Lewis Carroll's original version. I really do like this movie and would recommend it for young  children. The songs are nice and the story interesting. Even though it  doesn't follow Carroll's tale exactly, I still like it.
6304994540|5.0|This has joined the pantheon of my personal all-time favorite films, right up there with Dr. Strangelove and a select few others.  Not heretofore a Coen brothers fan, this film took me by surprise and knocked me for a loop.   Its hilariousness is totally captivating.  All of us have at least a  little of the Dude in us.  I have purchased the video and find it holds up  well under repeated viewing.  I notice other on-line reviewers havent  talked too much about the wonderfully eclectic soundtrack to the movie,  which is also one of its strongsuits.  At first I didnt like John Goodman  that much in his role, but he has grown on me after repeated watchings.
0792151712|5.0|A LOVE STORY AND THEN SOM
B00000163G|5.0|This was a GREAT example of who 2Pac was. If you don't have this cd, GET IT! It ain't hard 2 find! Even though he is most likely dead, his music and memory left a great impression on millions. R.I.P. 'Pac.
0671867369|3.0|This is an OK account of a platoon of American Airbourne soldiers, from &quot;Boot Camp&quot; through to the end of WW2, &amp; beyond. For me, Ambrose has a highly jingoistic &amp; much too &quot;yankee doodle&quot;  view of history. He comes out with some extraordinary generalistic  condemnations of whole nationalities. The French were too this, the British  too that, the Dutch are all just simply wonderful,....etc. Nothing,  according to the Gospel of Ambrose, is superior to Easy Company, Airbourne  training, Uncle Sam &amp; the American Dream! He maintains that the Germans  never did stand a chance. He dismisses their own common soldiers'  undeniable fighting qualities &amp; bravery in a petty, derisable,  comparison between American &amp; German upbringing, governmental  structures &amp; political ideals. I found this suggestion both ridiculous  &amp; unworthy! The basic account of the war, it's rigours, discomforts,  etc., is reasonably fast moving &amp; well related. I only however,  finished up feeling close to Winter &amp; possibly Webster, who is so  extensively quoted in the book, it made me wish I had read his account of  this history instead!
B000002U8G|5.0|This album deserves more than just five stars. It deserves a whole lot more. In  fact, words can't describe just how powerful this album. And symbols like little stars and stuff can't describe it either. All I can say  is that when I was sixteen, smoking loads of dope and completely out of my  mind, this album made me realize that the best acid must've been around in  the sixties. That part at the end of track three is especially trippy.
6304675348|5.0|i love this film but don't watch it alone at night it gives u the major creaps as i said major way cool scary and gory
6301334523|5.0|I've just seen Dangerous Liaisons for the first time, because when it was first released I was just 11 years old. A must see movie, superb acting by Glenn Close, great script, and marvelous setting.
0780625129|5.0|This movie was absolutely incredible. Never before have I left a theatre so speechless and disturbed. Everyone should see this amazing and thought provoking film. The content as well as the acting was unparalled. Edward  Norton has proved himself to be one the best actors there is. Edward  Furlong was quite amazing as well. If you rent any movie in the next while  make sure this is the first on your list!!
630157401X|5.0|Definitely my favorite of the trilogy. Actually my favorite movie!! It has been my favorite movie since I was 6 or 7. If you you liked the first two you are going to like this one even more because it explains many things  about Indy. MUST SEE!!!!!
6304994540|5.0|Hahahahahahaha!!  Oh, heeeheeeheeeheeehheeee!   Somebody help!  Oh, my lord!  There has never, EVER, in all of human history, taking into account every single movie ever made that I've never even seen, been a funnier  movie.  I do not exaggerate when I tell you that I was ROLLING ON THE FLOOR  with laughter while watching this movie.  Watch for a brilliant series of  shots that combines a Corvette and Carlos Santana and the Santana Band.
B00000FYIL|5.0|An excellent accompaniment to the movie: joyous, lyrical, sweeping, with a nice balance of theme music and incidental music.  Stephen Warbeck's score for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; swept me along with the same vibrant  energy as the movie:  throbbing cellos, dancing piccolos, violins by turns  weeping and soaring.  Bravo!
0805054375|3.0|Fight Club is a novel I would find difficult to recommend to anyone I know.  While it did affect me in some ways, I found that I could not identify with nor cheer on any of the characters within the book.  They are  weak people who find that pranks and beating up on others the only way to  feel accepted and powerful.  <br />I must admit that a few scenes did make me  think.  Especially a small one involving a future vet (at least he better  be).  But I don't believe that these scenes were enough to overcome the  feeling of apathy that the book conveyed.
B00000DGUG|5.0|this album at first listen puts you off abit, come back for a second listen and a song hooks you, then another, and another. there is no bad songs, lyrically and musically this album is the best ive heard since patti  smith. this album has affected me very deeply and sits in my cd player and  my car cassette and i listen to it all day. alanis has become one of my  favorites and i look forward to more, i didnt listen to her last all that  much, i liked 5 songs on it, this is a masterpiece.

0767817478|5.0|Ok, people and supposed fans of Godzilla. Time to get this record straight once and for all. This movie WAS EXCELLENT! and I will explain why. I have been a Godzilla fan for most of my life and I can say I was not let down  one bit. All of you &quot;Fans&quot; of Godzilla who were expecting this  big spectacle were supposedly let down and you call it the &quot;wost movie  ever made&quot;. I have seen a lot of horrible movies and this doesn't come  close. The effects are perfect (although, I understand the problems with  the baby 'zillas, I didn't neccessarily like them) and the  story.....well....lets talk about the story a little bit. You complain  about the story...the &quot;plot&quot;....Do you know what a  &quot;plot&quot; is? It is the general idea of the story. Every Godzilla  movie ever made has and always will be - &quot;Godzilla rises from the  water trashes a city, and maybe fights another monster&quot;. If anything,  this new movie had too MUCH plot. What were you expecting people? Some  weird love triangle between Broderick, the dumb-blonde, and Godzilla,  maybe? or howabout this....Someone kills Godzilla in the first 5 minutes  and the rest of the movie is a &quot;Who's the killer&quot; with a whole  bungh of pretty teens, which seems to be the newest fad.  I don't think any  of you &quot;true fans&quot; know a lick of what the heck you are talking  about. You obviously don't know what Godzilla was meant to be. I'm sorry  though...I take it back. Your right. Godilla looks real, its horrible. Its  DOESN'T look like a guy in a rubber suit....what a crappy movie.<br />It is  apparent to me that the world expects too much these days. A movie just  can't be cool any more with out having a mindbending plot. too bad most of  you are too stupid to figure out a mindbending plot if it had one. For the  record: the original Godzilla and its remake, Godzilla '85 were both flops  when they first came out......now look at them. I recommend this movie to  anyone who wants to see a really cool and excellently designed monster  totally rip up a city. Ignore the horrible little blonde and buy this  movie.
B000002KNU|5.0|Any collection of Alternative music that doen't include this disc is missing the very best. I hadn't heard this since my record player was retired, and now I can't believe I've gone without for so long. As soon as  the intro to UH-OH, LOVE COMES TO TOWN, my feet started tapping and didn't  stop until the last note of PULLED UP. This is the  best of the Talking  Heads. I'm a big of fan of every heads release, but this very raw and very  basic recording is, without a doubt, their best. &quot;If you were really  smart, you'd know what to do when I say&quot;..you need to have this disc.
6305268835|4.0|This is a great movie for Sandler fans, and an okay movie for the average movie goer. It's not as funny as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, so if you didn't like those don't see this. But overall it is a funny movie. Wait  till the price comes down though.
B00000IN5G|5.0|This is album Hatebreeder, is the biggest thing what could happen in black metal world at this year! They are better than ever and Alexi Laiho has more power in his sound! They're back and the chase is on for the killer of  Bodom-lake!<br />This Rules!!!!!!!!! Buy It!
6300185249|5.0|If you can't laugh at this movie then you need a new sense of humor.  I literally fell off the couch laughing at the sequence beginning with the raccoon in the dumbwaiter.  I had just recovered and then it was all  downhill from there!  If you need to laugh, this is the movie to get. The  critics hated it but take it from me, if you have ever bought a house you  will find humor in this.
6305265488|5.0|My family watched it many times, it's great for all ages! My favorite part is when Danielle(Drew Barrymore) surprises her step-mom as the princess of England. I know one thing is a fact about this movie, all women will love  this movie!!
0393038912|5.0|I was blown away by this book. It sets out to explain a question which has always intrigued me: why did some civilizations become more advanced than others, and come to dominate them?<br />Jared Diamond makes a compelling set  of arguments, much like in his other book &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot;.  A definite must-read.

0451191153|5.0|I've read the &quot;Fountainhead&quot;, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and many other works by Ayn Rand, as well as works on herself and her philosophy. I am studying Objectivism.  I have not formed a complete and  final opinion of Ayn Rand and Objectivism nor will I until I have completed  my studies.<br />I realize such an approach to developing an opinion of deep  and complex subjects is foreign to most of the reviewers below, both those  praising and condemning &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas  Shrugged&quot;.  Scrolling down the column of reviews is like taking a wary  peek under a rock, not knowing what kind of perversions you'll find  cringing and warring in the eternal muck and darkness.  Most of you people  understand next to nothing about Rand and her philosophy.  I've read so  many statements that testify to the disgusting, wounded intellects floating  around out there that I know there are not as many honest, objective  readers of Rand as there could be.<br />   Those of you who hate Rand, as  Roark says, &quot;I don't think of you.&quot;  How can I?  One can't  consider the opinion of a person who portrays himself as a snarling beast.   Some of you sound like you are an anurism away from declaring a jihad  against Objectivists.  <br />As for those others who:    <br />a. Like the story,  dislike the philosophy;<br />b. Dislike the story, like the philosophy;<br />c.  Have a lukewarm response to both;<br />d. have read just &quot;The  Foutainhead&quot;, love it,        and assume that that automatically makes           their opinions of Objectivism valid to            influence a  person who is considering to          begin reading Rand;<br />   To all of  you I say: READ ON. Read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.  Read her books on  Objectivism, not just the fiction.  Read Leonard Peikoff's  &quot;Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand&quot;.  If you don't you are  doing yourself and others who might be persuaded by your opinion a  disservice (certainly more for yourself; others don't depend on your views,  but your guise of authority is misleading).<br />   People who want to dissect  Rand on the internet need to wake up.  I have read few reviews not bloated  with fallacies.  Are you readers or are you not ?! Read on!
0385493800|3.0|I was given this book as a gift, and although I enjoyed the plot, I found I had a hard time wanting to read on and on about the trip through the Pantanal. It took entirely too long! I also disliked the sibling characters  and their lawyers so much that I dreaded those segments as well. But,  having said that, I loved the idea of someone having the fortitude to  reject instant fortune on principle and faith, and found I wanted to see  more about what happened to Nate's life after meeting Rachel. I was so sad  at the end when he went back to see her and wonder what would have happened  had he had more time to spend with her.
014028009X|5.0|I can't believe anyone would read this book, looking for any great meaning.  It is definitely pure fluff -- perfect for the beach or the bathtub.  I laughed so hard, I was crying, and read several pages out loud  to my husband.  I definitely saw myself in Bridget Jones -- particularly  the scene where she is cooking for her large &quot;Turkish family&quot; and  stepping in mashed potatoes.  Bridget Jones is everywoman who hasn't found  herself yet:  brave, funny, neurotic, a bit too harsh with herself,  battling with the desire to be beautiful and brilliant -- and the quest for  love in the 90s.  I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who  doesn't take herself too seriously!
6303908306|5.0|This movie was as exciting as it was thought provoking.  I do not understand why the complicated stories are dismissed while the puff pieces are embraced. If you are a REAL movie fan buy this movie, and watch it  often.
0783226152|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time in 1973.  I was 9 years old, and I wasn't happy about seeing it.  I quickly changed my mind, and I envied my mother for having lived in 1962 as a teen, and also for having lived in  Central California too!  I recently bought this movie, and I enjoyed just  as much as I did back in 1973.  A must see movie, and as my mother said,  very real, very true, pretty much just the way she remembers it.
6301986024|5.0|must see....McQueen is great....faye 's ok....
6300185249|4.0|This is a simple, enjoyable movie.  You have to take it as it is.  I can watch this with my kids, and they laugh just as hard as me.  My favorite part is after the kitchen is &quot;done&quot;, when the bathtub falls  through the floor, and Tom Hanks gets hysterical.  Really a good flick,  enjoyable for the whole family.
630518299X|5.0|For a some time I have been disappointed with most of Hollywood's big budget, action exhausting films that seem to have very little in the way of a plot.  This film supersedes them all.  Peter Weir again succeeded in  transforming us to a world of interest, imagination, and thought.  It was  not only entertaining but also left you with a feeling of hope and the  power of one man.  Imagine my surprise when I found that the last film that  I enjoyed this well, Gattaca, had the same screenplay writer, Andrew  Niccol.  Thumbs up to Jim Carry who also showed us a little of his dramatic  talent in The Mask.  For a film connoisseur like myself this was truly a  feast.  A must for my video library.
630349255X|5.0|I consistently rate this film amongst my all time favorites.  It is in a class by itself.  I write this review primarily as a means to express my wish that &quot;Baraka&quot; be released on DVD.<br />Does anyone know if  there are plans to release on DVD?
6305263248|5.0|When I brought this flick home I remembered how funny the car chases were and that my friend and I ahd a great time laughing our heads off.  The car chases are so absurd their ingenious and the sniper on the ice skater is my  favorite image of all the movies last year.  A fun film to watch while  blazed as hell.  Forget &quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; this was  the funniest film of last year.
6300216209|1.0|I think this is one of the worst films ever made.  It is insincere and cynical, and really scrapes the bottom of the barrel.  Made by a sensitive director, this could have been a wonderful film, but as it is .........    The song's good, shame about the cast.
6305265488|5.0|I watched &quot;Ever After&quot; on video, I watched it once alone, second time with my mom and third along with my mon and dad.  It is definitely romantic and full of fantasy.  Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott portrayed  the &quot;Cinderella &amp; Prince&quot; characters wonderfully!  I highly  recommend this movie to all audiences.  A movie you must see!!!!<br />Drew  Barrymore was a true &quot;Cinderella&quot;.  An every girl's fantasy...to  meet her prince. It is definitely a 5 ***** movie!
6300163431|5.0|This is my all-time favourite film.  From the wonderful opening credits (is the man with the stick Louis Cyphre?) to the stomach-churning final scene it's sheer quality.  Mickey Rourke makes a fine job of the seedy  private eye, and he perfectly expresses the bewilderment of a bascially  decent  man unwittingly possessed by evil. Robert de Niro's all-powerful,  static  and quietly spoken presence steals every scene in which he appears  as Mr. Cyphre.  The imagery is beautiful, powerful and scary.  I reommend  that lovers of this film also read the book on which it is based (Falling  Angel)- quite different but equally memorable.
6305265488|5.0|I think it is the GREATEST movie I have seen in a long time!!!  Enuf said :)
0375751513|4.0|First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray).  Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the  &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say  Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun.
0684852756|5.0|I was blown away by the pinpoint accuracy of this succinctly written novel.  Hanif Kureishi manages to lace each page with necessary truths that will resonate with anyone who has been in a long time marriage or live-in  relationship.<br />     He writes: &quot;I know love is dark work; you have to  get your hands dirty.  If you hold back, nothing interesting happens. At  the same time, you have to find the right distance between two people.  Too  close, and they overwhenlm you; too far and they abandon you. How to hold  them in the right relation?&quot;  <br />     Sometimes marriages don't make  space for both partners  to live. When expectations give way to reality the  intimacy erodes. And so it goes.  <br />     &quot;An unhappy relationship  can't be a sealed compartment.  It seeps into everything else, like a  punctured oil can.&quot;<br />     Too often, the demise of a relationship is  seen solely from the woman's point of view.  Kureishi's examination is  riveting and instructional.  There are signs:  &quot;Once it is over, there  is no comfort in the present;&quot; and there are solutions:  &quot;What is  it I require?  A kind indifference and some interesting underwear&quot;.<br />      Having shared this book with several married couples, I wonder if  marriage is one of the illusions in which we have invested far too much  belief in :  &quot;How disturbing it is that our illusions are often our  most important beliefs.&quot;<br />      A must read, a re-read!
0783227019|5.0|THE COMBO TALENTS OF PACHINO AND DE PALMA ARE ONCE AGAIN RECOGNIZED IN THIS CRIME DRAMA WERE PACHINO TRIES TO TIED THE BINDES, BUT HAS TO HELP A FRIEND(PENN) ONE LAST TIME. ONE OF THE BEST CRIME DRAMAS SINCE ...YOU  GUESSED IT &quot;SCARFACE&quot;.
0790733226|5.0|The DVD release of Contact is probably one of the best examples of why DVD, unlike laserdisc, will eventually replace VHS as the defacto format for in-home movie viewing.  Not only is the quality of the image  remarkable, the commentary tracks make watching the movie an even more  fulfilling experience, providing insights into the story, the acting, and  the magic behind the imagery that just aren't available anywhere else.  And  to hear the commentary given by the Jodie Foster on her own performance is  an incredible treat.  That alone makes this a more than worthwhile  purchase!
0453009123|4.0|This book depicts a sciencetist, Dr. Frankenstein, Tampering with life and death.  I liked the way Shelly set the mode by telling all the emotions of both the monster and Dr. Frankenstein. I think any one who enjoys science  fiction and horror should read this book.

6305126062|5.0|I seen this movie at the theater and rented it on video, It is a wonderful movie. I recommend everyone should see it. I also seen Monty Roberts in person and agree that things could have been done different  in the end of  the movie that was'nt so tramatic to the horse, but it is a movie. I will  be buying this movie to add to my collection.
B000001GBJ|5.0|One of the most beautiful music I had heard. It always gives me something which I don't expect and they are really wonderful.
0671027344|5.0|From beginning to end, this book does not get boring. It makes you think when it is all over about how you live your life. It focusses on the extreme edge of a teenagers life and makes you think about your own.
6302902010|1.0|PUT ME ON THE LIST FOR THE SIDNEY POITIER VERSION ALSO....HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR IT, FOR YEARS.  ALMOST PURCHASED THE ABOVE VERSION...BUT DECIDED TO PASS. IT'S NICE TO KNOW I'M NOT ALONE ON THIS QUEST. I  HAVE THE  ORIGINAL LP BUT IT'S NATURALLY PRETTY SCRATCHY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.  ANYONE KNOW IF THE RECORDING IS AVAILABLE ANYWHERE?  THANK YOU.
0425086798|5.0|As an avid Ian Fleming fan, I always recommend this one to newcomers who enjoy the films and want to check out the author who inspired them. Bond doesn't just waltz through this one unscathed... he goes through hell to  accomplish his mission! The scene in which a poisonous centipede crawls all  over Bond's naked body while he's in bed will make your skin crawl. The  torture-tunnel sequence, in which he must worm his way through yards of  heated metal, tarantulas and more, is also incredibly gripping. And Dr.  No's demise in the book is even more unusual than the way he bought it in  the film! Read this one, and see Bond the way Fleming intended him to be  seen. Roger Moore never endured trials like these!
B0000025HU|5.0|Clampdown...the motto of my life.  Hands down favorite album of all time
6305342776|3.0|After years of this movie not being available ITS BACK and on DVD also.After watching a ADVANCED copy of this on DVD (yes i have connections) I realize how much of a rip off this movie is on 20,000 legues under the  sea and 2001.But for the time period this movie is visual amazing remember  we are talking before digital effects like we see now.True the story is  good and some dialoge very bad and some acting bad it is still a timeless  movie and deserves respect and a look at.I applaude Acher bay for picking  up this title from Disney who did not want to have anything to do with a  re-release.Its a great old sci-fi movie and the kids will love it too.
0399143904|1.0|I had heard many people say that this was one of Clancey's best books. In reading it, it is a slow paced story with many technical innacuracys and one could take out a couple of hundred pages and not miss anything. Would  not recommend this book to anyone.
B00000I8UD|5.0|After hearing this disc, I can only hope that it isn't another 13 years before Sylvian releases a solo album. Brilliant.
B0000040W2|3.0|It seems to be the consensus of music reviewers around the world that THIS is the recording of the Symphonie to own.  I have to respectfully part with that orthodoxy.  While Davis coaxes some very fine playing from the  world-class Dutch musicians, the reading seems a little musty to my ears.   The interpretation that gets the blood racing (and that's what this music  is all about) is the 1968  Bernstein/NY Philharmonic [NOT his 1961 first  recording and DEFINITELY not Bernstein's abominable 70's recording with the  French National Orchestra].  Regrettably, this recording on Sony/Columbia  is now out of print.  The conductor and orchestra are in total synch on  this potboiler and the audio engineering is excellent.  The execution  (particularly in the March to the Scaffold and Witch's Sabbath) is utterly  hair-raising.  If you can find this in the cut-out bins, GRAB IT!  No finer  recording has been made in the last 30 years.
0375408266|4.0|I thought that the book was entertaining and a fast read.  It wasn't the easiest book to comprehend but it was exceptional.  I must admit it didn't exactly touch my heart but I did have emotional responses to the book.  Not  highly recommended, but recommended.
0380778556|5.0|I admit I agreed with the reviewers who said the beginning was slow and they gave up.  But if they had continued and finished the book, they would have realized what a fabulous book it really was!  Absolutely wonderful, I  must have closed the book and said &quot;wow.&quot;  That's the word to  describe it...WOW.
1882723007|1.0|I have read EVERYTHING I can get my hands on about the life after this one, and feel that, after years of study, I know it as well as I can without actually experiencing it myself, but this one just didn't mesh with  all the others.  I'm not saying that the author didn't have an experience;  I am saying that I feel very strongly that her story is GREATLY embellished  for entertainment value--and very entertaining it is.  However, I feel that  having an especially sacred experience such as this is treated as such by  those who have such an honor, and not exploited.  Yes, these experiences  are shared and written, but carefully and guarded.  Like I said, this book  was very entertaining, but from someone who has studied the topic for  years--it just didn't &quot;scrub&quot;.  I wouldn't recommend it, except  as an easy, fictional read.
B000002UDG|5.0|The music on this CD sums up why Paul McCartney has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!!  <br />Its a great addition to our music library.
B0000057C5|4.0|Harshly sung German vocals over grinding metal guitars and industrial backdrops! What could be better?! This album pounds into your skull with crunching heavy metal beats that bring names like Ministry to mind. Sure  they are not KMFDM or Atari Teenage Riot, but if you want Euro-metal at its  best, this is the band to listen to. These guys rock harder than anything!  Sure the two singles 'Engel' and 'Du Hast' kick ass, but other songs such  as the title track and 'Spiel Mit Mir' make this a worthwhile keeper!
0385486804|4.0|I read this book because I wanted to see if I would hate this kid for his stupidity or applaud him for his values, and I must say that I came away with a fondness for Alexander Supertramp. If life is a journey, then his  death was not premature, for he did more in his 24 years than most will do  in a lifetime. I do agree with some other reviewers that the organization  of the book left something to be desired, and I absolutely deplored the  author recounting his own life experiences, I thought it detracted from the  story.
6305089957|3.0|This was exacatly the same as scream but less blood and not as off the edge as scream.I heard that their going to make scream 3 but why?Are they going to turn this into a series of screams like they did with  halloween?This gets really boring after a while.I hope scream 3 is way  better than scream 2.I think anyone who will watch the same thing over and  over again should see this,but if your in for a more exciting film wait  untill the summer thats when the good ones come out.

1573226521|5.0|I'd hate to see a potential reader pass up the opportunity to read this book for fear that it lacks in content or speed.  This is an excellent title, and Mr. Garland does a superb job of transporting his reader to  Thailand, in all its richness and beauty.  From the thug-like drug lords to  the American &quot;tourists&quot;, this tapestry is intricately woven and  the story is marvelously told.  The only &quot;Gen-X&quot; reference I  found is that of all-important GameBoy which the &quot;Beachers&quot; hold  as their last tie to the the Western World.  As a matter of fact, there is  far more reference and comparison to the Vietnam and Korean wars than to  the Generation X lifestyle.  I often found myself &quot;assimilating&quot;  as Richard would call it, and forgetting about the world around me.  This  is definitely a book in which a person could get lost.  An excellent read,  and if you have any doubts...try it anyway!

0380973464|4.0|Reading the first few chapters (66 printed pages) online...Iwas engrossed, unable to move, unwilling to break for any desire or need.  Neal is pulling together across generations a  story that contrasts the differences and brings to surface the shifts  between those generations.  Deeply technical without necessitating  technical understanding, Neal brings a light to the technological and the  people that practice it that is only paralleled in Tom Clancy's ability to  make military arcana understandable to people outside that circle.<br />The  reader is drawn into the singular focus and numbing concentration of deeply  creative people.  The author brings light into the creative process that  consumes all outside stimula that so frightens people who cannot see beyond  the fogged eyes and distant presence.<br />The stories shifts are a bit rough,  but they are a continuation of the author's style of charater jumping  exhibited in his earlier books.  He tends to play these jumps very well,  building up scenes strongly, and then changing channels to build each  character's path in parallel.<br />I am quite excited and cannot wait to  receive my full printed copy.
0792152328|2.0|I had anticipated SO much more when I went to see this movie in the theater last year. It deserved maybe two of it's eleven Acedemy Awards...certainly not Best Picture. Lousy acting,  lousy story, lousy  script (did it even have a script??). If all it takes to win Academy Awards  these days is a hit song, some special effects and a teen  heart-throb...it's truly a sad time for the entertainment industry.
038097617X|5.0|This book is not really a sequel as such to LUCY SULLIVAN'S GETTING MARRIED - the character is the other sister - I found this book funnier - Ms. Keyes comes close to Jilly Cooper for laughs - so if you're feeling  blue read this - you'll cry for a different reason!

0792837614|5.0|This is the most incredibly moving and passionate movie I've ever seen. Who cares if half of the characters are lip-synching? They still make you cry. The dance scenes are visually stunning. I defy anyone to not get  caught up in this masterpiece.
B0000057C5|5.0|I am gratified to see how many people out there love this CD as much as I do. I'm not alone! Yay! I could listen to it several times a day and not get bored, and I have. The fact that the lyrics are in German doesn't  bother me in the least, and I feel sorry for all the whiners who get hung  up on the language barrier. So what? German is the next best thing to Latin  for inspiring primal, medieval imagery; I compare it to Orff's  &quot;Carmina Burana,&quot; with guitars. (How's that for an esoteric  leap?) One should experience the lyrics not as words per se, but as another  level of sound equally as powerful as the music. And as an added bonus,  &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; is an album both my girlfriend and I enjoy equally-  she's a reformed industrial/goth type with no taste for metal, but she  likes this one! (Well, maybe not quite so much as I.)
6300182355|4.0|I rememebr being nine years old and going to see Flash in the theatre. It was the first movie of that type that I had ever seen! I'm still watching it and enjoying it nearly 20 years later! Its full of what always made old  comic strip super heroes fun. Lots of bright colors, exotic sets,dashing  heroes and beautiful heroines.Alot of todays entertainment in that genre is  way more violent, less innocent and fun. I will always love watching Flash,  cheesy as it is, even when I have kids and they say to me &quot; god dad  how can you watch this??&quot; and I can look at them and smile, and think  &quot;why when I was your  age they made GOOD movies about super heroes and  adventurers not like whats out now.......&quot; And oh yeah the Queen  soundtrack is very cool.
6302597544|4.0|This is a great concert. The layout and everything that goes along with it is great. The only downside the is sound. It is not what I've become to expect. The vocals are dampened to much by the music. There are no LFE's  either. Almost as if it is a one track recording.  The picture is good  quality and the shots are great. Real innovation here. I love it but would  have enjoyed better sound quality.

Price is also fair, for what you get...quite alot. This book completly  documents 50 or so sunbursts with a front shot, back, close-up front and  back head stock shot, and an angled shot of the top that best highlights  the flame. All specs are recorded on each example (nut width, weight,etc,)     If you have any other Burst books (Vic Dapras'and a couple other come to  mind)you must get this one.

6304535570|4.0|I thought that this movie was wonderful.  I loved the various disguises that Val Kilmer masked as; thought that his ability to change his face was incredible.  I thought that the magic that occurred between him and E. Shue  was terrific.  They made me smile throughout the movie.  The story line was  also very intriquing.  I wish he would do a sequel.
B00000IBRX|5.0|The movies is awesome!  The book on the other hand has a terrible ending.  I would tell your friends to watch this movie!  One of Robin Williams best yet, next to Patch Adams.
0670881791|3.0|IMHO, the good characters (Vianne, Armande) were all good, and the bad (Reynaud) were all bad.  It would have been more interesting with more ambiguity.  But the desciptions of the candies were delicious, and I had to  stop for chocolate breaks while reading.
0553573403|5.0|Book given to me by a friend. Did not know it was a series of books, this being number one, Clash of the Kings is the next one.

Can't wait for the next one.  Keep up the great work.
6302054982|5.0|This movie, although not suitable for anyone who can't take violent mob movies, has a fast plot and a fine element of suspense. The direction in this movie is brilliant, and it shows throughout the once-shot scenes of  the old time Italian setting.

6305342776|3.0|This movie is definitely for people who saw it originally on the big screen and were fixated on it.  As a kid I ate this stuff up.  Now, it's more of a nostalgic trip and historical snapshot of special effects than  anything else to me.  If you have never seen it, you probably will think  it's &quot;cheesy&quot;, &quot;campy&quot;, and all the other observations  made about movies people don't like. It's nice &quot;popcorn&quot;  entertainment that your kids will also enjoy.
0375707972|2.0|I didn't have that feeling of not being able to put the book down.  That's a great feeling. This was kinda depressing and colorless.
6305363668|5.0|There's no point in trying to summarize or describe it.  I've seen all the movies the critics say are the greatest:  Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, 2001: A Space Oddysey, and, to be honest, I think Blade Runner  is better.

Any music-lover can understand the mixture of sacrifice, determination, hard work and hope that makes a brilliant  musician.

0671045725|5.0|Bowden shows adept knowledge of the events in Somalia on that fateful day as well as before and after the battle.  Because the book is written with the help of many of the combatants on both sides of the conflict, you  really get a feel for the people in the fight.  Also, it is easy to  visualize the experiences recounted in vivid detail.  A  &quot;real-time&quot; feel is also present when reading.  For journalists,  historians and anyone else that has an interest in learning what it would  be like to be on the giving and receiving ends of so much firepower, this  book is a definite must!  (I wouldn't mind helping with the production of a  movie script -- but Bowden is already working on that with an esteemed  director!) -- Brian Omdahl, Warren, MN

B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena Mckennit is not only brilliant, she has a great emotion in her work. The beautiful music and haunting vocals are food for the soul. &quot;The mummers dance&quot; is just wonderful, and &quot;The  highwayman&quot; will give you shivers if you have the patience to sit  through all 10+ minutes of it. It's worth the time. All in all, Loreena  provides a sanctuary of sound - she is truly gifted and i look forward to  buying her next album.
B000000ORX|5.0|A work that's remarkable for it's honesty of expression and unmitigated clarity, yet downright catchyness. &quot;Cherokee Louise&quot;, a song that contrasts the simple joys of childhood with abuse at the hands of adults  (aided by Wayne Shorter's staggered soprano sax) is the SADDEST song I have  ever heard. Place that against another song about the joys of Botticelli's  paintings, and you've got a month's worth of emotions in the space of 60  minutes.
B000002WYT|5.0|This CD pulls on every emotional string imaginable. I own all the 'Dave' CDs and this is by far the best one!! Tracks 1-4 are the best even though I love the whole CD. Sometimes I just put it on and cry. If you'er a 'Dave'  fan and you don't have it then you're crazy, but if you're a new comer to  the vast 'Dave' fan club then this will get you hooked.
6305342776|3.0|This is more a commentary on the reviews than the movie it self.  Yes, the dialogue is _very bad_.  But it makes a lot of sense to an eight year old.  More thought went into the screen play than many folks are supposing. Their  problem: Here's a strange, somewhat dark story that we must market to both  children (its Disney, not Touchstone yet) and their parents, with an  emphasis on the parents. Worth two stars just for the all the  &quot;death&quot; in a Disney flick . . . .  I think I got into goth as a  youngster because of this movie . . . [rueful grin].
B0000033TE|5.0|I would place this album among the best  in progressive rock. ELP's usual mind-blowing musicianship is at full force and they seem to push the experimental envelope even further. Lake's vocals are absolutely FLAWLESS.  This album can also be known for the unbelievably crisp clear sounds that  would be hard to top even with today's standards. (released in 73) Great  all around!
6304428928|5.0|Nice done, nice movie!
B0000060NA|5.0|I didn't buy this recording until it was already 15 years old.  It is as fresh and lovely as anything I've ever heard -- before or since.  His melodies and his lyrics speak to the heart, without being preachy or  arrogant.  His message is one of love.  A few of the songs (Have a Talk  with God, I Am Singing) are like being in church, they are so full of joy.   This is the one CD I would bring to a desert island.  Buy it and enjoy!
B000005JAX|2.0|I am an absolute, undeniable Depech Mode fan and it was with great excitement that I bought Martin Gore's solo CD. After all, Martin wrote the lyrics to almost all of Depeche Mode's work. So his solo work,  uncompromised from working with three other band members, must be  incredible! Right? Well, it was not to be. I was shocked upon opening the  CD to learn that NONE of the songs were written by Martin Gore! NONE! The  music is fine although very shallow compared to what you'd expect from one  of Depeche Mode's founding members. Very basic instrumentation with  seemingly no creativity, especially when you consider this work was done  between Depeche Mode's &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; and  &quot;Violator.&quot; If you're a DM collector you'll probably want this  odd piece but I can't recommend owning a copy for the music (even with my  love for Depeche Mode).
B0000033P0|5.0|I can understand the somewhat bad reviews people gave this album. It's definitly not for everyone. Most people don't like the heavy keyboards and complicated passages that comprised ELP's music. If your musically  adventurous and your willing to give Tarkus a few chances, it just might  become one of your favorite albums. No other music on the planet can take  you where Tarkus takes you. The musicianship and material is staggering. I  think Greg Lake had the best voice out of all the progressive rock groups.  Emerson's style is all his own, and Carl Palmer nails what can be described  as a drummers nightmare! Side 2 doesn't quite match up to side 1, but  harbors some very strange gems. The bizarre but somewhat cheesy artwork on  the album only adds to the strange feelings you'll get when you listen to  it. This is one of my all time personal favorites.
0375707972|1.0|The Reader is one of the worst books I have every read.  Part I was simply awful.  Even though Anna could not read, she knew better than do such an awful thing.  Part II was like reading for a history report.  Part III was  just as bad as the first.  The poor kid was messed up for life.<br />I have  read a few of Oprah's selections, and this one is by far, the worst.  I  finished it ONLY because I paid for it.
0679777547|5.0|Perez-Reverte combines the most interesting of elements to creat a great plot.  However, if one is looking for your typical 'who-dunnit' stay clear.  This book is more apt for the latin scholar.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang's &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; is a story that the world should know. We've all heard of the Nazi  holocaust against the Jews but few have heard the  horrors inflicted on 300,000 Chinese in Nanking when  Japanese soldiers ran rampant. More Chinese were killed in the three weeks  of this massacre than Japanese in the two atom bomb blasts. This is an  important story, well researched and skillfully told. To understand China,  and its looming role in world politics in the next millenium, this book  stands out as a must read. I've told everyone of my  book friends about  this book and hope they do the same.
6305268835|5.0|Awesome
B000002U82|2.0|All those people sitting around smoking pot (as you need to do to have the patience to sit through some of this stuff) and synchronising this thing to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; need to get a life. It's probably a three star  album, not a two, but the silly habits of its fans annoy me enough to pull  a star.
0385493800|4.0|A classic Grisham opening, and an enjoyable read throughout. Perhaps we dwelled in the Pantanal a bit long, but who's complaining. I can't say that this is the best Grisham book, but middle of the road from him is quite  alright with me.
B000002MP2|5.0|Greenday is the best band in the world and this is the CD that made them popular and if you dont got it there is deffinatly somethin' wrong with you
B000003BF1|4.0|This album is often held up along with &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot; as the Stones' best, but I don't think it's quite in that league. It's really rather a mish mosh, without the cohesion of &quot;Banquet.&quot; For one  thing, Brian Jones was leaving, Mick Taylor was arriving, and the producer  was doing the drumming on &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;  for some reason. (That song is great anyway, though the lyrics don't always  fit very well as Mick is forced to words like &quot;cherry&quot; and turn  them into three syllables.) The title song isn't really much fun.  &quot;Monkey Man&quot; is silly, but great fun. &quot;Country Honk&quot; is  pretty unnecessary. Perhaps the greatest things here are &quot;Gimme  Shelter&quot; and &quot;Love In Vain.&quot;
B000002UDV|5.0|I don't know what the reviewer from Washington, D.C. is talking about.  The album deserves to to be issued to every person at birth (along with Sgt. Pepper and Melon Collie).  This album has nothing to do with the  beach, sand, surfing, or cars.
6304030983|2.0|This terrifying film is not for children. The effects are fine, if you like this kind of thing. But really, the story is sad and unfair.
B000002B38|5.0|Pulse is a really great package.  It includes a basic jumble of lots of their hits and a few songs that never made it on the air, and of course the infamous dark side second disc.  The variety of songs, however, is not what  makes this album worthy of five stars.  The quality of the recording is  fantastic.  One can hear exactly what the band wants him to hear, and none  of the feedback or pick-click of normal live recordings. This is  brilliance, and truly captures the feel of all the albums from which songs  were extracted.
0684843749|5.0|Without a doubt the most compreshensive book  ever written on bodybuilding!  Truly a delight to read.  After reading the book from cover to cover, I revamped my workout and actually saw major results within a  couple of months whereas I havn't seen in about a year.  This book is truly  a must for anyone who wants to shape up or enter the field of bodybuilding.   I strongly recommend it!!!!!!
6303477259|5.0|There is nobody else in&quot;rockdom&quot; like Pink Floyd.Their live concerts are fantastic and this particular video portrays what a real live concert is really like.
B000002NJS|5.0|I have Madonna Fever and everything she does is great!Those of you who don't have the fever,JUST SHUT UP.... Go listen to your impetent satanic music. Or do you favor Mariah Carey and Whitney Houstan? Stupid! Madonna is  a legend before her time,don't be dumb!
B000002H38|5.0|There are sooooooo many different ways that I can describe Anita Baker's &quot;Rapture&quot; album, but I won't, simply because words don't do it justice.  From top to bottom, a more than worthy addition to anyone's music  collection.  Every song is soulful, colorful, and just plain full.  This CD  exploded on the music scene with all the subtlety of a nuclear strike.  Her  songs, &quot;Rapture&quot;, &quot;Sweet Love&quot; (being a musician  myself, I can truly appreciate the joy these songs bring to me when I  perform them, let alone listen to them), and &quot;Been So Long&quot; are  instant classics.  Although her other releases have been impressive, her  first album far and away blows them all out of the water.  Get this CD if  you're a fan of music.
0790733226|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie's of all time. the story kept me very interested at all times and it a suspense to it that rearly let up. Jodie Foster is superb in the title role. Excellent F/X and music. and best of  all an excellent story.
6305265488|5.0|This reworking of the Cinderella story charmed me from start to finish. Not just for children or teenagers, this visually stunning film incorporated historical tidbits that kept my mind engaged.  Great  &quot;modern&quot; romance between realistic characters that are not your  &quot;typical&quot; Hollywood glamour types. Besides, where else can one  see seven (count 'em, unless there were others) rarely mentioned French  chateaux on film?
6305128952|5.0|As a horse lover, I found the story a series of rehabilitating activities after a shocking beginning.  I feel sure it was hard for Ann to make on-the-spot decisions concerning the horse while dealing with her  daughter's physical problems.  At the same time, having had to deal with a  child's needs as opposed to holding onto a well-paying job, I can relate to  her actions.  It was refreshing to see her make choices which were most  beneficial to her family rather than today's too-often selfish trends of  &quot;me first, last, and always!&quot;  I liked the movie because I feel  that it is a good moral lesson.
6300216268|5.0|Harold and Maud was a great comedy and also the greatest love story of all time.  The funny, yet realistic way of Harold faking his death for attention is hillarious, and his love with maud, a 79 year old woman is  incredible.  I have never seen a better movie in any other category.  If  you have not seen this movie, you are missing a huge part of movies.
0553108034|5.0|A worthy sequel to &quot;GAME OF THRONES&quot;.  This has to be one of the all-time best fantasy-adventure books that I have read.  I would highly recommend it (i.e. the &quot;SONG OF FIRE AND ICE&quot; series) to any  fantasy-adventure lover.
6303114946|5.0|A tale of a child chess prodigy (supposedly based on a true story), and the effects his brilliance has on his father, and in turn, the pressure the father unwittingly shoulders upon his son.  Applicable in most any  situation where a family raises a gifted child (would be just as effective  if it were about gifted musician or Olympic athelete), this touching film  hits the bullseye without ever being soapy or preachy.  With a fine cast  and rich performances, \\"Searching for Bobby Fisher\\" is a real `find'.  For  those who missed it in the theater (probably most of the population), do  yourself and your family a favor and pick up the video.  Between 1 and 10,  \\"Searching for Bobby Fisher\\" gets a marginal 9.
6305181772|4.0|Great movie and fantastic quality. First time buyer from Amazon. Only 9 days to deliver to the U.K. and E-Mails to show progress of the order. Well done Amazon.<br />Colin
6303168507|5.0|Along with Steven Spielberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Schindler's List\\" is one of the most poignant and important films of the decade.  Filmed in glorious black and white and shades-of-gray, the format sets the tone for  this true story as color never could.  Superbly acted and directed,  \\"Schindler's List\\" will anger and sicken you, then tear at your heart, and  even uplift you.  After seeing this film, one realizes all too well that  this could happen again, did happen again (Cambodia), and indeed continues  to happen all around us today (although not in the horrifying magnitude of  the Jewish holocaust or the slaughter in Cambodia).  Brutally realistic,  this film should be required viewing throughout the world.<br />And bravo to  Steven Spielberg, the television network, and their sponsors for bringing  this magnificent film to the masses, uncut and unedited, and with only two  small commercial interruptions.  \\"Schindler's List\\" easily gets 10 out of  10 in my book.
B00000IBRX|2.0|i thought the movie was pushed to the end too fast. they should have made it alot slower... i mean, one second, their in heaven enjoying the the beautiful surroundings, the next, their in hell trying to save robin  william's wife! it was some-what far fetched.... also i could tell that  they intended to make it an emotional rollercoaster. but it just wasnt.  that was a major minus! the plus of this movie is the special effects. they  were fenominal! the way they portrayed heaven was great!!! makes you wanna  die and be there already!!! im glad they won the oscar for special  effects..if you wanna be amazed by great eye-candy, dont miss this film!  but if your in the mood for a tear-jerker, stay away from WHAT DREAMS MAY  COME!!
0790740443|4.0|\\"Soldier\\" is a unique movie, in that the protagonist has almost no dialogue.  I doubt Kurt Russell spoke more than 60 words in the entire film.  In a way, it's too bad, since Russell is a very accomplished actor.  To his credit, he let his expressions speak for him, and at times his  expressions were quite poignant.  I wished, however, that the film would  have concentrated more on the `soldier's' tribulations as a child growing  up through the system of training.  It could have been quite fascinating.  More time could also have been spent with the castaways after he was dumped  unceremoniously with all the other garbage.  It would have heightened the  emotion of the film when he was subsequently cast aside by the villagers  because he couldn't fit in.  But alas, Hollywood chose the easy way out,  touching only lightly in these areas and concentrated mainly on the  action...and as an action film, it wasn't bad at all, but it could have  been so much more.  Between 1 and 10, I give \\"Soldier\\" a 7.
B00000I8UE|4.0|Traveling Miles is both a tribute to Miles Davis and Cassandra Wilson. She borrows styles from a number of her earlier recordings, not just the last two by which many people know her. It has the jazzier feel of &quot;Dance  to the Drums Again&quot; and &quot;She Who Weeps.&quot;   If you're looking  for the kind of consistent blues/folk timbre that is on her later  recordings, you might have a problem with this CD. It doesn't flow from  song to song as well as the Grammy-winning &quot;New Moon Daughter&quot;,  and the arrangements are not as original as in &quot;Blue Light 'Til  Dawn&quot;. For the first time, on a few of the songs, I found myself  thinking, &quot;that sounds like what she did on &lt;song from earlier  album&gt;&quot;. An example is the guitar on &quot;Resurrection Blues  (Tutu)&quot;, which sounds like the guitar work on &quot;Strange  Fruit&quot;.<br />However, as a devoted Wilson fan, I love the variety. She  does jazz, she does blues, she does Delta blues (with slide guitar), she  does folk. She sings all beautifully, working each note to the nth degree.  Her arrangements, as always, are very engaging and neatly produced,  allowing the listener to hear each and every sound from each and every  instrument.<br />...Overall, its a reinforcement of how much I love to hear  this woman sing, as well as my faith in her intelligence as a musician.
0783226160|5.0|This is one of the greatest, if not the best, college movie ever made!  A must for any incomming freshman orientation!
0783228600|5.0|I know this movie has caught all sorts of grief for being so bad, but you know what, it's not.  I believe that Johnny Depp should have got a Oscar nomination for his performance.  You really need to watch this movie a few  times to catch all of the things that are said and all the references that  are made.  It is simply a look at two guys view of what the American Dream  is, and I can't knock it, in fact I want to take a trip (pun very much  intended) to where they went to.
B000003TBP|1.0|Beck samples the heck out of every imaginable music/noise source, then throws it all together into a strange mixture.  He has the same approach to lyrics -- just a bunch of word collages and nonsensical snippets strung  together.<br />So does it make anything worth listening to?  Not really.  This  stuff gets annoying fast.  Strip all of the weird samples and noises out of  the music, and the melodies (if you can even call them that) are extremely  weak.<br />If this guy is the next Bob Dylan, (Yeah...Right!!!), then the best  I can say is that at least his voice isn't as whiny as Dylan's.
B000002MTR|4.0|The two singles you hear on the radio are nothing compared to &quot;Tearjerker&quot; and &quot;Walkabout&quot; which are both flawless songs IMO.  Warped has one the coolest effects ive heard in a rock album,  and Pea is a cool little song where flea actually does the singing.
B000003S0R|5.0|Eno is great and this is one of his best efforts
630027120X|1.0|Unfortunately, I was forced to watch this movie for my World Cultures class.  I really hated it, although it had its good moments.  I didn't see the point the whole movie;it went it circles!  I wish the writers could  have found a better way to get to the point.
0375707972|3.0|I had to set my environment to read this book of &quot;literature,&quot; as the book is so labeled. I eased into my couch (it's a cushy couch), tossed a blanket over me, took a sip of my tea, and then lifted the first  page of The Reader. In one afternoon I read the book cover to cover.  I sat  there wondering what would happen to Michael Berg (the narrator).  How  would these events affect the rest of his life?  How would they affect my  own?  It made me realize the impact of one decision, not only on one's own  life, but on many. I can't tell you what happened otherwise I would give  away the story, but let me say that the story was told simply though the  topics were far from simple.  I found a connection with Berg's  reflectiveness and hoped him well.  A very good book.
B000003TA4|5.0|I would go get this C.D. if you do not have it. All the songs are good but my favorite is (smells like teen spirit).
0553577123|5.0|With her diary, Anne takes us into her life in hiding, with all the honesty of someone who never really imagines that their private thoughts will ever be read by someone other than herself. I have studied the  persecution of the Jews for many years and nothing has brought it more to  light for me until this. Anne tells us the raw events of her life - of  having to sit and not make any noice for hours on end, and of having to go  to the bathroom in a bucket after everyone else has used it, and then have  it sit in the room with them. And also she tells us about her first kiss,  her dislike of her mother, of that time in everyone's life when we begin to  become independent from our family. The amazing thing is that she was able  to show us that she was a kid, one that wanted to laugh, to play, to fight,  to love, all during the most heart wrenching time in our modern history.
6305268177|1.0|Almost all the songs are out of tune.  I guess they don't really care about how they perform.  If you compare Eagles' new DTS DVD - Hell freezes over, it is really shameful. (If I were not Bee Gees' fan, I won't buy it  even my wife told me not to.) I have it sold in eBay, right after I did not  even finish it.
0767805712|4.0|This superb near-future science fiction piece offers the perfect antidote to the tired, &quot;cyberpunk&quot;, post-apocalyptic view usually taken by writers when predicting future society.  Set in &quot;the not-too-distant  future&quot; - a technologically advanced yet stylistically fifties world -  the film portrays the social consequences of today's genetic research  carried forward to extremes. Society has become divided; a new underclass  created not according to race, sex, or financial means but &quot;bad&quot;  genetic material - those born &quot;on faith&quot; rather than being  genetically engineered to their parents' specifications.   Gattaca tells  the story of Vincent, one of the so-called &quot;In-valids&quot; who has  the willpower to succeed in life but is oppressed because he is genetically  inferior.  To achieve his goal of joining the Gattaca space corporation and  travelling into space he assumes the identity of a &quot;Valid&quot; -  Eugene - by fooling the all-pervading genetic testing machines with samples  of his blood, urine, skin and hair.  Eugene - who seems to have every  advantage in life - is bitter because he lacks the drive to use his gifts  to the full, and is now crippled after a failed attempt at suicide. The  film's overriding feature is the palpable tension created as Vincent must  hide every trace of his being from those investigating a crime committed in  his workplace - the attention to detail is superb. Overall, a thoughtful -  if a little extreme - treatment of genetic research and the importance of  the intangible aspects of the being as opposed to quantifiable features.
B000002C1Z|4.0|If your a Floyd fan, then you already own this one. If your here because your only exposure to Floyd has come via &quot;The Wall&quot; then this is a must. Very similar in structure and sound to &quot;The Wall&quot;, this  was and still is a favorite in my album collection.
6304196938|4.0|Perhaps my only complaint about &quot;North By Northwest&quot; was that it seemed to drag in some parts of the film.  Otherwise, I thought the film had wonderful actors, plenty of urbane humor, and a great musical  score.<br />The film aso had so many memorable (and rather famous) scenes,  such as the cropduster or the Mt. Rushmore scenes or the shots in the UN.   I also liked how Hitchcock used one of Fellini's tricks as his ending of  the film (his &quot;naughty joke,&quot; as someone else called it).<br />The  sophisticated humor and style, the suspense, the great acting, the scoring  (musical, not Cary Grant's), and the creative camera shots make &quot;North  by Northwest&quot; one of Hitchcock's best.
0312853238|5.0|Up until Ender's Game, I had never read a science fiction book.  WOW, was I blown away.  Even my wife, who never would have considered reading science fiction read it in one reading.  I have read many science fiction  books since, none, save Hyperion, can compare.  It is the best of its  genre.
0393038912|5.0|Guns, Germs and Steel is the most illuminating book I ever read, and the best you are likely to find this millenium.  Diamond shines his light on that dark little corner in all of us where we keep hidden the secret belief  that, in spite of everything, and our best intentions, white European  people really are smarter and better than everyone else. We hate racism,  and being racist even worse, but the evidence is there, before our eyes,  obvious and unarguable.  White western Europeans had the first big  agriculture, then crafts, villages towns and cities and nation states and  big armies.  Europeans invented everything, did all the best science and  discoveries and art, and built the first big industries. And finally got  the power and weapons to go forth and conquer and subdue the whole earth.  So isn't it obvious? Well no, as a matter of fact it is not, and Jared  Diamond is here to explain how it really happened, and why European  &quot;superiority&quot; is another one of those obvious, common sense, self  evident &quot;truths&quot; that turns out to be as phony as the flat earth  or geocentrism.  To read this book, and to be free at last from this  crippling old myth is exhilerating. After you read it- and you really must-  the world will never be the same place it was before.  And we can really be  one people after all, just the way we always wanted to be.

0671027344|5.0|This is the first book i have actually read in a while.  I'm glad I decided to read it. This book has made me want to read more.. i could really relate with everything charlie thought and the experiences happened  to me. i was reading  and it was liek whoa that happened to me. i couldn't  put the book down. i loved it Charlies experiences and toughts are that of  a real 15 year old. the book was just great.!! thats all there is to it
6305308659|5.0|At first blush, it appeared that the character's epiphanies would be sex-oriented, but thankfully, this was not so. Symbolic of our own automatonism (perhaps there is something beyond &quot;technicolor&quot; for  US), it resurrected for me a glimmer of recall of something  &quot;better&quot; in our own consciousness at which we refuse to look for  fear we might somehow &quot;disappear&quot;. I found this video delightful  from start to finish - hopeless, but not serious. Video stores need to have  another category &quot;Philosophy&quot; perhaps - as the script for me is  reminiscent of Socrates' tale of the sage trying to cajole the cavedwellers  into emerging from their shadow world to view the glorious sun - but they  were too frightened to even contemplate such a thing. Here the change was  refreshingly inevitable - and although some would say the characters  [again] chose to depart Eden, until we look at our dark sides we'll never  regain what we have &quot;forgotten&quot;. A most impressive work of art.
B000007492|5.0|I picked this gem up at Sam the Record Man in downtown Toronto, and was it a good choice! Every song on this disc rocks.  Supertramp may have been dissed by the critics and the general public, but they do have talent! Just  check out &quot;The Logical Song&quot; and &quot;Dreamer.&quot; I look  forward to getting the second volume of the series.
B000002GJ7|5.0|This CD is a must have for the rock fan.  In my opinion, this is the best effort by Extreme.  Every song on the CD is a good listen.  You will not be disappointed by this pick.

B000003JDA|5.0|I had brought this cassette very apprehensively from one of my friend's house.But after listening to the songs I was totally mesmerised.The music is simply scintillating and very,very catchy.The flute,in particular,has  been played very well.I liked almost all the songs.But I felt the best were  'wounded and treacherous,'valley',and 'dangerous veil'.This is my first  Jethro Tull and I definitely going to start stocking my cupboard with  Jethro tulls. A must listen for any person who likes music and who can take  a lot of flute.

0792838084|5.0|David Lynch's &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; is a symbolically rich, masterfully crafted work, depicting the coexistence of two seemingly diametrical worlds with icy and compelling juxtaposition.  Beneath the normal, kin- and  friendship-oriented world of small town America, Lynch delivers a haunting  and terrible (but inexplicably fascinating) world of evil and corruption.  The complex relationship between these two realms is unified by a rather  simple mystery-detective plot, but, like the opening montage, this  ultimately gives way to a premise of greater depth and complexity.  Without summarizing plot, one could argue that the central characters in  this tableau are representative of each world in some way: Jeffrey Beaumont  (Kyle Maclachlan), the college student and amateur detective whose  seemingly innocent curiosities lead him into the complicated underworld  where they evolve into voyeurism and compulsion; Dorothy Vallens (Isabella  Rossellini), the tormented lounge singer whose familial ties to illicit  affairs have forced and trapped her in this underworld; Sandy Williams  (played in an almost-painful-to-watch-at-times manner by Laura Dern),  Beaumont's budding romantic interest who is willing to help her too-curious  friend but remains morally and psychologically rooted in the positive  &quot;surface&quot; world; Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), Dorothy's tormentor  and blackmailer, and the terrifying, twisted villain who exemplifies the  negativity of the underworld.  The relations between these characters serve  as the foundation for juxtaposing the two worlds, a contrast which is  strengthened by the frequent use of symbols and subtleties (e.g. color and  lighting, sometimes surreal placement of characters on the screen, the  heavy profanity of Frank).  The main underlying idea is certainly a  haunting one: behind every facade and every seemingly normal appearance is  an existence of a deviant nature.  I do not believe that Blue Velvet is a  perfect film, though: even though its story is complex and difficult to  assemble it often progresses conspicuously slowly and unevenly.  The film  presents several jarring and somewhat confusing breaks of flow over its  124-minute duration.  Several important scenes are depicted in brief shots  and, in the spirit of the underworld that the film illustrates, low light.  Similarly, many lines are whispered.  While some of these effects are  essential to the artistic aspirations of the film, it may be difficult for  the viewer to perceive all of them.  A second viewing is often necessary,  but, unless a viewer cannot endure this film, a second viewing is probably  inevitable.  Criticisms notwithstanding, Blue Velvet is probably my  favorite film (if I had to choose one), and definitely one that I would  recommend.though: even though its story is complex and difficult to  assemble it often progresses conspicuously slowly and unevenly.

0140135154|5.0|This book is nothing short of monumental.  In it, Mr. Berger takes a closer look at that ground upon which many of us fear to tread: the realm of societal perceptions.  By analyzing the manner in which we communicate  to each other, he shows us that which we oftentimes forget in our hurry to  get things done: that others, too, are indivdual human beings capable of  true expression, but are often withheld by socioeconomic constraints or by  the limitations of self-conception.  This book stays in keeping with its  title in this service: it provides the reader with a broad range of views  that may never have come to life otherwise.  From a personal standpoint,  this book has served as a welcome companion on the road to self-exploration  and the search for wisdom, and I hope that it may for you, as well.
B000002UEB|5.0|Somebody should make a movie using the lyrics and music from this album. Not since The Wall, has an entire concept album told such a riveting tale using every single song without straying off course. Mindcrime is in my  all-time top 10, and it will never be replaced.

0345347951|3.0|I had greater expectations for this book, but I found myself disappointed. The surprising revelations that the various characters make as the book progresses were entertaining at first, but towards the end I found myself  growing wary of new developments. What's worse, some of the key elements  that I'd like to see included in the storyline are either mentioned briefly  or ignored completely. Why is it that poverty, crime, class structure and  religion are simply &quot;eliminated&quot; as soon as the Overlords present  themselves? It's like the author intentionally explained away certain  issues in order to focus on what he believed to be more  &quot;important&quot; ones. And as I read, I began to feel like Clarke  didn't really know how to draw a satisfying conclusion or deal with his  assortment of loose ends. But perhaps I could have overlooked these flaws  if the book hadn't seemed so hopelessly dated. With every page I turned, it  became more and more apparent that the novel was written prior to 1970. In  general the overall impression was that I'd be better off reading a  different book, like, say, 2001: A Space Odyssey(?)

This CD has many unmatchable songs on it, including &quot;Demanufacture&quot; (which is their best song), &quot;Self Bias  Resistor&quot;, &quot;Replica&quot;, &quot;Body Hammer&quot;, and many more  high-speed songs. The remixes, on REMANUFACTURE, are also very good. This  is their best effort, and is required music for any metal fan.

B0000028RR|5.0|This album was great. Know Your Enemy has probably the best guitar of any song ever made. Also, Wake Up also has a great guitar solo. The lyrics are very powerful, probably not as powerful as Evil Empire, but great none the  less. The great guitar makes this album above the newer album, but not by  much and the only critism I have of the band is that they need to produce a  new album, although I have heard news of one in the making. A great buy for  anyone who like the Evil Empire cd or anyone who likes this type of music.
6302238331|5.0|The French Connection remains one of the classics of film.  For brilliance of portrayal and suspense, it is timeless.    The film embodies what drives its two protagonists.  Alain Chanier (Fernando Rey) is a dapper businessman  on the outside, ruthless killer and drug kingpin on the inside.  NYPD  Detective Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman in a deserved  Oscar-winning performance) is a hyped-up cop who pursues his quarry with  glee, but is also quite likeable.  The contrasts are best shown in two  early scenes - Chanier's dapper nature comes through when he and his wife  Marie exchange gifts for their pending trip to the US; Popeye Doyle's  nature comes through in a thoroughly engaging scene when he and his partner  Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider in what should have won him an Oscar) bust a  lowlife junkhouse bar; Popeye accosts men twice his size, pulls  \\"dropsy\\", and all knowing none of these scumbags will dare  protest.  The raid, though, is cover so Popeye can debrief one of his best  informants (Alan Weeks); the informant reveals the coming of \\"a  shipment\\" (Chanier's) in two weeks.  To make the ruse look good,  Popeye reluctantly busts the man's jaw (the grimace on Popeye's face as he  does so is priceless.).    Adding to the tension is the presence of FBI  Agent Bill Mulderig (stuntman Bill Hickman in a superb performance), who  hates Popeye, blaming him for the death of an officer in a previous case.   The two quarrel several times and come to blows at one point.      Through  it all, Popeye trails Chanier and his American friends, lawyer Joel  Weinstock, candy store owner Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco), actor Henri  Devereaux (Frederique De Pasquale), and others.  When Chanier barely  escapes Popeye's pursuit, he has his henchman Pierre Nicoli try to kill  him.  But the sniper attack is botched, and the result is a thrilling  chase; Nicoli hijacks an elevated train (killing a policeman and the train's conductor in the process), and Popeye commandeers a car to pursue.  When the motorman passes out the train crashes, allowing Popeye to corner and then kill Nicoli.  It is the unique nature of  the chase as well as its execution that makes it a film classic.  Most car  chases involve cars chasing cars; a car chasing a train is something that  hasn't been done, before or since.    Eventually Popeye and company seize  the car in which Chanier's junk is hidden.  They replace the stash, return  the car, and eventually tail Chanier to an abandoned crematorium where the  switch is made.  A gunfight ensues, and Popeye blasts a man in the shadows  - Mulderig.    In the epilogue we learn the fate of the captured hoods, none  of whom get any kind of serious sentence.  The unsatisfying outcome  embodies the unsatisfying outcomes of so many crimes - a further testimony  to this film's greatness.
6304539495|5.0|This anime is simply spectacular. Crafted with the skilled artistry and fine attention to detail we have come to expect from our friends in the East, this film also combines elements of computer animation which enhance  the overall sense of a highly technified future and add to the stunning  artwork and rich animation. Particularly enjoyable are the beautiful and  incredibly detailed music-accompanied sequences of scenes within the city;  the dozens of intricately painted backgrounds alone are incredible. More  than simply entertainment, this film raises intriguing questions about the  soul and what it means to be human. This is one of my favorites.. in any  genre.

B000000OUE|4.0|When I first listened to it three years ago, I judged &quot;Astro-Creep 2000&quot; to be trash. However, after happening upon it one night on my car radio, bass cranked up high, I decided to give the band a second  chance. Although it is now defunct and Rob Zombie has gone on his own, I  feel that White Zombie is one of the most inspired bands of the decade.  While countless other bands incestuously ape each other, singing of trendy,  phony angst (for genuine earth-shattering angst, listen to Gustav Mahler),  this band's music satisfies the senses in ways that other bands cannot.<br />I  guess I like White Zombie because of the apparent contradictions in its  music. On the one hand, there's the Postmodern self-parody of so-called  &quot;Devil&quot; music, with its silly Satanism (Who can help but laugh at  the &quot;Devilman runnin' in my head&quot; bit in &quot;Super-Charger  Heaven?&quot;) and Rob Zombie's deadpan growling of the lyrics. But then,  there's also genuine feeling in the music, which has an almost organic  quality, like someone using bowels and intestines as instruments. In other  words, White Zombie takes its music-making seriously, without taking itself  seriously. Its intention is to entertain, to help us get in touch with our  inner &quot;Devilman&quot; (or Devilwoman), and perhaps to help us laugh at  the very things that scared the bejeezus out of us as kids (To paraphrase  Mark Twain, the best way to get rid of the Devil is to laugh at him.). It  also criticizes Christianity, or at least what it has become in the 2000  years since its &quot;founder&quot; died, and campily evokes the Devil and  his army of undead ghouls and sensualists as a kind of metaphorical  counterpoint. Some of White Zombie's assaults seem a bit sophomoric, but  it's merely to shock parents and authority figures while getting its  intended audience to think (hopefully) independently.<br />The songs are very  well-done for the most part. I especially like five of them.  &quot;Super-Charger Heaven&quot; has great drive, and the  &quot;Devilman&quot; chorus always evokes a chuckle. &quot;Electric Head  Part 2&quot; is funky. &quot;I Zombie&quot; has a (more or less) terrifying  sound, its relentless beat reminding me of the &quot;Mars&quot; movement in  Holst's &quot;The Planets&quot; (The monotone singing is particularly  effective.). &quot;More Human Than Human&quot; is very well-played, its  opening placing me in mind of how Wagner's &quot;Liebestod&quot; would have  sounded if played by Jimi Hendrix alongside porno sound samples.<br />Amidst  all the crazy music, the album ends with the enigmatic &quot;Blood, Milk,  and Sky.&quot; It sounds like an older, wizened Zombie growling quietly  under quasi-Arabic rhythms. The song is almost poignant, like a Zombie who  is weary of all that has transpired in the earlier songs of sex, death, and  the supernatural.<br />Analysis aside, this is an excellent recording. Not all  the songs are great, but you won't get bored either. I especially recommend  it for excellent sound systems and parties where conversation is not a  priority.
B000002L42|5.0|No matter what anyone else says about a rock band reunion, Steely Dan's return to the world of rock has been one of it's most anticipated moments.  With a new studio album on the way, &quot;Alive In America&quot; can  qualify as an introduction to anyone who has never had the pleasure to  easily digest the special mix of rock, jazz and soul with abstract lyrics.  Donald Fagen's(Not Tom Scott) vocals are rougher and stronger than ever and  even Walter Becker provides the best moments of guitar work especially with  &quot;Josie.&quot;  Becker's &quot;Book of Liars&quot; is a smooth step in  the spotlight for the usually silent half of this legendary duo. The  production and the quality of the music is near perfect and smooth as  glass.  I'm even surprised that it hasn't even gone gold yet. This ain't  country or hip hop you're hearing.  This is Steely Dan.  Get used to it.

006017322X|5.0|Of the two novels I was required to read this year at school (and the science ficton novels and short stories I read on my own). This was the best. Few books effect me the way this one does (two others being Ray  Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles and Ernest Hemingway's the Old Man and  the Sea). That is the story(s) these book tell true on a higher level. The  minor characters are deeper then the main characters in many novels (take  that atrocity called &quot;A Seperate Peace&quot; for example). This book  also has all the extra goodies, wit, social criticism, irony, a vivid  setting. I can not imagine a person not liking this book.

All the other songs rule! &quot;Mary  Jane&quot;,&quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot; and &quot;Hook In Mouth&quot;  reach out and grab you.

B00000IGGA|5.0|When I first heard Mule Variations-I was lucky enough to receive a promotional copy-my first inclination was to compare each song to others by Tom Waits.  I was slightly disappointed thinking that Tom had become  predictable; although even Tom Waits copying himself is better than most  artists who claim to be on the cutting edge.<br />However, now that I have  listened to the album several times, I'm finding that although the songs  still remind me of other Tom Waits classics, they have distinguished  themselves from the rest of his repertoire and have become entirely unique.  For example:  &quot;What's He Building&quot; will instantly be compared to  &quot;The Ocean doesn't Want Me&quot; or &quot;Ninth and Hennepin.&quot;  But after listening to it several times &quot;What's He Building&quot; is  as good as both, which is saying a lot, is altogether different from  either, and in some respects better.<br />I find I want to listen to every  song on the album, which I haven't experienced with a new record for years.  All are great, all are one of a kind, all are so thickly layered that I  hear new sounds each time I listen, and all have unique moods that couldn't  be created by anyone else.  I cannot recommend this album higher.
6300214540|5.0|Top Gun is the movie that defines what cool is.  Even today, 13 years after its release, my football team would sing &quot;You've lost that lovin' feeling&quot; on the bus ride home after a win. Some people may find  fault with the contrived plot and overall tone that war is good, but this  film was never about plot or social messages.  It is simply a film made by  a director (Tony Scott) and producers (Simpson and Bruckheimer) who know  how to seal the deal.  This along with the fact that the cast includes some  of the top movie stars of the past 2 decades (Tim Robbins, Val Kilmer, Meg  Ryan, Anthony Edwards) who were all but unknown at the time.  There is  nothing better than to pop Top Gun into the VCR, crank up the surround  sound and take a trip to the bars and runways of Fightertown USA.
B00000DI2T|5.0|It is important not to give Leonard Bernstein all the credits in the pioneering of Mahler music. However, besides Bruno Walter, a lifelong advocate in enhancing the appreciation of Mahler's music, there was Dimitri Mitropoulos, who did a series of recordings of Mahler's music at the time Bernstein was starting out as a conductor. Moreover, let's not forgot Jascha Horenstein, who was among the earlier exponent of the composer's music and was instrumental in getting Mahler exposed in Great Britain. Efforts of other conductors, like Maurice Abravanel (the second to record the symphonies in the United States), Sir John John Barbirolli, Klaus Tennstedt, James Levine, Otto Klemperer, Vaclav Neumann, Sir George Solti, Raphael Kubelik, Bernard Haitink, Claudio Abbado, Kyrill Kondrashin, and Lorin Maazel should not be slighted.<br /><br />That said, Leonard Bernstein is credited for not only bringing Mahler's music further to the fore, but also really the first for changing and challenging the listeners' and the establishment's perception of it, and on a wider scale, especially in Vienna. And he did that not through performances, but also through his televised Young People's Concerts, various interviews, and writings. And when you listen to his recordings of the symphonies and songs, they become, in essence, occasions or events of their own, so strong the kinship between conductor and composer. There is, in other words, nothing like them. I still think his recording of the Ninth Symphony with the Concertgebouw is the best, most gripping, terrifying, heart-wrenching one to date, even though Levine's RCA reading is quite as moving. Bernstein's way with the First is very special, as in the Fifth and the Sixth for that matter. The Third is among the very best out there, although I cannot think of a more apotheosis, awe-inspiring closing. And the Eighth is highly electric. In general, Bernstein took a more expansive view of the works in this second traversal, and many would find his first set with the New York Philharmonic more rewardingly straightforward (and less blaring) by comparison. But the beauty of this set is, other than what I said above, is the re-confirmation of Bernstein's very high Mahler credentials, not in matters technical, but how he relates to Mahler's philosophical views of life and death as expressed through music, and through music making. It is a set destined to divide opinions, so personal the readings are. But it is also destined to have us rethink Mahler, Bernstein's views on Mahler, and our own views of what life and death means to us through the vehicles of the music, and the interpretations of it.<br /><br />DG's recording may not be completely natural as sound (again quite blaring in spots), but it is technically outstanding, combining analytical clarity with admirable depth of sonority. The performances, moreover, are uniformly excellent. But to enjoy and absorb the meaningfulness of the music, Bernstein is perhaps the most ready musician out of many who is not at all afraid in letting you know what he really thinks.his first set with the New York Philharmonic more rewardingly straightforward (and less blaring) by comparison.

034538072X|4.0|I must admit I bought Alison Weir's The Six Wives of Henry VIII with great trepidation. I had read and liked a very comprehensive six-volume biography by an author whose name I cannot recollect, and was therefore wary of  reading another author's work on the same subject. I am glad to admit I was  mistaken. The book has been well-researched and is written evocatively  enough to keep your interest from flagging. As a history student, I am used  to poring over dry, dusty tomes; it was a pleasure to feel history come  alive as Ms Weir brought to life one of England's most colourful monarchs.  To all those who carp about her background research, I have only this to  say: From all the reading I have done, her sources are impeccable. Two, you  must realise that Tudor and Elizabethan England was far from being puritan.  The life-style of the court and aristocracy was one devoted to the pursuit  of pleasure. If I cavil at anything, it is that the author does not  elaborate about the political situation prevailing. Henry VIII succeeded in  giving England much-needed political stability.

I  mean, I GREW UP with this thing.  Whenever my mom and I would go to the  library when I was little, I would ALWAYS HAVE to check this book out, so  finally in 1985, when I was 5 years old, she gave me my own copy, and I've  cherished it ever since.  I learned to memorise every line, and to this  day, I can repeat the entire story from start to finish without even  thinking twice!
0385493800|5.0|If you really like Grisham for his Legal action, his courtroom battles and his happy ever afters then you won't like this.....however if you like reading books, any books as long as they are good then i'm sure you'll love  this. I've always been a fan of Grisham however this book was like nothing  he has ever dome before, this was an adventure, it was exciting, moving,  the characters were so real. Once i had gotten started i just couldn't stop  and i found myself actually missing the characters when i had finished the  book. Like i said if you like a good adventure read, with a little bit of  courtroom banter thrown in then you won't find better than this.
0451191153|5.0|I think this book explores Ayn's interesting phlosophy and shows what she beleves.
0375707972|5.0|Schlink is able to take the reader through a process of examining social justice and morality. While the book may be seen as an expression of a relationship between an adolescent male and an adult woman, it is far more  complex.  As world watches the horror in the Balkans, Schlink forces the  reader to understand how little human progress has been made. Power and  pride are the downfall of mankind.  The book is an excellent examination of  the human response to psychology and philosophy as it relates to  motivation.
6304711891|5.0|The Rock is the best action movie yet that you can rent.  Scratch that, its a sin to not buy it.  Sean Connery plays his usual role.  Dashing, debonair, slick, cool.  And Cage plays his usual role.  A little psyco.  Ed  Harris is also excellant.  If your an action movie fan, buy this movie.   Also, look for Desperate Measures, Air Force One, Con Air, and Face/Off.

B0000019PA|5.0|It's MANGUM, not Magnum.  Jeff outdid himself on this record.  I still listen to casettes that he made in his boyhood home including songs like 'Mike's song' and 'Goodbye my Friend.'  Although the sound quality nowadays  is much better, the quality of his lyrics is just as moving.  Way to go  mustard god!
0609603086|2.0|I've read every single book Follet has written and loved them all.  This just isn't up to his normal level of excellence.  Very predictable story line based on a nonsensical premise.  It was never a &quot;can't put it  down&quot; experience.
0812550706|5.0|Well, I don't know if Ender's game is the best science fiction novel ever, but if it isn't, it comes really close. It is certainly the besst sci-fi novel I have ever read.  <br />Ender's game was probably the first  &quot;real&quot; science fiction book that I ever read, and ever since then  it has been my favourite. From the beggining you are caught up into Ender's  struggle and ultimately  his triumph.<br />Card's in depth portrayal of the  zero gravity games and the tactical genius which Ender is captured my  attention from the first time I read the novel and it still draws me in  often as I re read it.
6305265488|5.0|Ever After was great.  It managed to take away the chauvinism but keep the romance.  It shows girls that they don't have to choose between love and independence.  They can have their cake and eat it too.

6305342768|4.0|I'm a big fan of &quot;The Black Hole&quot; and I bought it the second day it came out!  I love this movie, but there is one thing I hate about it.  It is too campy.  I know &quot;Star Wars&quot; had robots, but it wasn't  campy!  &quot;The Black Hole&quot; has 2 (count it 2) robots that look like  kids' play toys instead of robots.  Well on the other hand I suggest that  you buy/rent this movie!
0792151712|5.0|After reading about the Titanic, I thought I could never feel what it was like to be there.  Cameron puts you on the ship with the passengers.  Everything was so real and with the love story to match, simply fabulous.
630349255X|5.0|This film has never lost its excitement for me even though I have watched it many times.  As a person who has travelled around the world, I use it often as a gift for people who may not experience the places and the  mesmerizing sounds the planet has to offer. As an 8mm film with no  dialogue, our children did not see the point of it.  As a film with no  dialog but wonderful tracks of music, chants, it is a great meditational  adventure.  My favorite.
B0000025WQ|5.0|This was the first album I ever remember hearing when I was 4 or 5 years old. I now 17 and still love this album to death. My favorite song is &quot;Witness&quot;, I just love the way she says &quot;but the MELODY,  none at all my love&quot; wow, what an awesome voice. I have continued to  be one of her most  devoted fans. Thank you Cyndi for welcoming me into the  world of music!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001ES4|5.0|I live in Boston and one day on my lunch break, I went to Borders bookstore to browse the travel section.  I sat down on the floor with a travel book in my lap and was minding my own business when I realized that  there was music emanating from the other side of the room.  I stopped  reading and listened and found myself, eyes completely welled-up, more  moved and touched by this music than I'd ever been before.  Secret Garden  was giving a free lunchtime performance and I was lucky enough to have  caught it without even knowing!  After they finished, I immediately  purchased this CD and asked them about the song which had struck me so  beautifully.  It was called &quot;Passacaglia&quot; and it is by far my  most favorite track on the CD.  Give this CD a try and I guarantee you  won't regret it.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|One of the best DVDs out there.  Beautiful, clear picture and re-mixed 5.1 audio ensures detailed bucket loads of gore.<br />Frightening, claustrophobic and hilarious.  It's a genre masterpiece that's still being copied today  and goes to show how a great imagination can triumph over budget  limitations.
0871137380|5.0|Mr Bowden reveals the minds, hearts, and souls of the military men involved in this unfortunate battle. These guys could be all of our brothers or neighbors.   I too was very emotionally and intellectually  enraptured by the PBS special &quot;Ambush in Mogadishu&quot;.  Every  American should know about this conflict and honor the soldiers who fought  there.  I enjoyed the book greatly.  My only complaint is that Mr. Bowden  is such an apolegist for President Clinton. He goes out of his way to  compare Clinton and Somalia with JFK and the Bay of Pigs.  Clinton and his  administration's actions in Somalia should not be justified by anyone.    This book allows for greater understanding and empathy for what is  happening in Kosovo and Yugoslavia now.  These are real people dealing with  a corrupt and immoral President and administration in a no-win situation.   They never learn. Definitely read this book!
B00000269M|5.0|Michael Jackson's &quot;Bad&quot; album had 6 #1 singles off of it. However, when you listen to all of the songs on &quot;Bad&quot; you wonder if there could have  been even more #1 singles. I would highly recommend  this album to anyone who likes some of Michael Jackson's music and to  others who like pop music. This album has more musical flare to it than  Michael's previous two albums. This album is sure to satisfy any fan of  &quot;Thriller&quot; and  &quot;Off the Wall.&quot; People who like pop  music will  consider this one of the best albums ever created. Those who  don't like pop music as much can still love this great album by the King of  Pop.
B000005ITX|5.0|Richard Avedon's Beatles posters, the lava lamp, the carpet made of samples nailed to the wood floor... all abscent witnesses to the golden days when I used to carry this 'album' from house to house. Sounds of loud  talk and laughter usually drowned out &quot;ALL of Gods children gotta have  their FREEdom!&quot;. But to appreciate an all-time classic like this, you  didn't have to be there. Arthur Lee's beautiful voice and the exquisite 12  string guitar and marvelous arrangement is sincerely timeless. The comfort  Love's gentle strains lent to late hours after ragged party nights was  beyond value. The faithful CD recording is full and crisp! Maybe Forever  doesn't change! but wait... SOMETHING's missing!  The scratches... If you  WERE there, be forewarned, the memories come like a flood. You've been  waiting for this CD!
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson has been denounced for &quot;HIStory&quot; just because it wasn't as good as &quot;Thriller&quot; or &quot;Bad.&quot; To all those who think Michael is going  downhill, compare him to the rest of the music  industry. Most artists today will have albums that will sell from 1 million  to 9 million copies.  Those who sell even 3 to 9 million are considered  superstars. Why isn't Michael Jackson one of these superstars with sales  close to 15 million? It's because he is constantly upheld to  &quot;Thriller.&quot; The first album is the best combination of pop music  anywhere (though &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and  &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;  could have made the first disc stronger). The second disc will be  appreciated  by Michael Jackson fans and pop music fans. I like  &quot;Scream,&quot; &quot;They Don't really care about us,&quot; and  &quot;You are not alone.&quot; The second disc is very good and highly  underated. MJJ fans and pop music fans will find that this album is one  they will  be satisfied with after listening to both discs.
0790731940|3.0|Maverick is a very funny update of the vintage western. Mel Gibson is a pleasure to watch as lucky-go-happy cardshark Brett Maverick, and his coupling with southern belle Jodie Foster is a very good one. James Garner,  the original Maverick, is a hoot as a marshall. Look for funny parts by  James Coburn, Graham Greene and a familiar face from Lethal Weapon. The DVD  itself is decent. Picture and sound are good, extras are non existent  (unless pan &amp; scan counts as an extra). Well worth picking up if you  like any of the players.
B0000025RI|5.0|This was the album that made Michael Jackson a superstar. After a stunning performance at  &quot;Motown 25,&quot; sales of &quot;Thriller&quot; went through the roof. The best songs are clearly &quot;Billie Jean,&quot;  &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller.&quot; My personal favorite is  &quot;Thriller.&quot; If you want to hear the best pop album, this should  be your first choice. This album (which is the biggest selling album of all  time) shows how Michael Jackson grew from &quot;Off the Wall.&quot; This is  recommended to lovers of all types of music. You will easily be able to  find several favorite songs on this album.
0062511408|5.0|What a gem.  Coelho sure knows how to keep you interested.  Easy to read in a day, this book should be read by everybody.  In summary, follow your dreams.
B000002BVN|4.0|Michael Jackson's &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; is a good album for fans of &quot;HIStory.&quot; If you would consider &quot;HIStory&quot; as one of your top ten (or top five) albums, you will want to get this album.  I would say that the best remix is the remix of &quot;Scream.&quot; The  five new songs will take a while to get used to, but after that they will  sound good. Some of the songs sounded a little too &quot;hard core,&quot;  and I think Michael Jackson should try not to put as much synthetics into  his songs and he should try instead to build on some of his past success.  He shouldn't copy his past works, but try and continue with the style from  the &quot;Dangerous&quot; album. This is a good album for fans of  &quot;HIStory,&quot; but other Michael Jackson fans may find it to be a bit  more &quot;hard core&quot; than they are used to.
6304383827|5.0|Modern readers accustomed to the antics of King and Crichton often find reading Jane Austen dull. Emma, with Paltrow at the helm, serves as a fitting introduction for those who may find Austen's books boring. The  movie is humorous and lively enough to keep the attention of even the most  rabid Adam Sandler devotee.
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson's &quot;Dangerous&quot; album will sound different from any other album he has done before. Some may say that the sounds he had with &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; were what he needed to  continue with. I think Michael Jackson made the right move when he created  a new style of music. I think the best songs here are &quot;Dangerous&quot;  and &quot;Heal the World.&quot; This album was underated and Michael  Jackson deserves more credit because he created a new sound which was never  heard before. This album will surely satisfy any Michael Jackson fan and  any fan of pop music.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Now this is an amazing CD.  I bought of Why Dont You Get A Job?, but my favorite songs are Staring At the Sun and The End of The Line.  To be honest, every single song on this CD is just utterly brilliant, sarcastic,  and fun!!! Offspring are in your face immature brats, and I love them!!!!!
B000002VCW|5.0|I grew up on the music of Al Stewart and have discoverd forgotten memories through the sounds of the great man on the radio recently. Everyone should listen to great music so start here.
6304167660|5.0|this movie is amazing, the acting is excellent and the story line is excellent as well.. most of you will be jealous to know that I go to high school with Natalie Portman, and get to see her everyday, which is great  considering I am a big Star Wars fan, and she appears as a queen in the  upcoming prequels in may
B000002G7G|5.0|I challenge anyone to find a weak link here. It ranges from the somber &quot;candy says&quot; to the joyous &quot;beginning to see the light&quot;.And the chaos of &quot;the murder mystery&quot; to the  absolutely sublime craftmanship of &quot;pale blue eyes&quot;. This album  isn't better then &quot;velvet underground and nico&quot; because its an  easier listen,it's better because it's just plain emotion.On &quot;velvet  underground and nico&quot; all the true emotion is really masked by nico's  lack of subtlety.Here Lou and Doug alternate flawlessly through borderline  country to borderline gospel. This album is not an option it's a neccesity,  just like air.
0767817443|3.0|Godzilla was fun, but not intelligent.  The cinematography was good, the only good acting was Hank Azaria as Animal.  Everyone else had a stereotypical personality.  Big G looked great.  To be honest, I wished  that the writers refrained from showing his full body until much later in  the movie.  I liked the bits and pieces of him that you saw at first.  It  kind left the rest to your imagination.  I didn't like the crowd scenes  though.   Everybody was just running around like idiots, only doing it  because the director told them to.  None of their fear looked legit. It was  campy, stupid, yet entertaining fun.  It could have stocked up on brains  before it went for the special effects.
B00000637V|5.0|Yet another example of the masses rejecting anything that doesn't sugarcoat things. This album is not cold, it's objective. Lou Reed presents the story, he doesn't judge it. The crushing lines in caroline says 2  &quot;Caroline says as she gets up from the floor,You can hit me all you  want to, but I dont love you anymore&quot; illustrates the characters of  this play perfectly,detached and hopeless. Many don't like believing these  people exist. But reed has never been  afraid to confront his listeners  with such true depictions of the human condition. This album is also more  approprietly produced than the critically acclaimed  &quot;transformer&quot;. &quot;BERLIN&quot; Belong behind only &quot;blood  on the tracks&quot; as the best album of the 70's.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I love Alanis.  Her music is so great.  I think that this album is the best one she's made (she has made 3 other ones).  The Couch is the best song.  I listen to it every day.  It is really soothing music.  For all of  you who like Alanis, this is definitely the album to get.
B00000F1D3|5.0|I truly didn't expect this album to be this good when I bought it.  I love dance music, but many CD albums put out by dance artists at most have a few excellant songs.  But this album doesn't have even one stinker in the  bunch.  I'm still glad that Cher holds her prima diva status!
6305268835|5.0|This is his funniest movie yet!!!!!
B00000IBRX|5.0|Just when you thought Hollywood couldn't put out a great movie, simply amazing!
B00000ILBK|3.0|I think the thing that upset me the most about this movie was the enemy.  A Star Trek movie can only be as good as the bad guys.  Those of you who have seen First Contact know what I am talking about.  First Contact dealt  with creatures that we as viewers had had a history with when watching the  television series. Now these bad guys in Insurrection show up and are  supposed to make me care about their cause? I don't think so.  While  watching this movie I had no feeling that the good guys were in any danger.  Throughout the entire movie I just wanted to scream, &quot;SO WHAT!! WHO  CARES!!!&quot; Another problem was the humor.  First Contact blended humor  with action seamlessly. Those guys at Paramount Pictures were trying too  hard to make this a funny movie that it just came off looking bad. It was  not funny at all. For half of the movie I felt like slapping Data.  Those  of you who have seen this movie know what I am talking about.  Don't get me  started on the special effects.  You want a quality movie, go with First  Contact.
B000002MY3|1.0|This is awful! Please turn it off! Get a voice, get a better mood, get musical, Alanis! You should have put this one in the trashcan and released your second album right away, 'cause &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation  Junkie&quot; is as brilliant as &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is  unbearable!
630197154X|5.0|When will someone write an updated script for the moview based on the Web...keep the name though.  The contridictions in the movie along with the self mokery make is a great film.<br />Matt.
B00000DGUG|4.0|I can't stand Alanis' first album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; - so much more surprised am I about &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;! It is a brilliant album, showing rocking, sexy, sensitive, bitchy, jazzy...  MUSICALly genius sides of this Canadian mega talent. One of the best albums  released this year.
B000003S5H|5.0|Well, I really shouldn't say that these individuals are stupid, but rather that they do not appreciate good music. This album is FANTASTIC. This is the best music to blast in your car!!! Song number one is fabulous. I don't  know if I've heard a better song in months, possibly years. The bassline is  awesome and the moog guitar sounds great. This album should have been album  of the year for 1998. It was the #5 album in Spin - and well, I have other  albums that were placed above it - and I think that this is better than  those. This album rules. It is all catchy electronik pop that sticks in  your head. It is hummable and wonderful. Anyone who just wants to relax and  boogie to some great music - well, I can't think of a better album than  &quot;Moon Safari.&quot;
B000002KJM|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for debut albums. This one has everything I love about debuts. ZZ's raw sound, high energy and no nonsense approach is refreshing. The song writing and musicianship is top quality. Great feeling  on this one. If you like ZZtop this one is a must.
630438551X|3.0|A very interesting, original movie, which seems to get better and better the more times you watch it.   The leading stars are appealing, and an admirable performance is delivered by Postlethwaite as the Friar.  The set  (art direction, I suppose) is very beautiful.  Unfortunately, the first few  times you watch it, its dream-like story seems to crawl and lose all its  dreaminess.  Movies need to have an impact the first time.
1563523302|2.0|This book is a double edged sword.  On one hand it offers some unique insight into the lives of  millionaires and their buying habits and gives some practical (if unoriginal) suggestions: don't buy an expensive house,  car (especially), watch, suit; live below your means, don't spoil your  kids.  But on the other it never really focuses on enjoyment of money. It  seems that all these unlikely millionaires do is accumulate wealth to  accumulate wealth.  Is that the message being presented here? I'm all for  wealth through practicality but the millionaires interviewed have worked  all their lives and have millions to show for it but what else? Most  disturbing quote in the entire book: &quot;If your goal is to become  financially secure, you'll likely attain it...But if your motive is to make  money to spend money on the good life,...you're never going to make  it.&quot;   What is their definition of the good life?  Being the richest  person in the cemetery?
6302860253|5.0|The music is wonderful. The acting very believable and if I have any complaints they are personal. I do not like bullfights or to see women with underarm hair--but as I said, these are personal prejudices and not a  condemnation of the production itself. Certainly the bullfight was  essential to the plot! Placido Domingo is wonderful, both in his singing  and acting ability and if it seemed to some that he was too old to be so  naive...well, a man in love is not necessarily in full command of his wits  (nor is a woman). All in all, even if one is lucky enough to be able to  enjoy 'live' opera, this video is a must for those times when one must stay  home.
B000000QG9|5.0|L'incontro tra uno dei piu' grandi chitarristi degli anni '70 e il bassista dei Deep Purple. Blues, boogie, groove,rock e feeling purissimo, tecnica sicura e sempre inventiva e sopratutto uno dei piu' bei  pezzi del  suo repertorio,  la suggestiva e un po' disperata CALLING CARD.
0312199066|5.0|Gene Cernan's book is absolutely magnificent.  His narrative and insights make one believe that they were right there with him on his Gemini and Apollo flights.  He details how an ordinary American through hard work and  dedication can literally reach the stars.  From the first to last page, I  could not put the book down.  It was too bad that I was born after Apollo  ended, but Cernan's book tells the reader exactly what is was like to be an  astronaut during that exciting and pioneering time of space exploration.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This cd is the best.  I didn't really like the offspring too much before I had the cd, but now I am obsessed with them.  This cd is the best one in my cd collection.  I listen to in nonstop! plus it has a cd extra on it!  you  put it in your computer and it has videos of the offspring that you can  watch.  I love it.  Definitly get this cd if you don't already have it!
B000001F6S|4.0|Ten Years After appeared in 1966, the same year that cream and jimi hendrix made their british debuts, marking a new era in british rock. These bands took american blues and added volume, jazz experimentalism, and their  own unique twist to create a high point in rock development. Ten Years  After featured the incredible guitar work of Alvin Lee, a player who merged  jazz dexterity with rock and blues grittiness, but never achieved the same  notoriety as his compatriots hendrix, clapton, jeff beck, or jimmy page. He  himself always seemed to downplay his own ability, forever trying to outrun  the image of him in sonic oblivion at woodstock. This album, though,  captured the band in its live glory. It runs from scorching blues to  seminal jazz fusion (&quot;woodchoppers' ball&quot;), all driven by lee's  guitar. It is raw, loud, and unpolished, but incredibly good at capturing  this band at their peak. Worth having, if only to capture a unique moment  in rock history.
0767802551|4.0|Overlooked at the time of its release, I really hope Donnie Brasco has found its audience on video and DVD.  The depth of characterization so rare in most films is abundant here, and a lot of the credit goes to both Depp  and Pacino.  This is a really heartbreaking, gritty drama.  Its also  brightened by an astounding performance by Anne Heche that shatters  preconceptions.      As a film, there is little wrong with it, but as a  DVD, there's a lot to be desired. Such a great film deserves extras, other  than just languages and a trailer.  Why don't any newer films ever get  extras?  Its seems that they just get rushed out to the stores without much  preparation.  The picture is great, but I would expect no less from a  modern film.  Watch it for the great movie, don't get your hopes up about  anything else.

0375707972|2.0|I did not enjoy reading The Reader for several reasons.  I'm usually attracted to very strong characters, and the boy/law student allowed himself to be a victim throughout the story.  He allowed his teenage affair  with Hannah to affect his whole life.  I couldn't respect his  attitudes.<br />I thought that Hannah would be the strong character.  She  endured prison and overcame her illiteracy, but then killed herself at the  very moment her life could have begun.<br />I hate to call a book a waste of  time, but this was close to it for me.

B00000BKE1|4.0|After the extremely disappointing No Prayer for the Dying CD, Fear of the Dark is a vast improvement.  It is not as consistent as the classic Maiden albums from the past, but it has its definite strong points.  &quot;Afraid  to Shoot Strangers&quot; has to be my favorite Maiden song of all time.   Lyrically, it is one of the most original things Steve Harris has ever  written, and the music complements the words perfectly, building with the  passion of Dickinson's singing before exploding in a flash of metal fury.   I have always felt that the depth and complexity of Maiden's lyrics in  general were unappreciated, and this song is a prime example.  &quot;The  Apparition,&quot; with it's message of self-determination and positive  motivation, ought to be played to everyone who has ever accused heavy metal  of encouraging depression and suicidal behavior.  The title track,  &quot;Fear of the Dark,&quot; is an instant classic that ranks with any  song they have ever recorded.  &quot;Wasting Love&quot; is another strong  track, and it was certainly nice to revisit Charlotte the Harlot in  &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (Maiden doesn't get nasty very often, but  it's great when they do). Be warned that there are some definite filler  tracks on this CD (&quot;Chains of Misery&quot;, &quot;Weekend  Warrior&quot; come to mind), but on the whole, this is a very good CD.  I  shake my head in wonder why Fear of the Dark didn't sell more than it did.   One day, the heavy metal genre will return to popularity, and albums like  this will be considered classic.  I have seen other people here saying that  the classic Maiden is reforming.  With the original Black Sabbath back as  well, that would just make my year!
B00000ILBK|5.0|I really liked the movie. It had really good special effects
B00000BKE0|2.0|I gave this album another listen the other day, and I remembered why this is my least favorite Maiden album.  While albums like Piece of Mind and Powerslave offered intelligent, imaginative lyrics, Maiden often resorts to  cliche here.  Subject matter varies from the atypical heavy metal attack on  televangelists (&quot;Holy Smoke&quot;) to an uninspired song about aerial  combat (&quot;Tailgunner&quot;).  By the way, &quot;Tailgunner&quot; is a  carbon copy of &quot;Aces High&quot; from Powerlave.  &quot;Mother  Russia&quot; is Maiden's inevitable attempt at a history lesson.  It is  even more formulaic than &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; from the Somewhere  in Time album (another stinker), and is definitely tacked on. They are not  nearly as musically ambitious as they were on past efforts.  It used to be  that Maiden kept you guessing, but the music on No Prayer for the Dying is  so predictable it is depressing.  This album lacks hooks, melody, and Bruce  Dickinson's formidable vocal range is never even challenged.   The only  reason to buy this album is to fill out a collection.  If you are looking  for great music, get Piece of Mind, Powerslave, or Live After Death.   Listen to Maiden in its glory, and you will realize why this album is so  embarassing.
0385255853|5.0|This is the BEST series I have ever read.  I read books quite fast, and these are just the ones I have been waiting for!  They are interesting, dymanic, and have a great plot!  I love Claire &amp; Jamie, and want to  keep on reading about their love and lives.  I can't wait for the next book  to be released.
B000006E17|4.0|The late, great Pier Paolo Pasolini'sfinal film is a strong,unflinching dep-iction of Nazi atrocities. At the timeof its original release,it was the subject of controversy,due to the extreme nature of the film,which  isloosely basd on de Sade's novel. Thefilm is DEFINATELY not for  everyone,andshould never be seen by children.But,for fans of  bold,provocative,Europeancinema,it is a disturbing,graphic,yetpowerful and  beautiful work of art.

6304398395|3.0|Of course, any movie would be a 'cursory' look at the 88-year-long life of Charles Chaplin.  This movie attempts to cover too many areas of his life and is therefore shallow.  However, Downey is incredible.  He not only  bears a distinct resemblance to the young Chaplin, but his performance is  uncanny.  Diane Lane as Paulette Goddard has a striking, glamorous  presence.  Dan Aykroyd as Mack Sennett is amusing.  However, who decided to  cast Moira Kelly as Chaplin's beloved wife Oona?  She is mousy and  nondescript--both in her appearance and in her demeanor--while Oona was  neither.  This movie will give the viewer a brief overview of Chaplin's  life, but read a good biography to learn more.
B0000025T6|3.0|Whereas I respect Bruce for creativity sake, this album is a bit to depressing for me on a regular basis. You basically get just guitar, vocals, and harmonica.  To listen to this over the course of 40 minutes is  not an easy chore. The lyrics are heartfelt though which is alot more than  I can say for anything that has come out in the last few years.
630438551X|3.0|cool movies the actos did a nice job
B00000HZFH|5.0|This is a beautiful, witty and energetic record. I know it's blasphemy, but I think that it's a thousand times more fun to listen to than Perfect From Now On. The lyrics and melodies here are more engaging, the  arrangements just as rich as the previous record but hookier, more  memorable--the instrumental break in &quot;You Were Right&quot; alone is  worth the price of admission.
6302590388|4.0|We seem compelled to make lists. As we aproach the end of the century, it's hard to open a newspaper or magazine without finding out who were the top 10 supermodels of the '90s or the top 10 chicken soup recipes of all  time.  So of course, the question of the best films of all time keeps  popping up, and most critics agree; this is one of those films.  It was  released in Paris in '34 just days before its 29 year old director died.   Moviegoers were still excited by pictures with sound in them at this time,  and the art of film making was evolving rapidly.  As a result, good films  released then earned their &quot;great&quot; status based on how deeply  they influenced the future.  The film remains a very good movie, but in the  opinion of this reviewer it has been surpased in the 65 years since its  release.

6304712936|3.0|I purchased the DVD because I never tire of watching this movie.  The quality of the DVD is not up to par and it is on two sides.  Beware of the return policy.  Had I known you could not return the disc once it's been  opened, I would not have purchased the movie.
6305268835|5.0|I've never particularly liked Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live, but he was good in &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, and I really liked him in this one!  In fact, I'd rate this as one of the better football movies ever  made, and certainly the funniest!  The supporting cast is strong, but  Sandler and his normally annoying Bayou accent are what make this one fly!
B000002AT6|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theatre, all I could do was get caught up in the music.  James Horner has joined other movie score greats like John Williams and Ennio Morricone with this soundtrack.  When you watch  other movie trailers, you can sometimes hear it played in the background.
B000001E3V|5.0|I generally agree that the Allmans Live at the Fillmore is probably the greatest live rock recording ever, but...    Can you think of a better kick-it-off song than Got To Get Better In A Little While?  This is  virtuosity, top to bottom.  We all know the pain EC was going thru with  drugs and his love for Patti Harrison, and we know it inspired his playing  at the time.  But listen to Bobby Whitlock on keyboards, listen to Carl Radle  on bass, listen to Jim Gordon on drums.  They followed Clapton wherever he  went musically and made it all come together.      I've seen the man live in  the late 80s and early 90s, and on a lot of videos for benefits and the  like...and I would think any Clapton fan would agree that he has NEVER  matched the outright emotional playing he achieved during these Fillmore  shows.

0783229887|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Chucky. And I thought that this movie was the best in the series yet. The road movie format and Martha Stewart references were funny and original and gave this movie a unique touch all its own. I really  look forward to the sequel. Chucky Rules Dude!

0679745203|5.0|This book reads like fine poetry. Yet, it still retains the necessary form that stiches together the memories of a dying man into the tragic story of forbidden love and the triumph of the spirit over a withering body.  The  story lazily follows the stories of several remarkable people before,  during, and after World War II. Hanna is a young nurse who is embittered by  a terrible war and finds sanctuary in the care of a mysterious war victim,  who by a random occurance gains the title of the English Patient. By his  side are Kip, an Indian bomb dismantler, and Caravaggio, a Canadian thief,  both suffering from wounds on the exterior and interior. In the midst of  their temporary home in an Italian villa floats their stories, each marked  by extraordinary traits. As the English Patient drifts between their world  and his own, each tendril of story slowly completes the complicated weave  that Ondaatje has created.  This book is one of the most beautiful things I  have ever read. I most strongly recommend it to anyone who wishes to  experience, instead of read, a book.
B000001ZS4|5.0|This is the album that brought me (like the previous writer below) into the electronic music fold. The promise of instrumental synth-pop was realized here, and very few times since. Equinox, and maybe a Vangelis  album or two standout amid the insuing Euro-synth-trash that followed and  unlimately (tragically) led to knuckle-heads like Yanni.
6300182266|5.0|It is so irritating to hear people compare GALACTICA with STAR WARS! This film has nothing to do with SW. I agree with a previous writer about the ships' designs and special effects. Outstanding! And the costumes were good  enough to win an EMMY AWARD for that year. The family ties really showed  and was the heart of the series. A must see!
0152465030|5.0|The Little Prince is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is truely a beautiful book, more precious or brilliant than any diamond.  It is a book that will become a cherished treasure.  It literally will change your  life, and change your persetion of the world.  <br />I was struck while  reading the reviews of The Little Prince, as to how universally love it is.   It seems to touch on the very essense of life, and love.  Happiness, and  contentment can be found in the simplest things in life, and in the end  that is all that really matters.

B000002AV5|5.0|MAN!!  When I first started listening to Sade a while back, some friends warned me not to listen to her in the wrong mood, as her songs such as &quot;Jezebel&quot;, &quot;Is It A Crime&quot;, &quot;No Ordinary  Love&quot;, and &quot;Pearls&quot; will have you sitting in a dark room  with a loaded gun(jokingly).  I was somewhat skeptical at first, thinking  this songstress would be crooning about the horrors of love.  WAS I EVER  WRONG!!!  Well, they were wrong more, but that's another story.  One of my  top 5 songs of all time will allways be &quot;Sweetest Taboo&quot;.  This  CD captures all of her famous sound with her trademark voice (personally,  this collection would be complete if it had &quot;Keep Looking&quot; from  her &quot;Love Is Stronger Than Pride&quot; CD and &quot;I Couldn't Love  You More&quot; from her &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; CD, but that's like wanting  to take back a Mercedes-Benz because it had a scratch on the bumper).  She  may not have the vocal range of a Teena Marie, but I still consider her to  be one of the best female artists the 80's and 90's have ever seen.   Combine her vocal talents with the pure talent of her musical  accompanyment, and this becomes a must have.  Get this CD if you're looking  for a lot of replay value.
6305342741|4.0|The first thing you're gonna notice about this re-release is the lack of any Disney markings, with the exception of one: the tiny little print in the bottom-left hand corner of the box that reads, &quot;Disney  Enterprises&quot;. Disney...&quot;ENTERPRISES&quot;??? Boy, no bragging  about this tape, huh?<br />Michael, it wasn't that bad. Trust me. Was the  film that bad? I mean, after all, you can see where &quot;Event  Horizon&quot; got its inspiration...:)<br />I really can't see why they took  their name off the tape and left the copyright on there. I mean, if you  look at it, what have the Disney animated films become? The Beast gets  stabbed in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. &quot;Aladdin&quot; was about  a street-thief who had to &quot;steal to eat&quot;. And the Lion King had  two lions hitting each other in the face with flames surrounding them,  while echoes of Mufasa's death played. Then you had &quot;The Hunchback of  Notre Dame&quot; in which one character kills a baby's parents and later  sings of &quot;Hellfire&quot; and pictures himself lusting after Esmerelda.  Finally, we see &quot;Mulan&quot;, where the title character dresses up as  a guy, risking treason, where the penalty is death, and fights off an  entire army. Along the way, Disney took hits for being both sexist and  racist, capitalizing on and exploiting ethnic cultures that weren't theirs  to touch. And their name appears, covering &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;?  Disney's ONLY PG-rated cartoon. The PG-rating came forth because of the  dark violence and the villian who looked like Satan's worst  nightmare.<br />And then you have &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, one of two  seemingly forgettable Disney sci-fi's. &quot;Tron&quot; was the other one.<br />This film does have quite a cast to back up its reputation. Academy  Award-winner Ernest Borgnine, Academy Award-nominee Robert Forster, Max  Schell, Anthony Perkins, and the always lovable Roddy McDowall as the voice  of &quot;Vincent&quot;, the good-guy crew's robot. Yes, their performances  vary, and yes, the dialogue is hammy, but you know what, the dialogue is  there when needed. That's all that counts. I can find about fifty films  last year that can't make that cut(let's start with Something About  Mary...). Leave the rest up to special effects(Rhineheart's ship is a wow!)  and great poetic moments(check out &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot;)  and you get a nicely-rounded fun ride through a nightmare and back again.  Picture Event Horizon<br />Yes, this one DOES show &quot;hell&quot; at the  end. And for it's time, it IS a very scary depiction. But, it also DOES  show &quot;Heaven&quot;. The point of these visions was not to be  controversial, but rather, to give a message that we don't know about the  things that lurk on the other sides of the universe.<br />And perhaps, we  shouldn't pry.<br />Check out this small wonder that Disney has chosen to  dismiss and see for yourself. Along with TRON, WATCHERS IN THE WOODS, and  THE DEVIL AND MAX DEVLIN, this one is worthy of a place in the  &quot;Saturday Afternoon Matinee Hall-of-Fame&quot;.<br />--Matthe good-guy crew's robot.

0140277447|3.0|Touted as &quot;the first book in English about the Nanking massacre&quot;, it is not; Dick Wilson includes a detailed account in his account of the Sino-Japanese war &quot;When Tigers Fight&quot;.  The  author, being of Chinese heritage, begins her account with a statement to  the effect that everyone in her family new about the massacre, though none  experienced it personally.  This sets the tone for the type of  historiography which follows.  While she does do an excellent job of  relating accounts of survivors and other details of a tragedy about which  there is not enough awareness in the west, such an important story deserved  firmer foundations.  I am not, by any means, questioning what took place,  but (for example) she relies on a single contemporary newspaper account to  back up a statement that because of the Japanese the population of a  certain Chinese city was reduced from many thousands to just ten people;  query as to whether that would be an adequate source for a term paper, let  alone a book which purports to be ground-breaking.  And granted, the  Japanese did some terrible things in China and elsewhere, but the book  seems full of negative generalizations about the Japanese which many would  probably find objectionable if directed at other ethnic groups.
6305342776|5.0|This DVD is AWESOME!!!  I remember seeing this movie as a teenager and it had a tremendous impact on me.  As an adult, I am a little more critical.  As far as movies go, this may not be the best movie in the world but it  definitely has a place in science fiction history.  From a technical  standpoint, Anchor Bay Entertainment (who the film is licensed through) did  a fantastic job digitally remastering this.  I have grown accustomed to my  pan-n-scan, looks like it was filmed through frosted glass copy of the film  on VHS that came out in the eighties.  From the first second of the first  scene my jaw was literally hanging open with amazement.  &quot;This looks  SO GOOD!!!&quot;  For one thing, being able to see it in the widescreen  format as I did in the theater was a real treat, but the clarity and  vividness of the colors is enough to make you want to buy a DVD player just  to watch this film.  The film was also remastered from Dolby Stereo to  Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.  If you have the equipment, this is a great  showcase film for demonstrating DD5.1.  I highly recommend any fan, even  the casual viewer, to buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.
B00000ADG2|1.0|I was really excited about getting this c.d. &quot;Doo Wop&quot; has been one of my favorites songs recently, but when I listened to this album I about died!!! It was soooo boring. I don't see why everyone is so  &quot;excited&quot; about this c.d. &quot;Ex=Factor&quot; is the only other  song I would consider okay. She has an okay voice, but the music was just  slow and boring!!! Overall, it's a waste of $15.
B000004286|5.0|This soundtrack is very moving. It embraces the theme of Braveheart and its hero William Wallace. The pipes and the oboe on many of these scores captures the music that flows in my veins. It has a rich Gaelic feeling.    As a Scots I am very pleased with this soundtrack composed by James Horner.  Not only does it honor a true hero, William Wallace but a country that has  long struggled for freedom, Scotland. A GENUINE MASTERPIECE.    - H.  Wallace
6304233639|2.0|This movie had an intersting concept, okay- an awesome concept, but it was executed poorly.  Don't you think that if a ship the size of Mercury would be detected by NASA before it parked next to the moon?  And wouldn't it's  parking spot have a tidal effect on earth?  If these octopus men in the big  flying saucers flew ninety million light-years to destroy cities with one  laser blast, don''t you think that they would've heard of a computer virus?   But what the hey, ID4 doesn't slow down for logical details like that.  An  attention span is not required with a flick like this.       Dean Devlin  and Roland Emmerich think they're tough stuff, ID4's box-office invasion  cashed in more money than Star Wars, and then, when TriStar snagged the  rights for the Godzilla franchise in 1995, they new who to turn to.  Boy  were they wrong.  After one year of short, cryptic previews on E! and in  theaters, the buzz began for the update of Big G.  I quess the ID4 duo got  a big confidence boost from all of the hype Godzilla got, and they whipped  up a paper thin plot that reduced you to snores.  This happened with  Stargate, which resulted in a mild sleeper success, and in ID4, though it  made millions.  Godzilla was a victim of too much hype, and by now, the  Devlin and Emmerich boys have proved themselves to be unoriginal buffoons  who  like special effects.      Boys, boys, boys.  A movie that it all  style and no substance can insult the intelligence of the viewer, but if it  is so bad that it reflects your sense of storytelling, it needs to be  redone.  Characters are important.  And they're needs to be a sense of  logic and feasability in you idea.  Don't just add oblagatory dialogue that  will only boost the plot, make us care about the people in it.  In ID4 and  Godzilla, I found myself anxiously waiting for the aliens and the big green  guy.  I didn't give a flip about these people because they were all too  stereotypical.  Sorry buds, but your movie trailers are worth more than  your storytelling talent.        If I made a movie, I would read every  review I could, watch the movie over and over until I had every mistake  that I made pinned down.  Then I would try no to make those mistakes in my  next movie.  Maybe the Dreadfull Duo think that they know more than us, and  they do the same thing repeatedly.      Why do people remake only the good  movies, and make fools of themselves in doing it?  Why not remake movies  that weren't good enough, and do it right?  Cause' someone needs to show  these boy's how it is done.
B00000I8UD|5.0|&quot;Dead Bees&quot; is dead gorgeous.  <br />This album has a little bit for everybody - bits of &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot;, &quot;Gone To Earth&quot;, and &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot;, his 1980's solo albums, but  with a more distinctive India influence.  Parts are easy listening (&quot;I  Surrender&quot;, &quot;Thalmide&quot;) and other parts are funky (&quot;God  Man&quot;).  Sylvian's wife Ingrid Chavez contributes beautifully spoken  and sung vocals.<br />The sound is less dense than on previous recordings -  almost sounding &quot;open air&quot; and freer than in the past.  There are  hints of sounds passing through the mix which you'll catch with repeated  listenings.<br />I was worried because I'd read a couple of so-so reviews in a  couple of music magazines.  Don't believe them.  If you liked Sylvian's  80's solo albums but with a more mature edge and sound, you'll like  &quot;Dead Bees On A Cake&quot;.

0375707972|3.0|As an American living in Germany I have confronted many of the issues that are addressed in this book.  I was especially taken aback by the analysis of what the second (and in my case the third) generation should do with the  information it now has of the Holocaust.  In my time here I have visited  several of the terrible concentration camps, and each time I am just as  horrified at what I see.  I think that this book does a good job of  addressing these issues.  While I can't say that I loved the book (the  relationship between the young boy and 35 year old woman was especially  troubling to me), it really made me think.
6301902645|5.0|This movie is a closet masterpiece, Grand Prix was good, but too soap opraish at times. The sound of the 917 howling down the Mulsanne is worth the price alone. Real race car driver David Piper lost his leg during the  course of shooting the film.
B000003S2O|4.0|Brian Eno knows how to bring background music into the foreground.  I'm reminded of David Behrman.  The mood is also similar to the Eno/Fripp collaborations; soothing music that will also make you think.
0316152196|5.0|This book kept me from page one through the end.  I loved the Harry's character.  What I loved best was that I had no idea where this would lead and never would have guessed the end.  I read Blood Work which everybody  raves about.  This book surpasses by far.
6300218031|5.0|I grew up in the L.A. area in the 1970's. I had an obnoxious sister, a &quot; greaser &quot; good friend, and a beautiful good &quot; buddy &quot; I didn't realize was there.  Believe me, this film tells it like it was for  some of us. If my &quot; buddy &quot; looked like Mary Stuart Masterson,  there would be a Mrs. in front of my Mr. on our Christmas cards. John  Hughes was paying attention.
B000002KDX|5.0|This debut record is a very under appreciated acoustic classic that is full of wonderful guitar work and great vocal arangements that are accentuated by beautiful harmonies.  The songs on this record are  wonderfully constructed with the basics  elements.  The lack of production  is what gives this record its personality.  There are very familiar songs  such as &quot;A Horse With No Name&quot; and the simplistic but beautiful  &quot;I Need You&quot; but these are the fluff and not the real meat of  this work.  Songs like &quot;Three Roses&quot; and &quot;Riverside&quot;  display a vibrant acoustic guitar strumming while songs like  &quot;Clarice&quot; give you a beautifull lilting melody accompanied by the  ever present acoustic guitar.  This record is intertwined with very  original acoustic guitar work such as in the acoustic lead play and rythmic  struming crescendo of &quot;Hear&quot;.  The great vocal arangements,  harmonies  and melodies make this record great to sing along with and  listen to time and time again.  This project is compared with CSN&amp;Y but  is much less melancholy thanks in part to the use of maj 7th chords and the  song writing styles.  The simplicity of this classic gives it a certain  innocence that is lacking in a CSN&amp;Y record.  For those who love  acustic music with great harmonies and melodies and done with a great  passion and craftmanship this is a must have.  Enjoy.
0802133347|5.0|This is a beautiful novel that is fragile yet steel-strong. The emotions of its characters are extremely well-developed, for e.g. Connie's dogged loyalty towards Clifford in the beginning turns slowly into doubt, and  finally into contempt. This is a novel about the path to freedom, not only  sexual freedom, but freedom from pressure, from rules, from the chains of  life and society. Although there are only 3 main characters: Connie,  Clifford and Mellors, this book does not bore me. Some authors may kill the  novel when handling so delicate a subject, but Laurence not only allows the  emotions of his characters to live, but also gives them room for  expression. Connie's sexual desire is placed in the context of an England  that is slowly being brutalised by industrialism, and the author  expresses  his horror against this world we had created through the eyes of Connie.   As Connie is slowly being suffocated by her husband, I feel, surprisingly,  not hate for Clifford, but a strange pity. This book sparks neither love  nor hate for its characters, but the reader is able to weigh them at their  true value. In this way, the novel itself is never overpowered by the  strength of its characters. The author allows us to find our own freedom  while Connie seeks hers.  This book  improves with a second reading. At  first the characters seem rather detached, but later they fitted out  wonderfully. The language, of course, is beautiful. Everyone is in their  own way suffocated by something, and that is why as a teenage reader I can  relate myself to Lady Chatterley.
B000000HSU|5.0|The Bad Brains was the first HC band ever and this is one of the best HC albums ever.  After listening to this record you feel like you've been beaten up.  Furious and fast with the exception of the well done reggie  songs.  You should already own it.
B00000AFFI|5.0|Coming from a mainly heavy metal background I find that Polly Jean is a relaxing sway from what I normally listen to, &quot;Is This Desire&quot; is another great collection of songs. With PJ's use of melody and pulsing  bass, this album sets a mood that few follow. &quot;Is This Desire&quot; is  a welcome to my collection and I highly reccomend it to any true fan of  music.

6303212379|5.0|I've seen this movie no less than at least 75 times, and every time that I watch it, I learn to love it more every time. I guess I like this movie so much because evry time that I watch it I go back to my childhood. This  movie is now, and will forever be my favorite movie of all time. I highly  recommend this one to people of all ages, I hope that you appreciate it as  much as me. A true Goonies fan til' the end.  Jason
630522885X|1.0|I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw &quot;Lola Montes&quot;, had made its way to DVD.  I was so thrilled I couldn't get my money out fast enough.  Of course, I took for granted that the negative had been restored  and the telecine transfer had been made from a new 35mm interpositive on  the Philips &quot;Spirit&quot;.  I also took for granted that the best  audio facility would have been employed re-record the track of a film this  important cinema history.  Well, I was wrong on both counts and badly wrong  at that.  It's almost as though someone found a 16mm print that had been  left outside in a garbage dump for twenty years and mastered it rather than  go through the expense of restoring this masterpiece.   It is simply the worst looking print  and worst sounding track I have ever experienced on VHS or DVD.  If you're  hoping to see one of the world's great films beautifully restored and  re-recorded, look somewhere else.
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA drops more jewels then Russell Oliver, a corny Toronto jewellery dealer that advertises on late night TV.  When studying your 120 lessons, this album can be your coles notes to becoming 5%. I'm not a 5%er, but the  GZA has gems of knowledge for every man, woman and child on his album.  4th  Chamber, is the choice cut here.  RZA's verse, (the third), is by all  means, the best verse in all of hip hop history.  &quot;...the years  2002/the battles filled with the WU/6 million devils just died from the  beubonic flu...&quot;
6304795254|5.0|Combines many aspects of different movie genres, including very effective film noir aspects.  It is obvious that the screenwriters and Fincher know what they are doing.  The story couldn't be better with lots of  philosophical questions and is full of suspense.  You constantly want to  find out what happens next and throughout the journey you are sceptical  that it will be successful but halleluja!  Douglas is ideal and I am very  surprised that this previous viewer from San Diego was disappointed with  the characterization of the film - IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE!  Most  definite: one of the best American films I have seen - among Highlander,  Contact, etc.
B000002513|5.0|I just read in horror my own online review of one of the master's masterpieces-- THE WILD, THE INNOCENT AND THE E STREET SHUFFLE. I have no idea why I included the song SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT as one of the highlights  of this album. Of course SPIRIT is from GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK, Bruce's  1st record. I apologize to all. (And while I'm sending you over to  GREETINGS, let me tip my hat to another miraculous moment in Bruce  History.)<br />But it's still WILD, THE INNOCENT that does it for me.  <br />&quot;Good night, it's all right, Jane, I'll meet you tomorrow night on  Lover's Lane...&quot;<br />Just thinking about those words from INCIDENT ON  57th STREET brings me back to the moment in my life that Bruce sang into  the core of my heart and took up permanent residence. <br />He may be in the  Hall of Fame now, but to me he's still Spanish Johnny, Wild Billy, Boy  Prophet... and Scooter (from BORN TO RUN'S &quot;10th Avenue Freezeout).  Now if only I could be his Rosie, his Kitty, his Wendy in BORN TO RUN and  &quot;get to that place where we really want to go and we'll walk in the  sun.&quot;<br />Bruce Springsteen writes the stories we've all lived. And  nowhere does he tell a story better than on THE WILD, THE INNOCENT AND THE  E STREET SHUFFLE.
B000002G30|5.0|While they are currently relegated to opening for Marilyn Manson, Monster Magnet undoubtedly deserves to be touring on their own. Dopes to Infinity was probably one of, if not THE most underrated rawk album of 1995. You  will really be missing a gem if you don't buy this one.
078401213X|5.0|All of Max's paranoid searches culminate in a single moment of crystal clarity that defies the imagination. It took me a long time to come down off of the buzz I got from this movie...I hadn't felt this way about a  movie since I last saw &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;..a must-watch. A warning,  however: not everyone will &quot;get it&quot;. For those who can keep an  open mind, the movie will be more enjoyable...
B00000DHRZ|4.0|This CD is sweet! I don't have it, so I can't rate it 5 until I hear the other two songs from it that I haven't heard yet. The rest of the songs so far are cool. My favorites are Pretty Fly and Americana. Definitely worth  buying.
0451196716|4.0|I love &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;.  I think the 4 tales are some of King's most interesting stuff, and they are very enjoyable for me, since they depart from his standard horror writing.  I decided to post this  review, however, because of the appearance of this edition on the shelves.  The 4 tales of &quot;TBB&quot; are novellas, really, and not long enough,  in my humble opinion, to warrant an individual release.  So what we have  here is the publisher splitting up the original collection (priced at  $7.99), and asking the exact same price for 1/4 of the material.  Oh, but  wait, it's been spread out by approximately 100 pages to make it thicker.  Good grief, Stephen, like you need the money...  My advice: go to the used  bookstore, find &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;, and let this overpriced book  collect dust on the shelf.
0449911357|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes was one of the best books I have ever read.  It made you laugh and cry.  The characters all had so much personality and feeling, it was like I was really right there at Whistle Stop or with Ninny and  Evelyn at the nursing home.  I think one of the best parts about the book  was how the stories, though happening at different times and being narrated  by different people, all conected and worked together to become one story  about life.  I also enjoyed how Fannie Flagg brought Ruth and Idge's  relationship into the story, but was never shoving it in your face.  We  need more books like that that show gay relationships but don't center on  them.  This book is a must read for everyone.
B000002IJL|5.0|Since the movie is so wonderful and touching, the soundtrack is a good CD to go with the collection. For &quot;Stand By Me&quot; fans or fans of 50s music, this CD is an excellent choice. Stand By Me by Ben E King is a  classic.
B000002IM7|5.0|I bought this album after first buying the 2nd album by KING'S X, &quot;Gretchen Goes to Nebraska&quot;. Not as artsy or quite as creative as &quot;Gretchen&quot;, this still ranks as one of my all-time favorite CD's  because of the honest lyrics and spiritual dynamics of the material. If you  want to hear rock music that LIVES and emphasizes the positive rather than  all of the status quo garbage out there, this will be one of your faves. I  only wish KING'S X hadn't lost this feel in their music. - Brad Farha
0792151712|2.0|Frankly, this Titanic did not deserve 11 oscar nominations and especially did not deserve the best picture win.  L.A. Confidential was a much much better film with a real story line and much better acting.  The acting in  Titanic was horrible. If you want to see Leo act, see Whats Eating Gilbert  Grape, when he should have won best supporting actor...

0871137380|5.0|Ooops.  We have a hundered or so American troops trapped inside a city of one million very ticked off, very well armed Somolians.  Help is around the corner, but nobody knows which corner it is.  Mr. Bowden interviewed key  people on both sides of the conflict, as well as off site players.  He then  used his considersble writer's gifts to give life to his meticulous  research.  Be prepared for disappointment once you start this book:  either  you will have to pause for sleep or work, which you will not want to do; or  you will continue reading, thereby upseting your sleep cycle or employer or  spouse.
6305308659|4.0|I enjoyed Pleasantville at the theater much more than I expected to...and its release on DVD makes it even better!    The movie's story is engaging, entertaining, and thought-provoking (if you can ignore a few logical  loopholes...hence the four-star rating instead of five).     And then there  are the effects...which the Pleasantville DVD spends quite a bit of time  explaining, and it's absolutely fascinating (at one point in the featurette  that accompanies the movie, we're told that this movie contained some 1,700  digital effects, and took up a total of 7,000 Gigabytes of computer storage  space)!    This one's worth the price...get Pleasantville on DVD!
0780623703|5.0|I have heard the good and the bad reviews, and all I can say to people who are saying &quot;not realistic enough&quot; is...remember the opening words? &quot;ONCE UPON A TIME...&quot; For a fairy tale, which is what this  movie basically is, it is very good. I enjoyed the special effects, and  would recommend this movie.

B000002J1O|5.0|In late 1973 the post-Beatles British Rock movement came to its climax. Among the albums recorded and released at this time are ELP's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery,&quot; King Crimson's &quot;Lark's Tongues in Aspic,&quot;  and the greatest of them all, Genesis' &quot;Selling England By the  Pound.&quot;  Where other post-Beatle bands chose to soar into the journey  of the soul, or to explore apocalyptic anti-technology themes, Genesis  stayed here on Earth, specifically Southeastern England, to record the  collapse of the British nation into political, economic, social, and  cultural nothingness.  The songs on &quot;Selling England&quot; reflect the  destruction of folklore, of history, of social meaning in post-War life.   Tapping on literary sources from early English poetry, Edmund Spenser's  equally lyrical &quot;The Faerie Queen&quot; (1590) to T.S. Eliot's equally  bleak write-off of Industrial/Captialist Culture &quot;The Waste  Land(1922), Genesis created a vision of Shakespeare's &quot;Scepter'd Isle  (Richard II) transmogrifying into a corporate &quot;Aisle of Plenty.&quot;  <br />Muscially brilliant, moving from A-cappella cris de coeur to searing  guitar solos, flowing keyboard lines to inventive bass and drum work,  Genesis never bore, even in the long instrumentals that give weight to  &quot;Selling England.&quot;   A cohesive work far surpassing other  post-Beatle concept albums (including their own misguided &quot;Lamb&quot;  disaster), the classical and European avant-garde influences blend  seamlessly with Genesis's own visions to create something wholly new,  wholly Western, and wholly post-modern.  <br />A work of sorrow, rage, and  shock, in its way, Selling England By the Pound&quot; is the upper-class  equivalent of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks,&quot; and far more genuine.   Gabriel, Banks, and Rutherford were all well-educated members of the Upper  Class, trained at Charterhouse, Collins was a child-stage star, while  Hackett was one of the many middle-class kids seduced by rock and roll.   <br />The 1973 oil-shock and subsequent world depression destroyed  post-Beatles rock, and after &quot;Lamb&quot; Genesis dumbed itself down to  the point of non-existence. <br />As a sharp rendering of that brink moment  when all of Western Civilization came crashing down into a post-modern  late-capitalist heap where no artistic statement is important, and where  the commodity of humanity is worth less than the money humans might have to  spend, &quot;Selling England by the Pound,&quot; like all great works of  art, borders on prophecy.
B000002LIR|5.0|Rod is my favorite of all time.I have every album  of his either as cd or on vinyl.His early work with  the Faces is great,but I enjoy his later cheesy(even disco) songs just as much.All his styles are included  in this  box set.He's never afraid to try something new  or unexpected.<br />Rock on  Rod!!
6305126062|5.0|I read the book, I watched the movie.  I reread the book and rewatched the movie.  It is definately a kleenex kind of movie.  All the characters were strong and the acting was superb.  The music was outstanding and the  scenery was breathtaking.  I am ready to move to the west. Watch this movie  over and over but remember the kleenex, it doesn't get any easier the more  you watch.

0684867621|5.0|For all of you Stephen King fanatics out there, Stephen's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon hits bookstores on Tuesday, April 6.  Definitely vintage King (imo). Though some of the words/thoughts used by the main character,  Trisha, seemed a little too grown-up, she is a character you'll come to  cheer for just as much as she idolized her hero, Tom Gordon (a relief  pitcher for the Red Sox).  For me, once I reached the part where she  tumbled head over heels down a hillside, I had to keep reading.  In fact, I  couldn't read/turn the pages fast enough.  In fact, the tension was as  thick for me as it was in the climatic scenes of classics such as Cujo,  'Salem's Lot, The Shining, &amp; It.  Great stuff for those of you who  like to be hit over the head with suspense, tension, a little blood &amp;  guts, the ewwwwwwww factor, and characters who have a seemingless bottom of  will to go on ... oh, and don't forget, a bogeyman!  &lt;ewg&gt; Sue  &lt;&lt;--- who ain't gonna veer off the beaten path any time too soon  after reading this story!

0486281523|5.0|This is a fascinating collection of puzzles from the master of mathemagics.  It's clear and undeniable: if you want the best in fun, challenging puzzles, buy anything written by Gardner or his heir apparent,  Terry Stickels.  You can't go wrong!!!

0465068359|5.0|Iris Chang's THE RAPE OF NANKING is a work that cannot be ignored. I am only a ninth grader, but I was horrified at the history of the Nanking Massacre. It is truly a &quot;forgotten holocaust&quot;, the people  murdered and tortured there deserving a one-sentence mention in my history  book. Those who claim that the pictures are &quot;doctored up&quot; offer  little or no evidence for that statement, and, in turn, are denying the  event themselves. Others who complain that Chang is biased seem to think  that anyone who studies such a horrifying history CANNOT be biased- it is  so terrible, one has to hold an opinion of sorts. Other reviewers who  wished that Chang compare the massacre there to the one committed by the  Chinese in Tibet missed the point. This book is not about the atrocities  the Chinese committed (which are many, not just on Tibetans but on their  own people) but a completely different event... While the brutalities on  the Tibetans are widely-known and well-publicised, the Nanking Massacre is  not common knowledge. This book, though, is helping to make it one.
6304645635|5.0|Unlike Jane Austen who romanticized the travails  her heroines had to endure in order to attain love, social position, and wealth, this engaging adaption of the Anne Bronte classic proves the old adage that one should  always be careful of what they wish for.  They just might get it.<br />This  film is essentially a moral tale on the dangers of infatuation, the soul  killing effect of an abusive and loveless marriage, and the possibility of  love refound for a heart zinged once too often.<br />Tara Fitzgerald gives a  performance worthy of any Oscar actress as the lead character Helen Grahm,  who in the beginning is fooled into love by a &quot;gentleman&quot; who has  everything a woman could look for in a husband.  Yet she discovers to her  horror her husband is much more than the upstanding lord he makes himself  out to be.<br />As the &quot;upstanding gentelman,&quot; Rupert Graves plays a  character that could easily have been portrayed as a typical lord/lout  found in many novels.  His Lord Huntingdon is much more complicated.  Truly  a man created by an environment of entitlement, wealth, and absolute power  bestowed on members of the upper classes.  And this film holds no punches  to depict how truly awful he and his friends were in their relationships  with the fairer sex.<br />As for Toby Stephens, he is the embodiment of the  renewing effects love can have on a person who has suffered so much.  His  determination to forgo the consequences of befriending Ms. Grahm and  assisting her may seem cliched, but Stephen's presents a man who acts not  only out of his own personal emotional needs, but a greater indignant  reaction to the injustice of the situation of Ms. Grahm.<br />Wonderful  performances, beautiful cinematography, a strong storyline, and timeless  characters all add up to provide a romantic, yet realistic film.
B00000I8UD|5.0|Dead Bees On A Cake features 14 new tracks, and blends the deft lyricism of Sylvian's solo work with the sound of Rain Tree Crow. A bit of a blues influence is present as well. The tracks are mostly excellent, though a few  of the later songs are a bit too &quot;deep&quot; for my tastes. Still -  it's a must-have.
B000002A9Z|5.0|I bought the Vinyl LP when it was first released.  More impressed with Stills than Bloomfield or Kooper at the time.  It has come to make no difference.  The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.  Listen to  this during the day and the jazzy stuff hits you.  Listen in the wee small  hours of the morning and those blues sneak right in, and grab your soul.   Then, before you call it a night, sit quiet, real quiet, and let the short  but haunting, &quot;Harvey's Tune&quot; soak in.  Yeah, 31 years, two vinyl  copies, and 3 Compact Discs of Super Sesssion.  And a 20 year old son who  says, &quot;dad, that's cool.&quot;  He's right.
B0000025DD|5.0|I first got this album on tape when I was 12 years old in 1988 since David Gilmour is my fave Floyd member.  His guitar work and vocals are killer.  Then, I got this on CD in 1991 and rebought the CD in 1995 since I gave my  friend my first copy cos he liked the album.  This album has a rocking edge  and best songs are &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Mihalis&quot;,  &quot;Short and Sweet&quot; and &quot;Cry From the Street&quot;.  If you  have to buy solo Floyd this album and the follow up David Gilmour solo  album About Face are recommended.  This should have gone Platinum (too bad  in 1978 disco and Grease reigned the charts).
6305358613|4.0|During its theatrical run, critical praise of ELIZABETH was subdued somewhat due to the film's historical inaccuracy and emphasis on melodrama.  While both of these observations are admittedly correct, ELIZABETH is  none-the-less a spectacular production.  From the riveting opening credits  to the chilling finale, this movie is full of provocative dramatic  elements: sex, betrayal, politics, religion, violence, and revenge.  The  cinematography, set design, and costumes are outstanding.  The settings  alternate between dank medieval gloom and brilliant regal spendor.  Cate  Blanchett gives a dynamic performance of Meryl Streep calibre.  (She should  have won the Oscar, but ELIZABETH wasn't nearly as popular as SHAKESPEARE  IN LOVE.)  In plot and theme, ELIZABETH is like a hybrid of THE LION IN  WINTER and THE GODFATHER.  It begins as the reign of Elizabeth's sister,  Queen Mary (&quot;Bloody Mary&quot;)is coming to an end.  The film then  details the controversial ascension of Protestant young Elizabeth to the  throne. The movie focuses on the early years of her reign, as Elizabeth  struggles to solidify her power and overcome conflicts of religion and  political intrigue; questions of marriage; and numerous plots to depose or  assassinate her.  As previously mentioned, the movie takes a good deal of  license with history, taking events and relationships that occurred  throughout Elizabeth's reign and condensing them into the first few years  of her reign.  Overall, ELIZABETH is an excellent production-- as chilling  and dramatic as SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is romantic and funny.  The two films  are wonderful counterparts.
6304712936|4.0|It's too bad a movie of this caliber had to be a flipper. This is the type of movie that sets a mood and tone that shouldn't be disrupted. Beyond that, everything else was great. I loved how the music flowed on my home  theater system. The actors were so believable and the story was downright  interesting. I wished this movie could have been even longer than it  already was because I wanted to see more.

B000002B38|5.0|I first got this CD the day it came out with the blinking light.  If you all thought Roger was Floyd you are sorely mistaken.  Dave, Nick and Rick actually had something to do with the final result of most of the old  albums.  Roger's solo output save Amused to Death and Pros and Cons have  been pathetic.  This is the best live Floyd album. The songs from Dark Side  are better live and all the songs that previously appeared on Delicate  Sound bury that by a longshot.  This is awesome highly recommended.
B00000DBXL|5.0|Prolonging the Magic is excellent in the three-album-strong-CAKE style of quirkiness and variety.  No two songs sound the same, each song a representation of something in a way that makes the listener step back and  say &quot;aw yeeah...&quot;

0792839234|5.0|I liked the part where that girl turned into the Tall Man and killed that guy in the cemetery. I think the Tall Man is cool. I think they should make a movie where the Tall Man tries to do something normal such as: try out  for the county bowling league, playing a pinball machine, playing blackjack  in Las Vegas, drinking a beer at the pub, playing lead guitar with a local  band, working as a short order cook at a diner, or being a ice cream man.
0790733897|5.0|Bullitt is a modern-day film noir classic.  Featuring very attractice and stylish photography, the film is Steve McQueen's masterpiece.<br />McQueen plays SFPD Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, a no-nonsense cop popular with the  local press - a fact that leads smarmy and ambitious politician Walter  Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) to hire him and his partners Carl Stanton (Carl  Reindel) and Delgetti (Don Gordon) to guard a witness - Organization  wire-operator Johnny Ross.  But before the night is out, Stanton and Ross  are splattered about a cheap hotel room, and Bullitt and Delgetti find  themselves under fire from Chalmers - the politician vows to crucify  Bullitt should Ross perish - as well as their CO, Captain Sam Bennett  (Simon Oakland).<br />Good performances,  Lalo Schiffrin's jazzy score, and the action combine for a crime classic.
0316286869|5.0|This book really opened my eyes up to the possibility of make-up.  I had heard about this book before but thought that Kevyn Aucoin couldn't possibly be able to teach me anything I didn't already know.  I thought he  would say the usual, 'Blend your foundation,' 'Make sure your lipliner  matches your lipstick.'  But when I started reading the instructions, I was  blown away.  I never saw make-up and beauty the way Mr. Aucoin does.  As a  person w/ blemishes and imperfections, I have shyed away from make-up,  fearing the worse, that it will make me look uglier.  But Mr. Aucoin  enabled me to feel that I CAN be beautiful, despite the scars and  blemishes.  Some of the looks I especially liked were The Heroine and The  Minimalist.  Beautiful, simple, and elegant.  Whether you are experienced  or inexperience in the art of make-up, I suggest that you buy Kevyn  Aucoin's Making Faces.  It really will make you feel beautiful.

0060977493|4.0|The God of Small Things is not an easy book to get into and it certainly has its faults, but it is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I found the first 35 or so pages the most difficult to get through because  of the confusing names and the way the author dropped hints of what was to  come without providing a plot or a context with which to help understand  them. Gradually however the book began to draw me in--I wanted to  understand exactly what tragedies befell the family in the book, I began to  care about the twins and their mother and Velutha, I appreciated the  author's beautiful prose and her ability to write about little things like  the way a spider looks or the smell and sound of water. Yes, the author's  prose was sometimes a little over wrought and yes, I did get bugged  sometimes by how long it took  the author to let us know the details of the  tragedies her characters would suffer, but overall, her book is a real  accomplishment. I cried as I read the last couple chapters.The chapter  where Ethra leaves on the train is heart-wrenching and the one where Ammu  and Velutha make love by the river was absolutely beautiful.Not at all like  the &quot;bodice ripper&quot; novels that one Amazon.com reviewer compared  it to. I admit, I have only read a few of those kinds of books but none of  them impresssed me as quality writing, much less good literature.
B000000WA4|5.0|This record is like being manic-depressive. One minute you're up (Tonight Tonight, Cupid De Locke) the next you're down (Bullet...,Thirty Three, Ode To Noone). Every song is a suprise and a treat for your ears. It is never  too far from my stereo. If you don't feel complete in life buy this  record  - you will not regret it.
B0000025KI|3.0|This album is a mixed bag.  There are some excellent songs like The River, Independence Day, Caddilac Ranch, The Price You Pay, and a few others.  However, there is much filler on this double disc.  It would be better of  if Bruce only released a single CD and left the rest(Two Hearts, Drive All  Night(9 minutes of painful moaning), Wreck On The Highway, Stolen Car)on  the cutting room floor.  Bruce could have explored a few more styles as the  songs are either rockers or ballads with little in between.  Check out  Greetings, E Street Shuffle, Born To Run, Born In The USA, and Lucky Town  for his best recordings.

Yet another triumph for Smashing  Pumpkins!

Every thing about this record is fantastic - from first to last bite. Beauty, anger, love,  hate, all the emotions are there. Folk, rock, psychadelia, over the top  guitar solos, all the different musical elements/genres are there. I've had  a copy for five years and it NEVER gets boring. I can't say enough good  things about it.  Buy this record and your ears (and mind) will thank  you....again and again and again.
078062551X|5.0|Dark City provided me with one of the few experiences a movie ever does for me... saying &quot;wow!&quot; The computer effects are a huge aspect of the film, but it's far from being a movie like Twister, where they are what  the film is, carried by no plot. Dark City combines stunning imagery and an  incredibly imaginative script with absolutely awesome sets. The acting by  everyone is superb. This is a definatey film you'll want to keep.

0385493800|4.0|I enjoyed The Testament because it had you hooked immediately.  Troy was a crafty character.  He was in control of his fate even after his death.  A lot of Grisham's books are too wordy and could tell a good story with less  description.  His wordiness in this book was appreciated because it took me  somewhere unfamiliar.  Reading the jacket cover you learn that he has  visited the places in the book and is trying to make it real to the reader.   I was not disappointed to find towards the end  his typical negative  attitude about lawyers.  It seems his style to make some lawyer the bad  guy.  My favorite to date has been A Time to Kill.  The Testament is  running a close second.  I wanted a sequel.  I wasn't ready to say goodbye  to the characters.  I read the book slowly which is unusual for me and a  good book.  Good going Nate in your transformation.
B000002NE4|5.0|Known for urgent appeals for whiskey (&quot;Brother, My Cup is Empty&quot;) and deranged inquisitions of a guy in a ridiculous seersucker suit (&quot;I Had A Dream Joe&quot;), I had not imagined how caringly and  gently Nick Cave could love.  His self-exposure in &quot;The Boatman's  Call&quot; is so graceful and stirring; it both pains and soothes the  heart.  Rich voice, well-placed lyrics and chord progressions are dead on.   This is one of those rarities where every song is great, and in &quot;West  Country Girl&quot; he meows like a good cat should.  While in the vein of  favorites: Lou Reed, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, Peter Gabriel, or Jeff  Buckley; here Nick Cave stands above.
B000002TQV|5.0|I bought this album after OK Computer and Pablo Honey, and it has to be my favorite.  Although I have a strong bias to OK Computer's overwhelming creativity and genious, The Bends is has a more classic feel.  It is  definitely much easier to get into.. yet is deep enough to grow on you more  each time you listen to it.  A MUST HAVE for anyone who appreciates great  music!
6303471501|5.0|How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under?  Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang.  The heartless and stone cold Max sets out bent on revenge, hence  &quot;Mad&quot; Max.  Violence is as plentiful as the high-octane chase  scenes.
B00000IBRX|5.0|This film swept me away. It was visually stunning and emotionally devastating through every moment. Years from now students will study it as they have studied the films of Cocteau.

B00000ILE6|5.0|Aliens is a great movie. Exciting, fast-paced, Cameron's excellent directing and writing really shine here.<br />The widescreen is great (Though I do wish that cameron had filmed it in 2.35:1 instead if 1.85:1), The  picture clear and shard (As only THX can do), and the packedging is  awsome.<br />My  advice, get this immediatly when its released (I got my copy ahead of time  from 20th Century Fox(Not at liberty to say how)). Get this movie. Its  great.
B000002GD8|3.0|After the promising Crime of the Century, Supertramp seems to have come up with an album that one would have never thought they woul make. First of all, this albums major flaw is the fact that though most of the songs are  enjoyable, they fit together lik ten peices from ten different jigsaw  puzzles: The first track, Easy Does It, is a nice song with a catchy tune.  It is followed by the Simon-and Garfunkelish Sister Moonshine. Though these  first two are great songs, they lack the trademark quirkiness of the other  albums' songs. After comes the excellent homage to 60's rock, Ain't Nobody  But Me, the only Supertramp song in 12/8 time. So much for the good stuff.  After those three comes the jumbled Soapbox Opera, and then the  not-too-great rock of Another Man's Woman. These 12 minutes are avenged by  two wonderful songs: Lady, a tune reminiscent of &quot;Dreamer&quot; and  with shadows of Breakfast in America. It is followed by a jazzy song called  A Poor Boy, which is guaranteed to satisfy. It's too bad it had to get so  good, because after those come three horrid songs that end the album--Just  a normal day is a goos song, but lacks the enjoyment of such Supertramp  songs as &quot;Dreamer&quot; or &quot;Logical Song&quot;; then comes the  embarrasingly bad &quot;Meaning&quot; and the Sgt. Pepper ripoff &quot;Two  of Us&quot;. The lyrics in these last two have lines that are repeated,  which shows that they had writer's block. My theory is that they were so  stunned by the success of &quot;Crime that they were rendered unprepared  for another album. For die-hard fans of the band...not the music.
1881273156|5.0|An excellent book which opens communication between couples (married or not married) and enlightens us by using very simple, basic concepts which can enhance relationships.

0451191153|5.0|I just got finished reading it.  I had to write a paper on The Fountainhead for a scholarship and was not looking forward to the 694 pages that lay ahead of me.  But about 15 pages into it, I realized that I really  would enjoy it.  Length is a factor that should never turn anyone away from  a book.  This novel was extra influential for me because I am only 16, and  questioning how I should live my life and what I should think.  I have  learned to think for myself and become independent, just like Howard Roark.   Now, I try to not care what others think of me, just be myself.  That is  what I hope others get out of this book, too.

Pleases do not wait another year to release the  next one...I will not make it.  To those of you considering this novel,  stop it and get it!  Misery loves company.  But how sweet it is.  Five  stars is not enough.

0679735909|5.0|While this is not the easiest read it is probably the most satisfying work of contemporary fiction I have ever read. But the changing styles - Victorian poetry, post-modern literary criticism, contemporary narrative,  among many others - make it a small challenge. Well worth it though. I have  probably read this six times (highly unusual for me) and have found a new  layer or three each time. And the end always breaks and heals my heart at  the same time...

B000002KAT|5.0|After nearly three decades, Astral Weeks remains the most mysterious, mystical and ultimately, most beautiful record ever made. Eight songs that flow effortlessly like one long hymn, creating a sense of mood and  atmosphere that is as sensuous as it is timeless. Van Morrison visits and  revisits places from his memories like long lost friends, delivering us a  panoramic performance of thoughts and dreams drenched in a haze of  uncompromising music. The stream of consciousness that lies underneath the  entire record is almost reminiscent of another Irishman's masterpiece,  James Joyce's Ulysses. Both recall familiar places in Ireland, and both  seem at times, almost innocent and childlike. What Van Morrison has managed  to do is to take this same haphazard collection of thoughts, and put it to  music that is at once passionate and intense. The music on the album is the  kind that is almost impossible to categorise. Is it folk? Sounds like it.  But listen closely, and you will discover the magnificent bass playing by  Richard Davis pointing towards jazz. Drummer Connie Kay's accompaniment is  hardly standard rock and roll fare. Then there is also the classical  strings and swirling flutes punctuating the songs on the album that rises  above everything the Beatles ever attempted on their own records. As for  Van's voice, let's just say it is feverish blues at its most supreme. It  brings the same chills to my bones as when I first heard Robert Johnson  singing &quot;A Kindhearted Woman's Blues&quot;. The opening guitar strums  to the title track is so deceptively simple and folksy, that it doesn't  really prepare the first time listener for what is to follow. And what  follows is simply breathtaking. In fact, it is so dense and sophisticated  that on first listen, it is actually inaccessible. Yet, it is this  inaccessibility that somehow stirs our curiosity during our initiation into  this sonic journey.  The mystical poetry reaches a state of surrealism,  mixed with references to real life persons and places. &quot;Astral  Weeks&quot; speaks of being reborn, as if the opening song is just a  beginning. But of what, no one really knows. And that includes Van the Man  himself. But the stunning words and phrases are fascinating, almost  infectious. &quot;If I travel in the slipstream, between the viaducts of  your dreams...&quot; is almost as thrilling as the opening words of Dylan's  &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;. The entire song seems to move endlessly  like a river, taking you along for the ride, but never letting you know  where you are actually heading. It is the perfect start to a perfect album  of songs.  Listen to the songs again, and you might just wonder if some of  the songs are songs at all. &quot;Beside You&quot; hardly seems to have the  traditional verse and bridge structure. In fact, he seems to be like  improvising all the time. And the way his vocals whisper and soar  throughout the whole song, it seems like he is capable of every muscular  vocal trick in the book. &quot;You breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe  in, you breathe out....&quot; he repeats, makes us as breathless as he  suggests. &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; is hardly sweet. The way the strings come  raining down in the middle of the song, it is just as vicious as the  strings employed in Lennon's &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; There, Lennon's  attack at his former collaborator was mean and direct, and Phil Spector's  arrangement simply heightened the sour emotions further. Here, it serves as  an irony to the heartfelt longing that the singer is desperately trying to  convey to his lover. It is like saying that nothing can be that wonderful  without a taste of bitterness. Yet, despite this, it is beautiful.  Especially when he suggests taking a walk in &quot;the gardens all wet with  rain&quot;. The start and stop nature of &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; seems  perfectly suited to Van's stream of consciousness. Recalling in his mind  his recollections ofhis childhood, Van spits out the words to a bed of  musical dreamscape. A mixture of Celtic mysticism and soulful rock and roll  that seems unlikely, but ultimately, natural bedfellows. The build-up of  the song, from an acoustic softness to an eventual climatic burst, is as  fragmented as it is seamless. In concerts, he would end this song with the  catchphrase from a later song, &quot;It's too late to stop now...&quot;.  With this kind of powerful and passionate performance, you almost wish he  would never stop. The conclusion of &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; ends the  optimistic first half of the journey in clouded uncertainty. Just like the  Beach Boys' seminal Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks also treads on an emotional  arc from start to finish. What seems like the first flush of love or  perhaps, the enthusiasm of a new and bright relationship is at this point  turning to self-doubt. The rest of the record will then gradually document  the descent of this ambiguous relationship. What this relationship is about  does not really matter in the end. Maybe a lover, maybe a kin or maybe a  friend. All we know is Van is singing to an entity that he cherishes at the  beginning. With &quot;The Way That Young Lovers Do&quot;, he is questioning  this entity about the virtues of their relationship. If not lyrically, at  least he is doing it musically. Horns flourish amidst a big band jazzy  backdrop, haunting yet hurried. Doubt is now slowly evolving into  frustration. &quot;Madame George&quot; is simply the album's most brilliant  moment. Much debate over the title character's gender has been made and it  is almost pointless to ponder over it. Whether &quot;Madame George&quot; is  based on a real person or not, I guess we will never know. And Van doesn't  care. If anything, she or he sounds like a character that has walked out  from Victorian London into late 60s Ireland. Cyprus Avenue is revisited  again as Van recites a &quot;childlike vision&quot; creeping into him and  us as well. Strangely enough, when Marianne Faithfull covers this song, it  sounds as it is almost autobiographical. Yet in Van Morrison's third person  narrative, it seems like an epic tale being recalled in a haze of smoky  psychedelia that defines logic and reality. Is &quot;Madame George&quot;  really a transvestite? Van probably didn't think about it when he wrote it,  and for some reason, he sang it as &quot;Madame Joy&quot; instead. It is  precisely this sub-consciousness that we are supposed to experience, not  factual details or logic. The album's penultimate track,  &quot;Ballerina&quot; is another exercise in vocal dynamics and musical  finesse. As the xylophone makes its way stealthily around the song, Van's  voice swoops up and down like a preying eagle, waiting to devour the song's  protagonist. We don't so much as try to understand but experience the music  and the words on display. And what a vibrant and aggressive vocal display  it is, always interesting and vivid throughout the seven minutes of soulful  deliverance. &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot; seems almost inappropriate at  first to close this masterwork. Bluesy and simplistic in structure, Davis'  bass just seem to suspend in mid-air, then bounce with an eerie-like tone.  The song is darkly sinister in nature as Van recalls yet another place from  his memories, this time being Ladbroke Grove. Just hearing Van singing  these two words is almost worth the price of admission alone. That  anguished passion in his voice, it is almost unearthly.  Towards the end of  the track and the record as a whole, the drums suddenly come crashing down  like a deranged madman. It is almost the relationship that was promised in  the opening track and reaffirmed in &quot;Beside You&quot; is now beyond  repair. Utter insanity has taken over and Van has lost all sense of  self-control and time. It is like this abrupt ending is just beginning a  new adventure elsewhere. Are we supposed to resolve the destiny of Astral  Weeks ourselves, after Van has taken us so far on this musical ride?   Perhaps the answer is not really that important. What is more significant  is that the music, words and voice of Astral Weeks are forever embedded in  our minds and souls. At least, to those of us who have chosen to treasure  it. It is not an easy record to listen to, as it is not meant to be. But  there lies within this strange hypnotic album, a sense of time and place  that is beyond our normal realms and reach.  Astral Weeks may not sound  like rock music, but its place in rock history cannot be ignored or denied.  Like Van said, it belongs to &quot;another time, another place&quot;. And  most definitely, a better place than where all of us are living now. A  place that is as mythical as it is timeless. Van Morrison would probably  call that place Avalon. Close your eyes now and listen for it. Listen for  that Avalon Music. Ian Low 18th November 1998
630398021X|5.0|Absolutely and Positively the best film I've ever seen in my life thus far.  This film surges with greatness from it's pores all the way till the end.  I recommend it to anyone, as it has a science fiction feel, a drama  feel, and an action feel.  Amazingly fantastic.
B0000026DJ|5.0|When I first heard Diesel and Dust in 1988, everything changed.  I think everyone around me got tired of hearing the album over and over again...but this album stands not only as the best Midnight Oil album it is also, in my  humble opinion, one of the best albums to come out of the 80's.  I am still  surprised that only one song (&quot;beds are burning&quot;) from the album  ever received substantial radio play because there are so many other  worthwhile efforts that surpass &quot;beds&quot; in lyrics and music.  Take  for example, Warakurna with the smooth introduction or Put Down that Weapon  where Peter Garrett manages to modulate his voice to a steady, low, and  disdainful hiss.  The splendor of Arctic World and the introduction of  Bullroarer still ring in my ears.  This album is a definite must have;  don't just listen to the first track (like the radio stations do) and put  the album away.  LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING!  You will be richly rewarded!

It is the  perfect gift for graduation, job promotion, or any other crossroads in  one's life.  I have several friends graduating this June and I know exactly  what I am getting for gifts!
0060987464|5.0|marilyn manson has demonstrated his remarkable writing skills in this autobiographical masterpiece. the narrations of the various incidents with explicit detail and the enticing nature of the writing made me finish the  book in just 2 sittings. the artwork and photographs blend with the content  providing realizm to the metamorphosis.
0790739917|5.0|I am seldom emotional about a film (or anything) but this was a great, unexpected, pleasure.  I like Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage in anything but...together!!!  Reading the box I thought the story was a little too  bizarre and unrealistic, but the story turned out to be excellent, and the  actors, superb.  I enjoyed seeing familar faces like Dennis Franz.  Some of  the themes hit nerves that I haven't touched since school.  The Hemingway  twist added depth and appreciation.  Meg has matured, and she looks great.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is not just perhaps Kate Bush's best album, but certainly one of the best albums ever made.  It combines story-telling in weaving, teasing, dark lyrics with notes that are just one step off.  It is also one of those rare  albums where every track makes you want to sing loudly as you visualize the  lyrics.<br />P.S. Why no samples?
B000002LQD|5.0|This is arguably Brother Lou's strongest work in years (and that says something).  Fire of passion, lament of loss, Reed explores some of the most difficult issues facing Everyone.  The album ends in the transendental  self-realization of the title track.  There is little else to be said about  this masterwork except that we do, indeed, need a busful of faith to get  by.  Listen and be eluminated.
B000002UC5|5.0|&quot;McCartney&quot; is a great album. &quot;Maybe I'm amazed&quot; is one of Paul's best songs. The drum solos on &quot;Momma Miss America&quot; and &quot;Kreen Akrore&quot; are terrific.  &quot;Junk&quot; and  &quot;Every Night&quot; fill you up with beautiful, melancholic melodies.   They are confronted with &quot;Oo You&quot;, a stylish rock song. I  couldn't believe he had done the whole album all by himself, it sounds so  perfect. Nevertheless, on some songs there should have been more lyrics,  especially by &quot;That would be Something&quot;. I didn't like  &quot;Valentine Day&quot; at all, it's way to blunt and dull. Before I  bought the CD, I thought &quot;Singalong Junk&quot; would be a link or  something, so that was a bit of a disappointment.  All in all, though, one  of Paul's better albums, &quot;McCartney&quot; is an enjoyable piece of  art.
6301763041|5.0|I've seen nearly all of John Waters' movies and this movie was so excellent.....the music was truly outstanding and the acting terrific!!!  Johnny Depp has always been a heart throb for me and this was no exception!   This movie will make your life better!
B000000OA6|5.0|Nothing less than perfect would have ever satisfied Queen, especially Freddie Mercury. This is a great album which makes us believe that a legend will never die. Freddie's voice and interpretation are beyond any  expectations and he deserves to be remembered exactly as what he was:  perfect, talented, brilliant, awesome.
B00000FCBC|5.0|In their best album since Master of Puppets, Metallica really delivers on Garage, Inc.  In a world where musicians take themselves far too seriously, this album nicely balances power and  eighties kitsch.  The choice of songs  to cover comes from a wide range of bands, and many of these remakes are  better than the originals.  Highly recommended.
B00000I2VF|4.0|I can't stand Alanis' first album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; - so much more surprised am I about &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;! It is a brilliant album, showing rocking, sexy, sensitive, bitchy, jazzy...  MUSICALly genius sides of this Canadian mega talent. One of the best albums  released this year.
B000002VRZ|5.0|Back in Tampa in 1966, my older brother came home one night and told how he caught a ride home with a band called the Outlaws. I did'nt think much about it then but twelve years later they knocked my socks off in Savannah,  Georgia along with Charlie Daniels and Lynard Skynrd. They are true peers  with all of the great bands of the South. Its just to bad you can't find  their original album anymore.
0780622650|5.0|The film may have been a bit iffy, it was just a glorified television episode, but I loved it for that. Brilliant, but The Music!!!!! What a score! What a selection of tracks! What genius chose the music.<br />Thankyou  sir, whoever you are.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is probally one of my favorites from the Gods of thrash, my favorite has to be Frayed.....,and Dyers Eve just from the energy this album produces is mind blowing i recommend playing it loud and you will  feel the wrath ,James has proven once again why he is the best front man in  the biz!! he is a genius when it comes to writing just wish the loads had  the same kind of heaviness buy it you wont be dissappointed an A++++
630512065X|5.0|I got this video for Christmas and thought it was great.  My sister and I have watched it everyday at least once.  Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer is the best out of all the songs.  Mungojerrie is the best out of all cats.   He is great!  My sister is fond of Pouncival.  He's a great acrobat(  especially in Mr. Mistofolees when he is doing a head stand and clapping  his feet). This movie is a must for anyone who is looking for good music  and good dancing. If anyone has information on Drew Varley or Jo Gibb,  please e-mail me.
B000002C1X|5.0|For anyone who is a fan of a true musical &quot;expierience&quot;-Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; is for you. Argueabley the greatest Floyd disc ever, this 2 CD rock epic takes you through the dark alley that is lead  singer Roger Waters' mind.  His life story is told so well through  &quot;Comfortabley Numb&quot; and &quot;Hey You&quot;-this Disc is a MUST  own for any true Floyd fan!!
0790700506|5.0|Gizmo was the only nice grimlen.They are really cute because they look like furbys and they act like them too.I thought the bebies were cute,but they were alot of trouble......
B000002AZ8|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this is the &quot;White Album&quot; of the '90s. Sure, it has some uneven songs, but its good tracks (especially &quot;Corduroy&quot;) are some of the most introspective and honest songs  that PJ have written. Eddie deals honestly with the &quot;instant  celebrity&quot; phenomenon that killed grunge and Kurt Cobain - his  statements on the matter make this one of the true landmark albums of the  '90s in spite of its weaknesses.
B000002UTY|5.0|&quot;who do you love etc...&quot; takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion and bursts forth with tremendous orgasmic energy. this cd is without doubt, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock and roll albums of  all time.
031286504X|5.0|Richard Matheson has written a  timeless classic of the horror genre, one that deserves a place next to Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; and Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.  If you liked this book, you may want  to check out his take on the psychological thriller, entitiled &quot;Seven  Steps to Midnight&quot;.
630516603X|5.0|I am a big Michael Flatley fan and would buy anything he releases on video.  I was surprised to see that this is basically a repeat of Lord of the Dance.  I know that there are some new costumes and some added  choreography but it is a repeat.  Couldn't he have come up with a more  honest way of selling Lord of the Dance part II?  Even so, the show was  spectacular and Michael and cast were superb.  If Michael never dances  again he may die a happy man but the dance world will never be the same.
6305089957|1.0|SCREAM 2  all I have to say about it is don't waste your money SCREAM was okay but this is the pits. I mean NEVE CAMPBELL just seems to be going through the motions. To me it seemed like she was bored as did the rest of  the cast. And there was too much emphises on gore as well I won't say which  parts just watch and see what I mean and by the way people who don't like  this film aren't moronic and stupid they are just giving thier opinion so  cool it!!!
B000000OSE|5.0|Its a travesty that a band this good could split after so few albums, Appetite and lies whetted our appetite, Use your illusion left us wanting more, but alas it is not to be, Izzy if you are reading this they say you  are the only one who can heal the wounds, Millions of Gunners fans around  the world are waiting patiently
6304765789|5.0|The Game is a great movie for someone who likes murder mystery dinner parties and the like.  Such a twisted story line and very suspenseful- I definately recommend it!
0375707972|5.0|I often read the amazon.com customer reviews after I've read the book, as a substitute for a good book club discussion. It was interesting to me that so many people disliked The Reader.  Almost all of my favorite books have  centered on a strong female character, with multidimensional characters,  detailing of events and lush description.  I can't even remember a favorite  book with a male protagonist.  Spare prose is normally depressing to me.   Thus, I was surprised at how much I loved this book. The spare style is  perfect for the author's purpose in that it allows the reader to fully  reflect upon and identify with the moral questions; allowing you to examine  the answers to those questions in your own life and in the collective  consciousness.  The relationship between Michael and Hanna is a metaphor  for the post- and pre-war generations, respectively.  I see Michael's love  for Hanna as the love that generation had for both it's parents and pre-war  Germany.  It is only after the KNOWLEDGE of their involvement with the  Holocaust that there is shame and guilt over that love, even though the  love was experienced after the actual fact of it.  Towards the end, Michael  realizes that his desire for Hanna did not have her as its object; it was,  in a sense, a desire to come home (almost exact quote). this implies a  desire to return to the hearth of childhood, i.e., a time before the war.    In the past 6 months, I've started a dozen books and not finished one.  I'm  a pretty picky reader.  I loved Schlink's prose and ideas.  That I could  love a book so seemingly contrary to my idea of &quot;a good read&quot;,  and that it could make me think more than any book in recent memory, puts  me in awe of The Reader.
0792152328|1.0|There was much hype surrounding Titanic before it was released, probably because it cost 200     million dollars to make. Many thought the film would be a complete flop at the box office, failing to return what it cost  to make. Of course, they were proved wrong - how could it be a flop with  the world's biggest 'heart throb' starring, as well as every boy's 'pin-up'  as the love interest. Cameron certainly knows how to make his money, for  the film was made for little else. Little thought or care was evident in  the screenplay, as well as a distinct lack of talent. The plot was  non-existent, and what little scrags one could find were boring. The film's  themes were unoriginal and attitudinising. The acting was dire,  cringe-makingly sentimental. For the romance to have worked, the film would  have to elicit sympathy for its protagonists. It failed miserably, in fact  it made me loathe the       characters and stand up and cheer when the ship  sank (the fact that the end of the movie was nigh                     was  another reason). The length was another problem: if a movie's bad, at least  the producers could do the decency of making it a short film, but not with  Cameron, he indulges in the wafts of grotesque sentimentality, as well as a  superfluous and untrue depiction of the members of the first class as  sewlfish snobs. In fact, it took great dignity for so many of the men in  first class to stay behind while their families rowed away without them.  Thus the film has no substance, a poor screenplay, flimsy acting, is  fearfully inaccurate factually (there was more than one survivor left when  the Carpathia arrived) and a mess to watch. No, this film is indeed for the  braindead, who have no appreciation for serious, intelligent film-making.  It doesn't know where it's going - is it a serious film with an underlying  theme, or is it a good, old-fashioned yarn about the demise of the Titanic?  In fact, Titanic pretends to be the former, somewhat denouncing the latter.  A Night to Remember was    a far more digestable film, with an accurate  depiction of the proceedings, as well as fine    characterisation,  excellent performances (Kenneth More) and no social bollocks. My final  criticism of Titanic is that the music is perhaps the most woeful I have  ever heard. The minute Celine Dion's pathetic, disgusting and  sick-mackingly sentimental 'tune' graces your ears, you reach for the sick  bag. The music summarises the film; it's no proper film, it's just a money  maker. Frivolous, superfluous, boring and down-right bad, this Titanic is  loathable. The fact that it got five times as many awards at the Oscars  than L.A. Confidential (a stunning film) is disgusting.
B000002BPS|5.0|I think that this one is the best Offspring CD that they have made yet. I don't even have a favorite song off of it because they all rock.
0136879721|5.0|The ideas in this book are revolutionary and if applied consistently -with an open mind- will  change the life of an individual for the better.
6305048584|5.0|For long suffering Jets fans, it's nice to finally recap success. The inspirational leadership of Bill Parcells, coupled with the drive and evolving talent of players such as Keyshawn Johnson, Aaron Glen and Mo  Lewis, has put the Jets on course for bigger and better things.  Behind-the-scenes footage gives Jet fans a real inside look at how the  foundation is being set for Super Bowl victory. If you like talking, living  and breathing New York Jets football, this video is for you!!!!
B000002BNB|2.0|this cd is not all dat....the only thing making it worth anything is &quot;assasination day&quot; which is one of the best tracks i've ever heard...liquid swords and the 36 chambers kick this cd's bootay...
B000001IPL|5.0|&quot;Smash&quot; is one of my favorite punk CD's that I own. The Offspring have and will continue to make some of the best punk music ever.
0767819543|1.0|I didn't like it at all. I was specting to watch a great movie. What a deception. Even though I am a brazilian, I have to consider that LA VITA E BELLA is much much better.
B000000WI4|5.0|My personal favorite.  The alblum starts off with an upbeat duo from one of the best piano men around Johnnie Johnson.  It only gets better when Robert Cray joins in to play and sing vocals for the title track, a  definate feel good song!!!  Hooker also is accompanied by many other great  guitar legends such as Albert Collins, Ry Cooder, John Hammonds and even  Rolling Stone Keith Richards.  If you enjoy Carlos Santana's powerful  guitar playing, along with Hooker's legendary blues vocals &quot;Striped Me  Naked&quot; will take you to another world.  The more you listen to this  alblum the more you will like it!!! ;)
0767831837|5.0|Thinking about the idea of a sad movie when i get into the cinema and about the bad idea of going to watch it, I didnt want it to finish when I left. It was a great movie, I think that the little kid, Ben, should have  won an award for best supporting actor. His character in the movie turnes  all the sad moments into funny ones. Its the kind of person everyone needs  in theirs lifes to be similing all the time. To put a smiling face in bad  moments. To know how to front bad moments. I think the movie has a little  bit of all, and the actings of Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, are so  believable. Its great that we hae movies like this one.
B000000W74|3.0|Mr. Hooker is an artist who pulls off collaborations with such success, that it takes you to another dimension of the blues.  The title song &quot;Chill Out&quot; accompanied with Santana's potent guitar licks makes  the album worth buying in itself.  He also performs a powerful version  &quot;Serve Me Right to Suffer&quot; with Van Morrison caring on a  conversation that only true bluesmen could do!!!  His solo works are what  is expected out of the great Hooker.  &quot;One Bourbon... One Scotch...  One Beer&quot; is a classic with new found energy.<br />The man should be,  but is not a millionaire, yet has the enough money to ride around in a limo  with the personalized license plates &quot;Chill Out&quot; in Redwood City,  CA.  I had the opportunity to visit him about 2 and a half years ago.  I  came to his door uninvited, dogs barking etc. and Mr. Hooker answered the  door.  I explained I was a fan with his &quot;The Healer&quot; CD in my  hand.  He silenced the German Shepherd as well as the Cocker Spaniel, and  invited me into his home.  There were gold records with pictures of Bill  Graham, Bonnie Raitt and others on the wall over his fireplace.  He  graciously signed the CD cover and we began to talk about the Giants  baseball game on T.V.  We discussed baseball and other current events for  about a half an hour before I left.  Mr. Hooker invited me back again; yet,  I have not mustered the courage to re-visit him.  We never touched on the  great contribution he has made to the Blues, Rock n' Roll, or music in  general.  However, the very modest bluesman left me with the belief and  impression that the Blues are about everyday people, sharing everyday  experiences.<br />His recent recordings are mostly collaborations (I.E. \\"Mr.  Lucky\\", \\"The Healer\\", and \\"Don't Look Back\\"), but they are what helped  sparked my interest in the Blues.  I think one of the most positive  undertones to his albums is his ability to record with various artists and  spark my interest with him as well as their efforts.  For the novice fan  such as myself, check out \\"Mr. Lucky\\" (my personal favorite 5 stars), also  \\"The Healer\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\" are the next to add to the collection.  The more you listen to this man's stuff like albums that I feel demonstrate  some of his roots: \\"King of the Boogie\\", \\"Blues Legend\\", and \\"The  Collection\\" heighten one's awareness to the roots of all modern music.  Listen to each album a few times and ENJOY!!!!  ;)<br />P.S.  I give this C.D.  only a 3.5, definitely worth buying, but &quot;Mr.Lucky&quot; and the  &quot;Healer&quot; are in a class all by themselves....
0780622553|4.0|On first seeing this film at the cinema, it was clear that the writer and director had clearly set out to create a dream environment. Dark City's visuals are typical sci fi / Bladerunner and if you're looking for a disc  to show off your DVD player this isn't it. Having said that the picture  quality is very good (it's just not bright and sunny in the film very  often).<br />The film isn't a masterpiece as falls short of the mark due to  the over obvious and blatant script which unlike Bladerunner decides to  explain everything to the audience (are we more than our memories etc.) 50  times over rather than alluding to it.<br />The DVD itself has an excellent  commentary from the writer, director, production designer and director of  photography.
079073382X|5.0|I watched the later half of this film on TNT and was instantly attracted as soon as I switched to the channel. Both actor/actress played really well especially Delpy - personally I think she is very attractive, sensational  although not the most beautiful. I am going to rush for this movie for my  video achive. Hollywood produces few films more romantic and (less sexually  explicit) than this one.
B000002U8G|5.0|I've recently purchased this CD and I must say that I am enjoying it greatly. &quot;Echoes&quot; is quite impressive. Any song that can keep you interested for 23+ minutes is truely something worth mentioning. &quot;One  of These Days&quot; is an awesome instrumental. It is a bit  Black-Sabbath-Esque (If you've ever heard &quot;Children of the  Grave&quot;). The real meat of the album though is in the songs &quot;A  Pillow of Winds&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot;. &quot;San Tropez&quot;  sounds quite a bit like something Leon Redbone would have released but is a  nice song none the less. &quot;Seamus&quot; is a short song about an old  hound dog. It's comical in a way and it has a sort of nice blues sound but  the real gems on this album are &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;A Pillow of  Winds&quot;, and &quot;Fearless&quot;. If you're wondering what that is on  the cover of the album...turn it 90 degrees clockwise. It's an ear.
0780624890|4.0|The action was great. I loved the biting and all that
B000002U82|5.0|Everyone knows that this album features Floyd standards such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;, but it also has other great songs that don't get nearly enough attention (&quot;Us and Them&quot; in  particular). The thing that sets this recording apart from others and that  allows it to stand alongside other classics such as Nirvana's  &quot;Nevermind&quot; or perhaps Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;  is the raw emotion exuding from the pores of these nine songs (&quot;Speak  to Me&quot; doesn't really count).
6302859204|5.0|When I saw it was hard to get to sleep. we never finished watching it because it was so scary.  Then we rented it again and we watched the whole thing and the last ten minutes where terrifying.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|this cd is great when you listen to it the 1st time but it gets old soon
B000002JSJ|5.0|It's funny that another reviewer at this Amazon site said this was their worst almost because of the turmoil they were going through.  I say it's their best album-for the same reason.<br />Plant has said that this album was  born of pure anxiety.  Indeed!  That's what I was experiencing as a  teenager at the time-turmoil.  So if you're not into trebley full thottle  rock, you will not like this album.<br />Achilles Last Stand is just fantastic  in every respect, particularly the drumming, and the bass, and the  guitar(s) and the vocals!  I can say without a blink that this Zep album  stands alone.  If I could only have one Zep album, I'd go with Physical  Grafitti but only 'cause it's a double album. But this would be second.  H.O.H. would be third.<br />As for comments about pacts with the Devil, I  suggest that if you think that about Jimmy and Robert you need professional  help.  Just because someone's acheived something way beyong YOUR little  grasp doesn't mean it was only attainable through some Hollywood movie  style deal with Satan.  Sheesh.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni is the closest thing to hearing angels sing.  The ease at which she goes from high to low is breathtaking and shocking.  I have never heard another artist that is comparable in vocal quality.  Her music heals.
B000002JSN|5.0|Double Dynamite!  It's silly, I think to try to pick a favorite Zep album.  How exactly do you compare their fourth album with this one?  Either you're a Zep fan or you're not.<br />True, that last one they forced out was a  load of crap, but everything else has stood the test of time.  That's what  makes classic rock classic.<br />If you're young and just now getting in to  Led Zepplin,  I recommend you spend some money and buy the box set with all  the studio albums.  You will not regret it.
B0000027I6|5.0|I don't think anyone here actually caught onto the humanity of this album. IE- The song where they are talking about the innocent boy from Cleveland, and describing the american every day home life. They then switch to the  scene where the missle is fired upon the streets of a &quot;political  enemy&quot; yet they also focus on the normal home life of the man's  married life. How would we feel if this was to happen to our families? This  album makes you think about what our political wars do to people's  families; both home and abroad.
B000002H33|5.0|This cd is the opus maximus of the heavy metal world.  From the incredible breakneck speed of &quot;Damage Incorporated&quot; to the deeper, more eerie &quot;Sanitarium&quot;, every song on this CD is greater than great,  all except for Orion.  That song is merely great.  &quot;Leper  Messiah&quot; crunches slow and hard, while &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;  creates the battlefield scene better than any other heavy metal war song  and that says a lot.  The title song &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; has kind  of an unusual feel to it, but the clever lyrics more than make up for it.   No matter what kind of music you like, if your collection has a thrash  metal cd in it, it had better be Master of Puppets. Buy it. Now.
B000000OSG|5.0|Guns N' Roses made, in my opinion, the greatest CD ever.  The first five tracks are worth the price of the CD alone.  With &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;14 Years&quot;, my favorite, &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, and  &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; you cannot go wrong.  &quot;Get in  the Ring&quot; tells it how it is in an amusing manner, and both  &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Estranged&quot; are unbelievable.  This is  a must have for all Rock fans!
0380977281|5.0|Gaiman takes the ingredients of epic fantasy, mixes them together, and comes up with this intimate fairy tale for all ages.  At turns funny, heartwarming, and thrilling, Gaiman proves that you don't need a series of  phone-book sized novels or a cast of thousands (each with their own  unpronounceable name) to tell a gripping tale of the fantastic.
B000002URV|5.0|I must admit that I have tried just about every other artist out there that is said to &quot;sound like Enigma&quot; (Deep Forest, B-tribe, Delerium, etc.) and I have yet to see anything compare to this or even come  close to their sound. I love all of the Enigma albums but MCMXC a.D. has to  be my favorite.<br />If you're looking for music that perfectly blends Chants  with house rhythms - BUY ENIGMA FIRST! It is simply the best - and totally  exotic and sensual.
0316152196|4.0|The book took off from the start.IT kept moving and twisting and turning
0780622553|5.0|I know it sounds like excessive praise but if you've seen this film you know how good it is.  I truly don't know whether this is a better science fiction film than 2001 by Kubrick but I can tell you that in terms of  characters and themes Dark City has no equal in the genre.   This film is a  treat for your eyes and ears and for your mind.  You may rethink what it  means to be yourself, what it means to be human.   OK, the plot: John  Murdoch doesn't remember his life clearly and the police are seeking him in  a series of prostitute murders.  What Murdoch finds is that aliens called  &quot;strangers&quot; are also seeking him in their quest to understand the  human soul.  The world Murdoch explores is like our own but very different.  This is as much about characters as it is about the plot and the actors do  a wonderful job making the characters exist for us.  The great work of  Rufus Sewell should have garnered more notice.  He gives a performance that  makes us aware of our own humanity and identity.  And the beautiful and  underrated Jennifer Connelly is perfect as Murdoch's wife and love interest  (not necessarily the same thing.)  Connelly always looks delicious but here  we get to see her really do some fine acting in a difficult role.  William  Hurt as Police Inspector Bumstead rounds out the questing trio of humans  who don't know what's happening in their lives.  The great work of Keifer  Sutherland is surprising also because it's like nothing I've ever seen from  him.  His Dr. Schreber serves as the narrator and the catalyst. The aliens  are the coolest ones ever.  If you hated that band in the cantina in Star  Wars this is your kind of movie! The DVD has the valuable commentary track  from the creative team and also one from film critic Roger Ebert.  These  will add to your enjoyment and the Ebert commentary will increase your  appreciation for all of the performances, especially Jennifer Connelly's as  Emma. The film looks wonderful in widescreen and sounds very impressive.   If you haven't seen it, see it now!  If you have seen it, see it on DVD and  prepare to be challenged, thrilled and rewarded. It may not be the best SF  film ever, but it's the one I want to watch over and over again, the one I  remember and think about.  That must mean something.
6300183483|4.0|In the tradition of Atari games, whiz kids and teen adventure and fantasy movies, there it comes.  A boy, who used to play an arcade game in his trailer park, got to break the record and he passed the test to become a  starfighter.  That arcade was designed by aliens to find starfighters to  defend the frontier against evil forces.<br />The environment is some mix  between Star Wars, Buck Rogers and a Sci-Fi comic book of 80's.  Computer  animated sequences can be recognized due to lack of textures (What am I  supposed to expect from a movie of 1984?).  They looks like Tron.  However,  animation and direction makes you feel combat scenes are better than the  Sci-Fi sequences of &quot;The mind's eye&quot;.<br />The argument tells you  how a common boy which had a girlfriend is about to become a starfighter  and make his dreams come true.  In this aspect the movie takes you through  the fascination that reminds Close Encounters of the Third Kind and  E.T.<br />The argument has two backdraws.  First, the pilot of the ship (the  recruited boy is not the pilot but the gunner and the star of the movie)  does not take his role so seriously and that reduces the thrill level it  could have.  Second, the villain is not as siniester as he should be.  From  Darth Vader to The Joker, villains are an important part of the story.   Villains should match or exceed hero capabilities so that their  confrontation may result a challenge and some emotion may be added.  This  is not the case.   However, a very very good soundtrack (it has the same  quality of John Williams scores) and very good direction makes this  &quot;so so and easy to ruin argument&quot; to be an entertaining space  adventure movie despite of writer's lack of imagination for space culture  design (he performs good when not in space).  I should notice that the  concept of this movie is interesting and entertaining but it required quite  a bit more to be excellent rather than good.  This is a non ambitious  commercialmovie of 1984 that tried to promote arcade games and animated  computer wonders, so you may not expect deep feelings analisys like in  &quot;Enemy mine&quot; (1985) or the thrill of &quot;War games&quot;  (1983).<br />I should notice that this movie does not contain the violence  level of today movies and in my opinion, despite of its simplicity, it is  better than Babylon 5 which seems to be an expensive &quot;Space station  last starfighter&quot; rerun.  Just my opinion.<br />All in all, it is a very  nice entertaining movie for teens and a good remembrance for those of us  who lived in the Atari era.

I have been searching long and hard for a copy of this fabulous movie and have found only one possible link.   Considering the reviews on this page alone, why would it not be in  production?  With DVD taking a major step forward, why isn't this  masterpiece coming back from it's grave (archive)? <br />Somebody please push  some buttons or make some calls to get this released on DVD.
0684847248|5.0|It is not easy to describe in 1,000 words the impact that this book has had on my life.  It allowed me to explore my beliefs and myths about life, discipline, love, religion and spiritual growth. It has shown me how to  base my life on what is true and not simply on what is convenient,  expedient or popular.  I have recommended and given this book to people  whom I truly love-people whose personal and spiritual growth I want to  encourage and support.<br />I am eternally grateful to the author for sharing  with me the way to &quot;the road less traveled&quot;  because it has made  all the difference!
0887307280|5.0|A bit spacey but extremely insightful.  A quick read and well worth it for the insight it gives into why your business bites you on the arse.  One of the most valuable management books I have ever read.
6302732778|5.0|Tons, tons, and TONS of subtext here. True and pure cinematic art. Having read the book (although loosely translated) will help understanding. As for the director's cut: it is AMAZING how a simple, 15-second shot of a unicorn  can change ... well, everything. When you watch this, ask, &quot;Is Deckard  a replicant?&quot;<br />Also keep in mind: The movie, like the book, is not  about a guy who runs around killing Replicants. It is about what it is to  be human.<br />The only reason I can think that this did not do well at the  box office is because it is very 'heady.' Drop 2 or 3 stars if you do not  like to think.

B000002OG8|5.0|This is one of those recordings that makes you wish for days gone by when creativity and musicianship were valued over marketing hype and video appeal. Especially noteworthy is Ted Turner's (no, not Jane Fonda's  husband) guitar work, most notably on Throw Down The Sword. You won't hear  a more emotive solo anywhere.
0060977493|2.0|This book started out great and I was totally mesmerized, but by the end I was so disgusted and heartsick Iam surprised Oprah hasn't picked this book for one of her selections. (Most of her books deal with totally  dysfunctional people and families) I was so so sad for these children in  this book and the way they were treated by those who were supposed to love  them. These people were so screwed up!!!!! And the thing that disgusted me  the most was the author having the siblings have a sexual relationship in  the end of the book. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT??????? What did that add to  this already totally depressing story. I felt horrible when I finished this  book. Yuck!!!! I never want to go to India.

If anyone has seen any of John Woo's previous work from Hong Kong, you would know that the gun fighting scenes  in Face/Off is a near perfect replica of those Hong Kong gangster films.   This is my first time seeing a bunch of Caucasion's fight like this,  instead of a gang of chinese Triads. It's gun fighting with an art form.   Not just random shooting.  Heh heh... Impressive!!!  Rent it, watch it, buy  it.

I wish someone out there in the record business would team-up with the Jim  Henson Company to rerelease the out-of-print Trevor Jones title The Dark  Crystal. It is an amazing score to a classic cult film.
0385493800|5.0|I've read all but one of Grisham's novels, and I've always had very ambivalent opinions of them and of Grisham as a writer.  I've always described Grisham as a great storyteller but a mediocre writer.  Until now  I had always considered A TIME TO KILL to be his best.  THE TESTAMENT has  displaced that earlier work at the top of the list.  For the first time  since A TIME TO KILL, Grisham has written passionately about his subject.   For the first time EVER, he has found a spare and graceful writing style. I  would have given 4-1/2 stars to A TIME TO KILL and 3's and 4's to his other  novels.  THE TESTAMENT, however, is unquestionably a 5 star work.<br />It is  very difficult to write a good novel of universal appeal where religious  faith is an essentially integrated element.  But Grisham has done it and  has eschewed his erstwhile formula of courtroom tactics and intrigue.<br />For  the first time, I eagerly await his next.
B000005JA8|1.0|In Detroit, there's a self-proclaimed &quot;artist&quot; that spent over a decade collecting old, ratty shoes and attaching them to the outer walls and roof of his house.  Called simply &quot;The Shoe House,&quot; the  massive eyesore represents the diversity of humanity and the journey  through life in which we all must walk.  Or something like that.<br />Trout  Mask Replica reminds me of The Shoe House.  Here's a guy that wastes more  than a year painstakingly teaching his band how to play the weirdest, most  fatally warped, unlistenable music imaginable.  The Shoe House is, to any  reasonable person, a big eyesore.  Even after repeated listenings, Trout  Mask Replica has the same effect on the ears.
B000001EYW|5.0|Still Waters is just that, a quality album of quiet still songs that are very relaxing to listen to. Very much like sitting and watching water flow past and forgetting your troubles. Both Robin and Maurice have excellent  songs on this one and Barry's voice is so mellow.  I listen to the CD at  least twice a day.
B000002H70|5.0|This has got to be one of my top 5 CD's of all time.  Even if you cannot understand the lyrics, the mood of the music will have an effect on you.  I use to listen to track 8, 9, 11, and 12 just before going to sleep.  It  comforts.  I like that most of the songs on the CD are longer than six  minutes.  I wouldn't say that the music is depressing, but it is pensive  and sincere.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Untitled&quot;,  &quot;Disintegration&quot;, and &quot;Same Deep Water&quot;.  This CD is  consistently good from beginning to end.

B000002BBY|5.0|Wonderwall. Don't Look Back in Anger. Cast No Shadow. Champagne Supernova. These aren't merely pop songs, but timeless classics. And it's really no coincidence that they're all contained on Morning Glory, the pinnacle of  music in the 1990's.<br />The album has a very unique romantic air, as opposed  to the very raucous debut. Noel Gallagher successfully fused 30 years of  all that was ever right with music into one album, and has created  something that is uniquely his own. The band made fantastic instrumental  progression throughout the course of the production of the album, except  for that fiend Tony McCarroll, who was rightly sacked by the band and  replaced with the phenomenal Alan White at the onset of recording. Liam  turns in another stirring performance, and upholds his reputation as the  most charismatic frontman of the decade. Despite the mischief, you'd be  hard pressed to come up with a more soulful and focused vocalist. The  songwriting can be other-worldly at times, lazy at others, but this these  10 songs are truly a landmark achievement for Noel, the working man's poet  laureate. <br />Hey Now! and Hello supply the LP with mystique. Some Might Say  and Morning Glory are the rockers here, the former being filled with social  commentary. She's Electric has the undeniable melody characteristic of all  Oasis songs, but even moreso. Wonderwall gives the album its personal feel.  Don't Look Back in Anger offers majestic beauty. Cast No Shadow is probably  Noel's greatest achievement as a lyricist, and is his ode to songwriters  everywhere; namely Richard Ashcroft. Champagne Supernova is a psychedelic  epic that feels about 4 minutes shorter than it actually is. <br />Sure, Oasis  could've taken more time with the album and avoided such mishaps as Roll  With It, but such glitches are overshadowed by the nearly dizzying heights  that the album is lifted to care of Don't Look Back in Anger and Cast No  Shadow. The album is riddled with meaning, with the brothers Gallagher  almost pleading for the listener to recognize its importance. And they do  it pretty effectively, might I say.<br />A painter. A should've-been soccer  star. A talented drummer in over his head. Two brothers from the bad part  of Manchester. Their album. Their Morning Glory. Congratulations guys, you  made music history.
6303607942|3.0|Horowitz gives us a shaky performance of the famous Rachmaninov 3rd. While we are fortunate to have any video document of it at all, the camera shots are at times strangely inappropriate with what's happening at the keyboard.  Some of the most interesting parts to watch are wasted on shots of  Horowitz's face. Particularly amusing is Mehta's calisthenic conducting.  Sometimes his cues are so huge you'd think he was conducting an elementary  school band. Poor Horowitz looks so pale and nervous throughout the first  movement. I understand that he was afflicted with stage fright all his  life, and it's a pity he didn't do a video production like this twelve or  even five years earlier, when his playing was in better shape. Earlier,  Horowitz's fabulous technique coupled with unbelievable risk-taking has  given us some of the most exciting and dramatic piano playing ever.  However, at this point in his life - he was 74 - his tremendous risks don't  succeed very often, and it seems a full-time struggle merely to execute the  score adequately. One feels often that he is trying to be a kind of pianist  he is no longer capable of being, and the result is often uncontrolled and  hard to understand. He only attempted this Concerto a handful of times  during 1978, and from all reports this, the last, was the best of the  bunch. He makes it through without any truly catastophic lapses - unlike  the other performances that year - but this is borderline for professional  work, and really shows up all the hype of a &quot;Horowitz Media  Event&quot; at this stage of his life. Without question, the high point of  this performance comes not from Horowitz's piano, but from the throats and  lungs of the audience following the final chord. Crowds yelled like this  every time he played, regardless of the quality of his performance. I heard  Horowitz several times, including a fabulous recital in San Francisco in  1977. I don't dislike his playing, but I'm no sycophant either. Let's call  a spade a spade: this perfromance really isn't all that great.a spade a spade: this perfromance really isn't all that great.

0440178002|5.0|I read _Shogun_ as a young naval officer, while my submarine was in drydock for a year-long refueling overhaul, five years after I spent a summer learning celestial navigation and piloting aboard a sailing ship.<br /><br />It is still one of the three most memorable novels I have ever read.<br /><br />I was riveted by its portrayal of the bond among members of the  Elizabethan era's tiny brotherhood of truly competent deep-ocean  navigators.  As this story unfolded, the phrase \\"brother to  corsairs...\\" came alive for me as it never has before or since.<br /><br />In  1600, when reliable measurement of longitude was still several generations  in the future, an experienced voyager and shipwright who knew the latitude  of The Lizard (for example) was worth many times his weight in gold to any  nation.  Pinning down a world-class navigator, as Toronaga does in  _Shogun_, could give a leader a tactical advantage similar to the pinning  of a well-placed knight in chess. Demonstrating mastery of the closely  guarded lore of global navigation to a fellow pilot could also inspire his  instant friendship and a claim on his aid when in danger far from home.<br /><br />As they built upon the great tradition of Magellan and El Cano, plus Drake, Cavendish and the other English \\"sea dogs\\",  captain-pilot John Blackthorne of the Erasmus and the Portuguese  captain-pilot of the Black Ship inspired far more awe in me than did any other figure in this novel.<br /><br />Often overlooked, this subtle thread in Clavell's masterpiece is what holds the entire tapestry together.  Without the navigators' courage and skill, the Portuguese Jesuits, Spanish  Dominicans, Dutch Calvinists and Japanese samurai in this masterful tale of religious and political intrigue would have lived out their lives in complete ignorance of one another.

B000000WJZ|5.0|This album has got to be one of the best album's of the 90's, and as we leave this century, and this mellenium for the new one, i'll alway's remember this album as an absolute turning point in my life. (sob-sob ;( )  (LOL) but seriously, when i think back on the 90's and band's like nirvana,  pearl jam, metallica, green day and the smashing pumpkins cross my mind, i  think what album affected me most, what will i remember about the 90's the  most beside's the great historical event's that happened, i'll think of the  great music, and siamese dream is the first thing that pop's into my head.   I started listening to the smashing pumpkins when i was 14 and a bit  lonely, I'm 19 now and happier then i've ever been. the song's lyrics say  alot for the band, and our generation, and the lead singer Billy Corgan's  life, which in some way's was played out by many teen's who listened to his  album, and it proved that were living in the 90's, not the 50's where  everything was perfect.  And so what if there's 1 or 2 word's in there that  are objectionable, i'll be very proude one day if my kid's love the  smashing pumpkins as much as I do. and as we generation X'ers grow up into  the yuppies our parent's became, I can honestly live with the  fact that  this generation did more and saw more then some generations, and that is  why i think this generation, our generatoin, is the best, and I think  siamese dream got us there. ;)

B000009DUY|5.0|once again John Williams composes a powerful score to go with a powerful film. Several people said the movie was bad, and then that got reflected onto the soundtrack. The film was good so were the songs, and if you don't  like it, well, that's just the price we pay for the Hippie Generation's  stand on war. Yes, that's right, I'm a Gen-Exer. This movie, this  soundtrack, they are patriotic reminders of the brave men, sometimes boy's,  who lost there live's for us, for the freedom's we take for granted. If you  don't think you'll like the CD, listen to the sample's, they are good  song's, if you don't like them, tough. That's all I have to say, goodbye.

Vangelis' music absorbs and uplifts the listener from the  start.  &quot;Wait for me&quot; and &quot;Rachel's Song,&quot; have a  floating and relaxing feel which is almost trancendental.  &quot;Blade  Runner Blues&quot; is a beautiful, serene and heaveily atmospheric piece.  Lastly, the &quot;Love Theme&quot; in my opinion, is one of the most  beautiful and mezmarizing melodies ever produced.  &quot;Blade Runner&quot;  is without a doubt Vangelis' best work.

6305308659|5.0|When I saw the preview for this movie, I was sure that it would just be some cutesy little movie where the kids get sucked into the TV show.  We have all seen this scenario over and over again. This was only the set-up  for what turned into a very moving drama. I saw it in the theaters and  bought the DVD the day it was available. And on a side note, I think that  it was very unfair to try and compare this movie to The Truman Show.  They  are both very different movies.  But if I had to choose one I'd go with  Pleasantville.

6301930827|4.0|This is without a doubt one of the most accurate protrayals of nuclear confrontation between the US and USSR around. Five minutes into the flick and they're talking about the PRP (personnel reliability program)! And with  the historical accuracy comes a nail-biting plot and great performances  from James Earl Jones, Martin Landau, and Rip Torn.  Although Powers Boothe  turns in a rather stiff performance and DeMornay isn't quite believable as  a female bomber pilot, Torn is especially frightening as an Army Colonel  bent on turning a horrible misundestanding into an opportuniy to finish off  &quot;the Evil Empire&quot;, once and for all!<br />I've talked to folks that  have worked in the SAC Command Center and flown aboard the Looking Glass,  and this is exactly how it would've happened.  Thankfully, it's a fictional  drama, and not a historical documentary.
630518299X|5.0|Since most of the viewers comments that I've read are positive, it does make me wonder how there could be anyone who rated this movie only one star!  Even the famous critic Leonard Maltin thinks the old  Twilight Zone  was &quot;better&quot;.  I admit, I am an old Twilight Zone fan, and this  movie did remind me of it, but the big difference here was in  &quot;Truman's&quot; world there was no mysticism, just a chilling look at  how a person's life, if starting at birth, could be so totally manipulated  by &quot;well meaning&quot; people.  Slavery was abolished in Abe Lincoln's  day, yet we see in this film a young man being &quot;owned&quot; by a  studio, with people scurrying here and there, ready to grab off the scene  anyone who might reveal the truth and thereby ruin the revenues of this  commercialized society.  As a non-Mormon living in Utah, this movie  screamed at me the &quot;reality&quot; of the Mormon church.  Just as  Truman accepted without question (for a time) the &quot;truth&quot; of his  actually false world, I see otherwise highly intelligent people every day  who &quot;know&quot; that the Mormon &quot;Church is true,&quot; because it  has been presented to them as truth since the beginning of their lives.   Just as heartbreaking as Truman's fabricated existence.  And just as Truman  was discouraged from traveling (so that he wouldn't discover the truth on  his own) these people are discouraged from reading anti-Mormon materials  (for the same reason).  My advice to them, and to anyone who feels like a  Truman--Read the Bible for yourself, and see the reality that has not been  shown to you thus far in life!  This movie was definitely worth watching!
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album is awesome. At first listen I liked about 5-6 of the songs on this album very much. This is my first Hole album so I wasn't sure what to expect (I bought it on a reccomendation). As I listened to it more I found  that I couldn't stop listening to it. This album has become one of my  favorite albums of all time. The song writing and musician-ship is  excellent and well thought-out. The songs range from clean and polished to  edgy and emotionally charged. Courtney seems to have a limited range but  she overcomes that with an emotion that makes her performance amazing. In  other words......I would recommend this album.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Overall, I would have to to agree with some of the previous reviews of this film in that it was a very &quot;small-screen&quot; production.  This film could have easily been on TV with a very humorous plot and even some  slapstick comedy (IE Flying the Enterprise with a joystick.) bereft of the  usual Star Trek genius in both F/X and plot.  This film provided a very  different perspective of the Enterprise crew (under the influence) which  engendered humor and even some &quot;fairy tale&quot; conclusions to some  of the on-going dramtic tangents in the series.  While it was  &quot;cute&quot;, I would have saved it for a special television appearance  and not the big-screen.
B00000FYIL|5.0|I loved this music, especially when the orchestra played it at the Academy Awards last month. I couldn't help dancing to it. It is one of my favorites even though I have yet to see the film. The only thing keeping me away from  seeing it is the sex that I've heard that's in it...
6304539258|5.0|&quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away&quot; sets the stage for the greatest fantasy film ever made. This is not a science fiction film but a fantasy adventure which in 1977 set a new standard on how special effects  could be used to push the boundaries of our imagination (much like the  Wizard of Oz decades before).  At 13 in that year I thought I would see  much more of this to come but I have been disappointed ever since by the  lack of imagination Holywood has had in its use of special effects.  The  new revisited edition is welcome and maybe necessary so that new  generations of viewers can enjoy this classic without the limitations of  its original version.
B000001E3L|5.0|This album seems to have been crafted for fanatics of the music of Van Morrison, people whose energy builds as he belts out a song, those among us who feel that few (if any) singers in the last 40 years have put more soul  into their singing. &quot;Gloria&quot; will make you laugh, &quot;Have I  Told You Lately That I Love You?&quot; will reach deep into your heart, in  fact every song on this two-cd set will emotionally touch you. It is live  music at its best, right there with The Band's &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;  and Joe Jackson's 2-CD set. Fabulous!
B00000ILBK|5.0|Few people these days allow themselves to think beyond the movie, to think about the concept of the movie... don't limit your brain!<br />Insurrection was a movie for everyone: Trekkies, Trekkers and general movie goers.  It  combined drama, humour and moral questioning, provoking  the movie goings'  brain into thinking outside the realm of the storyline.<br />In previous TNG  films, the writers have tried to bring in new concepts that (for me) really  haven't worked:  Data with a sense of humour and Geordie with eyes.  This  film brought in some wonderful concepts which complimented the tv series,  rather than ignored the character development previously defined:  look for  some fun warbling between Picard, Worf and Data; the relationship between  Riker and Troy (it's been bursting to happen for years) and the beautiful  scene as Geordie catches the sunset over the village.<br />For the non  trekkie, the setting was beautiful and you can imagine this place being a  piece of heaven.  The direction and filming was good too.<br />Roll on May 6 -  Release Date!

6305265488|5.0|If you love romantic films, this better be in your hand the next time you go out to Walmart or Hollywood Video. Angelica Huston's performance was incredible! This movie has everything.
6305262063|5.0|Ronin is more than just an  action film. Granted, it moves slowly at times, but that is because that's how John Frankenheimer wished to tell his story. To assume that an action film cannot(or should not) be anything more  than non-stop fights, shootouts, explosions and swearing is to miss the  point of movies altogether. They are first and foremost a forum in which to  tell a tale. This movie takes men and women who are in a rarified line of  work, and shows us how they are just like us; that is, they are just trying  to earn a living, and make it day to day. That being the case, it makes  sense that they would be cautious about engaging themselves in an operation  before they are sure they are prepared to do so. That is why it takes a  while for the plot to progress to the point where things get blown up.
0375707972|4.0|If you have ever had a memory that clung to you despite your efforts to forget, this book is for you.  Bernhard Schlink turns remembering into a journey into self.  A bittersweet and tender lesson in how and what to  remember.

0375707972|3.0|I purchased The Reader due to Oprah's recommendation.  I respect Oprah's book selections because I have liked almost all of her selections.  But this book was hard for me to get into.  I read it three times, hoping I had  missed something.  But I don't think I did.  This book asked so many  questions of me.  Something that was both uncomfortable and distracting.   I'm not used to being interrogated in a way by the book I'm reading.  Not  to say that this is bad, but merely something I am unaccostomed to.  I  thought the book was inciteful, but it did not give me what I had hoped.  I  probably went in expecting too much, several of my girlfriends loved it.   This book did not leave me with anything I didn't already have, only with a  feeling of 'that's it?'
0380977281|5.0|I loved this book so much. It kept my focus through out the whole book. I loved the fact that I wasn't able to figure out what was going to happen next. There are too many books like that out there today and it was  refreshing to read this one.
B000002KAG|4.0|I noticed many of the people reviewing this album got it mixed up with &quot;Grateful Dead&quot;, which is a completely different album. &quot;THE Grateful Dead&quot; was the Dead's debut and is a damn good offering. Not  really as psychedelic as some people describe it. You can be completely  sober and enjoy this. Lots of upbeat tunes that are really well written.  The sound quality is what you'd expect from a 1967 debut but it adds to the  charm in a way. I'm not a deadhead   but I really like this album. Try it  out.
0671015206|2.0|A good thesis which is well proven, unfortunatly the subject matter would be better represented in an paper than an entire book.  The key points are made early on and then proved, and proved and proved.  The the consequences  are examined, and examined, and examined.  Worth Skipping, or reading the  book jacket.
0800141326|1.0|WHAT?! That was Godzilla, the king of the monsters? HA! I'm a 11 year old Godzilla Expert. I've been waching Godzilla movies since I was in preschool,and I think I know what Godzilla is. One of the worst things  about the film is that Godzilla didn't look like Godzilla at all! Emmerich  made Godzilla look like the T-Rex from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993)  with small mountains coming out of his back. He couldn't even shoot  Godzilla's trademark blue death ray. And he was killed by JETS! The  Japanese hit him with everything and still couldn't kill him! If Toho's  Godzilla and Tristar's Godzilla fought, Toho's would kill Tristar's in 20  seconds! Only two Godzilla films are worse than this: &quot;Godzilla's  Revenge&quot; (1969) and &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot; (1973). But  there's an animated T.V series on FoxKids called &quot;Godzilla: The  Series&quot; on Saturday Mornings which is way better than this. When  Tristar makes the sequel, pray it's better than this. When you wanna watch  the REAL GODZILLA just pop a Toho Godzilla movie into your VCR or D.V.D  Player.  If you wish to comment on my review E.Mail me at  spankys@Earthlink.net.
0783229364|5.0|This movie had turned to be one of my Inspirational material. Whenever my mood goes really off i used to watch this movie. Michael J fox was good as ever. The strong story with the right casting had made this movie one of  the exceptional one i had ever seen.

B000002JS0|5.0|Arguably AC/DC's best album. So raw it hurts. LO-FI but it works with the mood. The blueprint for every AC/DC album from then on. I would call it punk/blues rock if I had to label it. Also has some of their best known  songs like &quot;It's a Long Way To the Top&quot; and &quot;TNT&quot;. I  love it.
079073804X|5.0|I must admit, I have previously seen the Exorcist and I had long considered it to be an exploitation movie. I had beleived that the movie only sought to &quot;gross-out&quot; the audience for a fast buck.   However, after watching this version on the DVD format, I have reconsidered  this notion wholeheartedly.  Perhaps the best parts of this DVD version are  the documentary about the movie, as well as audio track commentaries by  Director Friedkin and Author Blatty.  I had learned that Blatty's novel was  based upon an actual 1949 event through the documentary.  The audio track  commentaries also put the entire movie into its proper perspective; the  ability of faith to triumph over evil.  While this film has always been  criticized and condemned as anti-God and pro-Satan, nothing could be  further from the truth.  The movie is actually a profound statement in  support of faith in God and the ability of love and honor to overcome the  powers of darkness.  Good and evil are two sides of a coin.  If a demonic  possession actually occurred in 1949 (as described in the DVD documentary),  then this would indeed be evidence that Satan does exist.  Ergo, if Satan  exists then so does God.  This is some pretty powerful stuff, particularly  to non-beleivers, atheists, or agnostics.  While many have seen the movie  the Exorcist before in one capacity or another, this new DVD's true gems  are the special features which really do explain the film and put it into  its proper perspective.  I confess:  when I first saw the Exorcist I  primarily thought it to be just another &quot;gross-out&quot; movie, and I  just &quot;didn't get it.&quot; After viewing these special features on the  25th Anniversary DVD version, my mind was changed...
0380973464|5.0|I was a freelance production person on this book, and it was one of the best manuscripts I've read in the last few years -- I have been recommending it ever since as a =must read= to everyone I know in the  industry. Incredible. I can't wait to see it in its final print  edition.<br />When will there be a sequel?! I didn't get enough! (yes, and it  is a =very big= book!)
6304083769|5.0|GITS has to be the greatest of all Anime fliks, it rivals even Akira and Neo-Genisis Evangaline. I have never in my life seen such tasteful and symbolical cartoon nudity. Movies such as these are not for children, they  step out of the boundries that most comform to. GITS is a powerful and  provokative look at the human life we have come to undermine.<br />(Note: Be  careful to look at what language the movie is in when you buy it.)
B000000OQF|3.0|Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine are the only songs worth the money to get this album. Other than that, well...some are okay, but a few of them suck something severe.
B000001ES9|4.0|Okay this isn't THE Rush album by any means, but I still love it. Working Man is the best and most recognizable track and points to better things to come. Tight playing and solid song-writing as usual with Rush. More blues  based than other albums. Worth the money in my book.
0375707972|5.0|I could not wait to read other reviews after I finished The Reader and I am so disappointed that very few people are shocked at how Hannah took advantage of a 15 yr old boy!  If the sexes had been reversed, this book  would have never made any book club lists. Why does the general public seem  to think it's okay if a young boy is involved in a sexual relationship with  a woman his mother's age, but a 36 yr old man having sex w/a young girl  would be considered outrageous?  This whole issue was difficult to get  past, therefore the more serious Holocaust issue became secondary to me.   Hannah's illiteracy is sad, but no excuse for her behavior.
0684874350|2.0|While the subject matter of this book describes a gripping poverty that makes any heart sad, the writing faild to get to the point. The images didn't form a coherent message. Shocking pictures of babies in dirty rags  and a useless father drinking is pubs while his family starves are stark,  but where they go is unclear. McCourt has captured individual moments very  well but dosen't develop a story.
B00000IHHM|5.0|The soundtrack is Cocciante at his best. The songs' wording brings you back to the Renaissance time with its hope in the future. Even though it is about 5 Centuries ago it resonates very much with today's hope and  contraddiction.
6302561868|5.0|Alien, and Aliens were both extraordinary films.  I must agree.  But Alien 3 wasn't really a sequal to me.  It was more of a story on its own.  It concentrated less on the aliens, and more on the human relationships, and  the tough time Ripley has endured.  Ripley had been out in space for more  than 57 years.   Close to 60, she has lost everything she ever had, wanted,  and dreamt of.  Everything she once knew, was gone.  Her only hopes of  trying to restart her life were destryed with Hicks and Newt.   She lands  on this prison planet, to encounter her demise.  The alien.  She wants to  get back for all the pain and grief it has cost her.  Her whole life was  dedicated to trying to get rid of this species, in return in dedicates it  life to destroying its one true enemy, her.  In the end, she gets her  dream, to join her family.  She has been out in space, again, for over 57  years, loosing her Husband and Duaghter.  She wants them back so much, the  she denies the offer to have it removed, just so she can live on, knowing  everyhting she has ever had, is gone, because of the alien species.  She  kills the last of the species, by letting it kill her, she gives it what it  deserves.  She destroys it, for destroying her.  Her dream will live on  through the years, until they cloned her, for &quot;it.&quot;  This film  gave the series a touch of Drama, making it one of my favorites of the  series.
B000002KH3|5.0|If you haven't heard this album yet, your probably not from around here. Eddie added more to the rock guitar vocabulary than anyone(except maybe Hendrix). I defy you to find any album with more energy than this one.  Eruption is the best guitar solo in history. The song writing is great too.  Gotta have it!
B000002G0P|5.0|I have been a fan of Extreme since 1990, and I own all of their albums.    This one is the best of the four.    Who else but Extreme would have the guts to write a song with lyrics like &quot;tell me Jesus, are you angry,  one more sheep has just gone astray a hardening of hearts, turning to  stone, wandering off so far from home&quot; (from the song Who Cares?) I  still can't believe that a hard rock/ heavy metal band such as this would  write songs about God, religion etc.   Also notice the song &quot;God isn't  dead?&quot; as another example of this.  Truly touching and profound work,  that transcends categorization.
B000002KOY|5.0|This is one of the best albums to come out of the early seventies.  Crazy Horse has been called the best garage band in rock history, and this album shows why.  Every track is a masterpiece.  If you have ever had your heart  broken you will be able to relate to &quot;I Don't Want To Talk About  It.&quot;  &quot;Downtown,&quot; &quot;Gone Dead Train,&quot; and  &quot;Dirty, Dirty&quot; are just great rock songs.  One can hear the  influence that Crazy Horse had on many future bands like Pearl Jam and  Blues Traveler on this record.  NOTE: a live version of  &quot;Downtown&quot; appears on the Neil Young album Tonight's the Night,  but is called &quot;Come on Baby, Let's Go Downtown.&quot;
0783211856|5.0|This film, is absolutley amazing.  The entire time in watching this film I was in awe.  The pain and suffering of the Jews was definatly felt, and the fear that was surged through them.  I was extremely moved by this film.  this film shows that humaity actually exists in our world of hatered and  racism.  It gave me hope, to see, that people in our world actually have  hearts, and the curage to help others in such a way, that it saves more  than one life.
0790739909|3.0|a bad ending to a great movie....
0060931671|3.0|The ideas contained in this book are as good as you can get. There are symbols and symbols of symbols, metaphors of metaphors. It also contains whacky characters, weird situations, and ancient conspiracies. In all, a  fun mix.<br />Too bad the writing is flawed. The problem is twofold. First  off, when Pynchon tries to be deep he can become unreadable. Luckily I  understood (at least I think I understood) what he was getting at without  these verbal misfires. Second, Pynchon can cut a little too close to the  bone in his prose. He cuts away vital cues in his dialogues and  descriptions in an attempt to sound modern.<br />I still recommend this book.  However, be forwarned: This will not be easy reading, and it won't be your  fault.
6305180261|5.0|This video rocks.  Its a shame that MTV rarely plays any Guns N' Roses videos anymore, so now you can remember those great videos!  If you are a Guns N' Roses fan,  then you must buy this awesome movie!
630438551X|4.0|This movie was.....suspenseful, catching, intelligent, and you had to be able to pay attention to understand what was going on. Though a love story, this is not simply a chick flick...<br />I loved it, I watch it over and  over.....  It's perfect.....
B000002L61|5.0|This second album of Ronnie James Dio's solo career is a tour de force. There's not a single weak song here - they are all good, and some are real masterpieces. The heavy, yet melodic, music (guitar by Vivian Campbell) is  perfectly complemented by Dio's dungeons-and-dragons lyrics. It's heavy,  it's dark, it's brooding, it's otherwordly. It's great. The best songs are  &quot;Egypt&quot;, the title track,&quot;One Night in the City&quot; (what  the hell is this song about?),&quot;Mystery&quot; and the underrated  classic &quot;Eat Your Heart Out&quot;. Enjoy!!!
630417893X|1.0|One of the most sprightly and effervescent of all Broadway Musicals becomes one of the most leaden and boring of Movie Musicals.  <br />Director George Cukor steadfastly refuses to do anything that might have made this  project live on film.  His direction is stagy, his pacing is elephantine,  and the entire film becomes a suffocating bore.<br />The film might have had  some value as a record of Julie Andrews' performance as Eliza.  But Jack  Warner put a stop to that by hiring Audrey Hepburn, who couldn't even do  her own singing.  Hollywood decision-making at its worst.
B000002AVF|2.0|I was in a huge Mariah Carey phase a few years ago, so someone bought me this album.  I must say though that the only good song on this CD is &quot;Forever.&quot;  I love the '50's vibe it gives off.  I'm not a huge  fan of her voice (I lose patience waiting for her to just find a note and  stick with it), but she's capable of writing some good stuff.  I don't know  why she didn't this time.  One star for &quot;Forever,&quot; one star for  songwriting potential
0553213105|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the language, the romance, the characters, even the choice of adjectives... (tolerably well... , and so on) But the point is... Do these things happen, in the real world? Sometimes I have the  feeling that, behaving as Mr. Darcy does in the first part of the novel  won't take you anywhere but to live the rest of your life alone. And  considering that I am a reasonably good-looking, tolerably clever, 30 years  old Italian man, who doesn't see many chances of finding a girlfriend  beacuse of his ill attitude... well, let me confess you that I am starting  to feel a bit perplexed (and worried) about my future... Giovanni (from  Milan, Italy)
B00000ADG2|5.0|The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is an exquisit piece of art, not only for adults but for teens as well!  The song I like the best is the wonderful,  Doo Wop (That Thing),  I think that this piece of music has inspired me the  most of all the cd put together because the true fact that she is talking  about 90% of the men and women of America.  We are all in blame of doing  somthing other than what God wants us to do.  Be smart Lauryn Hill is for  YOU!!
0670880728|5.0|when I first read Bridget's diary I couldn't stop laughing. secound reading made me feel somehow emmbarresed - she's telling all of our little secrets in public! oh my god. now all the boys know.... and yet, I thank  the day this book came in my way. what a joy!
B00000ADG2|5.0|She has a beautiful voice and she knows how to use it. She sings about issues and we should take the time and listen to them all. It is the best album I had in years. It's smart, fresh, and very appealing. It's the most  original, most inventive album there is. I give it &quot;two entusiastic  thumbs up, way up!&quot; The miseducation of Lauryn Hill has something for  everyone! I recomend it to anyone that loves REAL music.
078322706X|4.0|Having never seen a Brad Pitt movie, Meet Joe Black took me by surprise.  The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani was more powerful than any I've ever seen.  It was amazing that Brad Pitt could play DEATH with  such an air of innocence.  The peanut butter scene had me in stitches.  The  love evident between Death and Susan jumped off the screen making the final  scene at the birthday party when Susan realized who Joe was all the more  heartbreaking.  Overall MJB was incredible.
B00000G3CK|4.0|Pi is not just a &quot;math movie.&quot;  This chaotic, tense movie, shot in stark black and white, is sure to be a cult favorite. Racing visuals and paranoia underline the plot, which concerns a math/computer genius and the  various self interest groups trying to manipulate the man's mind.  Sure,  there's a lot of math ideas that mathematicians will appreciate, but anyone  with a sense of the bizarre will like this flick as well.  Definitely a  see-it-again kind of film.
B000002H33|5.0|Although the first four Metallica albums were nothing less than magnificent, this album is particularly remarkable. It is quite possibly the best metal album ever. What really sets this album apart are the songs  and the musicians. Hetfield has the ideal metal voice which hits every note  perfectly. Ulrich is in my opinion the best metal drummer ever. His command  of two base drums is what makes this speed-metal album possible. Every song  on this album is top notch. &quot;Battery&quot; starts off with a very  eerie acoustic intro but soon blasts off into the 200mph Metallica that we  know and love. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is the best song on the album  and the best way to describe it would be to tell someone to listen to it.  &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; is not as fast as the other songs  but has a very triumphant sound to it. &quot;Welcome Home  (Sanitarium)&quot; is musically a very fine song. &quot;Dispossible  Heros&quot; is one of my favorite songs on the album because of the theme  and because of the unique structure. While the guitars are blasting along  at their usual speed-metal pace, the drums are quite slow. Despite the  drastic differences of the tempos of the instruments, they come together to  form a multifaceted sound. &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; is just a good song.  &quot;Orion&quot; is pretty good for an instrumentl. &quot;Damage  Inc.&quot; is definately THE speed-metal anthem. When ever I think of  speed-metal this song come to mind. It tends to get stuck there two. This  song is the emotional climax for an altogether perfect album. To say that  this is not a great album would be as big a lunacy as to say that Mozart  was a no-talent. I proclaim this album a modern classic.
B000002BE9|4.0|Okay, so she's a nutcase. But that's why her album's good. The melodies are beautiful, &amp; her voice is haunting. Most of her lyrics are pretentiously poetic, which is pretty annoying. Yet when you hear the  lyrics that are raw &amp; honest, the ones that she didn't mimic from Maya  Angelou, there's no denying that she really knows what she's doing. There  are a couple of weak songs, I have to admit. But the really powerful ones  make it easy to forget there's anything amiss on this album. It's good if  you're feeling sexy, feeling angry, feeling guilty, feeling betrayed or  just sick of love. This is good stuff.
B000005S37|1.0|Rollingstone said it all when they voted it the worst album ever made. I remember buying the thing on vinyl,returning it for my money back; and later buying a copy at the pawnshop for fifty cents. I figured everyone  else on earth would return it, and it would be a collecters item. It may  well be on vinyl,but don't bother on cd;alter your head and listen to the  refridgerator motor!
6302814790|5.0|There are few movies that you can repeatedly see and love every time.  This is one of them!!! I first saw the film as a young child and to tell the truth it scared me a bit in the beginning.  I learned to love it and  saw that Beetleguese is a really fun character afterall.  Five football  players (feet up) for me!!!
0312199066|5.0|Cernan's memoirs travel the same ground already covered by some of the other Astronaut autobiographies (like Lovell's Lost Moon), but Cernan breaks with tradition by criticizing fellow Apollol astronauts (Buzz Aldrin  in particular), and takes some responsibility for the breakup of his first  marriage.   I would have liked to have seen some of this personal  &quot;cost&quot; examined a bit more deeply, but I guess we can settle for  a bit of illumination on the battle of egos and the jockeying for flights  amoung the astronaut corp.
0394810112|4.0|This is a very nice book! I liked he way most of the kids were spoiled brats! It's a very good book, but Roald Dahl has done mutch better.
0140283587|5.0|This is a great read - a Friday or Saturday night special when you don't need to work the next day, or a few days by the beach or lake.<br />This is Sutcliffe's second book - I got into the site to see if I could find his  first.<br />Hope you enjoy it - booze, birds and lots of inner turmoil, oh to  be young again.<br />Chalky<br />Melbourne, Australia
0871137380|5.0|I became aware of this story upon seeing those terrible images of dead young US servicemen dragged through the Mogadishu streets, live on CNN. I felt so angry at those awful scenes, and wondered, like so many on that day and over many later days, how and why this could happen. Mark Bowden answers all of the questions surrounding the battle, with great attention to detail. Using the admirably frank and often shocking testmiony of the Troops and others involved, he brings home to the reader the full range of sensations and emotions arising from the struggle for survival faced by so many that day. One of the best books I've ever read. It does not glorify war. Rather, it shows human endurance, outstanding bravery and courage, loyalty and friendship. From the very 'base' of Human instincts and emotions, to the paradox of euphoria felt in the heat of battle - its all here. 'Task Force Ranger' - true heroes all...
0385484518|1.0|Albom, a hack sportswriter with a tired vocabulary and an inability to string together sentences longer than three or four words, has finally managed something superlative: He has composed the most awful,  bathos-ridden piece of tripe published in the last 20 years.<br />No doubt  Morrie was a man worth remembering if he could inspire even someone as  unimaginative as Albom. But to have your memory trivialized by such a hack  must have him spinning in his grave. But Albom knows his market, and he  knows there's a never ending demand among the insecure for shallow, overly  sentimental books that pull on the heartstrings, and he's delivered just  that. The sales numbers certainly support that.<br />If you need inspiration,  there are better books, and not all of them are written at the fourth grade  level.
0553565915|5.0|I found Betty Eadie's experience that she described in her book to be amazing.  I have to believe life after death is exactly as she described.  I shared the book with many (ripple effect), and felt compelled to read it  again when my mother became terminally ill.  My mother passed away last  week, and I know she has been on a &quot;tour&quot; of the wonderful place  we all will go.  I gave a copy of Betty's book to my Father, and hope he  will gain comfort in Betty's experience as I have.
0783223161|5.0|One of the greatest films I have ever seen. Whenever I see this movie, the music and the end where Norman Bates smiles at the camera still freak me out even though I have seen it and know what happens.
0345350499|2.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel of Arthurian Britain is undoubtably well-written, but is made one step above repugnant by the heavy-handed feminist, anti-christian story lines. The only men not condemned by  Zimmer-Bradley are simpering druids who allow themselves to be dominated by  the oh-so-wise priestesses of Avalon. And every Christian is portrayed as  either a brutish, opressive lout (if male) or a submissive yet jealous  shrew (if female). Arthur himself, far from being a heroic warrior king, is  portrayed as a weakling torn between his Christian (in name only) wife, and  his pagan sister.  If you're looking for Arthurian historical fantasy that  is not filled with ridiculous neo-modern tripe, go read Stephen Lawhead's  excellent Pendragon cycle.
B000005YZM|4.0|I bought this album a while back with great expectations, but I have to admit that upon the first listen, I was disappointed.  This just didn't sound like the lost classic I was expecting.<br />However, upon repeated  listening, I began to enjoy it more.  There is nothing else as immediately  catchy as &quot;Time of the Season&quot; on the album.  Most of the other  songs are pretty tame, somewhat melancholic songs with mostly Rod Argent's  keyboard in the mix.  There is nothing that is anywhere near as rocking as,  say, &quot;She's Not There.&quot;  But even so, this record is enjoyable,  and it is *certainly* a lot better than about 99.9% of the stuff that is  slouching its way up the charts today.
0312199066|5.0|What a book! I remember the Apollo program, especially the bittersweet mission of Apollo 17, who's intense emphasis on science was overshadowed by being 'the tail of the dog'. Well, I can assure you that selecting Gene  Cernan to be the last man on the Moon was one of the best decisions Deke  Slayton ever made. Gene's unabashed enthusiasm flows through this book like  a torrent. From describing his early days as a Naval aviator to his gutsy  gamble that won him command of Apollo 17, Gene gives the reader insights  into what it really felt like to be there. Be it struggling to get back  into the 'Gusmobile', nearly augering in on Apollo 10 or the triumph  commanding a lunar mission, Gene brings it home to the reader in a manner  that makes it hard to put the book down. If you liked The Right Stuff  you'll love this: it's pure Cernan, and it's The Real Stuff.
6302135621|5.0|This is truly a remarkable film, considering the restrictions put on filmmakers back in 1941.  Orson Welles is a emarkable actor\director, and this film has the same lasting effect whichever ediotion you see.  Welles  paves the way for actor\directors such as Roberto Benigni(Life is  Beautiful)today.
B000002NJS|4.0|I'm convinced that this is one of the best albums of 1998- and one of the best albums ever from the fabulous Miss M, who seems to have gained many interesting insights from motherhood... Outstanding tracks: Frozen (of  course), the Power of Goodbye, and Little Star (which showcases some of the  loveliest vocals I'd ever heard in a drum &amp; bass song).  I was very  dubious about this album at first- &quot;Madonna does techno?  Oh  no!&quot;- but really, if there's any musician out there who can do  techno-crossover/synthpop as well as Depeche Mode, it's Madonna.  Well  worth the money.

0805017305|5.0|How could anyone read this book without shedding tears for the Native Americans who were persecuted, punished, lied to, tortured, and executed beyond what humanity should be able to imagine.  From the Sand Creek  massacre to Wounded Knee, and including the foolhardy attack by Custer at  the Little Big Horn, it's all here.  From the Apaches to the Nez Perce, all  of the American Indians are represented.  No American can read of such  debilitating behavior by men and their government and feel anything but  shame about the treatment of the noble Americans who now are consigned to  reservations.
B000005QH3|5.0|I saw this movie many times when it 1st came to the drive-ins in 1971. Always one of the favorites of my generation!! Great soundtrack, great car, great chase scenes. Barry Newman was also in the short live TV series  Petrocelli. Dean Jagger, the old prospector has a great character part  also. I still watch this movie from time to time, put it in and its the  Summer of 71 again!!!!!!
B000009ORQ|4.0|Dawn of the Dead is a great zombie movie. It's got enough gore and freaky looking zombies to keep you interested. Once the main characters secure the mall, ridding it of all the zombies, the film takes you on a joy ride where  you get to fulfill the fantasy of having your pick of anything and  everything in the mall. It almost seems like fun until a gang of militant  bikers ruins it for them. It left me wondering where the characters went  after they left the mall in the helicopter.
0783229569|5.0|Great movie done right by a great director.  Just one bad trip after another, awesome.
B000002LKF|5.0|In my humble opinoin this is teh best album released in the 90's.  It still holds up despite being 9 years old.
B000002LR6|4.0|of the Ministry i've heard this is the best. my personal favorite is &quot;Just One Fix&quot;, its crushing guitar line and heavy beat really gets the adrenaline going. &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot; is alright.  the lyrics are nonsense but at least the music is good. the real reason i  gave this CD a 4 is that there really isn't much on it. the last two tracks  are instramental so they aren't &quot;whole&quot; songs. &quot;N.W.O.&quot;  has some lyrics, but its still not a regular song. its like only getting  six tracks. still i think its well worth the price.
6305262063|5.0|If maryjusz drives her Chevy like they drove the Audi in the movie, thank God I dont live in Chicago Ill.<br />But really. The movie was first rate. The same person that directed the car scenes in Ronin also directed the car  scenes in Grand Prix, another excellent flick starring James Gardner.

The Offspring, Ignition, Smash, and Ixnay!
B000005IRG|5.0|This music fan first heard Marquee Moon in its vynil incarnation some twelve years ago, a decade after its original release.  I had never heard anything quite like it before, and have not since.  It evokes the same  creepy, half-lit emotional territory as the Velvet Underground's White  Light/White Heat, but without that LP's willful primitivism.  Guitarists  Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd exhibit the melodic inventiveness and  improvisitional skill of Duane Allman or Richard Thompson, and the rhythm  section of drummer Billy Ficca and bassist Fred Smith is as precise and  relentless as any other in rock and roll.  The instrumental sections,  especially the guitar solos on &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Elevation,&quot;  and the breathtaking four-minute workout in the title track, nudge these  songs out of the realm of rock and roll and point them somewhere closer to  John Coltrane territory.  Marquee Moon is what psychedelic rock was always  meant to be.  When looking for other albums to compare this one to, one  doesn't think of rock and roll titles, except maybe for White Light/White  Heat or the Stooges' Fun House; rather, one thinks of Coltrane's A Love  Supreme, Miles Davis's In A Silent Way, or Paul Gonsalves's saxophone solo  on Ellington At Newport.  Also noteworthy is the cover photograph by none  other than Robert Mapplethorpe, and the addition of the last, previously  unissued minute of &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;; where it faded out at 9:57 on  the record, it ends at about eleven minutes on the CD, which is definitely  an improvement.
0871137380|5.0|&quot;INTENSE&quot; A well researched, graphic book depicting the raw emotion and frustrations of brave Americans sent into harms way. The best first-person narrative of combat since &quot;We Were Soldiers Once - And  Young&quot;. The valor of these dedicated servicemen wasn't adequately  rewarded.
1558807381|5.0|I love this video, and really think that it should be made available to those of us who own DVD equipment.  They are much too slow in giving us older Fantasy videos in the new and better format. That is the only  critizism that I have to make about the lovely movie.
B00000ADG2|5.0|The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the best album I've bought in a long time.  Her songs are packed with emotion and that's what draws the music to a more personal level.  Ex- Factor and To Zion were my most favorite.  It  takes courage to do what is right and to think with your heart and Lauryn  does a wonderful job of portraying this in her inspiring music.   I also  thought that the snippets at the end of each song with the high school  class added to the emotion and realism of her music.

6304117752|5.0|I grew up singing to this video and now my kids are relishing in the music, the scenery, and , did forget to mention, THE MUSIC! It's a must have for any video collection.
B000002N2Z|1.0|I repeat, do not buy this CD. I was mislead buy the reviews on this site. The deftones were compared to Tool, Korn, and Rage Against the Machine, actual good bands, so I took the chance. The whole CD sucked. The small 30  second segments of real audio don't tell you jack either. The 30 seconds of  a few songs sounded alright, but all sounded similar. The whole CD sounds  exactly the same. When you expand the 30 second segments into real songs,  they don't cut it. In fact, I don't think the deftones changed the tone on  their guitar for literally the entire CD.     Also, those of you who have  recently heard their &quot;shove it&quot; song on the Matrix(A good movie,  by the way) sound track, beware. I like that song (and still do even after  this atrocity). Liking that song does NOT mean you will like this CD. In  the &quot;shove it&quot; song, the vocals are a Tool syle mix of whispering  and violent screaming. Deftones' Adrenaline has not of that style to it.  Just bad guitar and nonsensical vocals. In fact, some songs sound so  similar, I switched several times between them before recognizing any  difference.      Once again, I give the strongest possible warning I can  against buying this CD. This could be the worst metal CD I have ever heard.  It doesn't even deserve a star. I wish I could give negative stars, perhaps  even a few &quot;X&quot;s.<br />PS- I listen to Marilyn Manson, Tool, Gravity  Kills, some Rage Against the Machine, Ministry, Korn, and some Metallica.
0312199066|5.0|Cernan tells a great story of America's manned space program's early years with candor. However, I have two complaints. First, he over indulges in (and mixes) metaphors &amp; similes, which gets tiresome. Second, some of  the grammar is poor (I blame his co-writer and editor more for that).  Having said that, I still think it's a terrific book.
0783222955|5.0|and i own over 300 films. and yes i/ve read the book, and my background is such (bachelors in english and classical studies) that i usually *hate* it when a film disagrees w/ its source.<br />but sometimes you really do have to  view them as different things. gregory peck/s performance is just plain  awe-inspiring. the delicacy of the black and white film is unbelievable.  i/d put it at *least* in the top 5.
0800141709|3.0|With no special features at all,why would someone buy this dvd?  Sure it's a classic, but the VHS version would certainly suffice. Why I bought the DVD of this movie was the words &quot; Presented in Multi Aspect  Ratio&quot;. The packaging goes on to state that this movie was filmed in  Multi Aspect Ratio &amp; the proportions would change periodically  throughout the film.      I have watched this DVD a few times and I have  yet to see the Multi Aspect Ratio on my television (A 35&quot; Sony XBR).  Misleading packaging on this Columbia release is certainly a negative to an  otherwise great movie.  Someone should wake them up at Columbia. Some extra  DVD features would also have been nice for the price of this product. An  excellent movie presented in a so-so package.
B0000004V2|5.0|The Roses, are alternative to everything but themselves.  Each track on the CD is different but all share the arrogance of greatness.  If you don't agree, listen then, and you will.  The songs range for pop rock to dance  influence to down and out frenzied rock and roll.  You could take apart the  band and find things like, the singer can't sing but is the true frontman,  the showman; the lead guitarist doesn't show the emotion of the songs; the  bassist is all over the place; and the drummer is ten times better than the  singer is.  But when you put them all together you get the greatest unknown  band ever!  If you don't have the CD then you never heard of them. Take a  chance, what have you got to lose?
1573226521|4.0|A fantastic debut for the author.  I was completely intrigued by this book.  It takes place in a far away land, that I can only hope to one day visit.  The characters are true adventurers, not your typical backpackers.   And the risk they take to find the ultimate paradise brings them to a place  that is both breathtaking and dangerous.  This is Leonardo DiCaprio's first  role since Titanic and I think it will be a great one for him, as long as  they don't change the script too much.  The great thing about Leo is that  his previous movies had an indepedent feel to them, Titanic was an atypical  Leo movie.
0784011605|1.0|Jane Campion's film, although lushly beautiful and with stellar performances from all the main characters, particularly Neill and Hunter, left me sickened and angry. Hunter's character begins as a fiercely  independent and unconventional woman; throughout the movie she is degraded  and brutalized in attempts to make her 'normal', and exploited shamelessly  by her aspiring lover Keitel. Also, be warned, there are scenes of graphic  violence.
B0000025IE|5.0|If there is one CD that defines the terminology&quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, this is it. This is the one! Get it and bang your head!
0800141326|2.0|For a film with so much hype, you'd expect better than this, but once again imagination, thought-provoking points, plot, originality and strong characters have gone to the all in favour of big, bold special effects.   Not that the special effects are that good - Godzilla himself looks more  like a real animal than before but its offspring are obviously computer  graphics.  In fact this whole film has the feel of something designed by a  machine - it's so lacking in character.  Ideas 'borrowed' from Jurassic  Park abound. On a more positive note, the Frenchman intended as the 'evil  foreigner'(lacking a twirly moustache and sinister cackle, strangely)  actually comes across as the only real human being in the film. Bringing  Godzilla up to date and abandoning the man-in-suit version was a good move,  but it's a shame a plot worthy of the change wasn't written, an preferably  one that didn't encourage kids to believe in a world populated by 'goodies'  and 'baddies'.  The xenophobia was also something we can do without in a  world where there is already more than enough racism.    The Japanese films  were much more enjoyable than this.
B000001FSU|5.0|How come Anthrax doesn't get the attention that Metallica and Megadeth get? This CD is up to par with anything by them.&quot;Now it,s Dark&quot;, &quot;Antisocial and &quot;Schism&quot; more than prove it! Pick this one  up if you crave fast, ass kickin music!
B000000WA4|5.0|I have loved the Smashing Pumpkins since their debut with Gish.  Ever since then I have gotten all of their albums, and I even bought James Iha's debut solo album Let It Come Down.  They are one of the best bands of the  90s, in my opinion.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled off  mellon collie.  It is everything they have ever done and then some all into  one.  My favorite song is &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby.&quot;  There are  many songs on this album that got no recognition, and they are better than  any of the hits.  I guess that goes for every album.  I really do think  that this is an awesome album and if you are reading this review and you  have never heard anything by SP, I recommend getting this album first and  then getting the others if you like it.
6305308659|5.0|Get over it!!!!!!! If you can't sit back and watch this movie and truly enjoy it then there is something truly wrong with you. This movie had one point! I direct you to when Bud was showing the Ice Cream shop owner a Art  Book. This movie is about looking in our own mundane black and white lifes  and finding that thing or things that brings some color. And to the person  that gave it one star, quit watching movies.
B000002JSV|5.0|Huh-huh, Heh-heh, Huh-hu
6304457383|5.0|I think &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; is excellent!  It looks sort of theatrical, like a play, most of the story takes place in Audrey Hepburn's apartment.  The story is about criminals looking for a doll full of heroin  that they think is in Hepburn's apartment.  They take advantage of he blind  state and put on clever &quot;skits&quot;, so to speak, in order to find  the doll.  However &quot;The World's Best Blind Lady&quot; proves that her  loss of sight is a small hindrance and that she is a very clever opponent.   The climax was heartstopping!  If you like thrillers this is a must-see!
B000002LND|5.0|Can she help if she moves on in het artistic ways? No! This Cd represents the best of the Madonna of the early 90's to her days as the Boy Toy. If you stuck with her during her controversial (laughs)80's and the Justify my  Love scandal. Then buy this Cd and move on....... Go with her it's fun to  be there!
6304675348|4.0|After this movie's success there were many pitiful attempts to &quot;get on the bandwagon&quot;.  Craven's skillful direction and the suspense-creschendoing cinematography is what kept it from looking  incredibly cheap.  It's what I would call a first class horror film.  The  lovely black humor, which is centered around horror movie cliches, is what  gives it it's kick.  However, there was just a little too much  bloodletting, but that's just what  cult fans want.  It was just a little  overacted too.  I'm not a fan of horror films myself so I couldn't bring  myself to give it five stars, but it certinly deserves four.  When compared  the the other low-budget rip-offs of the last few decades, it ranks pretty  well.
B000002MUW|5.0|This Cd is a beautiful follow-up to her controversial,yet universally misunderstood EROTICA.<br />She regained universal appeal,once again with her wonderful ballad Take a Bow.<br />I simply love this album. Even Anti-Madonna  people have this album! It is very catchy!
0385474547|3.0|Kind of boring, but a lot of people I know who also read this book for class kind of liked it becaue it was unique. This book is also good if you are in the mood for a tradjedy (sp?)
B000002MFN|5.0|While the controversy of SEX swept the world. Many ignored the album EROTICA,the songs on the album may be scandalous to some people.But,ignored are very good hits of 50's songs done Madonna style like Peggy Lee's Fever  and Marilyn Monroe's Bye-Bye Baby! The album also contains very touching  songs like, Why's it so hard,In this Life,and Rain. They quite possibly are  universally appealing to all ears.<br />The album as a whole is a cross  between overtly sexiness and pure genius!<br />Selling millions,This album is  considered a flop? In what way?  Respect to you Madonna!
0385493800|2.0|I love Grisham, however, I MADE myself get through this book, often skimming pages.  I was so disappointed--I heard on Amazon that he was bringing back several characters from other novels, and I couldn't wait to  read it.  This did not happen.  This was definately &quot;OK, I read it,  now what?&quot;

6304539258|5.0|I would definetly give the movie a 1 million, but I can't because I&quot;ve only got 5 stars. You find yourself laughing at the droids when they do something (ie: when they're about to be crushed in the garbage  shute, and 3PO shuts it off and they start yelling &quot;oh,no!  They're  dying!&quot; 3PO says.  It's really funny) The acting is wonderful, and the  story is great.

B000006045|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  You don't mind waiting for something this good however long it be.  Massive Attack don't need to prove themselves but here they have created a masterpiece.  If you like POP then loose yourself  somewhere else, this CD is serious and will have you pleading for more.   Very cool and very well executed.

B000006N61|5.0|When I first saw this movie, in 1980, it was the best thing since sliced bread.  Mel Gibson, in my opinion, became a star that year.  Since the movie's release to video and TV, many key scenes were cut from the original  theatrical version.  For instance, the scene where Max gets a chance to  test drive the black beauty Interceptor and chases one of the bikers; he's  full Nitro, the red light starts flashing, he's pushing the Interceptor to  the limit, and then...she stalls out.  Though devastated, this brought many  a laugh from the audience.  Another key scene: the abandoned Hall of  Justice (police station); the brutal slaying of Max's fellow officers and  Boss by the bikers.  I've got both versions of this great film (foreign and  domestic) and neither have the scenes that I just mentioned.  Again, a  great film...lets lobby for the original, uncut, Director's cut, whatever,  of this film on its 20 anniversary!!!
6304539282|5.0|I LOVED all three movies, although my favorite was... I'd have to say Return Of The Jedi. The special effects were AWESOME.   I know that some people get really close to the characters during the movies, and I really  did.  I got really sad for Luke, and for Anakin... when he admitted he  really loved his son.   It was a wonderful story, and ended sadly.
B0000025H4|5.0|But spend the extra money to get the Japaneese version.  It has 4 extra songs, all of which are great (I expecially love Starbreaker).  Amazon sells it under the imports section.
044651506X|5.0|If you like DeMille's characters to be wiseacres and clever, and want to learn about the picturesque north fork of Long Island, NY, then this is a 5-star story.  Extremely accurate in its description of local geography,  fishing, etc., except for the catching of a shark in Plum Gut (the waters  that separate Orient, LI from Plum Island).  Ain't ever happened, and never  will.  But all in all, a great read!
B00000ICN5|5.0|Although Texas Flood is the nr. 1 album Stevie has ever made (in my opinion) I do have mixed feeling about this reissue. It does not really add s something new. Okay, it sounds fresh and cleaned up but the added  bonustracks lack freshness and clarity and my biggest disappointment was  hearing the fade out in Tin Pan Alley. I cannot believe that someone can  put a fade out in a song like that and put it in the middle of the song to.  So, in short...5 stars because it's a fantastic album but you don't get  anything new from the bonustracks.

B000002GJ7|5.0|Francis is the little boy with a cigarette in his mouth on the front cover of &quot;Pornograffitti&quot;. Francis is trying to find his knack in a society with shallow morals. The first song on the record hints at this  concept. The song is called &quot;Decadence Dance&quot;. It's a great song  to start with since it instantly grabs a hold of you. There are plenty more  songs on this record that showcase Extreme's musical versatility. You have  hard rock,acoustic melodys,jazz vibes and external noises on this record  like (bees,a bouncer,a thunderstorm etc). This is truly one of Extreme's  finest with the exceptions being III Sides and WFTP. If you want to venture  off on a little journey with Francis through his quest to find love of  sorts in a shallow,dirty world. Buy this CD! It's awesome...
6304493738|5.0|&quot;A TRUE MASTERPIECE!&quot;
6303415571|4.0|I loved Yessongs the first time I heard it in the mid seventies. When I knew that a video also existed, I began to look for it. It was a long search. Now that I got it, its a treasure, although I expected that the  movie had all of the songs of the records. I also found that some songs in  the video are not the same versions of the records. A little dissapointing  thing is the picture and sound quality (compare it with Pink Floyd's Live  at Pompeii, from almost the same year).  Anyway, the video is an important  progressive rock testament.
0790733897|4.0|That's right folk's, McQueen is cool in this very good film from 1968. As Frank Bullitt, Mc Queen is in his element as the stoic, laconic character that became his trademark. Car-chase through San Francisco city streets has  to rank in top three all-time car chases ever filmed, with McQueen  performing many of the stunts himself.  Jacqueline Bissett is solid as love  interest, and Robert Vaughn is, as always, perfect in the role of the  underhanded, less than forthright cop in charge. Film set the stage for  such other McQueen classics as, &quot;The Getaway&quot;, and &quot;Le  Mans&quot;.  Definitely a man's movie, but romantic, if at times slow love  story, will keep the lady in your life interested. Much recommended!
6303212263|5.0|I saw this Movie a couple years back and never ever forgot it.I'm a superhero fan like non other. The special effects in this movie aren't that bad  eighter,you got to remember it was 1978.And the cast is  encrediable.Marlon Brando,Cristhopher Reeve,Gene Hackman,and Margot Kidder  are an excellent cast in this wonderful superhero fantasy. HIGHLY  RECOMENDED!!!
B000007UEY|5.0|God in Heaven!  This is the most musically satisfying bits of music to ever come from the mind of a pop musician.  It stirs the soul in its softer moments and...well it does the same in its louder moments as well.   Rutherford may be best known for his pop ventures with Genesis and Mike and  the Mechanics but he truly comes across as an important composer for this  period in time with Smallcreep's Day.  I don't want to sound pompous or  elitist here but I, for one, really long for more of this man's serious  musical side.
B000002C4J|2.0|I used to like her music but a lack of variation in musical-style means: that of late - as evidenced by that quite wretched song from the  'Titanic'- she has begun to sound more and more like a coyote on a hill  howling at the full moon. She is becoming too bland and one-dimensional in  her presentation.
0767817478|5.0|I've been a Godzilla fan ever since I was 7 years old. Now as a college student my admiration for the big lizard has grown bigger than ever since this movie came out. The effects are superb and rival those of the rubber  suit character. However, my heart stays with the classical Godzilla, but  I'll always be a Godzilla fan to the day I die. This version was one of the  best films I'd seen in 1998. I thought it was better than  &quot;Armageddon&quot;. To all other Godzilla fans out there I love ya!  Those who think Godzilla is a fanatical craze or think that the King of the  Monsters is a total wimp to the entertainment industry, then keep it to  yourself...GODZILLA ROCKS SO THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6304117302|5.0|Wish I'd seen this on the big screen to experience the full impact of the cinematography and the stirring musical score which gave the film so much 'atmosphere': drama, foreboding, passion, tenderness and tautness.

0345423496|3.0|Like so many of his recent works, Clarke's &quot;3001 - the Final Odyssey&quot; hangs a few tenuously-connected vignettes together, with a heavy sauce of Clarke preaching about what he sees wrong in today's world,  as here he revives &quot;2001&quot; astronaut Frank Poole to be the butt of  numerous lectures from his &quot;betters&quot; in the &quot;more  civilized&quot; world of 3001. From religion to circumcision to eating meat  (he's against them) to environmental activism (which he appears here to  support), the &quot;story&quot; (a relatively uninspired one, and quite  timid in his technical prophesies) frequently jerks to a halt as it groans  under the weight of its lecturing load. His improbably &quot;deus ex  machina&quot; ending, he complains in the Afterword, is his own - but since  it's the same one as the movie &quot;Independence Day&quot;, he's afraid  that people will think he stole it from ID4. Don't worry, Dr. Clarke; it  was a bad idea in ID4, and it's a bad idea here, too.  Who'd steal garbage?   Overall: read it in the library.

6303286542|4.0|This video is great.  This tape has some of my favorite Aerosmith video's such as Cryin',Amazin' and Crazy, as well as video's I've never seen such as Livin' on the Edge and Angel. I loved it.
0670880728|1.0|This book is funny for about five minutes (and I'm being generous)...  Bridget Jones is a classic example of a shallow, pathetic woman who views her career as a way to find a suitable husband, defines herself by who she  sleeps with, how much she weighs, and sees parties as opportunities to get  drunk.  You keep hoping that she will see the light and start to grow up  but she never does and the book never seems to end.  So much more could  have been done with this character, I expected a lot more...
B000001FXR|5.0|Underappreciated in its time, &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; marked the worldwide debut of &quot;The Wailers&quot;.  Before the battling egos, before commercial exploitation, they smoked like smoldering ganja.   Multiple unforgettable tracks here:  &quot;400 years&quot;, &quot;Slave  Driver&quot;, &quot;Stop that Train&quot;, the title track.  Both Tosh and  Bunny Wailer added incredible harmonies (as well as Tosh's lead  contribution on 400 years).  This is one of the defining albums of reggae;  in my opinion it was the best studio album by the group in its original  incarnation.
1558807381|4.0|This is a very good fantasy that I recommend.  (The info. for this movie at the top of the page says this movie is rated R but it's not, it's PG.)
6300216039|5.0|This movie is very good,  I give it a 5 stars +++.  More movies should be made like this one.  Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey are the best.  Perfect couple for this role. A very sad love story.
B00000273P|5.0|I first heard this album in college, not realizing the musical power of this band.  After just two listens, I realized what a tremendous work of art it is.  Everything single song has its own magical essence, with each  note bringing forth a profound love of what is pure and beautiful.  This  is truly pop music at its apex, with such gems as We Let the Stars Ago and  One of the Broken.  Almost ten years later, absolutely NOTHING I bought or  heard has come close to the pure musical joy of this masterwork.  This  album will be dear to me, long after the members of Prefab Sprout have  faded away into musical oblivion and I approach the twilight of my own  life.  I absolutley love this album - forever.
0385484518|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It helped me see what is and what isn't important.  This book explains life and it's great gifts.
B000003S0B|5.0|I had to give this album 5 stars to bring up the average a bit. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. True it is not as good as &quot;In The Court&quot; but how  could they have topped it? Pictures of a City in my  opinion is worth the album alone. I would agree that this album is  strikingly similar to ITCOTCK except for side two which is much more  experimental (Devil's Triangle) and pointed to things to come. The title  track is a beautiful song that I think is one of KC best. Cat Food's humor  is out of place on this album and should have been replaced by a more  appropriate theme. A great thing about this album is that it has Greg  Lake's singing. In my opinion he had the best voice in prog-rock, and KC  was never the same after he left. KC's artwork has always been interesting  and this album is no exception. It really adds to the feeling you get when  listening to this album. If your into early KC or progressive rock in  general, I would definitly grab this one.
B000005QH3|5.0|This is much more than a film about a car chase. For those that lived in those times it is a wonderful example of searching for truth in times when truth was hard to come by (Viet Nam, bigotry). It's the story of a black  man and a white man joined in the brotherhood of righteousness. Two men  joined by their search for truth not separated by their color. And, it  shows the ultimate form of demonstration against the crooked establishment  by performing the ultimate sacrifice, taking a downward spiraling life and  sending it into infamy, if only for a moment. And, for us old hot rodders  who saw it at least eleven times at the drive in, it is some of the best  chase scenes on film.
0767802772|5.0|This movie was so romantic.  I loved it, my husband really isn't into any romantic movies but he thought it was cute too.  A must see.
B0000028RR|5.0|The mad bass, guitar, and vocals set this activist rock group apart from the rest.  And let's not forget the maddest of them all, Zack de la Rocha.  His militant lyrics will knock the wind  out of any moderate liberal out  there.  This album is definitely recommended for first-time listeners of  Rage, but not recommended for the faint of heart.
B000003S0D|5.0|This album is too much! In some areas there is quite a bit going on, and if you are musically adventurous that's exactly what you want! It has all the fixings of an early KC album like moog synth, horns, insane drums, and  occasional heaviness. Pete Sinfield's lyrics are as lucid and great as  ever. And for an album recorded in 1970 the sound quality is top notch.  Anderson from Yes sings one of the songs and does a great job. Definitly on  the top 5 KC album list.
0451191153|5.0|I loved and adored _Atlas Shrugged_. I didn't expect _The Fountainhead_ to be as wonderful. It was even better. The characters in this book are more real and accessible than those in Atlas. I always like Galt (of course) but  in my mind he doesn't compare to Roark.  There's no arguing that this book  is, in essence, a &quot;political tract&quot; of sorts. Whether or not you  agree with Rand's philosophies, her books are worth a read. If you can  successfully argue against her logic, I'd love to hear it.
6305265496|5.0|This movie was so good.  I have seen almost every movie that has come out this year, and this was by far the best romantic one.  It was excellent and I recommend it to everyone.
0312853238|5.0|Orson Scott Card is now my favorit author.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
6302293553|5.0|&quot;And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.&quot; &quot;U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I, uh, leap out of the Rabbit, uh, and uh...&quot; &quot;Listen, lad. I built this  kingdom up from nothing. When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it  all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a  second one. That sank into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned  down, fell over, then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one... stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these  islands.&quot;
6300185249|4.0|I cannot imagine why the critics have been so hard on this movie.  I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks, and seeing this movie started me out that way.  There are so many hysterical scenes, especially the one in which he goes to  the kitchen and simply turns on the light.  The movie is good, pure, clean  fun and does not pretend to make any grand statement about society.  It's  just plain funny.
B000002KD9|5.0|Neil's effect on music of the people is going to be felt for the next several decades, if not centuries. Just think, a lot of Young's stuff is going to go boppin' through space with the next several generations of  space explorers! Neil's stuff is powerful and sincere.It's got the urgency  of an ambulance siren. Hear him, see him. He's one of our living Greats.Be  nice.
0671004107|5.0|Carl Sagan was Absolutely one of the greatest minds of out time. He was the only person so far that has expressed a complete understanding of both science and religion truly unambiguously, and with the most comprehensive,  nevertheless beautiful poetic voice, a work finer than Cosmos. Sangan's  insight in physics is no less that that of Feynman, Weinberg or Hawking; in  addition, he may have explained the importance of Christianity to the world  better than John Paul II.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is one of the most powerful short novels of the twentieth century.  The story of Meursault is an existentialist battle cry, just as Sisyphus is doomed in his struggle against his fate, so are we condemned to  death by a banal society.  As Camus shows us, the hero must not allow  himself to be cowed by this inevitability.  This novel will only be  appreciated by those who despise the slave-morality.
0380778556|4.0|Rebecca was an excellent book. After analyzing it  and Daphne du maurier for an english project, i found it to be an excellent book. THe only thing i wasn't thrilled with was the end, which was very unrealistic. It is  written in a very good way which adds to the suspense that builds as the  story goes on. however, if you are a person who does not enjoy endings that  are inapropriete and end up &quot;happily ever after&quot; i would not  reccommend it. For me the suspense overided the ending.
B000001Y2U|5.0|The first segment, the Heirophant, is in a way an introduction to his life as he began the album, a summary of his pleasures and pains before inaugration begins. By the start of Tourniquet, it is clear things are  turning sour and the whole of the inaugration of the worm deals with  truly  growing up and how to deal with it. Anyone who's got their wings will  understand this. You reach disintegrator rising and it is like a parody - a  parody of the heirophant. The same style, but somehow different. What is  that difference? Marilyn Manson has got his wings. Those who hate this just  don't understand it, or haven't tried to. Or m,aybe they're scared, or  cynical, in which case they will ignore me because of my spelling mistakes.  As for him going to glam, I don't think he had a choice. He became what he  became. The only unfourtunate thing is that he's more mainstream now, It  almost feels like he's sold out.
6300151379|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies and i have been trying to obtain a copy of it for many years now. it is definitely a classic and i would like to add it to my collection...i can't even find it in the video stores anymore!   Please, i want to see this movie again.
6304117752|3.0|I watched this about once a year when I was a kid, and I liked it for all the normal reasons: good tunes, a fun family, majestic scenery. But a few weeks ago I watched it with my roommate (we're both 23-year-old men) and  although we were actually quite giddy initially - the &quot;Hills are  alive&quot; shot is still a sugary jolt - we got pretty tired with it and  could barely make it to the intermission. Is any family remotely that cute?  Would the baroness stand a chance against Maria in a zillion years? Just  how many teen ingenues did they have to turn down before they settled on  the lifeless actress who played Liesl? She's 16 going on 17 pains in my  neck. Still, it is a story you can root for, and Julie Andrews is a dear.  As in doe... ou know the rest.
B000003Z4C|5.0|This cd almost ruined my life becuase all I wanted to do was sit in my room and listen to it, the whole thing over and over again. It is on the same level as THE CURE's PORNOGROPHY as disturbing masterpieces go.
6300151379|5.0|This was really a fun movie.  I haven't seen it for quite a few years and would REALLY love to own it.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE re-release it!  I only collect the really memorable movies and I've been on the search for this  one for years.  The ultimate babysitting movie!<br />We're keeping our fingers  crossed out in in the wild west for Labyrinth....<br />K. Martin
B0000028SU|4.0|This CD may not have the classic material of Born To Run, Greetings, or E Street, but it sure beats the clunker Human Touch.  The sounds were written from the heart and mind instead of merely meeting a deadline.  I miss the E  Street Band and some of the backing vocals are cheesey but with excellent  songs like Lucky Town, Better Days, My Beautiful Reward, and Waist Deep In  The Big Muddy, this CD stands pretty tall.
0385493800|2.0|You want this book to be a great adventure but it is only half a ride.You get bored in the middle and at the end you wonder if you have lost your time. Grisham has better books.
B00000064G|5.0|&quot;Pink Moon&quot; is very simple and yet very intricate in its complexity. It is short, but intense. It lacks a purpose or a witty twist, yet it creates an emotional landscape very few records have achieved. This  is the true escence of a genius crying out. In an openness and directedness  that require no artifices.<br />In half an hour, Nick Drake encompasses what  the majority of musicians never do in a lifetime.<br />It's an extraordinary  album.
0780622642|5.0|This is the best movie ever!  I never fell asleep so easily!
0792151720|5.0|This movie was excellent. Once again, James Cameron astounds us with awesome special effects, a wonderful script, and a touching love story centered around a historical tragedy. This was by far the best love story I  have seen and it also has the best ending EVER in a movie! It's definitely  worth sitting three and a half hours and it's definitely worth adding to  your video collection..
6305399212|4.0|I have seen the director's cut of aliens and I liked it. Although I felt that some scenes should of been in the final cut; I was glad that most of the weren't. If you are a big fan of ALIEN movies as I am get the  director's cut today.
0515125024|3.0|Sophomore slump (of sorts) hits another author.  Though the book was an enjoyable read, it just didn't grab you like his first.  Though I'd recommend it, I'd recommend &quot;Killing Floor&quot; much higher -- though  this one will pale even more in comparison.
0440219078|4.0|I thought the book was good but it got very confusing. Imagining a whole different world is hard to do. If you like reading books in the future I'm sure you would like this book. The author did a good job writing this book  but didn't paint a picture in my head so the book was hard to follow.
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chboskey is an awesome writer. That book  grabbed me soooooo fast I couldn't put it down  until it was done. I am extremely glad to have  bought the book, but I was disappointed it was as  short as it was. It was  perfect in every way, but  I wish it was longer. I immediately fell in love   with the characters. I want to stay with them  longer..... Mr.Chboskey, if  you read this... PLEASE WRITE ANOTHER BOOK!!!!!! :)
B00000BKDV|5.0|This cd is incredible! Every song on the albumn is played to perfection! By the way, BRUCE AND ADRIAN ARE BACK!!! Yes, it's true...! Piece Of Mind is a definite 'must have' for any heavy metal fan. Up The Irons!
6305313687|5.0|i was not prepared for what just took place on my screen-this film virtually explodes with all types of raw passion and emotion the likes of which i haven't seen in years. it was gripping and highly emotional; the  acting by all was wonderful and natural, but edward norton should really  have had this year's best actor award. he is a terrific young actor who  will become one of the greats as the years pass. anyone interested in  seeing something so very unique and different should not pass this one up!  the photography (both color and black and white)was brilliant as was the  digital transfer-new line has done it still again!  this is one awesome and  unforgettable flick that will stay with you for hours after you have viewed  it for the first time.
0312199066|5.0|What a book! I remember the Apollo program, especially the bittersweet mission of Apollo 17 who's emphesis on science was overshadowed by being the &quot;tail of the dog&quot;. After reading Cernan's book I can  guarantee that selecting Gene Cernan to be the last man on the Moon was one  of the best decisions Deke Slayton ever made. As someone who vicariously  lived the Apollo experience through the writings of it's astronauts, having  the best storyteller in the NASA ranks write the final chapter of man's  greatest exploration chronicle is almost too good to be true. Cernan's  colorful, to the point style flows through the book like a torrent. From  describing his early days as a Naval aviator to the gutsy gamble that won  him command of Apollo 17, Cernan gives the reader insight into what it felt  like to be there. Be it struggling to get back into the 'Gusmobile', nearly  augering in on Apollo 10, taking an unexpected 'swim' in the Banana river  or the triumph of commanding a lunar mission, Cernan makes you feel like  you are right there with him, chanting &quot;Go Geno, go...&quot;. The book  also gives an insider's view to the role that politics, individual  personalities and fate played in NASA's crew selection process. If you  liked The Right Stuff you'll love this book. It's pure Cernan, and it's The  Real Stuff.
B000002B82|5.0|This is Ozzy's best album with Zakk Wylde, no question about it. The others are good, but this one is so varied that there is no way not to like it. The title track is probably the best song, it is friggin awesome. Its  funny that Lemmy from Motorhead helped write &quot;Mama I'm Comin'  home.&quot; The track is great, but it is neither Lemmy nor Ozzy's usual  style. Maturity brings things like that song about though, I suppose. The  bottom line is, Ozzy has never made a bad album. Some were worse (The  Ultimate Sin), and some were better (Blizzard of Oz), but they were all  worth it. Weather he is solo with one of the guitar hereos he has had  (Randy, Zakk, or Jake), or if he is with everyone's favorite Christian rock  band Black Sabbath, Ozzy makes great albums. My hat is off to him.
0780624890|5.0|At first I thought this movie was going to be cheesy old-time vampire schlock wrapped with 90's special effects - was I mistaken!  Wesley Snipes is great as the dark and brooding savior of the &quot;Day  Walkers&quot;.<br />There is gore aplenty; within the first 5 minutes blood is  dripping from the ceiling of a vampire night club and dozens of vampires  die a pretty horrible death even for a blood sucker.  A must see for fan of  this genre.
6300182266|5.0|I remember watching Battlestar Galactica as a sci-fi addicted 5-year-old (after Star Wars) with my Galactica action figures in one hand (I had cool ones like Adama, Starbuck, and the Cylon) and my Colonial Viper (with that  poke-your-eye-out torpedo thing) in the other. Today, I can look back on  the series as a great combination of the classic adversity-and-hardship  plotline coupled with some groundbreaking special effects (Dykstra was  &quot;the man&quot; back then). I love Star Wars, but Galactica is a whole  different thing - the plot is inherently different, and the characters are  more diverse (the humans, anyways). This movie is well worth the time spent  watching it.
0783232039|5.0|&quot;Bride of Chucky&quot;, what can I say? One of the most original, self aware black comedies of the 90's. A troup of well rounded, well acted vibrant characters, top notch direction from Ronny Yu and clever  screenwriting from Don Mancini make this movie a vivacious little gem of  the horror/comedy  genre and the best of the &quot;Childs Play&quot;  series. The fact that the movie manages to be both scary and funny when it  matters makes it a unique experience in it's own right and when you've got  Brad Dourif coupled with Jennifer Tilly it redefines the meaning of  chemistry. This has to be the best maniacal onscreen romance since Bonnie  and Clyde graced our screens way back yonder! The murder set pieces are  creative and cinematic yet this doesn't take itself too seriously and knows  exactly when to wink at the audience. The DVD transfer is beautifully crisp  and clean of all artifacts, actually this is one of the best non THX  transfers I've witnessed and the AC3 soundtrack nukes throughout the movie.  As a bonus you have commentaries by Director Ronny Yu, actors  Jennifer  Tilly and Brad Dourif as well as screenwriter and Chucky creator Don  Mancini. There's a fun behind the scenes featurette, a theatrical trailer  for the movie and another uncredited theatrical trailer for &quot;Childs  Play 2&quot; hidden is Brad Dourifs Biography. Mix this with Jennifer  Tilly's hilarious on set Diary and you have one of the best, highly  recommended DVD releases so far.
0684874350|5.0|I love to read, but rarely does a book have such an enormous impact on me. Frank McCourt's vivid and guileless present-tense story telling style brought all the characters right into my heart and there they will stay.  One of the best books I have ever read, by far.
B000002L9J|4.0|When Shadow was first visited by the ghost of Gary Coleman, in the background played &quot;There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.&quot; While it's become the theme for everyone from Ellen DeGeneris to Bosh, nobody can  deny that while Van Halen and Iron Maiden do indeed rock, nobody rocks the  box as hard as the Smiths.<br />Bitter no doubt, is Moz that Gregory Hines was  cast in the role of Shadow's neighbor, even he cannot deny the pop  tour-de-force of Shadow's own mind funk. <br />At this point, the only  question remaining is -- will Marr appear in the 2nd or 3rd film?
B000002JSV|5.0|This album is an undiscovered gem.  This is the best encapsulation of AC/DC, with Dirty Deeds running second.  This is a fully developed AC/DC, with songs like Downpayment Blues, that can't get any better. SLowly, this  album will gain &quot;classic&quot; status over time.
B0000024JN|5.0|All I have to say is that this CD is the Beastie Boys best.  It is full of great songs.  I enjoy listening to it weather I am in the car, at home, with friends, or listening to my discman on the go.  The best tracks are  3,6,7,8,9, and 11.  Thats all I can say about the CD; it is the best of the  Beastie Boys
6305308659|2.0|I actually bought this movie before watching it. BIG MISTAKE! I didnt really enjoy the movie. There was not as much humor in it and it was hard to sit through the whole movie. I would recomend it only if you want to be  bored!
B000002C1Z|5.0|This album is very good I enjoyed the first two track
0767830555|5.0|Robert De Niro has always been known as an actor who takes his parts very seriously.  In fact, during the filming of Taxi Driver he actually drove a taxi for 2 weeks before someone noticed him.  The movie takes the viewer  right out of his/her chair and drives them in the taxi towards the road of  imagination.  It's incredable how Robert takes us in many of his movies!   This is most definately a movie to add to your collection if your a true  movie fan!
6304366086|5.0|The first movie to put you in the cockpit.  A must see for any road racing or sports car enthusiast. Taken from the time when speed was outrunning safety advances and F1 racing was truly the most dangerous sport in the  world.
0767817478|3.0|Yes, the original Godzilla was the best, and yes, the story and dialogue of this film is bottom of the barrel, but its a big dumb summer movie.  It was exciting enough to make me forget about how pissed off I was that the  old G design was tossed to the wayside, and what we are left with is  essentialy a giant iguana.  I agree with some that it shouldn't have been  called Godzilla, but you cant deny the power of scenes like the one where  the beast jumps from Manhattan Island into the Hudson, or the climatic  scene on the bridge. A great special effects ride, dont expect anything  more.      The DVD version is great, with tons of extras, including some  Japanese trailers for the real Godzilla.  It makes you realize the true  value of your DVD player.  A great price for such a packed disc.
0784010501|5.0|Madonna is wonderful in this DVD.  The black and white scenes contrasted with the color concert scenes is awesome.  If you have a surround sound DVD stereo system, this is definitely worth it!
B000003TA4|5.0|I remember the first time the bartender in a local  bar here in San Francisco played this album.  It  was a unique experience that I'll never forget.  The bar was packed on a Friday night and the bartender was raving  about this new tape he just bought.  He put it on and, about 10 seconds  into Smells Like Teen Spirit, literally everyone in the bar went nuts!  I  never saw so many people react  that fast to a song.  For me it felt like,  wow, someone's finally making the music I've been waiting all my life to  hear.  I'll never forget the first time I heard NIRVANA!
630508999X|4.0|I loved the first Scream and i still do, so when i heard Scream 2 was been released i was more than eager to see it. I was a little dissapointed though, i thought it was a good movie but when the killers were revealed,  they werent really convincing and there motive wasnt the best, but Neve  Campbell shines still and Courtney Cox is good, i wanna watch the film  again as i may like it more the second time round, but it was a good film  and i cant wait for the third installment....
0140434143|4.0|I decided to read this book for a seventh grade English class. I was more than a little overwhelmed when I started reading, so I put it down and got another book. Well I finished that one, so I started this again. It was  hard going to read the all the old english, but definitely worth the  effort. I love it, and I reccomend anyone to read it, and don't let the  language intimidate you.
B000009QPQ|5.0|I love this CD, plain and simple.  I can listen to it all day (which I have done), and it just makes you feel so...so...I'm not even sure how to describe it.  The voices, the guitars, it all just meshes together to be a  very enjoyable listening experience.  I once saw them open up for the  Wallflowers back in 1997, and to be honest The Wallflowers should've been  opening up for the Jayhawks.  They rocked!  I loved it and the rest of the  night was a disappointment...Anyway, if you're looking for a truely fun  record, this is it...
067144901X|5.0|Sandra Boynton inspires parents to read with sound effects and sing phrases which inspires children to love her books!

B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols were what a rock band should be. They hated each other and their fans. They hated their record company. They got wildly popular. They put out one album that was a masterpiece and at the height of their  popularity they said &quot;screw you all&quot; and broke up.  Now THAT'S  rock and roll. Too many musicians create beautiful music and only milk a  formula after they find it. Every punk bands wants to be them, no one  succeeds. Their music and lives were chaos, they ended in chaos. Just as it  should have been. This album is the alpha and omega of punk.
0790729628|5.0|My favorite part of this movie is the dream sequence that Deckard has about a unicorn running through a meadow.  That makes you think:  Is Deckard a replicant?  Interesting, huh.
6302798450|5.0|This movie is just about as classic a cult fim as you'll ever find!!  You will laugh your ass off!!  Bruce Campbell is God!!!
B00000DFRS|4.0|I'm a Huge Whitney fan who owns all of her solo CDs as well as the music from &quot;the Soundtrack Years&quot;.  This is another example of a great work from a talent.  My favourite track is the Wyclef Jean penned, &quot;My  Love is Your Love&quot;, that is both soulful and reminiscent of a Bob  Marley tenament yard.   This is genuinely good stuff from Ms Houston and  her voice is as strong as it ever was.  Maybe a duet with Lauryn Hill  next!???
6301942647|5.0|I first saw dreams 9 years ago and to this day after the third time I've seen it Im still amazed with its beauty.<br />   Dreams is the most amzing foreign film you will ever see,very enjoyable so go out and buy it or rent  it.
6301955293|5.0|This movie should be hanging on a wall in the Louvre. Set in a small west Texas town in the early 1950's. It concerns nothing important, just how lives intertwine. It won Oscars for Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both in  supporting roles. It should have also won for best picture and best  direction. This movie gets better with each viewing.
0060977493|5.0|I recently read Arundhati Roy's _The God of Small Things_ after having heard about it in a university workshop. Just previously I'd read Mamet's _American Buffalo_, so first I had to slow down and get used to Roy's rich,  poetic language. <br />It definitely was worth it. The tapestry she weaves is  often sad but never really depressing, for the narrating voices sparkle  with energy, wit and humour - which, in the end, might be what helps them  survive.<br />I don't want to tell people how to read, but if someone dislikes  this book because the names are somewhat difficult for the average American  reader - don't read. Or at least, don't read anything that has to do with  the big wide world outside the States (or England, at a pinch). Personally  I'd recommend this book warmly to anyone with a liking for heartfelt,  poetic language.
6305313687|5.0|This film was truly moving.  It shows racism's ugly face for everyone to understand.  You can see how the human mind view's thing's differently from person to person and how those view's change people.  It should be viewed  in school so that kid's can see how stupid it all is.
0780623703|4.0|I have never seen a good movie use such obvious means of symbolism and have it come out with this quality. One can see the changes that comes over the characters as they discover what is beyond themselves, the things they  thought were forbidden, things we take for granted in our daily lives. As  for the visual effects...seeless. The hype about the effects was a big draw  and if you are not one for storylines, the effects will keep you  interested.
0385493800|4.0|This book moved along at a crisp pace, with good character development.  The ending was not the predictable one I had expected.  Would recommend.
006016848X|5.0|An interesting book that accurately specifies the differences between men and women. I found myself described in a lot of what is written in the book. I beleive that by understanding these differences between men and  women you can improve your relationships with the opposite sex especially  with your mate. It helps you understanding what are these reactions  appearing from your sweet half and how to deal with them to obtain the WIN  / WIN solution.
630534731X|4.0|This is one of the best science fiction movies ever. Too bad somebody got hold of the script and wrote in two cheesy robots, VINCENT and BOB. They are like floating tin cans with the generic over-sized &quot;Disney  Eyes&quot; their animation people love to put on their characters. Well,  the decision backfired. But the rest of the movie comes through, however.  Just go to the kitchen and get a beer whenever the robots get the  limelight.
0783230710|5.0|One of my favourite movies ... seen it in both Dolby Digital 5.1 ... waited for the DTS version ... and it certainly was worth the waiting for  !!! Not to be missed addition to your slowly growing library of DTS DVD's.
6300151379|5.0|My little girl loves this movie.  The songs are so fun for her to dance to.  This was my favorite as a child as well.  Hopefully it will be rereleased so that the rest of the younger generation will have the chance  to see this wonderful movie.
630280082X|5.0|Without a doubt, if you like guitar, this movie will make you want to pick it up and play.
0156528207|5.0|The Little Prince was truly a good book. Though simple and a bit short, it has a good meaning and the meaning of this book is a literary masterpiece!
6304091931|5.0|All this action, all those stars, that music too! Worth watching for Dennehy and Cleese alone. Or Glenn and Kline. Or Goldblum and Costner. Or Glover and those Henrys. Hell, I'd watch it just for Linda Hunt.<br />Settle  down. Get the family around you and relish!
0790740443|5.0|I watched the movie for the second time on DVD and it really brings out a lot of missed detail from the VHS version.  Kurt Russell does an excellent job in this movie, considering that he broke his ankle in the first couple  of days of shooting.  The director's commentary on the DVD is very  interesting to listen to as the movie runs, and you learn a lot about the  movie -- some bloopers they made that made it into the movie..A lot of  technical information.  If you liked the story line in Shane, you'll like  it in this movie, since it seems to paralell it very closely.
0375408282|4.0|Written from the point of view of a man too young to have any responsibility, yet he must agonize over the crimes of a woman who has had a proufound effect on his life.  This book is erotic and thoughtful.  There  are only a few characters but all are clearly drawn and the reader must  wrestle with all previous conclusions.
0790729725|5.0|The DVD of GoodFellas is amazing.  An already perfect movie is made even better by the crystal clear picture and great sound.  It also comes with two theatrical trailers.  It takes up both sides of the DVD, so you have to  flip halfway through, though.
0790739909|3.0|Cage and Ryan deserve applause.  McLachlan's music was enchanting and haunting.  The ending left a lot to be desired, was too abrupt, and ruined an otherwise fully entertaining movie.  However, I rate it a Must See.
6304618344|5.0|My comments pose more of a question than a movie critique.  I urge anyone who reads this to explore the painting &quot;Abduction of the Daughters of Leucippus.&quot;  The reason for this inquiry is such...the two fellows are  twin brothers.  One is Castor and the other is Pallox.  Being in an art  history class and hearing this for the first time today...I decided to try  the web to see what I could find.  If you have any suggestions, information  or opinions...please send them to me at  &quot;BTE8816@students.ssu.edu&quot; or  &quot;YthLDr001@aol.com&quot;<br />Thank you very much and happy hunting
6305076464|5.0|The wit and comical imagination of John Cleese is unsurpassed and this work proves it.  This collection of series offer us timeless comedy to enjoy over and over again.  In fact, the more times viewed, the more times  you will laugh and understand the idiosincracies of all the characters.   This hotel of horrors out does the Bates Motel!  What amazes me is that the  main character Basil Fawlty (the ???? Hotel Owner) is composed of John  Cleese's creative imagination but one thinks that there can be and are some  stressed out people out there that he represents!  If you enjoy British  comedy, this is one of the best.  If you want to give the British  Satirical, Dry, Sledgehammer Witted, Slap in your Face, Intelligent humor a  try, you cannot miss with this one.
1878424114|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws changed my life and really made me take a look at myself. I loved this book, it is the most charished books i have. I ahve read it numerous times and suggested it to all of my good friends. This  book has made me see a light of goodness and warmed my heart!! Deepak  Chopra is one of the most knowledgeable people i know of and i recomend any  of his books, they are all wonderful!!
6305311463|5.0|Two thumbs up! What else could be said
6303332609|5.0|This has to be the greatest movie ever made.  I first saw it as a kid, and I have been hooked for life.  This is through a great cobination of comidy, horrer, and sci-fi that this film gained it's nitch as a cult film.  I  would have given it more stars, but the limit is five.  This has to be the  best film dealing with Klowns coming from outer space for the sole purpose  of killing.<br />A masterpice.
B000001GE5|5.0|The etudes played by Maurizio give us the most chopinian way to play them.  Powerful left hand that almost flies over the keyboard, and a delicate sound and a charm depth in the slow pasages.  The original recording won an  award in France!!  The preludes played in a vivid form and with a little  &quot;nostalgia&quot; create a fantasy!! The powerful strikes of the chords  an harmonies of the polonaise transport us to the polish air.
B000002J20|5.0|This was the first Yes album I got, and it is still one of my beloved ones. It was also among the first progressive music I ever heard.  For me, Tales from Topographic Oceans is a rock symphony in four movements, and it  is also an Hymn to God and all creation.  I love most of its keyboard and  guitar playing, and also the vocal parts.  Although the sound is a little  dull, it can be fixed with a good equalizer (I hope the remastered edition  sounds better). I have to admit that this is not an album for most rockers,  you should have a special taste for the sublime to enjoy it!. After more  than 20 years of hearing it, my feelings about this masterpiece are almost  the same, even though now I'm more into classical music than before.  I  think that the people who says that this is a bad album is not capable to  unveil the treasure behind this music.
B000001FB6|5.0|Probably, the strongest Purple album in musical sense - ever! After the hiatus in 1976, one of the greatest hard-rock bands of all time gathered together with their Mk.II (Gillan, Blackmore, Lord, GLover, Paice) to  produce &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. This is something that heavy metal  missed in the beginning of 80's: classical and professional sound with no  glam, wonderfully crafted melodies and quite driving heavy rhythm.<br />The  Godfathers of hard-rock at their best!
B0000004V2|5.0|I just bought this LP for an incredible swiss girl because, trust me, this CD can bring visions of happiness to the ones who are dear to your heart.
0684874350|5.0|This book brought back memories of my grandfather telling me stories of how things were growing and working in a coal mining community during the period of the depression.  Whether you are Irish, Italian, or any other  nationality or mix of nationalities this book is for you.  Frank's  description of what his childhood was like will leave a pool of sympathy  and emotion in your heart.  It is a true testiment that reguardless of  what circumstances and environment a person grows up good things can always  happen.
0790735431|5.0|Has anyone ever sat in an airliner at 20,000 feet and hit turbulence?  Kind of scary huh, the plane shakes and moves and you can't help but wonder &quot;are we going down?&quot;  Now imagine the same scenario in an  un-pressurized B-17, Flak bursting around you, and German fighters waiting  to pounce on you at the first opportunity and send your plane down in  flames.  This was the experince of an airman in WWII.  I know we all live  in our little sheltered world where we get bored in history class, watch  MTV till our brain cells are gone, and complain that old people are too  slow.  Well this movie gives a good dose of reality.  Not as graphic as  &quot;Saving Private Ryan(100 stars out of 5),&quot; but it will open your  eyes to the horrors of war and will instill a sense of awe and respect for  WWII vets.  If you can watch these kinds of movies and not feel a sense of  gratitude, I pity you and your generation.
B000002BNB|2.0|YO i Dont get it.....why does every1 like this cd. it is basically horrible. the only thing stopping me from givin g it 1 star is &quot;Winter Warz&quot; and &quot;all that i got is You&quot; the rest of it is  horrible. the beats are repetative, the lyrics dont do anything for me.  dont get me wrong wu tang is phat but ghost is lackin on this one. it could  have been a lot better. maybe &quot;Supreme Climinte&quot; will prove  itself to be better.
6304258984|5.0|The rock starring Nicholas cage, Sean Connery and Ed harris is a modern day classic with all the characteristics of what makes a film great. Cage plays an FBI chemical weapons specialist selected to join the elite Navy  Seals team in a bid to overthrow a group of mercanaries and neutralize the  threat of a battery of VX poison gas rockets being fired upon the  unsuspecting citizens of San Fransisco.Connery however plays the part of an  ex SAS agent imprisoned by the US government for his knowledge of the  corrupt goings on in the Whitehouse. The only man ever to escape from  Alcatraz now comes back to haunt the Government that took thirty years of  his life being the only man alive to know how to get into the once feared  penitentiary. He Plays a vital part of this fantastic movie showing every  bit of skill acquired throughout his distinguished career and not once  showing his age. I rate this as a classic action film and recommend it to  everyone. the great acting, plot and music score are all well within the  confines what anyone would expect from any Don Simpson and Jerry  Bruckheimer production. i end this with a quote from the movie by ED harris  , if you have any doubts about seeing this film &quot;i hope this elevates  your thinking&quot;
6301942647|5.0|One of the most insightful looks into the mind of one of 20th century's greatest film makers.  Perhaps this is the definitive movie of this time period that others in the future will try to emulate
630463949X|4.0|I was disappointed that the video quality was not up to the high standard set by the Rolling Stones 'Bridges to Babylon' DVD. Otherwise, it was a great concert video.
0792836634|5.0|cool and great movie
B00000DFRS|5.0|This album is brilliant. Whitney sounds relaxed here. My favorite is &quot;You'll Never Stand Alone.&quot; Phooey to all the critics who say it's bad!
B000001GBJ|5.0|Songs From A Secret Garden flawlessly blends together classical and folk influences.   It is fragile yet powerful, serene yet haunting.  Definitely not stereotypically &quot;New Age,&quot; this CD is more powerful, and much  more profound.  The virtuosity of the performers is apparent, yet it never  obscures the message of the music with excesses.  &quot;Songs From A Secret  Garden&quot; is the best CD that I have bought in a long, long time.
0385487339|4.0|This book was quite entertaining. I enjoy the rich and detalied portrayal of deciet and heartless emotions. I would reccomend it to almost anyone. The movie is also very wonderful.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the best SP album ever! With such awesome songs as Cherub Rock, Today, Rocket, Disarm, Mayonaise, and SpaceBoy<br />I highly recomend it!
B0000029DD|5.0|This is one of the best LP's ever, simply! And easily the best debut. And Jeff's death the saddest loss.<br />Go lose yourself in dream brother.....
B00000D9TK|5.0|This is a beautiful CD. Celine sounds soooo lovely here. My favorite track is &quot;Papillon.&quot;
6305313687|5.0|American History X <br />I don't think I have ever seen a movie that I wish would come true as much as this one.   It is the story of one man who learns from where he has been to see where he needs to go. Fresh out of  prison for murder, Derek Vinyard (played by Edward Norton) tries to impress  upon his little brother the lessons he himself has learned the hard way.   In the face of chaos, it highlights the possibility of how education,  respect for humanity, love for our family, and love for ourselves can  change not only me, not only you, but all of us. It's a movie I want to  believe in. It's a film that says start with you, fix what is in your  control, do what you can for yourself for your family, that is each of our  responsibilities. Edward Norton (Primal Fear) will surely do for the screen  what Deniro has done and is still doing. He infects me and compels me to  believe him. Edward Furlong (Terminator 2) is the picture perfect  intelligent young man with the ability to be taught a better way. Not  taught through violence or experience, but taught through logic, knowledge  and kinship.  Norton is surely deserving of his nomination for best actor.
B000005QH3|5.0|I remember being blown away by this B movie at a drive when I was in my 20's; it was the 2nd movie - not really the one I went to see.  The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, perfectly in synch with the action.   The character development is occasionally over-simplified, but not always -  there's some especially fine acting by a few of the minor characters.  In  what other film would someone lost in the desert run into a gospel rock  performance by Bonnie &amp; Delany (in real life, one of their fans &amp;  occasional collaborators was Eric Clapton).  This film is worth seeing many  times over, but DON'T let anyone watch it who doesn't see it from the very  beginning (it's crucial later for getting the full emotional impact of the  story).
0790725657|5.0|My favorite part was when the Dad got bombed.  And when she got kidnapped by the police.  My teacher also liked it.
B000002NFM|5.0|What is it about Essex in the UK that makes me feel like the true UK artistes come from there, Empirion,The Prodigy, Underworld and Twelvetrees (i think). Four of my now favorite acts on this planet (just got 'boy on a  cloud' by Twelvetrees.......EXCELLENT!!!!!!) all come from more or less the  same area, and they all sound great live too (haven't seen Underworld  'live' yet).....maybe i need to move there for some inspiration....anyone  got a spare room?
6302413931|5.0|when seeing this movie for the first time it amazed me the second and third it destroyed me.  this is one of the most remarkable movies put to film.  francis ford is one of the most ingenous film directors of all time.   when producing the movie he felt that it would be the first movie to win  the noble peace prize.  i fill that  would understat the movie it is a  monolithic movie acomplishment like no other.  it is a must for any film  student.  and even more of a must for an every day film lover.  widescreen  shows how this true art should be seen.  this to me is the most  inspirational noncomprmising picture ever highly recommended by an avid  movie goer.

1558908366|1.0|What could be more fun, romantic and glamorous than prostitution?  Radiant Julia Roberts and handsome Richard Gere show us a world where streetwalkers are sweet, healthy, funny, charming, sassy and destined to live happily  ever after.   Yes, with Hollywood we expect to suspend disbelief, but this  film shows no hint of the reality of sadness, brutality, desperation and  boredom that define the lives of real prostitutes.  Why do we need to make  the world's oldest profession appear to be the world's most rewarding?    Pretty Woman brings us a prostitute who never encounters pimps, drugs,  disease or prison --- just fun, fun, fun ---- as her &quot;career  choice&quot; earns her jewelry, designer clothes and eternal love.  What a  wonderful lesson for the kids.  Disgusting.
6303983812|5.0|A great movie for the whole family. The cats are great and the villan is evil.  Just the right mix.  Watching the animals that are met along the way, cats and others is fun.  A movie that can be enjoyed over and over.   Cat lovers dream.
B000002C1W|5.0|LET'S STOP BASHING DAVID GILMOUR. HE HAS AS MUCH TALENT AS SYD BARRETT OR ROGERS WATERS. ON THIS ALBUM (FIRST WITHOUT WATERS) GILMOUR BEGINS TO DISPLAY AS A SONGWRITER WHICH I FOUND IT TO BE GOOD.
0783229895|5.0|Wooow! Excellent!. Bride of chucky is an example of the best horror film since last ten years (I include Halloween H20, another great movie). Brad Dourifs voice..better than ever!
6305127689|3.0|I was working on the F-14 program at Grumman when &quot;Top Gun&quot; was released.  The only more embarrassing movie featuring our products was &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;.  Since the Tailhook scandal in the  early '90's, the behavior of Maverick and his buddies, previously only  sophomoric, now seems recklessly foolish.<br />The real star of the movie is,  as it should be, Naval Aviation.  The opening scene of carrier flight deck  operations is terrific - sadly, the movie is all downhill from there.   Modern fighter planes like the F-14 are not utilized like WWII era P-51's,  as they are in this movie.  The reality is much more complicated, and much  more interesting, than the nonsense presented in &quot;Top Gun&quot;.<br />As  for the acting, every member of the cast (with the possible exception of  the always annoying Ms. Ryan) has done better work elsewhere.  The script  is hackneyed, the situations unbelievable, and military life has never been  like it is in &quot;Top Gun&quot;.
