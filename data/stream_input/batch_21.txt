B0053O89YM|5|I only watched one episode of this series on TV, it was in the third season.  I really liked it and have enjoyed watching the first season so far, I will be buying the foiurth when it coms out, please let me know.
0739384198|5|Very riveting- wanted to hear the entire story at once.Took a while to  identifying the many characters with unusual names. Can not wait for the next book<br />Ute Loeffler
B009ZQC7MY|5|One of the best series ever. Not only do you see the lifestyle of the upstairs titled family, but you also see the lives of the doenstairs servants and how they lived
B00003CXAA|5|I cant tell you how much, this movie series is a piece of perfection. Although the third movie dragged the trilogy off track a bit, this is still the GREATEST movie series of all time. ...
B000B589JI|4|I read a review about this container that talked about leaks. I to found that the main gasket used was not working as it should and there was a slow but noticeable leak. Slow drops would form when I inverted the container. You do not want your fuel to be lost to a slow leak. It also poses a fire hazard!  This was upsetting considering the name behind the product! But like the other fellow who noticed the same problem I went and got a plumbing gasket for a shower hose. end of problem. I have had the new shower gasket in place for over three days and it is tight and effective with no leaks whatsoever. I really like the idea of this machined piece of aluminium  and wanted something that would be good for my hunting knapsack or my go to bag. I wanted something that could take a hit or a drop and not get crushed and leak all over the place and wreck food or stink the place up.So if you do buy this then don't even bother putting fuel in it until you get a shower hose gasket in place. I talked to one fellow at the hardware store and he told me that rubber gaskets won't work because it is fuel. Said it would dissolve the gasket...Wrong! I went to a different store and just bought the gasket and fixed the problem. I rated this a 4 out of 5 because of the gasket problem but it is an easy fix. It has been over 4 days since I replaced the gasket and not one drop has escaped. Shook it and turned it upside down and no leak.This is good but I wish Zippo had figured out the problem before they sold this container.
B003G4W49C|5|NOW I WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE.<br />SEE HOW IT COMPARES TO THE BOOK. NOW I GOT TO READ THE ENTIRE SERIES.
B000B5OD4I|5|Overall, this is a really nice watch.  It doesn't quite have the panache of vintage Seiko 6105 and 6309 cushion-cased dive watches, but it has a considerable following in the dive watch community, and is a favorite for customizing.  Numerous bands, dials, hands, and bezels are available so you can make your watch uniquely your own.  Also, you can wear this watch while you search for your vintage Seiko, if you're so inclined.  The only problems I found were that the lugs for the watch band showed visible tool marks, and the holes for the spring bars were a little crude, not the precisely drilled holes of my Tag-Heuer or vintage Seiko.<br />  On the plus side, while Seiko kinetic dive watches are not generally known for their accuracy, I must have gotten a good one.  My watch lost only 27 seconds over the first 10 days of use.  Having apparently settled in, it lost only an additional 6 seconds over the next 10 days.  While not quartz-level accuracy, this is outstanding for a mechanical watch and truly exceptional for a Seiko automatic dive watch.<br />  The metal Jubilee bracelet, while not great, is not as bad as many people seem to think.  The outer 2 and center links are solid metal, while the remaining 2 inner links and end pieces are formed sheet metal.  It's functional, very flexible, and comfortable.  If you feel like replacing it you can, but it's not an absolute necessity.<br />  My only real complaint is regarding the warranty.  If your order is fulfilled by Amazon, your watch will not be covered by the Seiko warranty because Amazon is not an authorized Seiko dealer.  Amazon will remove the warranty information, warranty registration card, list of authorized Seiko repair shops, and watch instructions from the watch box because, according to Amazon, they are \\"void.\\"  Why Amazon considers the Seiko instruction manual to be void because the Seiko warranty doesn't apply is not clear to me.  The generic instructions Amazon supplies with the watch are neither accurate nor complete.  However, the appropriate instruction manual may be downloaded from the Seiko website.<br />  Instead, Amazon offers its own 2-year limited warranty covering only the watch movement.  According to the express terms of the warranty, it does not cover problems with the bezel, crown, crystal, band, or case.  In other word, there are many, many things which could go wrong with your watch which would not be covered.  I'm not sure whether or not the dial and hands would be considered part of the watch movement, and therefore covered.  I haven't had any problems with my watch yet and haven't attempted to use the warranty.  It may turn out to be outstanding. However, my repeated attempts to register my watch online for the Amazon warranty were unsuccessful, and my e-mails to Amazon requesting assistance remain unanswered, so I'm not optimistic.rate nor complete.

1400064287|4|Well written and full of humor, this book was helpful and easy to read. The authors admit that their concepts are simple, but provide plenty of examples to demonstrate that even the most common sense ideas are easy to lose in the messiness of everyday life. I can't think of a single person who wouldn't benefit from these ideas, and highly recommend reading this book!
B000SEFNMS|5|I knew many people who had read this book and loved it so I knew I had wanted to read it for a long time. I finally went ahead and bought the kindle edition. I thought it was going to be Chris's actual journal. However, it is just some pieces of his journal and the author trying to piece together what happened by visiting places and people that Chris did. Yes, it's not a book that has a real story line and nothing ever really happens. You are told what the ending is right away in the beginning of the book. I think this is more of a book that makes you think. Chris had so many ideas about how to live and he was so determined. It makes you look at your own life and compare your own ideas against his.<br />For me, I loved it. I love books such as this that introduce a love for nature and simplicity. I could've done without Krakeur's personal experience, but I didn't hate it.<br />Overall, wonderful book with wonderful ideas.
B00GXKVZSW|4|Just started watching season 1, but seems pretty wonderful so far!  Definitely seems to follow more of a move plot than a normal TV series.  Loving it!!
B00JB3MVCW|1|sorry piece!
B0001Z53AQ|5|My Band is the album's Purple Pills?  Aside from the fact that they are the first singles off of Devil's Night and D-12 World, they have nothing in common...unless your are listening to them with Dalton Higgens.  Purple Pills is a tribute to drugs.  My Band is a satirical look at how the public views D-12.  Purple Pills has a bass heavy beat that is nothing like the beat for My Band.  So where does the connection lie?  As for Eminems beat making skills being called into question, I ask you this Dalton Higgens: Have you heard the song Runnin?  If Eminem decided to stop rapping, he could make a serious living making beats.  D-12 world is hot cd...no questions about it.  40 OZ makes the cd worth buying by itself.  If D-12 World is a side  project for Eminem, as Dalton Higgens claims, then why isn't Eminem on all of the songs?  Why are Dre, Kanye West, Red Spyda (Leave Dat Boy Alone - another classic), and Mr. Porter making beats on the cd?  Perhaps because D-12 World is a D-12 cd, not an Eminem mixtape.  It my opinion that D-12 world puts Devil's Night to shame.  It is not that Devil's Night was all that bad, it is that D-12 world is that good.  D-12 has clearly progressed on this album, as oppossed to regressed like Dalton Higgens reviews.
B00I2TV3NO|4|Really enjoyed the movie
B007VUA7VO|5|I have had no problems with the app. Appears to be accurate. It is somewhat useful, but I could live without it. It is just kind of fun to see the graphics.
1401300529|5|Excellent book on the background of the Korean War. How the USA were not prepared, insight in the personal, cultural and political relations between the main players. And the lessons (not) learned.  History does repeat.
B00IRISI42|5|action until  the very end..
B008RZF1UO|5|1 word: eargasm!!!! Love most of the song in this album (Angel of afterlife, Veritas, Torn, etc.)
B008NCSZQ8|5|Great movie!
B000EBD9TY|5|After seeing a performance of Tennessee Williams' gripping play \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" at a local event, I immediately bought the award-winning film. I was unsure how a brutally powerful story about the demise of one woman's reputation could be translated into a film, but I was not disappointed. This two-disc set restores some of the \\"objectionable content\\" that almost derailed the film's production, and the movie is as enjoyable and thrilling as the play itself, with the exception of an ending that was tweaked to appease 1950s sensibilities.<br /><br />The performances are simply stellar. Brando is both hilarious and frightening in his breakout role as Stanley Kowalski, and Vivien Leigh turns in a graceful and haunting performance as Blanche DuBois, the Southern belle whose attempts to right her world when she moves in with her sister Stella and sister's husband Stanley go hopelessly awry.<br /><br />Funny, heartbreaking and moving \\"Streetcar\\" is a classic.
B00A8ECU24|2|This is your standard time sink kind of game.  It's fun enough up until you hit the point where there is literally no progression unless you play everyday for months to get enough gems to buy ponies, or you shell out money.
B00G4A6VZS|3|I ordered this, played it at first, but don't really play it anymore. It's okay though.
B00NY5586O|5|I have enjoyed all of Noodlecake's games, and this is no exception. The concept is simple, but it gets very challenging the longer you play. If anyone out there is familiar with a game called 5 Star Free Lines (older pc game), there is a similarity. Herr, you create shapes by joining bliss together to match one of the three shapes above the playing field. If you don't join two blocks together, more blocks assist (much like in 5 Start Free Lines, if you didn't match 5 colors, moor orbs appeared).<br /><br />There are also power ups to help you, but you do have to earn them. Bottom line, if you enjoy a puzzle game that truly makes you think, then get this game! So happy this was the FAOTD!
B00GX598FO|3|I really enjoyed the first version of Reds better than the second. I think the characters were better defined in the first version and I felt that was more enjoyable. Not a bad movie, I just spoiled...
B00F35BV64|4|Excellent sci-fi!!  Must watch!
B00785P2QC|5|This is a really cool building game for cities. It's not just like the original Virtual City*,<br />It's like a free play. And lots of goals to complete. I recommend to the ones that are looking forward<br />to a free play app city game that's FREE. Yes... It's free. I hope you enjoy this game!
B00004I9VE|5|If you are put off by the current actions of Michael Jackson, find comfort that he wasn't always such a screwup. This album, which is arguably his best, is really good! It has great songs like \\"Billie Jean\\" \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat it.\\" Full of danceable beats and tender love songs, it is really some of the finest music of the 80's!
B00867GHS8|5|Mainly I am using the Blu-ray 3D at my home and the regular DVD in my car. Both my daughter are loving to watch this move at least once a week. The quality is good and worth to buy. I didn't use the other disks yet. I'll try some time later.
B0097EWK3A|5|I finished the game in a few days. I can't wait to play the second game. I looked at a preview of it. A giant raven, totally cool. But I only saw the first part of it. To bad it costs $15. If only I had a merical.<br />..
B000EULJLU|5|10,000 Days is brooding yet melodic, familiar yet distinctive: another step in the evolution of Tool's sound. One cannot casually listen to this album and expect to be rewarded: one must surrender oneself to it. 10,000 Days has the ability to leave you cold and unsettled, with sounds ranging from hard-hitting (\\"The Pot\\") to other-worldly (\\"Intension\\"), to extremely personal and profoundly poignant--the two-part masterpiece--\\"Wings for Marie (Pt 1)\\"/\\"10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)\\"; Tool's ability to surprise you is as evident as ever, and 10,000 Days is arguably their most adventurous and unpredicatable album to date.
B001EN71DQ|4|I'm not going to review the films, that's been done to death.  You either like them or you don't.  If you don't like them, don't buy them.  I'm just talking here about the DVDs themselves.  Watching them on an upscaling DVD player on a 32 inch 720p TV, the picture quality is good, but not excellent. I noticed a few scenes where there appeared to be slight ghost images, especially when characters are against a white or light colored background. But overall its not a distraction.  The overall contrast and color levels are very good and the sound is great also.  This is a quality product at a good price.
B0006399FS|4|After what seemed like an endless wait for a new U2 album, it is finally here, and while it could have been better, it certainly could have been much worse. After the first listen through, my reaction was \\"where are the rock-n-roll songs?\\" I was under the impression that this was going to be U2 going back to their roots, a more upbeat rock-n-roll sound to the album. Sure \\"Vertigo\\" has a great beat, but if you are expecting the album to be like that single, you are in for a shock. Instead we get a more mellow sound, as if this is a transitional album. After listening to it more, I have found that I am enjoying it much more than their last album (however, \\"Walk On\\" is one superb song). While this album doesn't come close to \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"Joshua Tree\\", it is well worth the price, and over time will probably grow on us all.  <br />  Looking forward to the tour early next year, just hope we don't have to wait another five years for another offering by one of the greatest bands in the world. :-)
B0058FW1X6|5|Love it!
B0081SRJSY|2|This app fails install on my TF701.  Plays okay, a little buggy, on my phone, but even on Xperia Z3 it is small.
B00J2VSS0C|3|I enjoy this game. The timer makes for a more entertaining experience. Even though the scenes are repeated over and over, the are still tricky. The biggest drawback for me was not being able to access information related to the game.  This games is in depth with many aspects. I would enjoy it a lot more if I knew what the meaning was behind collections, amulets, and completing levels just to name a few.  I have the other two games in this series and the stamps and black cats are not quite as hard to find. In this game you need both to stay in play unless you want to buy the and I don't get that serious about ANY game. This review was written in order to earn five stamps to continue playing. Also you have to have energy but you can't buy that that I know of.
B00APUYWYA|5|AWESOME!!!
B00004Z459|5|Linkin Park, most definately put together a classic on this project.  The lyrical aspect is excellent, and the musical aspect is far from disapointing as well.  The two bonus tracks are very well done, I have no idea why they didn't put them on the american version because they were just that dang good. I'd highly recomend it
B0034G4OYA|5|This is a hillarious movie.  I really enjoy watching it.  My daughter of 3 also loves it.  The humor is great, and anything that gets a 30 yr old and a 3 yr old laughing is good humor in my book.
B00BAXFECK|4|Seems brilliant, but takes too long to move the story along.
B00005QG9J|5|This disc is one killer piece of plastic and foil.  It just rocks so nice.  It's got some action pact tracks, but also a few mellow chillout songs.  That's the only word you can use for the quiet songs, \\"Chillout.\\"  I had some friends over and it was like 2 a.m. and we just listened to this and it was...great.  And with Aqueous Transition at the end there, it nearly knocked me out with its super soporific qualities. (for those not in my english class, soporific means puts you to sleep).  <br />This album is very uplifting, no depressing, soulless garbage that most bands are shoving down the throats of the unwashed masses ....  <br />Oh, yeah,...Get it. right now.
B007SGLZP8|4|John Grisham cannot tell a bad story, so even if this one is light it is a good read. Good for quick vacation reads.
B00FB13Y74|5|This game reminds me of real racing except it's easier to control. it's fun to race with pigs and the angry birds.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Ms. Gabaldon has once again made it so my husband didn't get fed, my housework didn't get done and my eyes hurt from reading.  Thank you for a great series!
B00006RJHG|5|Black Christmas is the essential must-have for horror movie fans. I didn't realize that this film basically started the whole genre, pre-dating much of the well-known horror &quot;There's a killer on the loose&quot; classics. This movie will get under your skin, primarily due to all those psychotic phone calls. After having watched it, I can easily say that no other film of this type has left such a creepy impression on me. I wouldn't watch this film at night before going to bed, nightmares would be a given. <BR>Mind you, if you need blood and guts a'plenty, slashin' to and fro, then this movie may not be the one for you. Still, the insane, madman psycho in this will make you want to sleep with the lights on for a few weeks and double lock your doors. The film moves along well, with not a high count of murders occurring that frequently either. But those crazy phone calls just keep on coming. All the more to set you on your very last nerve. You'll be very surprised by the ending, it left me with  just one question - what ever happened to Claude the cat??<BR>   The picture and sound quality is excellent on this DVD version and comes with a special features section. However, the documentary with two stars from the film gets a little too silly if you ask me. Also included is commentary from director Bob Clark and actor John Saxon, but it is pretty much a rehash of what's already been spoken of in the documentary.  <BR>This version is a bit pricey, so if you don't want to shell out the extra money, then buy the 25th Anniversary DVD - Black Christmas will not disappoint.
B006IGZWB2|4|Great movie, very well done and had some really funny parts that made me laugh like crazy. Definitely worth the watch!
B004J4WKUQ|4|This book was a great read. The 80's trivia aside is was a good fast paced tale of the little guy against the big bad corporate monster.
B000003TAW|5|I have had this album for a long while now, and it is the best album that I HAVE EVER HEARD. It is completely perfect in every way. Whenever I put it in I make every one in the room shut up and chill out. I can't explain the sentimental attachment I have to this recording. It is my soundtrack to the summers of my life, which I think about alot. This album makes me feel really glad that i spend the \\"best years of my life\\" with this band.<BR> Well, on to the track listing. \\"my name is jonas\\" is a great starter track and is one of my favorites off the album. It's just awesome. \\"no one else\\"is a really good song about him being a jealous boyfriend. I can relate. It's another one of my favorites. \\"the world has turned and left me here\\" is my favorite song of all time. It's beautiful. Period. \\"buddy holly\\" is a great song to get you pumped and feeling good. \\"undone\\" is a good, long song about a decaying relationship. really great. \\"surf wax america\\" is a really good, fast paced song about everyone doing the same things all the time. So instead of taking the car to work, he's taking his surfboard. \\"say it ain't so\\" is another good standout. it expresses bottled up emotions and feelings and how they are released with drinking. \\"in the garage\\" is a really good song about being a loner, and finding comfort being alone when you make music and being a rock star in your own little world with an imaginary audience and expressing yourself through it. \\"holiday\\" is a really, really great song about a relationship with two many outside people butting their noses in, and wanting to get away from it all. \\"only in dreams\\" is one of my favorites. It is a beautiful song about a girl, with really great lyrics. It has a great build up as well.<BR> If you dont have this album, then you're a fool. So buy it now!! It will change you forever.
B00JCW0BCY|4|This is a good book to wake us up from our sleep,our deep dream in this solid yet dreamlike world. Our time in this world is finite and temporary and short,like a summer lighting,as the buddist sutra says, yet we think we have all the time in the world,until that Unwelcome Visitor come. How to best use of our countdown time? Think about it now,please.
B00EJU8ZIG|5|At first, I thought the songs were weird and I was bummed because I was super excited to get the cd after listening to &#34;Royals&#34;. After listening to the cd on repeat for about a week I began knowing the words to the songs and being able to sing along. After I became familiar with the songs, I fell in love with it! Definitely a good one :)
B005XQLBU4|5|Sweet game!! I've had so much fun playing it and itll keep you occupied for hours! I love this game!
B00CO8TA4I|5|Great CPU!!! This thing is lightning fast and the integrated graphics look great. I bough this for a machine that just browses the web and sends emails. It may be a little bit of overkill, but it will last a good long time, I'd think. Intel is leaps and bounds ahead of AMD with its technology. AMD processors  may be cheaper, but Intel is so much more worth the investment.
0618871713|5|Great read!  This is awesome and shipped right on time.
B00003CXBK|5|Great shipping and the movie is great .
B003274QH6|5|I've heard a lot about this series and the first season definitely lived up to all the hype. I'm looking forward to the rest
B009CPJHY4|5|A truly enjoyable movie!The story plus the cast of characters is memorable. So glad I finally watched this. and Amazon makes it so easy!
B001AQMBKA|5|I'm a die-hard LOST fan. I just couldn't believe how good the video quality of this blu-ray is. I had the feeling, in many scenes, that LOST was a 3D feature. Absolutely recommended and two important notices: although the blu ray box and amazon claim that this product is Region A locked, it can also be played, without any problem, in region B blu ray players and is dubbed in castilian spanish. The same can be said about Seasons One and Five. However europpean customers should know that Seasons Three and Four will not run on their blu ray players. A must buy absolutely recommended.
B001MSMULG|3|Started well. Gained momentum. Then, a common disintegration of plot and characters just when they were nearing the apex. Unfortunate.
B006OCM0G0|5|This is a cool game to play!!!!
6305428042|5|Excellent.  The kids loved it!!
B00W6XM002|3|It's OK.... I'm not over the top on this one..It does let you out of a chock hold very easily.....some change/improvement suggeted by developer
B00GU9CAV2|4|I liked the movie ,The dog getting killed really irritated me! I think the guy who killed the dog should have sufered more.
B00C2IJJDM|5|I chose this rate because is a wonderfull edition of this wonderfull movie , and have portuguese subtitles. Recomend this product
B000065V3H|5|I love this movie no matter what anyone says.  This movie unlike many other teen flicks of that time actually had a moral to it.  Don't change yourself just to become popular.  The movie was both entertaining and delightful.  Seth green was in it and he was so young! My favorite singer also choreagraphed in this movie Paula Abdul.  I liked the Ronald Miller part because I just graduated from high school and I know how it feels to be left out.  this is a good movie with a good moral to it.  My suggestion is to see the movie once and then decide if you like it or not like it.
B00687Q0VC|5|great acting, great history
B00CSR2J9I|4|fun and the kids really enjoy it, Now that they have learned to not be so heavy on the gas.
1577314808|2|The book came very damaged, the corner of the book was flipped back and the pages were black.  I emailed the bookstore that sent it and they are sending me another copy.  I wanted to give this to a friend and there was no way I was giving it to he.  But I got a response from the seller and I am happy about that.
1451649940|5|I've been waiting for their story for-ev-er.  And it was worth the wait.  Theirs is an epic love story.  They became friends as children, then enemies with Thronos chasing her for revenge.  Now they fall in love as adults.  They both have a lot to forgive.  The first 2/3 of the book is action packed.  Lanthe and Thronos have escaped from the Order's Prison Island and are literally in hell.  My favorite part of the book was the last third where Lanthe softens toward Thronos and it's really sweet.  The path to true love has obstacles for these two.  And it doesn't help that everybody is against them being together.  But of course they get their HEA :)  Lots of characters from previous books are mentioned including Bettina and Trehan from Shadow's Claim, Sabine and Rydstrom from Kiss of a Demon King and Holly and Cadeon, and their twinkies, from Dark Desires After Dark. And I forgot to mention Nix!  How could I forget her.  Love her.  I absolutely love Kresley Cole's alpha heroes and Thronos is an alpha in love.  Made me start an Immortals After Dark binge read.
B0097PW7H8|5|Straight up great. Use it daily. Easier than most out there. A couple of tweaks and your running. It won't over detail you!
B001KVZ6FW|4|we have watched this with the grandkids when we saw it at the theaters. Now that we own it we can watch it when we wish.
B008LV8TSU|5|Sophie Hatter,mThe Elder Sister of three ,is cursed by an evil witch and begins an adventure of magical proportions in order to break the spell. Along the way she meets A talking Fire Demon named Calcifur, A young wizard's apprentice, a very old witch, a castle that is always moving, and the Mysterious Wizard  Howl himself, a man who is said to devour the hearts of young women.<br /><br />An amazing story from the first page to the ending. This is nothing like Miyazaki's movie. This is the original and will put you under its spell.  After you finish it you will want to Reread almost instantly. I recommend it for everyone.
030758836X|4|That is the best way to describe this novel. As I began reading the book I thought I was so clever, as I would pick up on things in the text, and had the whole story figured out. I was completely and utterly wrong. This book has twist, after twist, after twist. The plot of the book was frustrating and annoying when it didn't go the way I imagined or wanted, but in the best way possible. The characters and unforeseen events kept me turning the pages, unable to put the book down. This beautifully crafted book leaves you unable to even trust the narrators, Nick and Amy, the whole way through. If you want a novel that makes you think and question and leaves you astonished with the most unpredictable ending, Gone Girl is for you.
B000ESSTL0|3|Great album, fantastic music and very much their Pet Sounds.  I loved it when I was a senior in High School and love it today.  I was really looking forward to this one a lot becuase DM was made for surround sound.  And it delivers on most, less on others, but, some stuff is missing from the songs that are on the original release.  I know most say to buy the overseas SACD version, I got the US one.  Over all, it is what it is and still play it.  Added to the collection of SACD/DVD Audio, what the hell for the price.  If you are a die hard fan, get the SACD version.
B00005UW9T|5|I don't care how unaccurate this film is. I just care that it is a great movie to watch. I love the characters, the animation is spectacular, and the songs are unforgettable! I always believed in the stories of Anastasia, but I was sad when I learned the truth about her and her family. If this movie was real, it would really convince me that Anastasia would be a true princess.  <br /> <br />The story begins in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1916, as a ball is being held in honor of the 300th anniversary of the ruling of the czars of Russia. One of the guests is the Dowager Emperess Marie (Angela Lansbury, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Murder, She Wrote, Beauty and the Beast), who loves her youngest granddaughter, Anastasia (Kirsten Dunst, Jumanji, Mona Lisa Smile, Spiderman). The emperess is leaving for Paris, which makes Anastasia sad. So, the emperess gives her granddaughter a music box to remember her by, as well as a necklace that reads \\"Together in Paris\\". The party is interuppted when Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd, Angels in the Outfield, Taxi; sung by Jim Cummings, the voice of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger), an evil holy man, sends a curse upon the Romanov family that they will die within the night. After the party, the revolution begins, and the Romanovs are trying to escape. Anastasia forgets her music box and runs off to her room, with her grandmother running close behind her. Suddenly, the protesters burst into the castle! A small servant boy helps the princess and the grandmother into a special door hidden in the wall so that they could escape. Rasputin meets the two on the ice, where he is sure that Anastasia could not escape. But then, the ice breaks, and Rasputin drowns to his death. By the time Anastasia and Marie get to the train station, the train is already leaving! Marie gets on, but Anastasia is running as fast as she can so she could get on, too. Marie grabs onto her granddaughter's hand, but it slips from her grasp, and Anastasia falls. Since then, Mariehas been searching for granddaughter, but all she finds are frauds. Can she ever see her granddaughter again? <br /> <br />10 years have passed since the revolution, and a rumor has been started that Anastasia is alive, and the Dowager Empress Marie is offering 10 million rubles to anyone who can bring Anastasia to her. Two men, Dmitri (John Cusack, Must Love Dogs, America's Sweethearts) and Vladmir (Kelsey Grammar, Frasier, Cheers) are willing to take that chance, but only for the money since they are con men, or those who use fake people to pretend they are a real person. Meanwhile, at an orphanage, an 18 year old girl named Anya (Meg Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail) is sent off to go get a job at the fish factory. She has no memory of her past, except a necklace that reads \\"Together in Paris\\". She can't shake off the feeling that she may be someone special. Anya doesn't know what to do. Then, a little encouragement from a stray dog leads her to St. Petersburg, where she decides to get a ticket to go to Paris. But she has no exit visa, which she can't get a ticket. So then, she goes off to the old palace to seek out a man named Dmitri. While exploring the palace, she imagines herself at a ball, dancing in the arms of those who love her, feeling safe and warm. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Dmitri and Vladmir appears. As Anya tries to run away, but is stopped by Dmitri, who looks at her while standing at the painting of the Russian family. She looks a lot like Anastasia. Anya tells her story to the two men, who want to help her get to Paris, but the third ticket is reserved for Anastasia. Then, they try to convince her that she could be the princess. Anya catches on, and agrees to go with them. But, unknowingly, a bat named Bartok (Hank Azaria, The Simpsons, Bartok the Magnificent) watches from above, and realizes that Anastasia is alive. The reliquary, which belonged to Rasputin, plunges down to the underworld, taking Bartok with it. When he tells Rasputinthat Anastasia is alive, he is enraged and vows to kill the remaining member of the Romanov family. Will Rasputin get his revenge? Is Anya really Anastasia? And what will Dmitri and Vladmir do if they get the rubles? <br /> <br />This movie is fantastic. I loved every minute of it, except the part where Anastasia learns that Dmitri is a con man. The songs are simply lovely. I love Aaliyah's version of \\"Journey to the Past\\". She did a great job. I'm sorry to see her go unexpectedly. I also liked \\"At the Beginning\\" by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis. And a big shout-out to the composers. They rock!  <br /> <br />It doesn't matter if this movie is historically correct or not. It matters that you learn a big lesson from it. A couple, actually. The main lesson is follow your heart. It will guide you to your true heart's desires. Buy Anastasia today! The special features of this DVD are good, too. It's a real journey to the past!
B00MASEK74|5|Love Dr Who we are a Dr Who Family!
B007M45PMU|5|Trying to compare with a contemporary is difficult. Maybe Head and the Heart is a close comparison but with the lyrics of Mumford & Son/A Fine Frenzy. They have a definite folk/bluegrass sound without being overly twangy. I really like \\"Submarines\\", \\"Stubborn Love\\", \\"Ho Hey\\", and \\"Morning Song\\". They sound genuine...their sound seems like it wasn't overly tampered with in-studio. Overall, a great summer album.
B004BSIJ9Q|5|I honestly thought Mr. West would not be able to top 808's and Heartbreaks because it was so out the box. I have to say he's paving a road for future artists to put out creative material without fear. Also his G.O.O.D Friday's series helped in keeping interest in this album. I love when artists allow listeners to preview tracks before they finalize them. Although I wish more songs from the G.O.O.D Friday's would have made the cut for this album I am in no way dissappointed. My favorites would have to be \\"All of the Lights\\" and \\"Blame Game\\". Also \\"Blame Game\\" has a hilarious skit towards the end of the track. I'm glad to see Mr. West didn't let all the hate he was getting stop him from creating art. They say you can only go as high as you fall and with this album I think Kanye just shot up past the Sun. If your a Kanye West fan you'll like this album.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Great writing. Once I got to an end of a chapter, it was hard to put down! It's a great suspenseful book that will keep you saying &#34;just one more page!&#34; I really appreciate the authors writing style.
B000CNDIZE|3|she is really a great singer, but the album lacked direction. I wasn't sure what she was trying to convey.
B0030IIYYS|5|Toy Story 2 builds magnificently on the originaly Toy Story movie.  Woody is accidentally sold in a yard sale to end up with a collector who wants to ship him and new characters, a complete set, to a museum in Japan.  Worried about not being loved forever by Andy, Woody sees an opportunity to always be admired.  His friends come to the rescue and a tough choice is made.  This is a rare sequel where it's better than the first.  Godfather has nothing on this well-written gem.
B007THA4FI|1|I tried over a period of several weeks to read the book.  It did not grab my interest in the least.  Many characters and after reading 20 percent of the book, I still could not figure out the main character.  None of the characters were likable.  I returned it for a refund.
030758836X|4|I was definitely into this book, its worth reading.  I was really dissapointed with the ending, it could have been so much better.
0345806786|5|always wanted to read the book
B0063IH60K|5|Just what you want in a solitaire app. I have no complaints and I have played it many times. Thanks so much!
B005HSL626|5|this is the best game ever don't listen to what peeps say only da ones dat say its fun bye!

B000WS4PCO|5|What can I say, it's U2's best CD
B00005JOQS|3|Let me start out by say this;  <br />If Warners' was going to do another Superman movie. They <br />should've made a fresh start of it. <br /> Watching this movie was like visting a loved one's grave at <br />mid-winter. and seeing shadows flitter in and out of your vision <br />range. <br /> There was just to many references to the first movie. From the <br />opening theme, to Marlon Brando's post mortum apperance, and once again we have Lex Luthor's ridiculus obssesion with land! <br /> It was funny and clever the first time,(as portrayed by Gene Hackman). But this time with Lex (Spacey)being played as a nasty, sadistic, and bitter creep. It was just un-appealing. <br /> The scenes between Lois and Superman(Clark Kent). Were more of <br />a study in marriage consuling than just a strained reunion. <br />But a real failure in the movie is what the writers didn't do  with the introduction of Lois Lane's son Jason.  <br /> So much could've been done with this aspect of the story. <br />Instead of him being played as a frail asmatic dull child. He could have been played as a normal active five year old. (Supernormal if you get my drift!) <br /> Also, the part of Randy White, Perry White's nephew could have been eliminated altogether. He adds nothing to the story at all.   <br /> To sum it up Superman Returns, while not being a total flop <br />isn't a complete winner either. <br /> <br />
B0064MPXFA|5|The characters are well developed throught the season!
B00D3ITOHG|5|I've tried several over the ear head phones and could never find any I could wear for any length of time.  Until now.  These are comfortable and not to tight.  They are easily adjustable.  I like the fact you can switch sides with the cord.  Like most they can get your ears hot after a while, but that goes with this style.  Overall,  these are just great head phones.
B00079FUI6|5|I had a blast lounging around the house in my PJ's watching this DVD series. I had missed a lot of episodes and this filled in the gaps. The show is hilarious, witty, intense and dramatic all at the same time! <br /> <br />The commentaries by Marc Cherry are excellent as are the other bonus features. Watching the DVD set gave me a new appreciation for the quality of the show's writing. Plus it's just plain fun because once one episode ends you can just pop in another! <br /> <br />This is a great investment even if you want to watch the DVD's once and then resell them.
B00005AG7K|5|Beatles fan from way back. Seen all the Beatle movies except this one until I purchased it. It was a little shorter than expected, but I enjoyed it very much. Really takes me back. Thanks for asking me.
B00AKKGX4W|4|I rarely re-read a book but I'm so glad I did. It has a story that really touches the heart, characters that charm, and emotions that are easy to relate to. The way the love scenes were approached was refreshing and real.
B00687Q0VC|5|Great!
B0001HAHXW|4|To the &quot;fan&quot; from Australia who trashed this effort: your opinion is your own and thus valid on that level.  But, at least get Eric's nickname correct- its &quot;Slowhand&quot;, not &quot;Slowtrain&quot;.  Now then, clearly this is not the same incendiary guitar work evidenced on &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; or &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Cream was a brilliant disaster, perpetrated by three disparate musical geniuses who were often as not completely miserable on stage.  The Clapton that survived that debacle as well the the drug and alcohol fueled &quot;Layla&quot; has his place securely cemented in the annals of Western music.  This new disc is a carefully considered , reverential tribute to one of Clapton's great, if not most important personal influences.  Is it the best thing he has ever recorded?  Clearly not, but it is an essential addition to his musical lexicon.  Take it or leave it.
B007HACDLK|5|Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series continues with current event like matters. You have to read each page deliberately so the  book doesn't end too soon. The one criticism: Mr. Flynn isn't sufficiently prolific.  Read and enjoy the  continuing adventures of Mitch Rapp and his world : the CIA and protecting US interests.
B002PZ8YCO|5|Excellent story and acting by Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor. It was an accurate portrayal of life in England in the early 20th century. Baatrice's water-colors were beautiful.
B00DMCV7K0|5|I learned a lot about the relationships between slaves and their owners, as well as about slavery in general from reading this book.  The characters have stuck with me and I found myself thinking about them long after finishing the book. Spend time reading the notes by the author at the end. The basic premise of the story is rooted in actual history. It is my favorite of Sue Monk Kidd, and a must read!
B00ATDOVNK|4|Fun adventure but it has a thin story line. I wish the plots and characters were more well developed. But still fun and engaging.
B00DL48CN4|5|While this focuses on one, barely known, chapter of world war two—it completely portrays how dedication to an ideal leads to comradeship. No one in this movie is a super soldier, it is very realistic in that sense. But the willingness to risk everything for a mission and for each other is the essence of brotherhood of arms.
0345535529|2|Great story, but the print is far too small. It should be offered in larger print. Could not continue to read after first chapter.
B00P7PBD2C|4|Very good. Clever plot with interesting surprises. Beautiful to see. We decided to give a copy to our grandchildren. They range from 3-10 in age. While there is some potentially scary parts, we think they will be able to handle it. And, there is enough positive moral messaging to offset any negative images.
B00425S1H8|5|I at first purchased a cheaper similar item from Amazon and it did not work at all. This one works perfectly; I use it almost every day and am very happy with the purchase. Unlike the other unit, the electronics and driver are made by the same company, and thus everything works.
B003YFIUW8|4|This book describes such horrors that I moved beyond the point of, \\"I'm glad this has never happened to me,\\" to, \\"At least her rapist isn't her relative.\\" I would probably never have read this book of my own volition but I read it for my book club. That being said, I read it very quickly and it's easy to see Donoghue is extremely talented. The perspective of the young child is engrossing and believable. I was so disgusted and disturbed by the room that after I felt I knew what was going to happen for the duration of their time in the room I skipped forward like 20 pages until their escape was finally executed.<br /><br />The most interesting part was the perspective of the boy. I felt like everyone else's reactions and emotions were predictable but the child was surprising and touching. His incomprehension of various things such as the reality of the outside world, and then his later desire to return to the room after their escape, were feelings that Donoghue described skillfully, compassionately, and insightfully.<br /><br />My book club revealed to me that this book was based on a true story that is infinitely more horrible than what is described in this book. I don't know how that affects my feelings about this book. I don't know how I feel about having read this book or about finding out about its basis. I do know that I googled implanting a transmitter under my skin so that this event never happens to me. I think I feel lucky that I've never been kidnapped but also scared that I may one day be kidnapped, so it balances out to just confusion.<br /><br />As a work of literature, I'd probably recommend this book because it's unusual and well done. I don't know if I'd recommend it as a feel-good book, although maybe some people find it uplifting and it does carry with it an ultimate message of hope, love, and healing. I think it depends on your ability to not be as freaked out as I was by the events described.
B0062P332Y|5|Great action movie with some really good actors.
B00K2CHX9C|5|Okay, I like sci fi. This was very good and very different. Yeah, there was some Ground Hog day going on but the action and actors changed the whole impact. The story was good and the action intense. Tom Cruise was good as a fish out of water in the war but I thought Emily Blunt was superb. She was very different in this film from most other things of hers I've seen and I enjoyed their interaction. Can't give the ending away. But see for yourself. I wish I would have gotten the blu-ray though.
B006LSZECO|4|Slow at first, but if you stick with it and get the style of the author's writing - it has lots of surprises and twists.  I had to see how it would end.
B004XWLN20|4|We never watched this when the series was still going but after watching a few episodes here and there on TNT I decided to buy the entire series. I did a lot of shopping around before I found this set and the price for the complete series with all of the extra content and extra memorabilia was a fantastic deal.<br /><br />The series itself is well done and although it does not stick to the traditional Superman storyline it is very well done. My only complaint throughout the entire series is Clark's unreasonable obsession with Lana Lang. By season 3 I was almost to a hate level of Lana Lang and could not stand the way Clark was so willing to destroy heaven and earth for this girl. Lex Luthor and his father are brilliant in this story line. While undoubtedly the villians of the story you really grow to care about their characters and lives right along with everyone else. I loved where the story started going in the last couple of seasons and really felt disappointed that they ended the series when they were finally starting to get into the meat of Superman/Clark's story. Although this series was meant to be about Clark Kent growing up to be the Superman we all know and love, it had a lot of potential to continue on for a long time.<br /><br />I know there have been complaints about the way the discs are packaged in this set. The packaging is a little tight slipping the discs in and out of the sleeves to start with but after I discovered the method to their madness of getting them out it was no big deal. I love how it is done in a book style. The only petty little complaint I have is that it does not fit on my traditional DVD shelves like all of the other collections I have currently. Which really is no big deal.<br /><br />The condition of the discs were perfect and all discs played well. There was only one episode on season 3 disc 3 that hung up but we were able to push through it without missing more than a few seconds of content. That is the only reason I am givingthis a 4 star instead of a 5 star review.<br /><br />I have recommended this set to several friends and family already and more than likely will continue to as long as it is offered on Amazon for this superb price.
B00FATEJYE|4|This game is cool but it's laggy other than that I really like this game I would suggest getting this game if you have a lot of memory
B00DR0PDNE|5|This makes looking at any program enjoyable on a larger screen. works like it says can take from one tv to another
B001BC5HXG|5|A great read. Wish I had discovered Steinbeck years ago.
B009RWRIKM|5|Dance is notoriously difficult to film well and Wim Wenders has done an absolutely masterful job in both the dance sections and the talking sections.  The film is heartfelt, moving, thrilling and brings to life a great master of dance.
B00DURGZHW|4|Son and I enjoyed this story!  Surprised I had not heard about this film prior to seeing it on Amazon.
B007JM4CWY|5|I really like this game good thinking one just have trouble with the harder puzzles because the boxes are so small
B004FRX0MY|4|My four star rating is because it was easy to understand and get my music downloads also sounds good.The price is reasonable.
B00028HBKM|5|Great movie!
B005NJ2K6U|5|Love love love!  :)
B00STX2UB2|4|Very good show, seems to be pretty close historically from what I know.
B004SBS8LA|3|15 minute download and counting - you would think Amazon would have scaled out their systems to handle the day one traffic.  Hope they get their infrastructure up to speed soon.
B009BJATYS|5|It was such a fun series to watch.  Well acted & many twists & turns in the plot & interesting characters.
B002WJI66C|5|A little on the pricey side for a stuffed toy, but of course I'm sure that's due to the character name & likeness. My kids love Mario! And any & all things Mario related. I guess it's a good thing to spend time off the game systems and actually playing with something like this, to go on adventures of their own, recreate their favorite game scenes, etc. They play with this series of plush toys (they have many of them) for hours on end. Very good construction. One of them finally developed a small tear (after a year+ of rough use) but my wife was able to sew it back up good as new. Buy with confidence!
B007PBKG5G|5|Love love love this album! I bought it at first as a CD from Starbucks and then proceeded to play it nonstop whenever I was in the car. I lost the CD and happily paid for it again as an MP3. Sooooooo good!
B003XF1XOQ|5|It was a great ending to the Triligy of the Hunger Games, of the many books I've read I always see the strength of women, Mockingjay and the 2 books before was a good example of the strength of a woman, how the rich live off the poor and how nobdy cares when your poor.
B00DR0PDNE|1|First things first.  I love the idea of the chromecast.  However, there is one very HUGE drawback to it.  It does not actually stream content from your phone.  All your phone really is, is a remote control for it.  To do anything with it, you have to have a WIFI internet source (which CANNOT be your phone).  All the ads and literature imply that you are playing stuff from your phone.  Then you read the description of the package very closely and decipher the cleverly word description and find out that your phone merely controls it (i.e. your phone is an overpriced remote control for it).  Now if you have a good, high speed, unlimited data, wifi internet access, then these facts will not really matter to you.  This thing will work just fine for you then.  However, for much of Rural America, this is simply not an option.  Our phones out here ARE our internet access.  My phone has a good 4G connection and has an unlimited data plan, but without another good internet source, this device is rendered useless. You can't even stream videos and pictures that I have taken on your phone through it.
B00006FXB6|5|It's certaintly looking that way. In short this album kicks ..., there's just no other way to put. The vocals are awesome and it seems like the guys have gotten to be better musicians since Rated R (especialy Nick). There is alot of diversity on this album, but they rarely step outside of rock, there is punk (Six Shooter) metal (Millionaire, Song for the Deaf) Doorsesque rock (God is in the Radio) stoner rock (The Sky is Falling) and even folk (Mosquito Song). All of the songs are memorable and get caught in your head very easily. They recall band like Sabbath and the Stooges, but were a lesser band would just copy the formula (The Hives anyone?) QOTSA give it a breath of fresh air. Take a bow QOTSA you earned it.
B0001XAOLQ|5|This is an excellent movie and we very much like to watch it. We like the German version and would recommend it!
B00IFMHZ58|1|Horrible...That's the only way to rate this movie.  Poor story line, lousy plot.
0875845851|5|My name is Tiffany Stinson and I am a graduate student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  I am a client in the Information Engineering and Management program.  One of my main focuses this semester is Disruptive Innovation and the effects it has in my industry and my career.  I was referred by a co-worker about this particular book.  What caught my attention is that the book was published sixteen years ago during a time where technology was heavily on the rise, but not anywhere near as developed as it is today.  It's almost as if the author predicted what would happen to businesses if technology continued to rise.  This lets readers know that technology can and will play a huge part in the future success of businesses.  Reading this book also encourages companies constantly stay current on all the newest and latest technologies that will soon take over all businesses and their processes.  Most importantly, this book gives readers an insight of how technology can completely drive out even the biggest most successful companies.<br />What I found most frightening is that companies that are extremely successful, attentive to their customers' needs, aware of their competitors, and invest in the newest technologies can still easily fail due to disruptive innovations in the industry.  Companies that face this issue can potentially lose lots of money.  The book gives tons of examples of how disruptive innovations are harmful to companies because they are often easier to use and cheaper.<br /><br />One main point of interest to me is that the author explains how large - successful companies are unable to compete with small startup companies.  He explains that new startups develop a detailed analysis before entering the market and try to find better, more sustainable ways to do the same exact job or produce the same product.  This is one of many main reasons why large companies are failing.  Large companies are becoming complacent and over confident with their success.  Their complacency is causing them to overlook their competitors and new entrants.<br /><br />This book is VERY well written and gives lots of examples of the author's findings.  It is very informative.  Reading this book has helped me to be more aware of my industry and its changes.  It has given me a broad understanding of disruptive innovation and things to be mindful of.  Most importantly, this book has opened my eyes to the seriousness and effects of disruptive innovations. When disruptive innovations affect companies, it immediately begins to effect employees.  I highly recommend this book to working professionals in any technical field, and also executives of companies.  This book has certainly been helpful to be in my current academic coursework.
B000E1ZBGS|4|The Bottom Line:    Though some of the casting choices seem a bit suspect (Jena Malone is annoying as usual and Donald Sutherland is manifestly American), this is a fine adaptation of the Austen classic and a fine film.
B00AE2IJIE|4|Good children's plot, although I bet it's a bit scarey for many younger kids.  But still cute any funny for all ages. Great animation. I would watch it again.
B000000HTL|5|This offering takes us to some different realms,I feel that the album has an&quot;escape&quot; feel to it.For people who don't know this band,I would suggest a tongue in cheek approach go and buy the first album &quot;The  aerosol grey machine&quot; it is an import but it is defenetly worth the  money! It is availiable in this store you just have to click on &quot;all  albums by Van Der Graaf Generator&quot;.If not,buy &quot;The least we can  do is wave to each other&quot;.Now back to &quot;H to HE&quot;,it has guest  player Robert Fripp,that brilliant guitarist from King Crimson appears on  &quot;The Emperor&quot;.Aside from that,the band lays down more and more  spacyness and they explore more levels of relatively the same  theme,&quot;what will later be known to me as the VDGG experience&quot;.It  is a positive and non deceiving growth from the preceding,It will  ultimately prepare us for what's to come our way!
B002SJ8FH6|4|A hilarious play based on the movie --- rather than the novel on which the movie itself was based --- is currently making the rounds. In the past year, I've seen it at 2 universities and one community theatre. The play tracks the movie almost scene by scene, though the movie itself is more serious in tone. Audio quality is the problem with the movie in downloaded, VHS, and DVD formats, though it's not as bad as some of the other Hitchcock movies from the 1930s. It's a shame that such a masterpiece has begun to slip away from us.
B00AMBM9MO|4|I enjoyed the movie. I found it very funny.The language was a bit on the rough side but I thought it was fine.
B0055B7IPE|5|What a fun movie. Worth watching over and over again. Oh yeah, the kiddies loved it, too. Gotta love the talking dogs (and the cone of shame).
B004HO6HWA|3|Why is it so hard to remake a good film leaving it better? The original Charles Bronson, with Jan-Micheal Vincent, flick was an old technology good film. This remake has great Star power but just isn't as good as the first version. The bad language is distracting, great fighting scenes with little character connection? I wanted it to be a great remake, instead I wish I had passed on it all together. Maybe better luck next remake?
B00IS87HYI|5|Since candy crush, this game has held my interest the longest. I love  the 2 hours of free play we sometimes get.  More interesting levels of play than I have seen from any game, so far.  Never boring with the cute, movable little pets.
B0000CFW87|5|A gift that brought a lot of joy.  I would do business with this supplier again.  Keep up the good work!
B00H58VGIA|5|This was a great read! The way the author interwove the 2 main characters was nothing short of BRILLIANT! I read and listened to this book via the WhisperSynch feature. This brought to life the story in a magnificent manner. Add this book to your list for an inspiring story based on actual events.
B0061IMJBI|5|The other reviews say this episode was slow, but I think it's just fine. There was a lot more drama and psychological events in this episode than action and that is just fine. You find that in any Zombie flick. Just look at this as one giant movie. It dispersed the action and made it so that the scenes with action were even better.
B00005JM02|5|This is one of our favorite movies.  We just love Dory in it.  Thank you for sendig it so promptly.
B000002LFZ|4|This is a great cd all of fleetwood mac hits from 1975 to 1988, the only thing missing is the extended version of rhiannon, also it would be great if there record company digitally remastered this package that would be  excellent with no buts
B0086700CM|5|BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM THE FIRST ONE!!!!!!<br />BETTER OBSTICLES!!!!!! ZIPLINES!!!!!!!!!!!<br />MINE CARTS TO RIDE IN!!!!!!!! GEMS TO COLLECT!!!!!!<br /><br />BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
B003P2WO5E|5|I started the book and almost put it down. I was not interested in a fantasy book.  However It finally caught my interest  and then I began to find it hard to put down. the end is is very intriging and compelling. I am looking for a follow up book!
B00008PX8P|5|[Discussing Disc One] From the very first seconds, this was an incredible experience.  I was only two-years-old when the footage on DVD-1 was shot.  I was never able to see Led Zeppelin in concert during their day.  \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" video was somewhat of a dissapointment - this endeavour blows that attempt away.  Those that are responsible for this work - Thank you!  The footage is magnificent, yet raw and smacks solidly against the brain.  It captures all the improvisation; one can actually witness these four creating new material on stage, literally making it up as they went along.  Rock was in a state of flux, and we are allowed a long clear look at the metamorphosis brought about by Led Zeppelin's talent and daring.<br />And, Dear God, how about that John Bonham!  During \\"White Summer\\" he makes his power known by sneaking in on Page's ad lib's and totally transforming the feel and texture.  And \\"Moby Dick!\\"  That alone was worth the purchase price!  You can look and see one tiny drop of persperation marking the center of John's shirt, proof that he was indeed laboring during this portion of the show.  And when John labored, he was unmatched by any drummer that planet Earth ever produced.<br />Robert Plant sang well.  His voice was in his control, which is more than can be said for a lot of Rock singers in that era.  Watch as he and Page play games, going back and forth, mimicking each other's notes, taking turns.  A lot of fun.<br />How young they all were in this first disc.  That in itself was intriguing.  The whole performance was reminiscent of a \\"bar band\\" scenario; they were all at ease and having a blast.  The crowd often was completely silent, intent and enthralled with what was going on onstage.<br />Again, Thanks to all who made this possible.  It is a treasure beyond any words I could come up with.  I'm going to buy this for both my brothers (Zep fans) and for a couple of friends, too.  It's too great not to be witnessed by all.<br />Gary
B00ACP3OOM|4|Works great and the sound quality is pretty good, though you will need ear plugs for the best experience.
0399159347|4|Great read. I sorta of pieced the story together towards the middle but it was still a good read. I really like the ending. It makes you think about your life in choices you made.
B00BAXFACO|5|I enjoyed this Connelly novel more than any other book I have read lately - and I have read many. The plot develops well and the story moves along at a pace that wouldn't let me put down my Kindle. I can highly recommend it for those who like Lincoln Lawyer novels - and for those who don't.
B0002S947K|5|Many of us had been taken with a few singles of Ray Lamontagne's offered by a local radio program of singer/songwriters for many months now.  Some of us were even fortunate enough to catch him live this summer.  To witness him, you immedediately hoped that whoever finally recorded him, recorded him for the right reasons, and appreciated how amazing he really is.  They got it right...it's all captured on this debut.  Be a total nerd and call the store and ask them to hold you a copy.  Heartbreaking, romantic as hell, politically captivating and energizing, and I'll say it again, magical--entrancing.  It's all here--best album/Cd I've heard in years.  Sara Watkins and Jennifer Stills offer some nice background vocals (and Sara fiddle), and Ethan Johns is a great accompaniest.  Remember why you loved music?
B00GTCECVG|5|I think that this is a really good game. All you need to do is just buy some more gems to get started. Everyone should get this game because it is one of the best games.
B00915G6SU|5|item was great
B000QCQ8Y4|5|Usual Lee Childs thriller. Some twists, but nothing serious.  I thoroughly injoyed it.
B003WUYOQ6|5|Good information clearly presented by an author who has done his homework on the topic; a shorter more layperson-friendly variation on his earlier Good Fat Bad Fat.
B000084T18|5|Its rare to find a CD in which you can go the whole way without skipping a song. The beats, the lyrics, all of it is great. Definately worth the money. Every song has its unique sound and feel, and tho the lyrics can be repetitive at times, this is what 50 feels, this is what fuels him, and it does a good job.
B008B7OQHM|4|I am a chick & I have excellent taste in music I must say! I LOVE Slipknot & I do not care who they do or do not worship, I love Corey's voice, I love the instrumentals & sound effects & I love the lyrics, they speak to me. I like all their songs & albums (I wish they would release more copies of Mate Feed Kill Repeat) & I didn't see any disturbingly violent artwork in this at all, just some tools (without blood on them) & a dead bird. The red devil's head inside of the cover is clearly a styrofoam head, painted red with horns on it. Seeing images of the devil do not disturb me in the least & this was clearly done for shock value. My only complaint about this cd (hence the 4-stars instead of 5) is they could have included the non-live albulm version of Purity on the non-live disc. I cannot wait until Slipknot comes out with some new material, I like Stone Sour but I LOVE Slipknot & their creepy masks (Corey's Subliminal Verses Mask was my fave)! Sorry dude down below, but in my opinion, Slipknot puts GWAR to shame & I like GWAR! :-P<br /><br />*RIP Paul Gray, you will always be remembered!*
B0002XNSY0|5|Good example of a 40 years old madness that don't go away. Almost as much significant today as it was in 1964.
B0050DIWFC|5|Wow....what an ending. Highly recommend read!!  I was pulled into the book early on and couldn't wait to get to the end!
B0076L9W9Q|5|One of the very few bands worthy of an album purchase these days. The entire CD is awesome. It's worth every penny.
B004ZZITEU|1|Was it brain damage, insanity or just being completely out of though with their fan base that led to the creation of this abomination? We'll probably never know. One thing is for certain, Morbid Angel has \\"lost it\\" and is adrift in a quagmire of their own making. Between the infantile, chest thumping, lyrics that come \\"cut and pasted\\" from any generic hip-hop record, the banal out of place industrial / techno elements, to the utter lack of enthusiasm evident in the metal sounding songs this album fails to provide any positive aspect.   Between Immolation and Deicide, Morbid Angel were one of my favorite death metal bands. Sadly the use of past tense was necessary and correct. I harbor feelings of betrayal, shame and disgust just like I do towards Metallica for their sell-out, cash grab attitudes. What is truly sickening, as with Metallica, is that it casts an emotional stain that hangs like a putrid miasma when listening to their back catalog. You know that the old material that you're currently listening to is excellent and written with talent and dedication but you can not force the ugly image out of your mind of what the once great project has now become in the present.
B007UPNA6Y|1|the worst Lee Child book I have read . Full of repetition on descriptions . Drawn out and boring . The last lee child book I will be buying
0547978847|4|Cute little book, and definitely one that encourages a lot of imagination on the part of readers. What I love is the point the author makes to adult readers about not losing our imagination and creativity. He doesn't explicitly preach that, but it is implicit in the story, while he still maintains the whimsical fairy-tale tone. It is obvious to me why kids & adults alike would love it.
B00IRMQADY|5|I enjoyed the movie very much.
B00CEK9OTM|5|This app took a bit longer than some to load, but once it loaded I have had no problems with it at all. It is a labyrinth puzzle. The kind you tip your device to make work. while the game is simple to understand it got challenging right away. If you like a challenging game that makes you think and work at winning you will love this game.
B009IRVSVQ|5|I bought this album for the Blurred Lines selection, on a whole the album is great. I enjoy it very much! Also bought one for a friend.
B00DPM7TIG|4|Excellent read.  Very different.
0142403873|5|What a great children's book. We actually found this on Netflix in the short movie version. My son loved it so much that we got the book, as well as The Gruffalo's Child which is the sequel to this book. Love it! Room on the Broom is also by the same author. Another good book for children as well as a short movie.
B000A0GYD2|5|From the Earth to the Moon!  What an incredible DVD set!!  This is one set I will never loan to anyone!!  Packed with so much information that I never knew existed!! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves America, is a space enthusiast or a history buff!!  Can't say enough about this DVD set.  So many fine actors it's unbelievable!! I've watched it 3 times since I've received it and will watch many more times.  Fills one with such a sense of awe, wonder and pride.
0441013597|1|Look, I love Herbert, and I love Dune, and I just got a Kindle for Christmas, so I figured I would get at least the first three books, but, guys? You might want to take a look at your pricing, there. I am NOT going to pay MORE for the Kindle edition than for the paperback. Particularly not for a book I already own, just for the convenience of reading it Kindle-ized. I hope that is some kind of silly, easily fixed error. Oh, and guys? Also not paying more than four bucks for an e-version a book as short as Dune Messiah. If the publishers are making you do this, feel free to forward this review to them.
B0015AARJI|4|I but it for my grandson he love it. What I love the most is the price. Same item I saw it for $45.00.
B00BEF1AEK|5|Pretty awesome game, i really like its unique playing style. Found it enjoyable to play. Go for it download it.
B0058YPILY|5|This is one of my favorite shows.  I watch it in my spare time.  I can hardly wait to get the 8th season.
B00DTMCSO2|5|This game is really interesting to see what I am boss and I know it is the most important farm tool for party in love again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
0062502182|5|a book about following your heart.  one of the most genuinely inspiring and wonderfully innocent books i have ever read.  kind of in the same spirit as herman hesse's &quot;siddhartha.&quot;  a must read for anyone.
B00HY7VU60|4|only comment would be I wish it progressed a bit faster
B007GCY8FS|5|Who would think that reading a book about riding in a car would keep you wanting to find out what's at the end of the ride and then fine that the end is not the end. This is the third lee child jack reacher and I want to read the fourth
B00JDB4PEY|5|I love all versions of the eight songs on this album. \\"Slave To The Rhythm\\" and \\"Love Never Felt So Good\\" are my two favorites.  They are great dance songs.  I love the  remix of \\"Love Never Felt So Good\\" with Justin Timberlake. It sounds like a groovy jam.  \\"Slave To The Rhythm\\" is a gritty groovy jam.  I feel like a slave to the every day grind of life even though I am a man.  I also love the song A Place With No Name\\".  The acoustic guitar chords are similar to the song \\"A Horse With No Name\\"  This song is much more uplifting than A Horse With No Name.  It is about finding a place of absolute peace.  Loving You is a breezy sounding song that makes me feel good. \\"Blue Gangsta\\" is a cool song about a woman can turn a man crazy and into a gangster of sorts.  I wonder what a blue gangster would look like.  \\"Do You Know Where Your Children Are\\" is a socially conscious song that reminds me to look out for the children I care about.  I have young nieces and nephews.  This song made me think of them.  \\"Xscape\\" is a great song.  I just want to escape from my problems every once in a while.  I had an emotional reaction to these songs, because I am a huge Michael Jackson fan  \\"Xscape\\" is an excellent album.  It adds to the musical legacy that Michael Jackson has left behind.
630542828X|5|A voice explains the worth of a person in tort law. A young child is worth the least, a white middle-aged professional is worth the most. A Massachusetts hospital is being sued, the lawyers agree to a settlement after the jury is selected. [Does this match your experience?] Personal injury lawyers are the sole defense against a corporation for the average citizen. The small town of Woburn lost a dozen young children to leukemia. They blame contaminated drinking water, but that may be difficult to prove. Will Jan Schlichtman take this case? It takes a lot of money to bring a case to trial. Fate brings Schlichtman to that industrial site where waste is dumped into the river. The need for a lunch hour is explained (to promote sanity in a hectic environment).    The judge seems biased against personal injury lawyers. Rule 11 is old and ambiguous. Discovery goes on to learn about waster disposal from the industries. One witness knows something. \\"Did you ever eat peanut butter?\\" Silicone and TCE are spilled on leather for waterproofing; where does the waste go? The costs for doctors and geologists are high. They must borrow money from a bank for expenses. One employee tells more to Jan. Another man tells what they did: just dumped it in the ground. Most cases are settled not tried. Jan gives his price for a settlement. Too high?    The trial begins. A civil suit is over money for suffering and damage. The witnesses testify. A phone call brings Jan to the judge's chambers. If they can't prove the chemicals reached the wells there is no case. The jury must decide three questions. Jerry talks about Truth and a Court of Law. Will Jan settle for $20 million? Or less? What is the trial about? Money or Justice? There is a settlement. After costs and fees there is $375,000 per family. Will that site be cleaned?    Jan remembers about spilling that glass of water. Somebody had to clean it up, and there will be records. How could a fire ignite water? Jan would file an appeal, the odds are against it. But he can't afford it so he sends the records to the EPA (they have the resources). The result was the closure of the factories in Woburn. Jan filed for bankruptcy. What happened? After paying off debts Jan took on a similar case in Toms River NJ.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Thanks good product.
B006ZS4SXQ|5|Very good for play.
B000069AUI|5|I cried when I listened to this album. Not only is it better in scope and beauty then anything Radiohead have put out, post-OK COMPUTER, it actually cements Coldplay not only as the NEW Radiohead, but a far better one, with their own style and musical chops to spare. This is one of the best rock albums...EVER. I highly recommend it, although I know most of you already own it. Stand-out cuts include: &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Politik&quot;, and &quot;In My Place&quot;. I've long yearned for Radiohead to quit fiddling around with their toilet-bowl worthy endeavors like &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and get back to music that has passion, purpose and heart. Coldplay exceeds these excpectations and righly own the throne and mantle , much like U2 eventually did after &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. These songs are aching with purpose and beauty. Wonderful stuff! And this is their SOPHMORE record! Very impressive and dazzling. One of my favorite records ever...it breathes and aches with enchanted beauty, like the colors of a rainbow. Politically, as in the case of U2 , it brings to light some worldly concerns, and that, also, is to be highly commended. Buy it here at Amazon. NOW!
B00011RPB0|4|We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date..
B00I46T7W4|4|It's fun and great graphics!
B00000K3D4|2|The girls were coming over the house for the weekend and my daughter wanted to watch this flick with them. We odered it and they enjoyed it .That's all that matters they were happy
B00EFNXPFK|5|..........tho the best one is the jjcale song IMO, but Cale, Clapton, have always been in my wheelhouse. Ending of \\"they call me the breeze\\" still has me scratching my head, knowing that it was sent out with the tail bobbed on it.
B0031RAOVY|5|A really lovely story about a man and his dog. It had me crying at the end, and I'm a cat person! I highly recommend this movie, for all animal lovers.
B00002MZ2T|5|This is one of the best CDs I own. I nearly cried when I heard Crash and Burn. It is so poignant! It truely describes what friendship should be. If u liked their first CD then this is a must buy. The CD is filled with sad  and touching songs. Almost every song has a touching theme. Two Beds and A  Coffee Machine was especially sad. If u like touching, emotional songs this  CD is really for you.
B00DHSK3RM|5|higly addictive but fun. Using skills and rationality to beat levels. competitive and often frustrating. you will like it . fun
B0051ANPZQ|5|It a wonderful book for all ages with good values and lessons. I hope everyone reads it to their children.
B008JMKN4Y|5|This book is truly amazing! As soon as I picked it up, I couldn't put it down! I recommend it to anyone who loves a good story
B00HHJOH2Y|4|Very entertaining for all ages.  The girls were precious as well as the minions. The adults were very entertaining. Violence was controlled
B00HCMG6LG|5|one of the harder escape games that I have played. definately awesome if you get stuck there are help videos. definate good download.
B0081SRJSY|2|did not enjoy

B003XF1XOQ|5|I recommend this series to any and all who enjoy a great story teller. my thanks to Susanna Collins and her amazing imagination.
B0034G4P7G|4|The Social Network describes the experience of a generation. It is epic and very well done. Good acting and plot twists.
B00846REIS|5|One of those hard to put down books stayed up tooo late at night reading it.  Cant wait for the next one
B00DR0PDNE|5|Very useful little gadget. Love it. Now if android can come up with a better way to use it, auto detect, auto full screen, etc.
B000NU2CY4|4|Definite way to verify remastered edition is B1R2 on the disc. Thanks a lot to previous reviewers to point it out.
0399159347|5|read it - based in Australia but cold happen anywhere - people and their connections -known and unknown -
B00005JKG7|5|It is my opinion that no classic horror fans collection is complete without this earthy ghosts tale.
B008IJTFYW|5|Very useful for relaxation and for falling asleep. Many combinations to choose from and you can create your own and save them as favorites. I love the fact that there is also a timer so that you can set the app to shut off after a period of time.<br />Try it, there is no downside!
B00PTB7B34|5|The characters are really well designed, but the juggernauts are pretty weak
B00BD99JMW|3|I did not feel any continuity between Allegiant  and the first two books of the series.  I felt book 1 and 2 in the series were about Tris and then wham book 3 is all about Tobias. And Tobias was so out of character from what he was in the first two books. For me a big build up at the end of Insurgent and then big let down with Allegiant
B001KZBK76|4|Overall, unlike some other listeners, I like this album better than \\"Beautiful World,\\" which seemed bogged down by a number of undistinguished ballads. \\"The Garden\\" is probably the best song here, and the one that transcends the mainstream subject matter that can make TT seem a little bland. It earns its melodrama better than \\"Greatest Day,\\" which works better with the video - it is drama with little content. This could be the greatest day: why? so what? While some fans wanted a Barlow-dominated album, I found that the variety of voices here gave the album more depth. \\"Up All Night,\\" the Beatlesque \\"Shine\\"-type song of this album, is instantly likable, and its laddish lyrics give the band some much-needed grit. The social commentary of \\"How Did it Come to This\\" similarly earns its hook with a little humor. These are all non-Barlow elements (Mark Owen, mainly) that make the cd more engaging. \\"The Circus,\\" a piece of Barlow-balladry threatens to dissolve in its schmaltziness. Songs like \\"Julia\\" and \\"You\\" veer too close to teen pop, though; they're about *  * this far from the Partridge Family. \\"Hold Up a Light\\" may pander to the band's 02 Arena audiences, but it works, and would have made a good b-side. \\"Said It All\\" is a song with a strong hook, reminiscent of Keane, and, as the last single, rounds out a collection of \\"adult pop\\" with few skip-track moments. Take That are more charming this time around even as they are unabashedly commercial.
B007SGLZP8|5|Best Grisham book yet...I've read it twice.  They need to make it into a movie with Denzel Washington playing the lead role.  Awesome!
B001PPLIFU|4|There is no FUN in this movie! It's a pure action film, and not a bad one, but as a Bond film it's nowhere near the good ones, as a huge part of JB's character is his sense of humor and irony. Craig is perenially dour and full of grimace; where's James Bond? Even Bourne has more fun than this guy!<br /><br />I don't know if it's Craig's fault: he seems happy enough in the making-of bits here, but in the film he's a dead fish. Ready to kill, but that's about all. Connery is the template because he was both tough and charming, with a bon mot always at the ready. It's what makes his Bond special. The writers have lost that. There are tons of glowering action heroes out there, but only one James Bond. Please bring him back!<br /><br />And the best guy to play that combo of deadly and funny is Statham. Watch the first Crank or even Transporter 3 and see a truly interesting and multi-faceted action hero; as Bond he would no doubt be that much better. Buuut, for some reason many seem to love Craig, so we may be stuck with him for a while. Too bad.<br /><br />Beyond Craig's lack of humor, this film has many flaws. The action scenes are cut WAY too fast, so that one can barely tell what's going on, let alone enjoy it or feel much tension (except from the constant cuts). The acting is wooden from almost everyone; the locations are good but abused by the quick cuts and lack of playfulness. Original director Terence Stamp must be turning over in his grave. He understood Bond's character and that's why the first four Bond films still stand far above the rest. The latest Bond directors are so concerned with being au courant that they miss the whole Bond vibe: lots of action, sure, but also lots of fun.<br /><br />And worst of all: almost no Bond theme or music until nearly the end! What the...? It's the last vestige of the first and best Bonds, so use it to make your weak effort in the series, shiny and slick though it may be, work. Yet perhaps that says it all: this isn't really a Bond film, it's a super-hyper action movie with a guy called Bond, a guy who bears little resemblance to Fleming's, Stamp's, and Connery's Bonds: the real one, a man who enjoys life and the chase instead of suffering through it all.yper action movie with a guy called Bond, a guy who bears little resemblance to Fleming's, Stamp's, and Connery's Bonds: the real one, a man who enjoys life and the chase instead of suffering through it all.
B00BVMXBVG|5|This BBC import is one of the most unusual and successful series I have ever seen. I will disclose only that the first character we see is a clone (which is revealed early) and the incredibly gifted Tatiana Maslany not only plays all the roles with marked and convincing individuality but successfully plays some of the characters when they are pretending to be one of the other characters -- and both layers are visible. To cap it, the plot gets more and more involved, wheels within wheels, complexity upon complexity, unfolding mystery and conspiracy, with a creative genius almost never seen in TV drama. This show is in the realm of Battlestar Galactica and The Wire. This disc should not be started if you have anything else to do.
B006MW3UZW|5|I'm hooked on Downton Abbey!  So many characters have developed with sub plots. Love it. Thanks Master Piece Theatre!! Watch it....
B005HSL626|5|The I pod version stinks(free)but this rocks. The Ipod version you cant do sensays swag (excuse my spelling)but over all good game.
B00J3ZIGOU|5|Very funny book Greg should of put the key in Roderick's laundry. Try every book in this series over all good book
B003O86FMW|5|Fantastic book and series!  I highly suggest it.  I read all three in a matter of a couple days, really keeps your attention.
B009CVRQLY|5|Best CD she's done yet. Can't wait to see her in concert again. Already seen her twice. Good listen in my car!
0689835604|4|My 15 month old daughter loves the book. She likes to pull up the pages herself.
B00BAXFECK|5|Couldn't put it down!  Obvious huge amount of research went into the development of this story that is compelling and educational!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Everything that it promises it does. No complaints been using it for well over a year and I really like it. Would recommend to any one searching for a calculator application for their device.
B00L8O7KW8|1|Did not really care for the movie at all not what I expected. Really was a waste of time and money gave it 1 star cause of some of the graphics
B0014Z4OQG|1|How annoying is he?  By the time they got out of the tunnel I was rooting for the monster.
B00GMFYX0A|1|it did not woork on my HTC One
B0015ABRE2|5|Great series and season 3 is just as exciting and awesome as seasons 1 and 2. If you love Showtime shows and haven't seen this one buy the seasons. It's so worth it.
B0092ZEIN4|5|This gaming pad is perfect for my old games! It was a piece of cake to connect to my Samsung Galaxy S5.  I use the John emulators for NES and Gameboy games and they work like a charm.  I simply had to map the buttons in the settings on the emulator so they worked as expected.  I also use this controller while reading on my phone so I don't have to constantly tap the screen.  The case is well made and protects the gamepad nicely.  I like the stand that came with it as well since it can be used with my phone or tablet, and packs away in the case with the controller.  Overall I am very satisfied with this device!
B008JMKN4Y|3|This was an ok read. It was interesting enough to keep you reading but the characters weren't that believable. And the plot has lots of flaws. At moments the book felt like it was happening in high school instead of college. It was just superficial in the sense that you don't get to really know what Abby is feeling or whats actually going through her head, she is just stating facts not telling a story. Something that to me was incredibly unbelievable is the fact that she was still sexually inexperienced in spite of the fact of her background and where she came from. The book was still mildly entertaining, so if you are bored and don't have anything better to do go ahead and read it.
B0086700CM|5|this game is very fun to play and I am planning start playing it right after I finish this review.
0064409422|4|I have been reading this book to my eight-year-old son at bedtime.  He is absolutely fascinated by it!  I read it myself, years ago, but I forgot how wonderful it is.  We had a discussion about the hidden meanings in the story, so he can appreciate the book both as a work of literature and an allegory of the Crucifixion and Resurrection (especially appropriate since we are reading it during Lent). <br />My only caveat is that some parts of this book are pretty sexist (such as when Lucy and Susan are sternly told that women don't go into battle), but my son understands that attitudes change over time.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game to pass time
B00368CQ6Y|5|My son loves his train.
0785156593|5|Awesome Comic, good price !!!
B00003CWL6|4|I really enjoyed this movie.  I like the way that it really took you into these people's lives and exposed you to a level of perversion that you don't get to experience from the outside.  I'll admit that the first time I saw this movie I wasn't quite sure what all the fuss was about but the more I watched it the more enamored I was with the whole concept.  It really makes you want to take a look at your own neighborhood and wonder what is going on out there.  Definitely deserving of all the praise.
B003O86FMW|5|It was a good read I enjoyed it only one left to read  this one I read in a day couldn't put it down
1451695195|3|Good book with standard near death experiences recounted. Author wants extra authenticity because he tries to explain things from a physician standpoint (he's a neurosurgeon). However, as much as I wanted to find &#34;extra&#34; proof or evidence in his testimony, it simply didn't add anything new to the discussion. (Not a particularly well-written book either...somewhat journal-ish.) Buy ANY book by Raymond Moody instead.
B002MQYOFW|5|Great price and I loved the book! Made me very interested to read the next two, which I have already done!
B008JFURKG|5|You know you have a good movie when you don't get tired of watching it. When we have friends or relatives over for a weekend, we pop this is the Blu-Ray and enjoy it for an evening. The casting is perfect! You can't beat this level of action, humor and unexpected surprises. After we've seen the movie so many times, we know when the surprises are coming and still enjoy them! Red 2 is now one of our all-time favorite videos. It's not for kids (violence) so save this for the adult crowd.
B00QW8TYWO|4|Kids love it
B00125WAWS|5|In the 1960s, I heard a black man tell a room of whites that if we believed in equality, we would each put a gun into the hands of a black man.<br />I flinched and I doubted the efficacy of such an action, though as a child of an extremely abusive father, I did not wonder at the man's conviction.<br />I watched this movie today and I know that the story is a testament to actions which are much more powerful than any gun can achieve. In addition, this film is nothing short of elegant in all aspects of its masterful portrayal.
B001NLKZUA|2|no doubt Cassandra Clare copied off from Harry Potter,she is unoriginal.she grabs bits and parts of OTHER authors stories and throw in some lame and unoriginal parts of her ideas,and BA-BOOM,she makes this sieries.id say that she is good in creative writing at least,but does not know how to string together a story yet.I have searched the other reviewers,their thoughts are surprisingly similar to.mine.eh,this book is ok,but I don't think I will continue this series.
B004EBT5CU|4|Christmas got really noisey this year.  My husband got the daughter a new stereo, and now she has enough power to blast us out of the house.  I guess that is one way to get he and out on a date night...But she had asked for music, and we made her happy.

B007Z8ZKS2|5|I will not say much. Loved this book. From beginning to end. Cancer is tragic, not funny. I giggled. A lot. And cried even though I tried not to. A drama you will not be bored with.
B000NA28I4|1|I've read Mr. Paolini's Inheritance set (so far) at least twice, in an effort to understand the modern development of the various dramatic and literary themes in use for the last 4,500 years - since the earliest Homeric epics, and including Shakespeare, T.H. White, and Tolkien. Paolini has done a marvelous job of incorporating the ancient themes with modern sensitivity. Unfortunately, Messrs. Peter Buchanan and Stefen Fangmeier blew it, in their movie \\"Eragon.\\" The movie fails entirely to develop the lead character, Eragon, and entirely misstates the environment of Alagaësia and the efforts against the immortal king Galbatorix. I realize that \\"film\\" is not the same medium as text, but there's no excuse for omitting most of the motivations and the growth of Eragon as the story progresses. Also, there's next-to-nothing about \\"the rest of the story,\\" no apparent lead-in to the later books, and thus to any later films. (There's really, as yet, no critical difference between film and DVD, as there is between film and stage, or either of those and text.) In my world, not worth the money.
0880796863|3|I have had several different versions of the Rider-Waite tarot deck.  I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with the &quot;original&quot; deck.  The colors of the cards are dull, and the cards themselves are large and awkward to handle.  The accompanying book is smaller than a man's wallet, with small print.  The author tends to rattle on about &quot;secret doctrines&quot; and really offers very little information for beginners.  I wouldn't recommend this set for anyone serious about learning the Tarot.  The other resources available today are much more easy to learn.  I'm purchasing the CD-Rom set &quot;Tarot Magic&quot;, and maybe with both I can refresh my skills as a reader.
0316044938|5|Though it is  a sad topic the story is in a strange way very uplifting. Definite must read.
B00DHQHAH0|5|Awesome show and very funny. I hope they continue making it for a long time. My husband and I love it
B00000DFRS|4|the girl can sang! it is a pity, therefore, that over her career, much of the material has not been worthy of her incredible voice.  yet, whitney could sing the alphabet and make it a must-have.  so, too, is this album.  as a long-, long-, long-term whitney fan, surprisingly, i am most impressed  by the &quot;new school&quot; material.  in no particular order, my  favorite cuts are &quot;it's not right but it's o.k.,&quot; &quot;when you  believe,&quot; &quot;in my business,&quot; &quot;my love is your  love,&quot; and &quot;oh yes.&quot;  &quot;my love is your love,&quot; the  title track, is stunning and powerful in its simplicity.  &quot;when you  believe&quot; is whitney at her best; mariah is mediocre, in my opinion.  one reviewer described it as whitney being soulful and devout, while mariah  was all fidgety. i like the &quot;i'm a strong woman; i ain' takin' no  s___&quot; sentiment of &quot;it's not right but it's o.k.&quot;  some of  the songs, though, i could have done without, including &quot;i learned  from the best.&quot; yuk!  when whitney is not distracted (be it tackling  bobby, the rumor mill, or the media), she has no peer.  her voice is  amazing, and i hope (and have some doubt) she is doing all the right things  to preserve it.
B00S0DW46M|5|We have received. Thank you.
0060589469|2|I get that this was a big deal back when it came out and I read it with my book club, many of whom had read it before, they didn't feel it held up. I can see why. Apart from the ongoing child abuse throughout the book the author seems to ramble and often presents confusing and non-clarified points to his philosophy. I'm not going to write a huge review of this book since there are more than enough out there but I truly did not enjoy it or find it enlightening in any way.
0316789720|5|This is a quality way to teach attention My students 1-12 have loved this.<br />Having a station to produce with precut paper and fine line markers is a real hit.
B00FATEJYE|5|Great game for all ages to play an will be better if there where more energy or none at all
B000XUBFE2|5|I truly enjoyed the book.  Want to see the movie now.  Great character study of those who endured WWII and survived.
B0086HGW42|5|I bought this mainly for the A team like most people but after listening to the CD nonstop I have to say while I still love that song it is no longer my favorite. My favorite actually changes every day because there are so many good songs on here.

0471267554|4|As a young-earth Creationist, I love the concept of this diet, and it really works.  I have been losing about 1/2 lb a day very consistently over time, I have more energy than before, I've lost that \\"brain fog\\" that so many people have on a high-carb way of eating, my general mood and outlook are improved, I'm certainly not starving.  I'm in ketosis most of the time, so my body is a fat-burning machine, without me even trying - I don't even exercise, although I'll start soon. Why is this great from a Creationist viewpoint?  The same principles apply -- what did the first human beings eat?  Genesis 1 tells us that God created 1) grasses, 2) edible plants (vegetables,fruits,herbs) with seeds on the outside, 3) edible plants with seeds on the inside.  Then, God tells us to eat those edible plants. Nowhere does He say to eat grass (grain) or seeds (grains, legumes, arguably potatoes). In Gen. 9:1-3, right after Noah's flood, God finally gives people permission to eat meat.  Sure, people began to eat grain, beans & potatoes later in the Bible, that is an historical fact recorded in scripture. But going back to the beginning, what did our Intelligent Designer create for us to eat, originally?  Fruits, vegetabes, herbs, (arguably) nuts and later on, meat too.  Not grass, and not foods in which the entire food items IS the seed (grain, beans, potatoes).  Some animals can eat those foods fine, but human beings aren't designed by our heavenly Creator to eat those things. We can if we have to, but in a free society today, we have the freedom to eat the way we were designed! I give this 4 stars. I withheld one star only because Dr. Cordain is very vocal about his foolish belief in the fairytale of evolution and its supposed basis for this diet.  Frankly, this should be more aptly titled \\"The Creationist Diet!\\"  It fits perfectly hand-in-hand with biblical Creationism, so I wholeheartedly recommend it to bible-believing Christians everywhere!
B0000AQS0F|5|After watching this DVD set I was blown away.  I've never seen anything like this on TV before.  This series is consistently witty, suspenseful and charming.  My wife and I are super bummed that there won't be another season.<br /><br />I just don't understand how this show got cancelled?  I could see this being the next Star Trek (in terms of longevity).
B00CWY76CC|3|Fun so far! Only on level 4 but enjoying it. Took a bit to get the hang of it but catching on now.
B003WQT2YY|5|Wonderful production!
B007PT3QOQ|5|Game play fanciful; characters interesting; tests your ingenuity. Enough additions to town settlement to choose from.  Just need patience to expand.

B00IUBXPEY|4|Very entertaining, though the movie seems to lack a certain smoothness to me.
B00AFCEIB0|5|Love using google on my Kindle because of the bigger screen than my i phone.  I am always looking something up.
B0097EWK3A|5|I like mystery seek and find games and this one was interesting.  There was a lot of back and forth between locations and I did need the help button a lot just to give me an idea of which direction to go but I really enjoyed the game.  The puzzles were challenging without being too difficult.
B005LAIIRQ|5|I thought it was a great movie.  I would recomend to all adult viewers.!!!<br />Liam Neeson played a great role in the movie!!!<br />I've watched it several times and every time it gets better!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4|Really like this game. It just as good as temple run. Love the minions and the whole cast. Very very good
B000002G87|5|The drug-induced haze that surrounded the recording of this album transcends time....Duane Allman and Clapton render the \\"sickest\\" version of \\"little wing\\" that I have ever heard.  Clapton's pain can be felt as he rips through stunning solos of pure desperation....This album is a must have for any true Clapton fan.
B005KMX866|5|Wonderful recording of several songs from the rockabilly age of music.  I grew up listening to this music and Chris Isaak is one talented guy.  He and his band are great in a live concert also!
B0051UP5NQ|1|I just blew $15 on an app that won't even work for what I need it too. The most helpful reviews weren't helpful at all! I bummed!
0061122416|5|I bought the Alchemist, based on a friend's recommendation, before reading any other reviews (either positive or negative). As a result, I approached the book with no expectations; I think this is one of the reasons I ended up enjoying it immensely,     The Alchemist has neither a complicated plot, nor multidimensional character development. As other reviews pointed out, these are not its strengths. However, this should not be mistaken for naivety. To the careful reader, the Alchemist is anything but.     The strength of the Alchemist is its ability to provide an emotional stimulus. It invokes hope, and optimism, and rekindles the desire to follow your dreams. Whether or not you'll enjoy the book depends largely on your state of mind.    If you're on the fence for buying the book, I highly recommend reading at least the first chapter, available online. It's short, and provides a good example of the tone and writing style that follows.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Very enjoyable, happy ending
B00AKL1XPU|4|Good game. Fun to play
B009UX2YAC|4|Fun game to get friend
B001453LSI|5|This music isn't fire everyone, Martians may not like it. Melody is such a sensitive heart, she will touch your soul. The music is quiet, thoughtful, with just a dash of whimsy. I heard one song on Spotify, and immediately bought this collection.
B00GH4RKYM|3|We in enjoyed the movie but were disappointed in Amazon. We constantly had to restart.It seemed that Amazon kept having to reload while we were watching. To add insult to injury,we had to pay for the movie even though we have Amazon prime. It was a very frustrating experience!
B000002KHF|5|This is more like a greatest hits album, there are so many good songs. &#34;Into the Mystic&#34; is my all-time favorite song.
B00EY7MFKS|5|So far I am very much enjoying this series.  Very glad to see a tv series in the marvel universe that isn't all about the super heros.
0553386883|5|This is the best series I have ever read. I could not put it down.  Is there a book after this one.
B00HV8TN7K|2|Boring sums up this never ending movie.
B006VRDZ44|4|Entertaining
B0098VXHBG|4|Elles is a serious look at a specific aspect of modern day romantic life in the age of the internet and cellphones.  Juliette Binoche stars as a writer for Elle magazine researching (she thinks) an article on young college-age women who offer their services to men in order to obtain the money they need to live as something better than a starving student.  Binoche's character starts out aloof and almost sneering, with the stereotypical attitude the general public has towards these women, but as she gets to know them better she gets drawn to them and into their world, letting down her journalist's guard.  What elevates Elles far above a mere fictionalized documentary movie is when Binoche's character realizes that she is already part of this world.  Aside from one scene in which a character gets assaulted (which is most likely a fantasy, although it is not entirely clear), there are no real victims or perpetrators in Elles.  It is just what consenting adults do to satisfy their needs and survive the stresses of modern day life.<br /><br />The centerpiece of Elles by far is Juliette Binoche's character, and she gives a star performance.  Her character is not terribly attractive, and her face often shows the stresses of the life she leads as a busy working mom, but that is as it should be.  She is most appealing when she lets her hair down by getting tipsy with one of her interview subjects, and that scene is a pure joy.  The two college students, played by Anais Demoustier and Joanna Kulig, are near opposites in personality, body type and hair color, but each actress gives an intimately revealing portrayal.  The men and boys in Elles have much more minor roles, but are well played.  The casting and acting are spot-on, and speak to the care with which Elles was obviously made.  If this film ever gets remade as an American film with American actors, I doubt it will be anywhere near as good.<br /><br />The only thing that prevents me from giving Elles five stars is that it tries to do a bit much in a short amount of time.  There are many scenes and many significant events which rush forward to an ultimately satisfying conclusion.  I feel the film could have benefited from a slightly more languorous pace, which would have allowed time to more fully explore everything that happens.<br /><br />Elles is highly recommended for adults who aren't afraid to look behind the facade.
1250007208|5|Such a cute story!!
B004SJ3AXI|5|angry birds is a execellent game its so good i would trade gold for the game angry birds its so good.
1451696191|4|Perfect
1594489505|5|Powerful.  Every woman in the western world should be required to read this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Enjoyed this book. I would read more by the author. I learned about this book from a magazine reviewing summer reads.
B00006AW2S|1|I bought this as a CD, with the AutoRip. The Autorip didn't include two tracks.<br /><br />I bought the digital MP3 version. Despite the fact it says it consists of 12 tracks, the MP3 version did not include the same two tracks.<br /><br />Either way one must buy the missing tracks separately.<br /><br />So anyone who bought this should check to see if they got the whole album.<br /><br />Should also check their \\"December's Children,\\" which omits one track.
B00005JNX0|5|Great
B004SJ3AXI|1|If I could give it a minus one or two stars, I would.  I tried to download the game for three days without success.  I was teased with this free game offer so that in frustration I would go ahead and pay for the paid version.  I never like to pay for something unless I know I will like it.
B005NNUKF4|5|It an Album you have just sit and  Listen to. It also a great reminder if High school and great time.
B005K01VZS|5|Truly makes you think about why you are here and what God wants for all of us. Improves your faith.
B00IXF8PLU|5|I loved The Book Thief.  Here's some reasons why:<br /><br />Casting is VERY good.  In particular, Sophie Nélisse and Nico Liersch, who play Liesel and Rudy.  Both have excellent acting skills, especially for being so young.  They are perfect.  Of course, the rest of the cast is good as well, with Geoffrey Rush as Hans, Emily Watson as Rosa, and some others whose names I forget.  The only actor I slightly objected to was Ben Schnetzer, who played Max.  I think they could have done a little better. Still, not too far off.<br /><br />I really enjoy the subtlety of the acting.  Nothing is more distracting than having even just one actor over-acting.  I didn't feel that way about any of the characters, which was great.  Not that they were boring or unemotional; they are anything but boring, and show emotion where they should.<br /><br />Of course, the story is wonderfull.  Here the credit goes to both Marcus Zusak for writing the book, and whoever translated it into movie form.  It came off as true the original book, with a few minor alterations.  Alterations include changing who says what line, or the title of a book Liesel read.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints.  First, I didn't like the narrator's (death's) voice.  It sounds too much like the usual creepy voice that we attribute to death.  It goes against the different character that Zusak gave to Death.  Second, I wish they had included more Liesel and Rudy's stealing trips.  But that's it!<br /><br />The Book Thief is really, really good.  So watch it!
1250038820|5|I enjoyed it so much I bought another one and gave both away for Christmas presents. Now I have to buy another one for me.
B008Y768XO|4|A little drawn out at times but I liked it.  Based on a true story but only in similarities, not necessarily fact.
B007V5CF5K|3|this was the first hidden object game i have played and while i did like itand would probably play other games like it, it did have a few problems. first, it takes up a lot ofspace. at first i thought i was having the dl problem others mentioned, but i found that if you leave the game and then reopen the dl starts again. there were a coulle issues with the touch interface not responding so i would have to keep tapping an area and near it till i hit the sweet spot to solve a puzzle andkeep the game going. there reallyis no plot to this game except solving the puzzles either, but ateast that is amusing. the game also seems to quit randomly and restart but luckily you return to where you were and havent lost muchprogress. however the art is very nice and from what ohher reviewerssay the hiddne object genre can bemuch better and this game is on the cheap side. so a good intro gameif u would like to try somehhing new but obs not thebest.
B000056NX5|1|This DVD is terrible and not worth watching. The characters lack passion and are unbelievable.   I had to force myself to sit through it until I could not take it anymore.  Don't waste your time with this one, watch the original again.
B0083SBMBM|5|I was so impressed with this movie.  It had so many great scenes and great action!  We all love it over here!
B007J4T2G8|5|I highly recommend this trilogy.  It's a good read.  A good love story, but men may like it as well.
0393316041|5|\\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" Adventures of a Curious Character is an awesome book about a nobel prize winning physicist named Richard P. Feynman, who encounters many interesting, and at times, unusual obstacles and adventures throughout the span of his lifetime. Mr. Feynman's crazy antics throughout this book remind me of a more professional Michael Richards (Cosmo Kramer, Seinfeld) but still with humor. The book starts with his life as a child with some short stories, to his college days, up to his assistance to the atomic bomb. This book is an awesome book for people from teenagers on up, and will always draw your attention to the book, wondering what crazy thing Mr. Feynman will do next.
B009LMTDL0|4|This book caused waves in the media and caught my attention. Sandberg is a charasmatic speaker and an interesting individual. Her call to women to &#34;lean in&#34; has hit a nerve with women like myself who juggle child rearing with work. The book is an easy read - the language is simple and so are the ideas. Sandberg is obviously a very intelligent woman with an agenda. But the book itself is kind of a let down. I think success is easier when you are a Harvard graduate like Sandberg. From the outset of her career you can see she was both lucky and ambitious. Not that she didn't (doesn't) work hard but let's just say that it is easier for her to lean in. While there are some gems of advice and her arguement is convincing, I closed the book thinking, &#34;Good for you but this isn't going to work for me.&#34; I want to see my children on a daily basis like most mothers. And climbing the corporate ladder means day care and more day care with little time left for family. And we can't afford the type of help that Sandberg can. Maybe it would be easier for me to spend more time at the office if I knew my children were well taken care of and if day care didn't eat up almost all of my salary. Anyway, this book has important ideas for young women starting their careers but not much to offer those of us already stuck in the work-childrearing balancing act.
B00000J7S8|5|I don't know what the reviewer below me is talking about. Diana Krall is an excellent singer. Granted she does not have vocal chops of a Mariah Carey or a Whitney Houston but that is not all that singing is. Diana is a  master of the understated style reminiscent of Shirley Horn, placing an  emphasis on knowing when to stop, when to pause for effect, and when to  pronounce words a certain way for maximum effect. This is much harder to do  than simply belting out, and it is what makes Diana Krall a superior  singer, and what makes this album one of the best for the year.
B00BJA2VFW|5|Three ways to play my favorite game. Challenging levels keep me on my toes. Would recommend to a friend. Glad I bought it. No regrets.
B00008BXJG|5|AC/DC: One of the only true and dedicated Rock \\"n\\" Roll bands that have been making dependable and honest, in-your-face music for the past 30 years or so. Without a doubt, Angus, Malcolm, Cliff, Phil, and Bon (the line-up on Highway to Hell) are some of the most humble, comical, and nicest fellas anyone has ever known, and ever will know, for that matter. And without failure, the group continues to give their fans (with or without Bon [rest in peace]) predictable and unwavering classics, while maintaining that special freshness of genuinity that most bands can not boast about. Easy, but infectious riffs, funky-primin' drumming, and simple bass lines have never sounded so good, nor so enticing on this gem. Full of instant goodies, prime-steak riffage, and abrasive n crude vocals from one of thee greatest frontmen of all time, H2H is a sure-fire hit with anyone into good old fashion rock n roll. Anyone who says AC/DC sound the same on every album, are slaves to routine, or scared to move on got just don't know what they're saying. Taking the famous line from Rock n Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, \\"rock n roll ain't no rhythm man; to me it makes good, good sense\\" those critics of AC/DC have to take to heart what Brian professes on that number. With all that off my chest, here's the cannon for this Top 3 delight.<br /><br />Highway to Hell: Seriously now, how much more classic can you get? You're just socially inept if u haven't even heard of this song. Right off the bat, your ears pleasured as Ang rips out that catchy and infectious 3-chord riff that's so well-known today. Da-Da-Da. Da-Da-Da. Da-Da-Da--Da-Da-Da-Da--DaDa. Complete with Bon's coarse vocals and that powerful sing-along chorus, \\"highway to hell\\" is like a fiery shot 'o liquor, potent but tasty.<br /><br />Girls Got Rhythm: Just what you'd expect in a great AC/DC tune; contagious riff, Bon's bad-boy lyrics, and another catchy-as-heck chorus, with gang-vocals to boot. Ah, girls got rhythm indeed.<br /><br />Walk All Over You: Slow, but menacing opening riff, with powerful drums by Phil, that rips into a fast-paced rock n roll onslaught. Driving start/stop riff during the verses complementing Bon's vintage vocals, that goes back to the opening riff with a slow, but powerful chorus, again complete with gang-vocals. Also contains one of my favorite solos by Ang on here; fiery and scorching like lighting, just the way I like 'em.<br /><br />Touch Too Much: Opens with great complentary riffing by Ang and Mal, both producing riffs that kind of flow over each other. Kinda bluesy w/ AC/DC's leery lyrics plastered throughout the mix. Ang, once again, shreds on his frets, giving the listener a short n sweet, juicy solo. Chorus could be my favorite off the album as well, as Bon really hits those high notes, and 'cause the gang-vocals add a lot to this number.<br /><br />Beating Around the Bush: Probably the fastest song off the album, this treat delivers galloping riffing and drums plus some great filler solos in-between the start/stop riff. Features some stellar screamin' from Scott in addition.<br /><br />Shot Down in Flames: Bon gets center-stage here, not being backed by Mal and Cliff and all, plus painting the perfect picture of getting s*** on by a snobby chick. Ang, however, takes the show with his speaker-splitting solo that speaks more than volumes.<br /><br />Get it Hot: More laid back and relaxed, but nonetheless still enjoyable. Fun, little rocker, that adds yet another gem to the track listing.<br /><br />If You Want Blood (You Got It): Yes, Yes, give me it ALL! This perfect compliment to Highway to Hell could be AC/DC's most sinister number describing hypocrisy and unfair treatment, while managing to throw in a curse word for good measure. The ending is the highlight, though showcasing Bon + gang vocals at their finest, preceded by Ang's great solo.<br /><br />Love Hungry Man: The drums are the best on this stripped-down, blues-bust. While the worst off the album, it still acts as an enjoyment.<br /><br />Night Prowler: What a great way to end this masterpiece. Bluesy, but no less rocking than any other track here. Ang's beginning, cresending solo acts as a nice opener to Bon's subtle and quiet vox. Then, all of a sudden, the heavy guitar riff rips out and Bon screams out 'night prowler' with Mal and Cliff giving their best back-up performance off the album. Perfect closure.<br /><br />>In closing, just pick this up RIGHT NOW! No, in fact, if you don't own a copy, just forget it, cause you should have it by now (he, he, ehh). Highway to Hell was a great way to close off 70's AC/DC, Bon's career (RIP once again), and their first era, which produced several classics, not just this. Being one of their best produced albums (thanks to Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange), AC/DC's best outing, and one of thee greatest albums of all time, Highway to Hell needs no further elaboration; it just needs an easily accessible spot on your shelf.masterpiece.

B00GTO6X0W|4|As a sailing enthusiast and a Robert Redford fan, I wanted to see All Is Lost because of Redford and because there really aren't many movies made about sailing.  From my perspective, All Is Lost felt very much like an \\"art film\\" - the only human you see on screen is Robert Redford, and the dialogue consists of about 10 words in all.  Although Redford's character makes all sorts of \\"sailing mistakes,\\" he does a credible job of convincing me he actually made to his location at the beginning of the movie.  Although the pace of the movie is somewhat uneven, I had no trouble staying engaged until the last 2 seconds of the movie when the plot is resolved.  I'm not an acting critic, but I thought Redford did an outstanding job with the part.  I don't know that a lesser skilled actor could have pulled it off.<br /><br />Net/net - if you like Redford and sailing, you'll really enjoy All Is Lost.  Otherwise, maybe not so much.
B009HUB40Y|4|I'd say this game is entertaining. I don't know if I would pay but I am enjoying playing so if you like these kind of games get it! And have fun
0345803485|2|I figured I would give the book series a shot after so many people on facebook made such a big deal about it. I was even mildly curious that it was an erotica because I usually don't read books with that sort of subject matter and it was hitting the best sellers list. Well I just finished the third book today because I thought after the first two books I might as well see how it ends. The trilogy was disappointing to say the least. Its so predictable how it will end, the sex scenes suck and are comical...and there is so much repeating! It was exhausting to read and I actually towards the end was counting down the pages until it was over so I could be done with it.<br /><br />The author had nice vision and I understand she was trying to create something different than people are used to reading, but I feel the book series still needs a lot of editing before it could be considered something worth publishing. I can't believe its going to be a movie...
B003F5WOEC|4|This album is simultaneously classic and modern, mellow and intense, rock and blues.  Even the packaging maintains this contradictory pattern being both the simplest album artwork I have ever seen and the coolest.  The music is beautiful swampy blues-rock and showcases some of the best songwriting and musicianship I've heard from a modern band.  Like another reviewer wrote, this album is mellow, but it also has an undeniable soulful intensity. It's also worth mentioning that this album rewards vinyl lovers with great packaging including a poster and a copy of the CD -- the mp3 crowd will definitely miss some of the charm of this album.  So, why only 4-stars?  The songs, and the packaging are both definitively 5-star, but the album looses a star for offering no journey and limited variety: it's a collection of great songs, but unlike Blond on Blond, Dark Side of the Moon, and Music from Big Pink, for example, this music doesn't gain anything from full-album listening.  If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.  But, you should get this album and get it on vinyl -- this is one of the rare modern releases that feels like it was made to be heard on vinyl.
B0015KO52S|5|Awesome!!!
B0095JQYCU|5|This group is amazing.  I first heard them on YouTube and wanted to support them, so I bought their CD and will be going to see them in concert! Great song selection and excellent talent.
B00FRQ32N4|2|I thought I could start using it for free, you need to buy even the first robot to start playing.
B00FHB7398|4|Had some issues with screen transitions. The story line was interesting but some of the threads went nowhere. Seems like it was put together by a fledgling programmer.  They should fix and upgrade the game cause it was fun for casual play.
B000002UAR|5|This is the greatest and most revolutionary album ever recorded. Anyone who knows anything about music and the beatles will tell you that. Im telling you so. The album keeps a wonderful acid sound right through to the end with Tommorow Never Knows(which i rank as the 4th best Beatles song and therefore the 4th best song ever). Although Rubber Soul was the real turning point for the beatles, this was a much more dramatic declaration to listeners that they were beyond A Hard Days Night. Unfortunetly, most people still had their head in the sand and didnt catch on untill the vastly inferior Sgt Pepper was released. Every cut on Revolver shows that the Beatles were and still are the greatest songwriters ever. My favourite is She Said, She Said, which John wrote about Peter Fonder i believe, at a acid party in LA. As John said - \\"Rubber Soul was the pot album, Revolver was the acid.\\" [....] <br />1966 gave Revolver, the pinnacle of music, to the world.This moment of shining glory makes civilization and the entire pyschedelia movement worthwhile, even if a few [misguided people] still keep preaching about Sgt. Pepper.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Love every minute, excited about the future!!! I Love all of the relationships of the family and staff. Thank you for a great series!
B00GRXA7GG|5|Thank you!
B000KWZ7VU|5|It is one thing to listen to the Beethoven Sonatas, another to experience Bqarenboim's recreation of this epic soundworld.  His interpretations transcend technique.  One sees the role of Beethoven in music history and the history of keyboard writing in a whole new way.
B00BVVA138|5|Another awesome album from the best metal band out there, Kill Switch! This is a must have if you dig metal with great lyrics!
B0031KC8OC|5|watching Kristen Bell is worth any shortcoming the series may have. Very good actress and a pleasure to watch her work.
B00BMYHU7Y|5|I received my 4vol box in a timely manner and was thrilled to find a &#34;used&#34; item wrapped and BRAND NEW!  AND after being hooked by the TV series I am delighted to find Mr. Martin's Magnum Opus as good and at times Better than the TV series....He also writes in such a way that if you are enamored of any one character, you may read ahead the chapters listed by that characters name....I'm trying to catch up to the 3rd season, but am already dreading reading about the &#34;Red Wedding.&#34;  The nuances of the book are sprinkled with enough historical language to have me looking up some equine terms I'd missed which I found rather refreshing.  Has anyone else noticed that whoever in the story breaks their bond or spoken/implied promises seems to live (or die) to regret it?
B00992CF6W|1|All I get is a black screen now since the update.  My kids spent their own money on this, and are livid right now.
B00EL8I8IS|4|Loved it.
B004FGMDOQ|5|This book has a great deal of fantasy and if that is what you like them this book will definitely satisfy!
B00000IPAX|3|Blink 182's fourth cd, Enema of the State, was a big dissapointment to most &quot;hardcore&quot; blink fans who owned their first three CD's. After this was released, the band began making TRL appearances and where victims of constant MTV airplay. Now, is this CD as bad as most hardcore punks say it is? Not really. Blink has a more professional sound to the album, which can partly be attributed to the new drummer, Travis. You can really hear Travis' influence in thie first track, Dumpweed. The music style for Blink is not alot different from Dude Ranch. They still play pretty fast and their lyrics...well...they aren't much different either. All in all Enema is a decent offering, not nearly as good as Dude Ranch or Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, it is still the weakest off Blink's CDs. Better tracks include Dumpweed, Don't Leave Me, Going Away to College, What's My Age Again?, Dynestery Gary, and Mutt.
B00DQQSD2W|4|Very well done. Great photos, video and audio help to illustrate the process of bringing the core ideas to the screen.
B00MI25Z8A|5|Son's birthday gift.  He was happy.
B00631VJIC|4|A soundtrack album for 'Sons oF Anarchy' was always going to be excellent with such a wide and varied selection of music to choose from. The problem was always going to be 'What to put in and what to leave out'. I can't really quibble with the choices on this disc, the theme song, the Katey Sagal selections, Paul Brady's mad version of 'Gimme Shelter' are all excellent but with so much left out I would have preferred a double disc with some of the stuff left out such as 'The Black Keys' stuff from series one, 'The Dropkick Murphys' version of 'Johnny I Hardly Knew ye' and especially the magnificently poetic  season 4 opening scene where the sons get out of prison soundtracked by 'Joshua James' song 'Coal War'
B009SQR28A|5|Absolutely hilarious is you like British humor.
B00UTJ93FU|5|Awesome
B009UX2YAC|5|Very good I recommend this
B004XUMMFE|5|Great series.  Was cancelled early because Joss Whedon is a visionary and makes things popular instead of following trends.  Watch it.
B00B2V66VS|5|temple run 2 is really cool.because once you get A very hiscore. I like that wood part and stuff and that's why it is awesome.
B007L3BMGA|4|Picked up the the book after seeing the amount of Media intrest in it. Not my typical reading but overall liked the book and would read the entire trilogy
B002UZ5CHO|5|Excellent DVD  I would highly recommend it!
B000HKYOK0|4|Good movie
B007EECSFA|4|Wonderful story with well developed characters. Morton's plots are believable. The characters stay with you long after closing the book.
B007RE0RR8|4|The doll is very cute, and is beautiful like all of the other dolls of Monster High. I have one or two complaints with this particular doll though from the new Dead Tired line. 1.) She doesn't come with the ice cream carton shown in the photo. She comes with a paper magazine instead. Not a big deal, but probably a cheaper route on Mattel's part. One of the best parts of MH are the accessories they come with, so a little disappointing. 2.) I'm used to Draculaura's facial features, and her mold in general. Any big MH fan knows each doll has very unique characteristics to their facial sculpture. When I looked at her in the package for the first time, it didn't look like the usual Draculaura mold to me. Her face is a bit puffier then the other Draculaura dolls. I own other versions of her, and while still being pretty, it's just different, something is off. If you're not familiar with most of the dolls, this won't really matter to the untrained eye. 3.) No stand! Most MH collectors have extra of these, but if you plan on standing her up for display, you'll need to have an extra stand handy. All in all, she is still a gorgeous doll to add to your collection.
B00DWZHTOU|5|After going to the show and seeing this I decided to buy it. The family really liked.
B003Q6D2B4|5|This is one of the best movies ever - funny and action packed. Absolutely loved it and recommend it to everyone,
B000RF7XYO|5|Elizaneth is a great look into a tumultuous time period. There is some artistic license ( the putting on the stone makeup in kind of weird, but it's a movie) the costumes are rich. The characters are real and the story is easy to follow.
B001NLKXK2|5|Very well written.  The author is highly educated on the topic and this fictional story seems so real.  The other day I was thinking about if Alice was still alive, then I remembered this is fiction.
B008476HBM|1|This isn't even readable.  It's like People magazine written in 18th century English.  I have no idea why this book shows up on the top novels lists.
B000F7CMRM|1|I found this movie in the $5 bargain box (along with a bunch of other movies I had never heard of) at Walmart. Sad to say, I wasted my money.    Writer and Director Stephen Gaghan tries to define himself for a new generation, but all that he delivers is an abortion of a motion picture.     The best scene was when the main character was being tortured; as the viewer, I could sympathize as I felt equally tortured watching this movie.    I actually laughed out loud during the extra features when George Clooney related how anxious his fellow stars were to get a part in the film (I wonder how they feel about it now).     If you want taut, intelligent drama, watch Spielberg's MUNICH instead of this force-fed globetrotting disaster - SYRIANA is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
B003YFIUW8|5|This was a book I couldn't put down. And when I had too, Jack was in my head talking to me until I returned. A must read for everyone!
B007SOQBCM|5|It works fine for me i usually only watch wyld and other minecraft people and you can chat with other people you need to click the arrows that point all together but it just as good as the PC twitch
B00KZ6WRAA|5|I like it!
B0033H7VI6|5|The knife is full tang meaning the steel  is solid from the tip of the blade all the way through the handle. The grip is first class even when wet and the blade is plenty thick for using to pry things apart which does make it a little on the heavy side but was expecting that. It isn't stainless but the blade is coated and so far no notable corrosion. The sheath that came with it was part of the reason I selected this one, well made with a plastic insert that keeps even a sharp blade from cutting into the nylon and a small pouch that's perfect for carrying a magnesium fire starter or portable sharpening device. For the price you can't beat it.

B003LXM1RS|3|Night Work is, in my opinion, the least good of Scissor Sisters´ albums so far. The best was Ta-Dah! and the second best was their eponymously titled first album. Unfortunately there was not a single track on Night Work which had as much \\"swing\\" as the fantastic I Don´t Feel Like Dancin´. I would say that Night Work is good, but not great.
B008XG1X18|5|Great place to go for ideas for anything that you can think of.
B00BAXFAJC|5|Fantastic. Hated for it to end.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love YouVersion's Bible app. It offers all versions of the Bible along with the ability for your device to read it to you. It offers all types of readings plans such as The One Year Bible all the way to daily devotionals and scripture for specific life issues. My wife and I use YouVersion for our daily readings together. It is unbelievable how taking the time to include God in your daily life can bless you and your family. Thank you YouVersion and God Bless You.
B0002Z9HT8|4|<br />i still have some of my original tapes from the '85 broadcast and believe that poor performances may have been blocked from re-release by the artist.  A few of the performers at Wembley had trouble playing on Freddie Mercury's Steinway -- Phil Collins had one or two embarassing screw-ups on \\"Against All Odds,\\" which was left off this DVD.  And Simon LeBon's vocals were at one point reduced to a tortured squeal on \\"A View To a Kill.\\"  I also read that they doctored Paul McCartney's performance of \\"Let it Be\\"?  At the original concert, his mic was completely off during the first verse.  Due to the complexity of the production, most bands went onstage with little or no time for sound checks!  I would've preferred to see the mistakes left in the DVD.   <br /> <br />
B004DI7HZ6|2|I just couldn't get into the story or the couple. Nothing about it reeled me in. First half of the book was painfully boring. That's a big chunk for an almost 600 page book.
B00KIGRRRU|5|another great chapter in this story!
B00AB7HESI|5|Kindle Fire HD needs the one game that is impossible to hate from DS, no matter how many times you played it. 5 stars for this game. It has only failed once and I can't stop playing it.
B00NMXY2MO|4|A+ construction, plug and play, I am using it with dragon. Its not as good as philips speech mike but decent performance
B0063GORYU|4|I would recommend this game to anyone. Works great on my Galaxy Tab 10.1. Easy to adjust options. Ads are annoying but go away with one click.  It's FREE.
B008XG1X18|4|love this app, its been great and every now and then does a force close. works fine after. I have this app for my kindle fire.
B001AQO3QA|5|HD looks good on movies considering how old they are. The box set is a pretty nice collectors item. The original theatrical release & the director's/ special editions are included for each movie.
B003O86FMW|4|Great book starts off a little slow but in the end of the book it is as thrilling and awesome as the first Hunger Games book. You should read it too it's a great book.
B004EPYZT4|1|Yeah, and the producers/writers/director/whomever clearly do not understand the character or stories of Conan hence they do not wield it effectively. As a Sword & Sorcery film it was okay, at best. As a Conan story it was terrible. As with the Milius version we get yet another sentimental version of the character. Conan was many things in his fictional career, indeed he has been a thief, pirate, military and mercenary Captain, even a desert chieftain and finally King. But sentimental? Nope, sorry. Given my experience of reading the character I feel Conan would view sentimentality as a weakness.  I knew something was wrong during the narrative intro by an oddly misplaced Morgan Freeman voiceover (the first time I didn't like him in something). The voice over started off correctly but then deviated wildly from the history of Hyborea. Conan is made to stand out as something special, unique and somehow important. This time he is gifted with near superhuman skills and abilities which takes away from the excitement as you never feel like Conan is ever in danger of actually losing (even though you know he won't) let alone getting injured or suffering. The written character of Conan was not unique, different or special. He actually was an outsider and his father and exile. At fifteen he (for the most part) ran away and eventually sought his fortunes farther south. Conan, at its heart is an everyman tale (if an arrogant everyman). He is not heroic, although his actions could surely often be interpreted as such but more often than not was seeking to better his lot while furthering his ambitions. Mostly he was just a man that kept growing, surviving and gaining skill all though his life until he achieved his goals in Aquilonia and even then had some more adventures. This, to me anyway, makes for a much more identifiable and interesting character.  A note on comparisons versus the 1982 Milius version: Neither of the films are very good Conan films but Milius' worked so much better as a Sword & Sorcery film for various reasons. One being that Conan in that film actually suffered more than once and was in no way superhuman. This one seemed to lack a sense of continuity and I felt like I was simply being dragged from one set piece to the next with little time to reflect on anything. Heck, even the sex scene seemed like a set piece.  A note regarding Jason Momoa: I do think he COULD make a good Conan but I do not think he made a very good one here. Not sure if this was his or the director's fault but running through a film constantly looking angry really makes for a bland hero. Even Arnie got to show a wide range of facial emotions in the Milius version. It may seem like a small detail but it does go a long way to humanizing the character.  Cast notes: Stephen Lang was good as a bad guy. Much more complete a character than Avatar (where he played a pretty one dimensional soldier) and overlooked by Hollywood for too long.  Ron Perlman: Please, I would watch Ron Perlman sitting alone in a room for two hours. He makes EVERYTHING he is in, better.  Rose McGowan, initially, I didn't like her in this, she was weird, creepy and disturbing. But then I realized that is EXACTLY the kind of bad guy witch woman I would want in a Sword & Sorcery flick. I have changed my stance on her and liked her in this film.  Rachel Nichols: Not really needed here. Not that I disliked her, just didn't care for her character and she seemed little more than the \\"love interest contrivance\\" for the script. Still, with that bit of a part, I admit she did exude charisma.  A few more notes: The filmmakers apparently pulled from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Yet, the story is VERY similar both in plot and theme to the 1982 one. What the what? Comics and images? There seems to be this major disconnect between what a comic is and how it is interpreted by Hollywood in general. A comic does NOT show the moments in-between, this is something our brains do and it is called closure. Movies rarely have that luxury as they are moving pictures and the in-between (at least within those moments) is laid out for us. Hollywood, in general, clearly does NOT understand what a comic book is. Also, many of the SSoC were based off of L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter stories. What about the guy that created Conan? Remember him? Robert E. Howard. Does his original work have so little merit or influence despite being the actual creator!?! I would argue that the original literary work from Howard (or DeCamp or Carter for that matter) had much influence at all.  Final note: Ultimately I was bored watching this film. So much so I had trouble even watching the third act, compounded by the fact that it was the worst of the three. (Stephen Lang did make a great villain though) What did that mask actually do for Khalar Zym anyway? It sure didn't help him fight any better or survive.  Ultimately a let down and Conan the Destroyer (for ALL of it's faults) still remains the closest to an actual Conan film (if seemingly based on a later Carpenter or Jordan novel) despite its campy tone.
B00475AYJQ|5|One of the best books I've ever read.  Just like The Name of The Wind, by the end I was completely immersed into the world and it's characters.  I can't wait for Doors of Stone.

B000EULJLU|5|this album is INCREDIBLE, if you think it sucks then it just went over your head, i have to admit on first listen  i was thinking this was boring and wasnt as good as there last albums, but after many listens and finally obsorbing the songs  it all came together , 10,000 DAYS is up there with lateralus , its just an amazing ride all the way through. Once this album hits you - you wont be able to stop listening. : ) TOOL DO IT AGAIN
0679879269|5|This story is amazing. I couldn't put it down. While some say it doesn't have the action and suspense of the first two; I was certainly kept on the edge of my seat. From the dying off of the huge trees that give the mulefla their way of life, to the tiny Gallivespians who help Lyra and Will on their quest to free the dead, to the end of the Authority, this book is always giving you something to wonder about.
B005DOKIYG|3|i was not happy with the quality or the appearance of the cover. it looked and felt cheap and was not inexpensive. if i was able to find the paperwork, i would have sent it back, i bought another cover that opens like a book.
B000Q66PXE|5|I purchased this as a gift for my closest friends.     Now, everytime we talk ... I get a freaking book review of the most recent episode. I sincerely believe they are addicted.    They tell me that it is historically accurate and very realistic. Their daughter has a doctorate in Latin and their son married a vegan, so I think they are pretty creditable people.    I watched only 15 minutes ... and I got hungry for a Ceasar's Salad.    I don't want to ruin this series for anyone by giving away the ending, but from what I understand, in the end - everyone becomes Italian.
B007V2UGPE|5|This is a really fun game.nu will admit that it is a bit difficult at times and the glue credits thing is annoying but other than that I cant really complain about anything.
B00ESCJG1U|4|Really excellent results, surprising how it can make the bad look better or give life to pictures I would delete... but sometimes it makes an object of the picture better while making other parts of the picture worse, driving to an end result that I dislike.<br />It is still far from perfection but once I still could not find the perfect tool, I would say this is the best out there so far.
B00C1S945G|5|New chief of security, new doctor. Deanna Troi's mother is so obnoxious, I skipped the ones with her in it. The episodes are still mostly full of imagination. Data is always good. Can artificial intelligence finally get so good that it breaks free and becomes human or even better? Can we do away with war on earth? Can we do away with money? Stay tuned.
B00IFOOPM2|5|If you are (were) a fan of VM, you will not be disappointed! Cameos from so many of the characters, it was great to see where they are now. Multi layered mystery and sleuthing in true Veronica style! Loved it!!!!

B00000FCBC|5|this metallica CD is probably the best one since the black album. although the songs aren't their own, they put their familiar sound to them and make them their own.
B005HJWWW8|5|Bought a pair of Koss PortaPro's last week which sounded pretty good already, especially for $30. But my cousin suggested picking up the E5 saying they could use a slight boost. After reading some reviews I figured why not spend the extra $5 and get the E6. Though I is my first day with with them I notice a drastic and immediate difference. Bass now has a really nice little punch and mids & highs are very clear. First time I ever used a headphone amp and I now get it. This is going to make night shifts a lot easier. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially to beginners like me. Instead of spending the money on some blah set of headphone with some rapper's name on this side do like I did and buy some koss portapros and this amp. Compared this setup to the $300 beats by Dre and it wasn't even a contest. Sure the beats had a little more bass but everything else was washed out. Didn't get a chance to use the amp with the beats but I don't expect much. Right now I am using a droid charge with the power-amp app, 320kbps MP3 files, Fiio E6, and PortaPro's. The E6 has has 4 EQ mods, first one just seems to amplify all ranges a little, second EQ is a bass boost type mode, third EQ is what sounds like a mid range EQ boost(not sure just guessing from what it sounds like to me), & the fourth mode reduces on all frequencies. It is easy to switch through each EQ mode by simply pushing up on the power slider quickly, which you hold for 3 seconds to turn on and off, slide down for a volume lock. On the opposite side is a volume rocker that increases and decrease sound by very small margins with each one click. Each mode has it's purpose and I've already use all of them, well not so much the 4th EQ setting but I have a few idea's of where it could be very useful. I am already very please with my purchase and at just under $30 it is an easy sell. What came in the package was two different sized 3.5mm dual ended male adapter, 1 mini USB charging cable, Fiio E6, 2 clear removable plastic clips & a multi-language instruction pamphlet.vable plastic clips & a multi-language instruction pamphlet.
B000002UAX|5|Hey kid, you have no clue what the beatles are about, revolver, although no where near as popular as the white album, was possibly the beatles greatest, and arguably their only \\"rock and roll\\" album.  The white album songs which you have neglected to put on your list of 13 are equally good, and in some cases better than your list.  Go take some history lessons and look at what was going on with the beatles when they made their albums, and don't judge the ones you don't like because you are looking at them through eyes that have no clue what the beatles are about.

B000063DI8|2|In a word, awful. This CD contains three decent hit singles in \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter\\" and another catchy tune in the aptly-named \\"Hooks In You\\". Stupid and derivative lyrics and substandard musicianship aside (not that they play them bad, but these are songs where a band like Maiden can just \\"phone it in\\"), all are good enough to make you hum along with repeated listens. Too bad they're surrounded by turkeys like \\"Mother Russia\\", \\"Fates Warning\\", \\"Public Enema Number One\\", \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and \\"The Assassin\\". The title track is acceptable, although it's basically the blueprint for \\"Afriad To Shoot Strangers\\" on the following album (and \\"Strangers\\" is better). And what's up with Bruce Dickenson's voice? He sounds like he's been gargling battery acid and chain smoking unfiltered pieces of tire rubber. I would call this the weakest album they've ever done. <br />Also, a comment on the revamped cover - why did they edit out the guy with the lantern looking into the grave? On the original cover, Eddie was grabbing the guy's throat. Now he just seems to be clutching empty air. Plus the coloring is drastically different between the two covers. Go to a used CD store and find the original (I guarantee there'll be PLENTY of them there) and see what I mean!
B001GQACGO|2|I can appreciate Beyonce exploring new musical challenges, however  I just felt most all the songs fell flat to my ears.  Better luck  next time B.  You had me becoming a fan with B-DAY, but I'm skipping  you this go round.

0545123283|5|Linger picked up right where Shiver left off. The detail was exactly what i expected. This was a beautifully written story with vibrant characters and an abundance of emotion with the right amounnt of drama[[ASIN:0545123283 Linger (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 2)]]. The end makes it seems as there may be a 3rd book to follow. I hope very much that there is and look forward to reading it.
1853104825|2|I bought this hoping to get a summary of accident investigations. Instead it is diatribe that goes on and on. I should have known from the childish marketing name \\"Naked\\".<br /><br />It does NOT summarize the data and put it in a form that is quickly usable and understandable so that a pilot can quickly learn from it. Does anyone have time to read on and on like this? I read every week much material so I don't have time for \\"wordy\\" materials like this. The positive reviews neglect to emphasize this.<br /><br />A Readers Digest type summary could be written that might be 100 pages long rather than the 300 pages of densely packed material here that I don't have the time to wade through.<br /><br />For a person writing a report or devoting most of their time to this subject, it is exhaustive in its wondering comments on aviation and why things likely happen. It just spends too much time weaving around for a normally busy person to read it.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for succinct explanations that you can remember or as rules of thumb for actual situations.
0373771665|5|One of the most disreputable of Heyer's heroes but also one of the most engaging. Not much plot but the usual wonderful dialogue and eye for detail. The developing relationship between Venetia and Damerel is totally believable. Although nothing explicit as usual with Heyer their relationship is one of the most sensual and emotionally moving of any of her protagonists. One of my favourite Heyer books along with Frederica and Sylvester.
B000000YBQ|5|This is a stunning recording. The level of empathy between themusicians, but the level of freedom in their playing is quiteastonishing. Nothing before or after (including work by Bill Evans), except for Sunday at the Village Vanguard, reaches the same levels of improvisation while also creating a singular mood of calm and beauty.... This recording does in fact embody many characteristics of 'free jazz' in that there is very little structure to the overall interplay of the individual performers. Each musician plays as if in isolation when heard on a superficial level (as when one concentrates on the individual playing), but together create a coherent whole. This is, in fact, the ultimate free jazz and, indeed, the ultimate jazz recording. The seemingly contradictory combination of improvisation and freedom with amazing ensemble interaction yields a recording which reaches the zenith of what the jazz musical form can accomplish. A recording that no serious jazz fan can be without.
B002MQYOFW|4|So... I had a push-and-pull relationship with this book. I had heard so much about this book that I just had to get it. But i have huge collection of unread books and this wasn't at the top. However after several months i finally convinced myself to pick it up. 5 days ago, in the morning, I did, i've read barely half page and something came up, so i had to put it down. Then later, i started again from the beginning, i've read 2 pages and someone interrupted me...again. I was like, \\"GOD! The big daddy up there doesn't want me to read this bloody book...\\" . 2 days ago i picked up again, logged out from everywhere, turned on my instrumental music (ya, usually i listen instrumental musics -Two Steps from Hell, Immadiate Music, Brand X Music - while i read books.) and started to read from the 2nd page. In about 8 hours i finished and was stunned. I can say, that i'm addicted to the story, the charaters, the world of Hunger Games.<br /><br />There are No POV changes in this book. All first person present from Katniss. Which was a little bit weird for me, because i think (if my memory works fine this time...) this was the first story told by first person present i've ever read. But i quickly got used to it.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />I absolutely loved the story of this \\"World\\".<br />How the Hunger Games work. Every little detail, rules, featured events.<br />The characters. Even the minor characters has something in them what makes you can not forget them.<br />There isn't an easy solution for every problem. They have to fight for it. They have to suffer for even a minute rest.<br />Lots of ACTION!! Yes i'm an adrenaline junkie, so bring it on baby!!<br /><br />What i didn't like:<br />There was one thing, i didn't like. Katniss talking about the same thing over and over. And after several times i got tired of it, that i had to read about it AGAIN.<br /><br />OVERALL: I'm so so so happy that i've read this book. This is one book worth reading. I was afraid that the slowness at the beginning will be annoying and exhausting, but no. I really liked the story, so it turned out well. You know my favourite genre is in between the Urban Fantasy and the Paranormal romance, and i think this was the second (i have no idea what was the 1st...) Dystopia book i've read. And i just falling in love with this genre. I'm looking very much forward to read Catching Fire.I really liked the story, so it turned out well.

B002MQYOFW|5|It is a amazing story. Very detailed and has a great storyline. I can't wait to read the next one!
0385340567|1|My father-in-law and I bonded years ago when he introduced me to the genre of action thrillers.  It began when he loaned me a box full of the first 60 or so Remo Williams novels.  I still remember that chapter two of each book began with \\"His name was Remo and . . .\\"<br /><br />Our latest action hero has been Jack Reacher, the creation of British television writer Lee Child.  Reacher (always Reacher in the series, never Jack) is an imaginative hero.  He spent the first thirty-five years or so of his life on military bases.  First, as a child of a soldier and then as a top military policeman.  The hook is that Reacher, as a military policeman, is something like a super-cop.  His targets were trained men, often devious, tough fighters without a moral code.<br /><br />As he aged, he tired of his regimented life, quit the army, and became a wanderer.  Reacher doesn't even have a suitcase.  He wears a set of clothes until it wears out, buys good quality English walking shoes, and carries an ATM card and a folding toothbrush.  He is something of a cross between Dr. Richard Kimble (The Fugitive) and The Incredible Hulk.  Big, tough, strong, and very street smart.  He moves from place to place and gets involved in situations usually requiring his violent intervention.<br /><br />All in all, it has been a highly enjoyable series.  The kind of candy I yearned for while working on my dissertation.  Upon finishing, I gorged on the likes of Reacher.<br /><br />The latest, Nothing to Lose, lost me as a customer.  Lee Child, the author, seems to have REALLY enjoyed the recent works of village atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.  He seems to have enjoyed them so much that he had to come up with a highly improbable plot just to demonstrate how stupid he thinks Christians are.  Oh, and along the way he manages to claim that nothing the American military has done since 1945 has been worth the price of men's lives.<br /><br />But Child's little crusade against conservative protestants and American military efforts of the past sixty years wouldn't have been enough to send me packing if the book weren't so bad.  The villain catches Reacher multiple times and somewhat inexplicably lets him go.  The bad guy has a compound.  Reacher spends the entire novel working his way in and out of the compound as he goes between two towns, Hope and Despair.  On the one hand, the villain has put together an incredibly devious and ingenious plan to help bring about the apocalypse.  On the other, Child (through Reacher) assures us that the villain is a weak-minded man who is accustomed to believing things that comfort him.  It is profoundly boring, which is something I have never been remotely close to saying about any of the other books.  It was literally an act of will for me to continue reading Nothing to Lose.  I was determined to finish because I knew it would likely be the last run for Reacher and me.<br /><br />Now, having finished, I'm sure of it.

B008Q09H64|5|Best movie ever. I have watched it at least 20 times.Can't seem to watch it enough. So glad to see it again.
0316018953|4|I always expect great things from Michael Connelly. His books never seem to disappoint. But as I started The Overlook, a short mystery that originated as as a serial in the New York Times Magasines, I started to think that Connelly wouldn't live up to my expectations this time around. But halfway through, the book becomes a real thrill ride that you won't want to get off of. <br /> <br />I am really tired of authors using 9/11 and terrorists as a topic for myseteries or thrillers. And The Overlook starts as such. A man is killed after having stolen highly radioactive materials from the hospital he works in. His wife has been left at home for dead, tied up naked on her bed. The only suspects are a terrorist group that is suspected to be in the area. The only witness? A Canadian teenager and Madonna stalker who may or may not be reliant. <br /> <br />Not only does he have to find the radioactive stuff before it is used to wipe off Los Angeles, Harry Bosch also wants to find the murderer before the FBI does. His ongoing vendetta against the Feds is put to test in this novel, and soon enough, he comes head to head with his past flame and partner Rachel Walling. Eventually, they will team up again and the good ol' Bosch will come back to the surface.  <br /> <br />Although the book is barely over 200 pages long, you get to learn a lot about Harry and Walling. Teamed with a new partner, Bosch seems a bit tired, bitter and overworked. His hard-headedness and his bad temper comes out in full force in The Overlook and sometimes even prevents him from making the right decisions. I love Bosch for this. He is flawed and real, and every book makes you learn something new about him. He is not like the other characters in serial novels, where you get tired of always reading about the same person and the same events from their past. Bosch is unique in that he always seems new and familiar all at once. <br /> <br />Although I am still waiting for the day when Connelly will write another masterpiece like The Poet, and although I would have liked The Overlook to be a bit more fleshed out and longer, the story served its purpose. It had me on the edge of my seat, and kept me guessing 'til the very end. Connelly has another winner on his hand.
B007SGM084|5|I enjoyed this trilogy so much I read them twice.  Now I'm sending it to a friend to read.  Five stars for this story!
B00C7KYXHW|5|great show with great acting, a well written and thought out story line with plenty of twist to boot<br />WATCH IT.
B00FAPF5U0|5|GREAT
B000AMJG4Y|5|I just bought my copy from JAPANTOWN yesterday(saw the movie from a friend's AVI), and I was LITERALLY BLOWN AWAY!!I've never seen CGI so well done, clean, and the character movements and detail are FLAWLESS! I thought Pixar was good, but SQUARENIX just blew them away!! I do believe they used Motion actors to capture the movements accurately.<br /><br /> I could rave and rave about the quality of the movie, and anyway, most reviewers pretty much covered the plot, so I will get right to the point, BUY IT!! The FINAL FANTASY 7 cast are all here: Bennett, Tifa, Cloud, Valentine, etc. Sephiroth returns to plagued our heroes, in a manner of speaking. Kadaj is the real bad guy. Man, the fight sequences are so well done, the chase scene and the DRAGON is expertly animated. The movie takes place after the video game itself. Every fan of the franchise knows that FINAL FANTASY is the measuring stick for all role-playing games, now this anime feature is the one movie where all Computer generated animated feature may be judged against.<br /><br /> This movie is the true FINAL FANTASY movie, if you're an anime fan or like sci-fi fantasy movies, this is for you! This movie brings back the enjoyment when I played the game in the late 90's. I just wish they made FINAL FANTASY SPIRITS WITHIN in this style. I loved the film so much I bought the action figures based on it. I just need to buy 2 more characters and with this film, my collection is complete!!<br /><br /> Buy this movie, the english subtitles won't even bother you at all. This is a true epic anime masterpiece.

However this CD was a big disappointment ...there was NOTHING NEW,  the meaningless talking before and after some song totally ruined the mood... for the most part the song choices left a lot to be desired...DULL... don't waste your money.... sorry Barbra... :(
B00FAX6XQC|5|This game is great and fun.
B004A8ZWWO|3|\\"Tower Heist\\" (2011) offers few surprises for a caper flick, yet remains a pleasant diversion - coasting on the strength of its comic ensemble and Brett Ratner's slick direction. Eddie Murphy and Matthew Broderick have their best film roles in years while Alan Alda makes a terrific Bernie Madoff-inspired scoundrel. Freewheeling escapism most of the way.
B008Y2VTIS|5|great series

B000784WMW|2|Whilst I agree with previous reviews as to the praiseworthy likeness of this adaption to the original novel, its downfall is the poor technical production with which it was dealt. <br />There are many brilliant productions to come out of the BBC and who can forget the most beautiful ever - Pride and Prejudice. Thus it is by this series that I look to all others produced by the BBC and why I was so disappointed in Jane Eyre. <br />The actors and the script adaption deserved better than the dreadful location, filming and lighting of the scenes. <br />The outdoor takes are about the standard of a home made movie but the indoor ones are worse still. The fluorescent look of the lighting made me feel the whole time that I was standing on the set behind the cameras in the studios of the BBC. It is garish and completely detracts from the story.  <br />Why was so little attended to? Even the costumes of Mr. Rochester's wealthy connections were dull by comparison to the richly created wardrobes for the characters in Pride and Prejudice. Very dull indeed. <br />I donated my own copy of this series on DVD to my local library for it is best served as a teaching aid to students studying the novel.
B00S17FT82|1|I hope someone from Amazon reads this. There are several songs that skip. I am really disappointed and not sure how to fix it.

B001HNE3NO|4|Sarah's Key is a story about the Vel' d' Hiv round-up during World War II.  It is told from two different perspectives; a Polish-Jew child from the World War II era and an American Expatriate living in France; present day.<br /><br />The story is littered with tough decisions; both for Sarah, the young girl, and for Julia, present day expatriate.  These decisions determine the life path of both characters.<br /><br />Sarah in particular is forced to grow up fast; witnessing acts of violence and indifference so heinous, at times I took pause before continuing the story.  Sarah also experiences random acts of kindness from acquaintances and strangers.  Unfortunately, those bright spots are few and far between.<br /><br />Julia also experiences growing pains, but in a different sense.  She becomes her own person while confronting a situation going against her husband's wishes.  She also doggedly pursues the conclusion to Sarah's story.<br /><br />I appreciated the author satisfying my curiosity regarding &#34;the rest of the story.&#34; I also appreciated the finale.  The author brought the main story line to a close and gave just enough detail for the reader to draw his or her own conclusions regarding how Julia’s story ends.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in a story that nicely dovetails two stories, sheds light on a obscured historical event demonstrating the far-reaching authority of Nazi terror, and portraying its main characters not as victims of society, but as proactive and smart women; never giving in and always moving forward.
B000AARKOO|5|I strongly recommend this movie: the cast, special effects and acting are excellent.  The movie has as a background the historical clash between Islam and Christianity that started since the birth of the former and where Christianity was most on the time on the defensive until the Crusades came about.  Hence it is based on historical figures and the portraits of Saladin the Islamic leader, Balian (Orlando Bloom) and Guy de Lusignan are outstanding.The director took some liberties and there are many facts that are not historically accurate e.g. Balian and Sibylla never married. The plot revolves around the dualism between faith and profit, dualism that was the main engine for the crusades. The bad side we all know it because the media wants to continously remind us of the antisemitism of some of the crusades. This movie focus more on the ideals that move Balian, his father and the people who shared their faith: Jerusalem not as a real city but as an ideal place to strive for: the Kingdom of Heaven. This movie is a must for people who like history, epic movies, good acting and of course Orlando Bloom.
B0046B8GEQ|5|This is a great movie that everyone could enjoy. Its wholesome, cute and I bet everyone who watches the movie will love it!
B003TQKVGU|5|Excellant! I liked it so much the minute i finished it i started over. If you like &#34;The Secret&#34; this expands upon the concepts in that book.
B00HEM4T0O|5|what can I say about this book, nt much books can really keep my attention but this one had me right through it
B00008PW2D|5|A short, but sweet season, I love the fun of season 5.<br /><br />Of all the heavy relationships, serious issues, and \\"true life\\" this show tends to embody, season 5 is nice for its frivolity.<br /><br />True it is shorter than any other season, but a savvy shopper can find it for a smaller price (if Amazon ever fails, try a video rental sale when they sell their former rentals)<br /><br />The episodes make you happy to be a girl! \\"Anchors Away\\" is great, soo many boobs, all of them seen by Carrie (And what a great song in the end!).  \\"Unoriginal Sin\\" allows us to see the truly lawyer-ific side of Miranda, and she goes up against the \\"desperate\\" Catholic church, while Carrie must change the name of her column due to lack of activity: --- & the City.  \\"Luck Be an Old Lady\\" is great if only for it being Charlotte's \\"thirty-faux\\" birthday!  \\"Cover Girl\\"  Carrie's head on Madonna's body as a mock up for her book cover, in addition to the \\"taste\\" difference between Carrie and Samantha in their clash over what is sexy makes this episode hilarious and we get the Amy Sedaris and Molly Shannon cameos!  \\"Plus One ...\\" a fun episode complete with Miranda's Freudian moment and Carrie's \\"skinned: date, Samantha.  \\"Critical Condition\\" is a throw away episode ... Samantha and Miranda come to an understanding, Carrie freaks out about what she might have done to Aidan, and Charlotte refuses to take Bunny's harsh treatment \\"lying down.\\" \\"The Big Journey\\" is great, just the beginning alone can be re-watched over and over: \\"I need a man on top of me\\" and the \\"very 'Some Like It Hot'\\" reference is hilarious.  But this episode is all about Carrie, no doubt.  \\"I Love A Charade\\" is a snoozer, but Charlotte steals the show with her new playmate, Harry ... unlikely and very entertaining.<br /><br />But based on what everyone else has been saying maybe only die hard fans should buy it, but everyone who enjoys SATC should see it once!
B000JMKTLO|4|You might think you have a dysfunctional family, but it's nothing like Camille`s.  Camille is a reporter that has gone bad home to bring justice to a town grieving.

Despite being the perfect mother to the perfect daughter,Amma, they both keep secrets.
6305558167|5|Although now a bit dated, this movie continues to impress. The imagery and  cinematography, classic strengths of John Boorman, are spectacular --  ranging from the dark and gory battle of human conflict to the lush beauty  of nature. Added to this rich visual feast is an excellent score of  classical music. This is one of the most nicely shot films you will  experience.<br />Nicol Williamson's portrayal of Merlin was critically  acclaimed, and was my first introduction to this versatile actor. Helen  Mirren gives her usual strong performance. (There is also a short  appearance by Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame, if you care to track those  kinds of things.)<br />The story is full of symbolism of mans' struggle to  balance nature against progress, wrapped up in Arthur's relationship to  &quot;the Land&quot; via Excalibur. While many will find the symbolism and  imagery tiresome (again, manifest in most Boorman films), I found it to  bring depth to the overdone and overplayed Arthurian legend.<br />Warning: the  gore factor is fairly high.
B00ADS98FC|5|Very funny and one of the best &#34;feel good&#34; movies I have seen in a long time. Would recommend to everyone
B0002JJBZE|5|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1400 minutes per box, you are looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is beautiful. Make sure to retain the cardboard holder that it sits into as this helps stability on the shelf (although the box can still stand alone the bottom is a little narrow). The shell cracks open down the centre to reveal a box. Sliding out of the box is a small booklet insert with discs in a well designed plastic holder that flip from disc to disc. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 8 discs in total. However the last disc, disc 8, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 30 episodes. The rest of disc 8 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Several of the shows come with a commentary. All the episodes have been remastered to the point that scratches and artefacts are hardly visible. The special effects have been touched up slightly (no strings), however they still retain an overall early look and feel, especially the initial episodes that have budget restrictions. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season Two, starts to get a budget based on the ratings of TOS Season One. The Enterprise has undergone a new design and looks more than just a hunk of plastic hanging from a string... although not by much. The Bridge looks bigger with more components and consoles. Chekov, who was not in Season One, makes his first appearance here. Season Two has more space shots and attempts are made to film the Enterprise making manoeuvres. Costumes are brushed up a bit, but Kirk's new green sweater might attract some debate. The intro credits have an irritating *ding* sound every few seconds. Both the Green sweater and the *ding* are done away with in Season Three. Apart from a few questionable episodes the series does takeoff in the right direction. There is an instalment with the character Dr. Zefram Cochrane who appears in the movie First Contact. There are themes of rapid aging, furry pets, alien abduction, telepathy, Nazis, advanced computers and time travel. Scotty appears more often than usual. We are introduced into our first space station that looks like pre-deep space nine. The alien costumes are given a sprucing up. In one episode there is a gathering of about twelve various life forms. The big plus side is in the quality of the dialogue between the characters. Spock and Bones go at one another more often. There is tension on deck as well as post-mayhem humour and analysis. At the end of each episode Kirk usually makes a statement to round up the day's affairs. They even crack a joke or two. It is worth it for the episodes \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\" and \\"Patterns of Force\\", along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The main thing you will like about Season Two is the improved interaction between the characters. The camera also pans and dollies more, with lots of handheld making the visuals less static than in Season One. The credits and end credits also undergo a revamp, including titles that appear as the episode starts and ends and not just along with the music. There is lots of experimentation and improvement here that has since stood the test of time. The budget boost was certainly worth it.often.

0743496728|5|although this novel can be disturbing to read if you have children of school age, it is fabulous!  then again, all of her subject matter is edgy and controversial--i guess that's what makes her work so wonderfully enticing.
B005LJK3AC|1|I don't generally rent R-rated movies but thought I would give this one a chance since I was looking for a comedy and generally enjoy the acting of several of the actors in the movie. All that this movie did was make me more committed to not renting R-rated movies! Jennifer Anniston, what were you thinking in taking that roll? Yikes! You're a better comedic actress than this!
B00005JNQQ|5|Don't listen to the lame people saying they thought it was too noisy, or stupid. Personally, I hate how on Amazon, adults, complain how much they despise kid movies. Folks, they're for kids. You're opinion doesn't matter and shouldn't be taken into consideration. This movie is amazing. I am 16, and still considered a kid in most standards, and I thought it was simply mind-boggling. It was funny, heartfelt, and exhilerating. This is the story of Rodney, an inventor, who leaves his beloved parents to go to Robot City to pursue his dreams. There he befriends a delightful cast of miscreants and discovered he must save the greatest robot of all, Big Weld, to save his father and their world. Ewan McGregor and Robin Williams were wonderful as were all the other voice actors. This movie has you laughing every other second. This is the most imaginative movie I've seen in a long while. If you want to inspire your kids to hold onto their dreams and be creative, then this is the movie for you. Believe me, you won't regret spending $7 to spend 90 minutes with Rodney, Fender, and the crew. It's worth every penny.
B006UIUJ2A|1|I picked up this book in the hopes that it would shed more light for me on what life is like in North Korea.  I had already been deeply moved by Blaine Harden's book on North Korea, Escape from Camp 14, and wanted to find in this novel something of the same caliber, at least. I was disappointed to find this book full of unnecessary obscene details such as sexual fantasies, twisted thoughts, and in some parts psychopath-like mentality that reflect the author's own disturbing imagination, rather than the hard reality of life in North Korea. I found the author's embellishments and details tedious rather than insightful.  It lacks the simple facts and details that other books have i.e., \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Victor Frankl.  With its graphic and unnecessary details that take too far whatever research the author made, this book is essentially rubbish.
014144116X|5|I will not summarize the plot of this intricate novel, which is freely available through authoritative sites across the Web.     If you love novels of character and theme, you will love and remember this painstakingly written novel of bigotry and colonialism before Indian independence. The concept which clothes the story: the Caucasian, very proper, very British Miss Quested accuses the Indian, Dr. Aziz, of physical assault in a cave. The facts of the event were literally invisible. The balance of the novel is a clash of cultures, biases and characters, all of which conspire to express \\"reality.\\"    Forster is methodical in way he prepares his readers for the Event and its aftermath.  He writes with the precision of a literary surgeon just as he did in A ROOM WITH A VIEW and HOWARD'S END.    If you'd like explore Forster's writing, this is a fine place to start. Give it a little work and it won't let you down. The author was one of the great masters of the English language and an outspoken adversary of bigotry. Most of us have experienced bias at least once or twice in our lives. For that reason alone, I'd try it.    Forster is also the great exemplar of the modern novel. Few were as consistently aware of form. Few had the ability to infuse raw emotion into such civilized prose.    Go for it.
B004W5T2RG|4|Country Strong is surprising.  I expected a certain amount of cheese because the country music industry can be seriously cheesy, but Country Strong did not deliver.  I was pleasantly surprised by this gritty portrayal of fame and addiction.    Gweneth Paltrow was believable as the broken Kelly Canter, and Garret Hedlund gives a stunning performance as Beau Hutton.  He seemed as if they really had plucked him out of a honkytonk in Nashville.    The writer's could have done a better job developing the story more fully.  I wanted more background into Kelly's fall from grace, and I wanted the character of Chiles Stanton to be fleshed out a bit more.  Overall, though, Country Strong is worth watching.  It celebrates the sorrow that country music used to be about.
B008Y6UNT0|5|Excellent movie! Well worth your time to watch!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I was recently introduced to Season 4, so I had to see the back story .  Watched the whole season in one night.  Amazon was the only place I found it.  I recommend getting amazon prime just for this.  Love it....
B0031R5K72|5|This book was an experience..it taught me to enjoy life without complaints
B00GY0HJ4K|5|It's so cool it's just like flow my mom loves it I can not get her off it  and she can not download it on her phw cause that would be a waste of time cause she's always busy
0446572764|5|It  is a very well written book. The first half of the book on the relationship between the main character and his wife was a chilling reminder of the life behind the iron curtain.  Fear was everything even in marriage.  This part of the book already deserves 5 stars.  One critism is that the locating n solving of the case was too brief.  Otherwise I would not hesitate to give a 5 star.<br />Even with this comment,  it still a very good book.
B0034G4P7Q|4|I thiught this movie would turn out to be about smarmy tech kid spouting off a bunch of technical jargon. It actually has a pretty decent plotline and you grow to hate the lead character - meaning : a fine performance. I liked it.
B001PJRAUS|5|This is a great movie and one that I watch when I need a pick me up! Sure it offers a different endings to the characters of our beloved Jane Austen &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;, but how creative. This movie is the best merge of old and new, and traditional and creative. Jemima Rooper is perfect for the role she plays! She loves that she gets to go back in time, so much so that she chooses to stay. I wish I had that power!
B0009P5YXO|5|My son wanted to get my hubby a sonic screw driver for Christmas because as he said &#34; so dad will stop playing with mine&#34; haha but I wanted it to have some sort of function to it. He loves the pen part espescially the invisable ink he and my son are constantly playing with it. works great
B008BQ8YHQ|5|This well written, intriguing series really grabs you and holds your interest. The casting is great, especially Louis Litt. he is perfectly cast.<br />Sorry that season 3 is not part of Amazon Prime.
B007THA4FI|2|I respect the author’s efforts in exploring a new venue but she may have tried to do too much here.  There are a lot of themes, a lot of characters, and a lot of different social issues.<br /><br />Somehow it just did not work for me.  I never really cared about the characters.  To my eye the story was very fragmented and unappealing.
B00KY7PEAA|5|Very entertaining! So many options within the game. You can enjoy the game even if you choose not to spend real money.
B007PVHANM|1|Dear Sirs,<br /><br />With great regret I have to confirm that even after returning the first copy of Marley that I received (as non-playable!) - I received a replacement Marley DVD that I, again, had to return as unplayable.  I have, before making this order for Marley, very recently updated my dvd player, and all dvd's run very well on my new system - so, the fault is with the actual Marley DVD!!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Toby Gower
B006ON41FC|3|It is o.k. but it is hard to move.<br />I give it a three star because that.<br />Skipping that it is fun.<br />I would give this free app to a 8-12 year old child.<br />If you think you would like it you are right.
B0006AAS5G|4|Good product.
031606792X|5|(daughter of user)  Well, first off, I am so happy that the book ended on a high note in Bella's \\"existence\\". This book was very different from the others, but that was a good thing. Stephenie Meyer couldn't just write the same book with a new enemy each time, so it was clear that change would come. At first, I was very unhappy with the fact that the whole middle of the story was from Jacob's point-of-view. It was harder for me, as a girl, to connect with him than it was for me to connect with Bella's emotions and thoughts. However, Jacob finally grew on me, and I can say that I love him as a character now too. I absolutely loved the beginning of the book, but when we hit chapter 7 of book 1, I started to get a little panicky. *SPOILER ALERT!!!* How could it be possible that Bella and Edward could have kids, all of a sudden? SM had denied that he was able, so what gives? I hated the idea, with Bella being so immature, and then she got all excited about the kid, and it seemed a teensy bit irrational to me that she just out of nowhere wants kids now. I totally agreed with Jacob and Edward, who wanted it gone. And then we met little Renesmee, and how could you then not like her? I felt a little weird about Jacob imprinting on her, but at least now he has a purpose. And yes, the moment we've been waiting for arrives! Bella turns into a vampire and beats Emmett at arm wrestling! Well, anyways...I'm so happy that Bella ended up with Edward forever, because that's what I've been hoping for throughout the series, and I'm also glad that the Volturi never got to fight them. To lose any of the Forks/La Push clan would be a great loss. It's just too bad this is the final book in the saga. I'll miss Bella and, especially Edward, so much. Keep up the good work, Stephenie Meyer!
B0002B15XI|5|This is the third best army movie. The first best is Catch 22. the second best is Kelly's Heroes.<br />Thank God they didn't use John Wayne in any of them.
B00DZ83IPS|4|Good movie.  Violence but very little bad language. Something you can watch and not be asulted with.
B0041KKYCY|5|I have liked a good revenge movie since Charles Bronson did some house cleaning in Death Wish. The victimization has to be brutal and over-the-top to warrant the revenge at hand. No one on earth deserves Sarah's brutality and degradation, thus the sickos could not deserve their come-uppance more. I believe the punishment should fit the crime..and Sarah's character does a fine, yet preposterous job.It doesn't take the victims' suffering away, but she assures they won't do this to anyone else. Revenge,anyone?  This fills the bill.Good acting,too, and loved the special featurette, especially talking with the bad guys and some of the difficulty in making this work, even tho it deals with a horrible, yet all to real, situation.
B003NHRIVQ|5|The movie arrived on time and in very good condition. We popped the movie in and watched it and it was in very good condition. Will buy again should the chance arise.
B004DI7HZ6|5|So entertaining! Author has such a clear direction and kept me hooked. I'm already onto the next book and hooked there too.
B00005NP04|5|Martina McBride is the most amazing singer alive.  Just listen to her belt out songs like &quot;Broken Wing&quot; and &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; and you'll be hooked.  Her vocal performances in concert are nothing short of astounding.  If you like the songs on CD, you MUST see her live.  Words can't describe how incredible she is.
B00RJXKUSS|2|We have a brand new Samsung disk player, and I find a lot of variety in how it deals with various DVD's and blu-ray disks.  The Breakfast Club blu-ray is the worst blu-ray disk I've ever played.  To begin with, everything is slower than molasses; slow enough where you start pressing buttons on the remote hoping to speed it up.  The disk player itself makes more bizarre sounds while trying to process this disk than any before it.  If you stop the disk after you start the movie, it goes right back to the very beginning of the whole process - if you pause it too long, it goes back to the very beginning as well.  I have blu-ray disks that ask me if I want to continue watching from three months ago, so I know this disk is different.  If you actually get to the movie, and don't mind watching it from beginning to end with no bathroom breaks or trips to the kitchen, you'll be fine.  And, the Dolby 5.1 sound track sounds marvelous, after only seeing this movie on TV.
0062515675|4|Since I mentioned Robin Sharma and \\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\\" in my latest video on my website (August 2011), people have asked me about his book. It was one of the first books that I read and recognized as spiritual fiction. The subtitle of this book is \\" a fable about fulfilling your dreams and reaching your destiny\\", and it truly is a fable and totally fictional. Initially when I read it I thought it was a true story until some of the things that happened to the lawyer Julian just seemed impossible to believe. I was really in the infancy of my spirituality at the time, however this story did get me hooked.<br /><br />This fable is about a very successful lawyer named Julian Mantle who is stricken by a massive heart attack in the middle of a packed courtroom. One of his proteges, John, is there to witness the big man crumple to the ground, and the story progresses from there. The author provides you with a detailed background of the circumstances leading up to Julian's heart attack, and you are then fast-forwarded to Julian's return after several years of being away from the rat race.<br /><br />Not only does Julian survive the heart attack, he quits the law firm, sells all of his possessions (including his red Ferrarai) and travels to India on an \\"expedition\\" to become a monk. This explains the title of the book. When he returns he visits John and meets with him several times to explain his \\"transformation\\" and to explain the lessons that he has learned.<br /><br />When Julian returns, he is virtually unrecognizable to John. He is lean, tanned and calm. In fact the only evidence left of the man that he once was is a scar on his chest from the surgery he had as a result of his heart attack. Over the course of several meetings, Julian explains how he was transformed by a meeting with the \\"Sages of Sivanna\\". These \\"Sages\\" teach Julian many things and show him that life is much more than material wealth and possessions.<br /><br />This is a spiritual fiction book and I have found it very easy to read and to keep interested in (I have read it four times). One of the things that I found unique (for it's time) was that it also includes an \\"Action Summary\\" and \\"Julian's Wisdom In a Nutshell\\" at the end of every chapter that has provided you with one of the \\"7 Timeless Virtues of Enlightened Living\\".  Many books today include a reader's study guide or group discussion outlines, however this was one of the first books I had encountered that did this in a fiction book.<br /><br />Written in 1997, this book is just as relevant today as it was then. With all the hype about \\"The Secret\\" and the fiction book \\"The Shack\\", Mr. Sharma brought all of the lessons that they have been teaching into his book at least ten years before they became popular. I would recommend that you read this book, particularly if you have read similar books and you will see that learning life lessons can be enjoyable when combined with an interesting story. I also recommend \\"Life Lessons From The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\\" and I deem it essential to own and KEEP \\"Who Will Cry When You Die\\", both by Robin Sharma. His latest book \\"The Leader Who Had No title\\" has a good message, however I was put off by the poor editing.<br /><br />Please contact me if you have any questions or comments - I would love to hear from you.<br /><br />Laughter and love,<br /><br />Rick Fessto read and to keep interested in (I have read it four times).

B00EMXBDMA|4|I found this book very interesting although quite different.  I think many women would find it a difficult read.
B005S9EK5Y|5|I love the renowned and marvelous stage play \\"Les Miserables.\\" I have seen it six times. It was great that the stage play was made into a movie. I also love the movie version. When the Bishop of Digne told the French Police authorities that Jean Valjean did not steal the silver, that he gave them to him, and told Jean Valjean that he forgot the candlestick and left the best behind, Jean Valjean turned his life around.  The depth of the kindness of the Bishop of Digne inspired him to be a better person. He began a new life.  His conversion was powerful and moving.<br /><br />The actors and actresses in the movie \\"Les Miserables\\" played their  roles in an outstanding manner.  They portrayed the characters of the story convincingly.  Hugh Jackman was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Jean Valjean.  His voice was powerful, and his acting was superb and phenomenal! Anne Hathaway won the OSCAR Award for Best Supporting Actress playing the role of Fantine. She was remarkable in her role as Fantine.  Russell Crowe was super in his role as Inspector Javert.  And I love Amanda Seyfried's portrayal of Cosette.  Her voice was ethereal and absolutely delightful. The score of the movie is splendid and grand. The songs have gorgeous melodies.  The scenes in the movie are fantastic and breathtaking.  Amazing story!  I love the final words at the end of the movie, \\"TO LOVE ANOTHER PERSON IS TO SEE THE FACE OF GOD.\\"  There is a lot of wisdom in this movie that you can learn and use in your daily life whoever you are.<br /><br />Don't miss this sublime and awesome movie!  Everybody should see the movie \\"Les Miserables.\\" Go buy the Blu-ray or DVD. The production is lavish, and it is spectacular.  Above all, this movie is grace-filled, spellbinding, and inspiring. You will be so happy you did!<br /><br />By Ofelia D. W.
B004DLPXAO|5|Downloaded this for use on a (really cheap) Coby tablet. Had a bit of a problem installing it, but that was due to Coby not directly accessing Amazon. Found the information need to complete the install through Amazon's site however. (Thank you Amazon) I've been using this app for sometime on a couple different Android phones for books purchased from Amazon, as well a many books from my local public Libraries. Yes that's plural as I use two local libraries (County and City), and have learned that while there is a great deal of overlap, I can often find books in one, that the other doesn't have. I especially like the ability to sync locations when switching from phone to tablet or back.
B003XF1XOQ|4|I liked this book because it had a lot of action in it.<br /><br />I recommend this book to teenagers who like action books.
0062315005|5|great book<br />enjoyed reading very much
B00J2PEZAU|3|It wasn't mind blowing but it was nostalgic. Liked the music and fashion.  The acting was good by all of them
B00C0OGRCO|1|Got it and it was in Spanish. Returned it and got not even 50% of my payment back. Not happy...
B00GINENG0|5|This is a great app to play especially for children. I love to play this game.

0446672653|5|Couldn't put the book down... Once you start.. You gotta finish it... Great book, opened up a whole new perspective for me... If you are interested in reincarnation, and soulmates, you should grab... there's not an easier book to read..
B0096BIENY|5|excellant item and arrived well and before time.  These tenors are really great and always enjoy the sound.  Wish they were all in english but still love it.
B0017TFLBQ|4|Not a great game, but the product was good and works as advertised. I would buy again from this retailer.
B00H8XF9I0|1|Unbelievable, really. Check the promo on this box. Cleverly, it isn't stated directly, that these are the original Capitol mixes, because they aren't. This is a Frankenstein - original US packaging and by in large, the British mixes. Forget the ongoing debate about Capitol &#34;butchering&#34; the original British releases, what's correct or what sounds the best - that's another discussion. This product has simply been misrepresented...period. For the fans who want the original Capitol albums, meaning the packages AND the music, this is infuriating. Hey, why not reissue all the original British albums, but with American Capitol mixes?  How might that go over? One has to wonder who at Capitol is behind the curtain and why this set was presented so deceitfully. If it had been marketed as &#34;US packaging and sequencing with British mixes&#34; then it would've been, although still an arguably absurd product, at least honest. The &#34;Capitol Albums&#34; boxes released in 2004 were correct, although entire lps like &#34;Yesterday and Today&#34; were inexplicably omitted. This had hoped to be that 2004 release, but fully realized. Capitol should be held accountable and this fraudulent product recalled.
B000051Y0G|5|This is almost a greatest hits album in and of itself. Pretty much all the songs are great pop rock songs, a complete album of good stuff. I've generally gravitated to country/western roots rock music over the years, but I still enjoy this pure fun pop music from Cyndi from when I was a kid. (Shhh don't tell anyone!). Seriously Cyndi does a great job here and it holds up well over time.
B00ACP3OOM|2|I like the overall design but this product just doesn't last. I have had several Finis SWIMP3 devices over the years and you can guarantee the wires will break between the MP3 and the (ear) cheek pads. This product is good for only one year, one and a half years at the very best. If you don't mind spending $120 every year for a new SWIMP3 then you will like this product.<br /><br />NOTE TO FINIS: Upgrade the design and allow for replacing the wires - there is going to be stress on the wires as swimmers put on and take off goggles. Be smart and anticipate this, design the product so that the wires can be easily replaced and send the product with an extra pair of wires - this isn't rocket science. Then again, engineered obsolescence is always a possibility....
B003UN590U|5|Fav Anthrax Album.  On white vinyl.  Vinyl is clean (no ticks, pops) and quiet.  It is still a s***ty recording...production just was not that great on early A albums.  Still better than the CD version....still not dimensional but not as bright i.e. better tonality.

B0047Y0FGY|5|A witty, quick read that's hard to put down.  It's always interesting to read the backstory that makes you like the author even more than before.
1401937519|5|The most inspiring book I have ever read.  Go out and enjoy life.  Think about what you want, but don't forget to enjoy the moment.<br />Stop worrying and start living and love every minute doing it.  That's what we should be doing and that's what this book is all about, the consequences of living our western ways verses living the way we were intended.
B00005JKPF|5|Okay..I'm sure I'm not the only one who emerged from the theatres after seeing the original 'X-Men' and immediately said,<br />\\"Bring on X-Men 2!!!\\" 3 years pass..we hear the rumors, we see the very few set pictures published in magazines, and we ultimately wonder just how better it's gonna be...<br />Well, friends..lemme tell ya..it's absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, AWESOME in every sense of the word! I saw 'X2' 3 times in its theatrical run and it all I can say is I was in Marvel heaven. Being a lifelong fan of the X-Men, I was not at all disappointed. I don't think there are a lot of people who were..what does that tell ya? :)<br />One thing about 'X2' that makes it far better than its predecessor is the fact that all characters and their mutant powers were already introduced and explained in the first movie. So that just opened the door for our favorite superheroes to let loose, kick butt, and take names. The story is deeper and darker and there are many themes that run through the movie that hit close to home.<br />There are subplots that are intrinsically (and perfectly) weaved into the film that provide the audience with loads of entertainment. There isn't a bland moment in all of the film. The opening action sequence with Nighcrawler in the White House is a damn good way to get you engaged and wanting more of that kind of action.<br />The acting was great! They all seemed to have been enjoying themselves (hey..gimme a chance to play a superhero and I'd be jazzed too!). As far as the coveted 'scene-stealing award', I would have to say that it's Wolverine's title.<br />Nightcrawler was definitely the break-out character, but Wolverine was just FAN-DOUBLE-TASTIC!!! We see him on many different levels: first as the loner who continues his search to find out who and why he is what he is, then we see a rather soft side of him as his feelings for Jean Grey begin to grow, and finally as the feral clawed Weapon X primally screaming down the halls of the X-Mansion and cutting loose with his trademark beserker rage. I absolutely LOVED watching Wolverine. My favorite comic character proving to all that he's the best there is. I don't want to give the rest away because that's the best part. Oh..and a little note to Hugh Jackman: Dude..you were BORN for Wolverine!!<br />Just trust me when I say that X2 is definitely worth every penny you spend on a ticket. Some even argue that this is the best comic-book adaptation ever. Well, hey..it got my vote.<br />Now I'm left saying over and over much like before...<br />BRING ON X3!!! :)nsion and cutting loose with his trademark beserker rage.

B003P2WO5E|5|Great read
0345803485|4|You know, it's a trashy novel folks. It's always about some chick whose never had sex, the guy she meets is always rich and there unfolds the story. It's nothing new. But this has been so much fun to read with my husband. Yes, we read it together at night when the kids are in bed. It's a fun way to unwind and spend some time laughing and talking about the book , characters and what not ;). It's what you make of it. It does sound cheeky in many parts but again, it's a cheeky trashy novel. You read the whole book so It couldn't have been that bad other wise you would have put the book down the minute you got bored or irritated and been done. I've been married for 17 years and this has definitely been the most fun I've had reading with my husband!!

B00BD99JMW|5|Amazing but ripped my soul out. I love the Divergent series but the end of Allegiant killed me. No more spoilers from me. Just get the book. It's still really good even though I am grieving.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I love hidden object games and this has that and more. It's a challenge finding objects and being able to open new location. The only issue I have is how long it takes to replenish your energy. It'd be nice to be able to play however long you want, without having to wait to restore energy

B007NYODBS|3|Roman Polanski has gathered a brilliant cast, with a terrific concept, and yet produced what I think is probably one of his lesser films.. simultaneously feeling somewhat long (at only 79 minutes!) and yet not long enough to reach a more biting, effective and satisfying conclusion.<br />The movie takes place in one room, as two couples (from apparently reasonably wealthy backgrounds) meet to discuss an altercation between their sons, which resulted in missing teeth for one of them, after being hit in the face with a stick by the other.  It all starts with a great show of civility, as they each go to great lengths to remind each other that they are above such petty squabbles and as adults can reach a conclusion amicably.  However as time goes on (in real time) the restraint and cloak of civility worn by the characters slips away, and by the end we see the real gap between what they would like to be seen as, and what actually lies beneath.  The turning point comes half way through when the stress (or the cobbler..?) causes one to throw up, and this acts as a catalyst for the underlying true selves to be seen, almost as if the repression had the cork removed.<br />It is actually a wonderful concept, at least for those that like their `action' purely drive by people talking in a room.  However, although this was always going to be tough to make into a film, it's disappointing that Polanski has somehow accentuated the staginess of the play, rather than made the situation any more natural or at least cinematic.  This does distance you somewhat from the events taking place.  On the other hand, the performances from Winslet, Foster, Reilly and Waltz are all excellent.  They appear to be having a ball, getting their teeth into a role which allows the full range of emotion in a short space of time, perhaps too much so in some cases as they let their acting tics start to show and flag the characters coming development.  In the hands of these great actors though, we relish watching as the relationships develop from 4 people trying to agree, to two couples facing off against each other, disintegrating as alliances form and then fall apart between the various characters (with the aid of whisky and cigars), until each stands apart.<br />So although stagey, its meticulously put together and well acted.  Why only 3 stars? - because the sum of its parts, what it adds up to, is somehow at the end of the movie not quite enough to resonate as much as it could or should have, failing to surprise in a way which would have left its mark in the same way as, for example, [[ASIN:B0001P044Q An Inspector Calls [Region 2]]], or [[ASIN:B000I2JDEY Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].

1938895274|5|This book is really good and deserves all the praise it's getting. A well researched book that is easy to understand and written in a conversational tone. For me, the most valuable and unexpected piece was on dieting. I have a whole new understanding of how to eat in a way that you are 1) never hungry 2) eating foods that you like and 3) losing or gaining weight (depending on what you want). It's truly a Have Your Cake and Eat It Too approach that works.

This movie in particular was pretty great because the messages of family, love, and that challenging the system is ok and necessary for progress to occur were all present. Music and animation, as to be expected, were wonderful. I have rented the movie 2 or 3 times now (not available on Netflix like some of the older movies are), and will probably be purchasing it next time the kiddos (or I) get the urge to watch the &#34;fairies and the snow&#34; movie.
B00005AWMF|4|Different music supports different moods.  This CD is perfect for the night on a porch with a glass of wine.  It's not intrusive and very mellow in the background.  I love her voice and delivery.  I listen to this in the shower in the morning or after a hard day at work.  Enjoy.

B00007BH5C|5|This is the second soundtrack to the mega-successful box office hit, The Lord Of The Rings. Howard Shore managed to handle this heavy task and transform it into an a amazing work of perfection.  <br /> <br />There are more new themes introduced in this soundtrack. Rohan's theme is calm, soothing (with the string instrument) and grand at times (the horns). It really created the identity of the city. It is one of my favorite themes, second only to the Elves themes. I absolutely loved the opening anthem Foundations Of Stone, with the disturbing sounds of the choir (if you can recall its the part when Gandalf fought with the Balrog of Morgoth). The songs are not in the order in the film but its a great opus. The mood and emotions of the film are expressed perfectly and its unbelievable how the music flows in the film. <br /> <br />As I mentioned in my ROTK review, I loved music for the Elf kind. Evenstar is very emotional and it moved me so much! Arwen's grief is portrayed beautifully. See how the music connects alot with the film! Music of Gandalf (The White Rider, Forth Eorlingas) is magical and enchanting. Ben Del Maestro is a beautiful vocalist. My other favorites would have to be The Hornburg, The King Of The Golden Hall, Helms Deep and Riders Of Rohan. The fierce anthems (Isengard Unleashed) fits well with the film. Gollum's Song is very haunting but its majestic at the same time. <br /> <br />You need to watch the film and listen many times to the cd to really appreciate it. Howard Shore is an amazing composer, made him a well-known composer. I don't understand why this soundtrack wasn't even nominated for Best Score in the Oscars. But it won a Grammy, so it shows!
0061020680|4|As he writes, Pratchett is getting better.  This is a pretty good book.  Death is always comical - it's hard not be when you always have to speak in uppercase letters.  Mort is a decent character, and his adventures in Sto Lat and Sto Helit are very funny. I really liked the young wizard Cutwell, too.  He was a riot.  Now we know that Death can sometimes bend the rules a bit.
1400063515|1|I picked up this book thinking that the premise was interesting.  Sadly this book is horrific.   The author is encumbered with an unchecked ego and his sense of superiority drips disdain on his readers and the rest of the world.     He decries editors, yet could have used a good one.     The book is rambling, poorly organized and his points aren't that interesting. One of his main arguments uses the story of an author whose unconventional book becomes a best seller only to have the sequel flop. This is complete fiction though--there is little to no real science in this book, just the ramblings of an egomaniac. His main points are neither new nor particularly exciting. This book seems just to have been written to show off how smart he thinks he is.     Overall it would be mildly interesting if he didn't write so poorly, but alas there is little to be gained from this book other than frustration and the loss of a few hours of your life.
B0090SI3EI|5|Awesome
B005ZOBNOI|5|I don't usually write reviews but here goes.<br /><br />This book wrapped me in from beginning.  I laughed out loud while falling in love with Hazel and Augustus' story ( that kiss in Anne Frank's house... OMG!!).  I truly loved Green's blunt sarcastic humor.  And of course I wept and wept and wept.<br /><br />Immediately starting to reread once done with this review.
B001EOQWF8|5|My girlfriend actually told me to watch this movie because she was so surprised that me, being a hopeless romantic and cutesy fanatic, haven't seen this movie yet. I thought this movie was adorable. There's not much talking, but there is a great lesson taught and the overall movie is very heartwarming. I love it and would greatly recommend this movie.
B00499NHLC|3|Should have known it wouldn't live up to the hype.  Heard so many people raving, but it really just didn't work for me.  Not a fan of the Watson character in this and stealing Jimmy Neutrons brain blast for ideas really took me out of the show.  Still worth a look if you like Brit TV.
B000BYA4JM|5|A very fun romp!  Madonna's best movie.  Outstanding for a rainy day.  A brilliant example of our times' mad cap comedy.
0517548232|4|Of the positive reveiews, they seem to be amazed that someone can define economics.  It's not really rocket science, and, in an age of plenty, it's not really about scarcity.  It's about individuals making choices to maximize value.  They may be bad choices, uniformed choices or perverse choices, but they have, in the final analysis, impact limited to the individual.  And in most cases result in some level of increased individual satisfaction.<BR>The real danger, according to Hazlitt, is when the choices of a few people, with same kinds of fallacies noted above, are coercive, enforced by government or monopolies.  Which leads us to to the negative reviews.<BR>The negatives, if we can be allowed to throw out the obvious loser rants, seem to be concerned mainly with rapacious corporations, free trade among inequal countries and natural monopolies.  While these are certainly provide distortions of individual choice and informed consent, they do in the long run tend to be self correcting -- see government-sanctioned coal and oil monopolies.  The real interest is in how to minimize the effects of these diseconomies.<BR>Hazlitt would argue that they are self-correcting via the collective effect of individual choices.  The Marxists would argue that action based upon the sceeding of individual choice to a collective power is the solution.  Surely, if we can assume there is no absolute, theoretical winner in this debate, we can look to the real world, based upon the actions of multiple forms of government and millions of individuals to provide some guidance on which path leads to the most for the most.<BR>To that end, I would challenge you to read Hazlitt's book and a Marxist equivalent like Ivan Ilich's &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and then, accepting both as plausibly complete and material, match them against your experience of recent history and your hopes for your personal future.
0394720288|5|Great book.
B006LSZECO|4|I don't like to reach the end feeling that I wish both protagonists got their just rewards.  I feel duped.  Nice exerise in writing.

B000PC6A3E|5|Graet Movie.
B00N0YUU94|5|Worth every penny !
B00005OAIE|5|This CD has to be - bar none- one of the best CD's I've heard in a long, long time. John Mayer has a deep, smokey, soulful voice that reminds me of Dave Matthews ( without that annoying whine), and his music is truly fabulous. The more you listen to this disc, the better it sounds. It is as suitable for your workday  as it is for your weekend relaxation.  Every song is one that -at one time or another in the course of your day, will find it's way into your head. . . and never leave you alone! The music and lyrics mix and mesh perfectly, and when you put that with that sleepy, sexy 'bedroom voice' - you can't help but come up with a winner. I look forward to hearing a great deal from him in the future, and hope that Mr. Mayer has some concert dates set for summer'02. I'd bet he's awesome live on stage. Get this CD. You won't be sorry!
B00HV8T1WC|5|EXcellent, keeps you at the bottom of your seat.

B00CAYHVKQ|5|Most of us have the following problem; we read the bad reviews First!! I read a couple bad reviews (The Kindle version), before I started reading this book I was skeptical about it, but something inside told me, \\"do not pay attention to negative people\\". So I chose to read it for myself!!<br />On the Nine Do it yourself energy experiment, I said to myself let me ask for something simple (it's funny that we think that the universe has simple and complicated things).  The book says ask for something that if happen on the next 48 hours it was because you created it, I said, Ok something simple!! I want a quarter that was manufacture in 1996.  If I get it I will know that I created the event, Perfect!!! After 1 hour, I asked one of my co-workers for a quarter to see if this is really true!! Imagine what happened? No, the quarter was not manufacture in 1996. However I was Ok with the quarter she gave me! I said fine and forgot about it, then that night something inside me said \\"asks my wife to see if she has a quarter!!!\\" I asked my wife for the quarter, she gave it to me.  It blew my mind that the quarter my wife gave me was a 1996 quarter. I said WTF!! This is creepy!! To make the story short 6 of the 9 things happen, in 3 days, this is Crazy! I'm waiting for the other 3 things, knowing that it will happen! I will say Good luck with your wishes!! But Remember: \\"Whether you believe you can do things or not, you are right\\". Henry Ford

B0000TB01Y|5|My kids took me to this musical and I so enjoyed everything about it.  I just love this fabulous CD.
B00G5G7K7O|5|Probably of of the best movies Disney has produced in awhile. This ones a keeper for sure. My girls are Frozen crazy and I have feeling that we will have to replace the blueray because they will have worn it out. I could pretty much repeat this movie verbatim at this point. I have even seen a lot of boys who like this movie. Great choice for the kids. Good clean fun and even humor or the adults!!
B00ECU2SGS|3|Great acting and all but this is one of those movies with numerous stories going on with numerous characters.  So much so that it is hard to say what the movie is really about.  Plot is weak at pulling all the characters together.  Not a movie you would watch again
B00B5FBQTS|5|Nice very nice lol
0385495315|5|Singh traces the history of code and cipher making and breaking history.  There has always been a struggle between those making codes and those braking codes, with implications for the people, businesses, and  governments of the time.  For example, we currently live in an era in which  there are essentially unbreakable ciphers available, which allows for  internet commerce, and companies like Amazon.com to exist.  As Singh traces  this struggle between code makers and code breakers, you will learn the  basic elements of cryptography in a non-threatening (for non-mathmeticians)  fashion.
B00J9APGGA|4|The Maleficent doll needs the Aurora doll to be best appreciated,  We purchased both at the same time. While Aurora is part of playtime without Maleficent, the only time that the Maleficent doll is brought out is with Aurora.  The Maleficent costume is well made and very true to the film.

006117758X|5|If you don't get it, you won't get it. If you read the book through the lens of any particular school of criticism, your biases will ruin your experience. HoR is one of the greatest American novels ever; unfortunately prudish and narrow-minded critics frequently read it possessed of confirmation bias. Readers tend to miss the very deep and expertly crafted parallels that make this novel so utterly remarkable.
B004MC8CA2|4|very easy to use and reliable app.  it would be great if maps and illustrations and references links were available.
B00005AQE8|5|I have owned this cd many times. It disappears from my house many times also, but that's ok. If more folks get exposed to Pac they would see that he truly transcended rap and hip-hop. Very few of the tracks on both cd's would be classified as filler tracks. One of the greatest albums of all times- any genre. I won't say anything about the music itself because I would be selling the album short. Please get THIS album and listen to it through and through for yourself if you never have. I'll be anxiously awaiting your reviews afterward. TUPAC SURVIVES!!!!!!!!
B00GRVV29E|5|I am not one who usually rates an app.  I read what the rest of you have to say and then make if not an educated decision then at least a better informed decision.  Yesterday my sister was diagnosed with cancer, and I will be going to treatments with her.  I can not wait to give her this app to relax with, and hopefully take her mind from what is happening, if only for a little while.  It is wonderfully relaxing and distracting.  Easy to use without too much to think about to change it up.  Thank You
B00DPKQ60A|4|Ariana's voice is truly amazing. She just has pure talent, plain and simple, and overall I'm really into her.<br />The only reason her cd gets 4 stars and not 5 is because, well, the actual songs could have been A LOT better.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are a good number of GREAT songs on here; probably about half. However the other half, although her voice still shines, are just not songs that I feel like anyone would like. It's kind of like a genre of music that absolutely NO ONE is into. Here's how I rated the songs:<br /><br />*Honeymoon Avenue - one of my favorites. Love this one! 5/5<br />Baby I - this song had to grow on me, but overall I like it. Her voice shines. But it's definitely one of those songs that won't appeal to many people. 4/5<br />Right There - could have been a lot better. I like the Big Sean feature, and I do like the song overall...it's just kind of slow and the beat is a little boring. 3.5/5<br />Tattooed Heart - definitely a highlight of the album. Her voice is just phenomenal here. But again - it sounds very 60's, and even though I like it, I'm not sure a lot of other people would feel the same. 4.5/5<br />Lovin' It - I skip this song a lot. The chorus is catchy, but idk, I'm just not really into this one. 3.5/5<br />Piano - mixed feelings on this song. It can sound really corny at times, but really great at others. 3.5/5<br />Daydreamin' - feel the same way about this song as I do the previous song. 3.5/5<br />The Way - loved this song from when it first came out! Definitely the right choice to release as her single. 5/5<br />You'll Never Know - this song is very &#34;Mariah&#34;...as in it has great vocals, but the song itself is kind of crappy =( 3/5<br />*Almost Is Never Enough - this song & Honeymoon Ave are definitely my favorites! Flawless song; voice songs amazing over the piano. 5/5<br />Popular Song - another song that leaves me with mixed feelings. It's catchy and kinda cute I guess but really just corny overall. 3.5/5<br />Better Left Unsaid - after listening to this one a few times, I always skip it now! It's really sad, this could have been a GREAT song...the lyrics are so on point, and her voice (as always) sounds phenom. But the &#34;if you wanna party&#34; part of the song completely ruins everything. It doesn't fit and doesn't even sound good at all =( 3/5Better Left Unsaid - after listening to this one a few times, I always skip it now!

B004GUSG4M|5|It is rare that I chose to read a suspense thriller type book, and I probably wouldn't have chosen to read this book had it not been one of the books selected by the book club I'm in. Can't say how glad I am that it made the list! I was instantly sucked into the book right from the start and could not put it down I finished it in one day.I would definitely recommend this book!
B00HUCF6KK|3|Nobody seems to want the middle ground on this one, so, having watched the series on HBO, I'll try to stake it out:<br /><br />First of all, yes, the acting was great--especially McConaughey--but the lead performances were weakened for me by the fact that neither main actor looks 17 years younger in the flashback scenes than in the \\"present day\\" scenes. In fact I thought McConaughey looked younger in the \\"present\\" than in the \\"past.\\" And Michelle Monaghan doesn't seem to age one single day by the final episode--presumably because, however she ends up at the end of this one is how she'll have to appear throughout Season Two, and Season Three if there is one.<br /><br />As far as the \\"violence against women\\" complaints, True Detective is guilty of them--and guilty also of violence toward men, since all the \\"bad guys\\" in Season One are either drug-crazed bikers, wacked evangelists, or African American drug dealers. The episode in which the drug dealers appear is so very violent that I supposed (incorrectly) that it had been written by a different writer and directed by a different director. I can't imagine why that episode was added to the mix, except as a bid to try to pull in a wider audience by pandering to the lowest common denominator. The series as a whole is rather slow-paced,atmospheric, almost poetic at times; and the characters tend to be introspective; and there are long, well-written conversations throughout. Since nothing happens in the bikers-versus-drug-dealers episode that couldn't have been handled by a more subtle plot twist, that violence is absolutely gratuitous. That episode didn't need to be there, so it shouldn't have been.<br /><br />The best elements of Season One are its overall creepiness and the sustained dramatic tension: these kept me waiting for each new installment--but the ending to Season One was a big disappointment, so I wouldn't watch these episodes again or buy them on disc. The plot, in the end, remains inexplicable--unless you find \\"some totally evil form of bizarre insanity\\" satisfying and plausible. The opening gambit--a nude body found arranged in a creepy tableau--is never explained by anything other than this same \\"evil insanity,\\" and that means the nudity of that first corpse is also entirely gratuitous. Finally, most of the actual detective work in this story gets accomplished during the hiatus between the flashbacks and the present day--in other words, all of the \\"true detecting\\" takes place off camera--which is thoroughly disappointing to a viewer who expects an air-tight mystery. In short, this is not a series for the mystery lover; it's also not for the squeamish or prudish; and it's not for those who want a thoughtfully crafted plot. It does have some female nudity and some guns, and a passel of wacko rednecks--but those who like this series for these latter elements will probably not appreciate its slow pacing and all of the dialogue. I'd assume this series will have to pick either one audience or the other for its next season: either become more blatantly and senselessly violent and titillating, or else settle down to be more subtle and more intellectual.<br /><br />Anybody willing to bet they don't choose the former?
B002QE3CTY|5|The Maze Runner kept me guessing the entire time. An original universe in the seemingly overcrowded young-adult, dystopian post apocalypse genre with relatable characters and a interesting climax. I can't wait to read the next book.
B003EI2EH2|1|I was fooled by some of the earlier 5 * reviews and I unfortunatly waisted money to buy the book. This is one of the worst investment I ever made, the book is full of inconsistencies and has no substance, don`t be fool by the initial good reviews these were probably written and posted by the book author and were part of a well orchestrated marketing campaign.
B0076DCT2G|5|Nelson DeMille uses John Corey's humor to bring a book about a country and terrorism an interesting read. I thoroughly enjoyed it as I always do and have read all of his books, except the most recent, Radiant Angel. That will be read soon!<br />I am a big fan of Mr. DeMille and always look forward to reading his novels.

0380730405|5|Rebecca de Winter.<br /><br />Manderley.<br /><br />Mrs. Danvers.<br /><br />These names will live in literary infamy.<br /><br />So easily was I sucked into the deep and mesmerizing world of Rebecca's, the one she left behind before her death. The one that continues revolving without her -- yet always with her.<br /><br />The story, in fact, is not about Rebecca at all -- yet it is consumed with the enigma of her. The story, in fact, is about a lady's maid residing in Monto Carlo, who is swept off her feet by one Maxim de Winter, swiftly becoming his second wife. And at that point, the new (and now rich) Mrs. de Winter's problems ensue. As she begins to settle into her husband's beautiful English estate, the one called Manderley, she soon realizes that she does not truly retain her husband's attention, manage the household staff, or even receive due favor from the house pets. They all still cling to Rebecca and her remarkable ways.<br /><br />All along, the absence of Rebecca haunts the new Mrs. de Winter. Clues to the previous Mrs. de Winter's life exist all around Manderley -- such as in Maxim's thoughts and in the devious housekeeper's actions. It seems that the young bride cannot escape the mortality of the woman who preceded her place. Rebecca casts shadows upon each of the new Mrs. Maxim de Winter's steps.<br /><br />My thoughts? In short, 'Rebecca' is fascinating. It kept me held in place, waiting with baited breath to see how this story could possibly turn out -- especially in a satisfactory way. Does it end well? How can it?<br /><br />I think one day I shall have to re-read this vintage classic. Not just to relish again in the labyrinth of plot manipulation, but... to see in a decade or so how I feel about the story in general and the characters. Will it still feel cold, yet classy? Seeing the coming twists, will I internally mourn when the final cause of death is revealed? Mrs. Danvers, I wonder, will she still seem so sinister after I have had more life experience? And the new Mrs. de Winter -- will I still see so much of me in her that it brings me pain to see her suffer so?<br /><br />The title of 'Rebecca' is the epitome of fine elegance and fatal intrigue. Considered a gothic novel due to the morbid turn of events, it was published in 1938 and won the National Book Award for favorite novel of that same year.<br /><br />I listened to this title as an audiobook -- Anna Massey's (Hachette Audio) verbal nuances and character tones are spot on. If you like audiobooks, this is a great one to listen to. (But if you prefer reading in book form, please go right ahead.)<br /><br />It's an amazing read -- one to send you reeling for many a day.experience?

B0000C6E4D|5|Wow....the pictures inside the cd jacket are worth the price alone!  What happened to Sarah?  She certainly has gotten sexier over the past 6 years!  She is looking really beautiful now with the long hair.  Beyond that, this album is really well done.  It's like a continuation of SURFACING...and that is a great thing!  SURFACING is one of Sarah's best albums and the fact that she didn't change her sound drastically between outings is greatness to her fan's ears.  All of the songs on here are really good....I really didn't feel there were any real standouts.  You just need to get this one.....Sarah is something special.  Don't miss out on her!  You'll be sorry!

B001EBV0OY|5|One of my favorite movies ever. The story is inspiring and uplifting in the sense that it shows the triumph of the human spirit above our lowly and unwanted circumstances. It also shows the lengths to which people will go to be free.

B004O3YGMC|1|This app presents a wonderful idea, but it is clearly not ready for prime time, at least, not on the Kindle Fire, as of 11/12.<br /><br />The mouse indicator is too small and too difficult to maneuver -- it is impractical to continually zoom in and out to make it workable. The mouse buttons do not work consistently. Thus, navigation is, at best, awkward.<br /><br />Videos brought up with Real Player or Windows Media Player do not play.<br /><br />The device automatically changes resolution on the desktop monitor without explanation or warning.<br /><br />The documentation, what little there is of it, is useless... as is the app itself.<br /><br />The developers should be shamed for putting out such a product.
B00I7696IG|5|Of a man who almost got away with it. Amazing that the \\"old boy network\\" protected him so vigorously. I can only imagine the pain of betrayal his close \\"friends\\" felt.<br /><br />Also a great historical perspective on spying and intelligence before and during WW2 including the birth of the American OSS and CIA.<br /><br />I hope more is revealed about Kim Philby by the UK and former Soviet governments in the future.

0316098337|5|I won't even attempt a thorough overview of the book.  Simply know that it is exceptionally well written.  While the subject is so dark, it is a novel filled with the light captured via the eyes of a child. I found it compelling reading, finishing it in just a few sittings.  I highly suggest it.
0312383436|2|2.5 out of 5 stars. *sigh* This was my first time reading a 'Madeleine Wickham' novel, and since I have read all of her as 'Sophie Kinsella', I thought these would be just as good. But I don't know ... I guess the way some of the characters decided take care of their secrets just rubbed me the wrong way or something, since I had to skim through some of the chapters just to keep reading, if I didn't skim through I would probably have stopped reading the book altogether. I will say I did like the ending and how the characters finally resolved their issues, and I loved the letter that Rupert read it was very sweet. In addition, I did like the fact that this book was about how to grow up and come to turns with who you truly are as a person, and once you do to stick by what you believe in. Therefore, it had a good message but the plot was a little boring and irritating for me ...<br /><br />Review By: From Me to You ...

B000YAF4OS|3|I listened to the story years ago and do not remember the book's ending.  I have been told they changed the ending.  a MIST inhabits a small town and townfolks come running to a local grocery store spouting there is something in THE MIST!!  yes, and they soon find out too.  so, I went and saw the movie yesterday and the movie was very entertaing.  the characters were well defined and the movie developed at a good pace.  good direction from a wonderful director DARABONT--he really knows how to flush out characters.  scary and eerie and sometmes clasutrophobic it made me jump a couple of times.  however, the movie was hilarious at times because of settings or conversations(characters would blurt out the most stupid lines)-I am not sure if it was serious or not!!.  so, for most of the movie I enjoyed it for its campiness but the ending was cool too-however incredibly BLEAK--a real downer but somehow appropriate.  special effects were excellent with strong characters(however silly) and an ending I think STEPHEN KING probably enjoyed.  its not a feel good movie, but its a movie that felt good to me at the end.

B00104QSOM|5|This film is almost three hours long, and there's not a word of dialogue for the first fifteen minutes, but I could barely believe it when the credits rolled. Based upon the novel Oil! (1927) by Upton Sinclair, the film is set in the wild California frontier at the end of the 19th and beginning of the early twentieth-centuries. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, a silver miner who discovers crude oil on his land, and Paul Dano, who plays a preacher named Eli Sunday who sells rights to the oil on his family's property in order to help his church. Playview and Sunday become moral rivals, and thirty years later, at the end of the film, both characters have been deeply corrupted. Plainview goes mad, whereas Eli admits that he's a fake and God doesn't exist. In an important sub-plot, Plainview's adopted son lives under his father's very dark shadow, and declares at the end of the film, \\"I thank God I have none of you in me.\\" Plainview's own last words are a confessional understatement: \\"I'm finished.\\" Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film won two Academy Awards -- Best Actor for Day-Lewis and Best Cinematography for Robert Elswitt.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Awesome game very fun to play I love it enjoy :-)
B00LP1MVSW|4|It's a nicely set up game that's very entertaining, but the constant updates on sales gets old really quick. It's good for people who like to shoot guns but don't like to kill real life animals.
B00DJFIMW6|5|love it and so does my son. we cant get enought of it. wish there was a game for the first movie
B006LSZECO|5|Loved Gillian's writing style, much the way my own mind works. I don't give away spoilers, but I will say I wish it had ended a little differently.<br /><br />But don't let that keep you from reading Gone Girl. The characters are truly some of the most developed I have seen in a long while and Gillian loves to make you think you know the entire plot, but there are surprises at every turn!<br /><br />Amy and Nicks relationship is so incredibly disfunctional, just like so many of us!<br />You won't be disappointed.
B00KY7PEAA|5|I stated playing back in November anni have not stop the game addicting and the people you meet is unbeliblive
B0046MOVD0|4|If you liked all the others.This one will entertain you as well.A very good series for a video game based movie.
B00G21YLF6|5|so good did not even think to expect that type of ending did not think he would be able to save them
B00DP3IGJ6|5|Interesting movie.
B0041KKYBA|5|I have viewed this film three times already, and each time my blood boils hotter and hotter. I am not a banker, lawyer or politician but this movie proves they are nothing more than sewer scum. They have attacked our nation and should be arrested, tried for treason and hung! We can no longer sit by and complain, we must react.     First we all need to register as independents. This will make the two parties that are ruining our country unsure how \\"We The People will vote\\"..... If that's not rigged also.    Second, we must demand immediate action with all involved  tried, convicted and locked away forever. Yes we are talking about you Ben Shalom Bernanke , Hank Paulson, Timothy Franz Geithner. We must do this for our children or they will someday be modern day slaves. Please watch this movie and invite everyone you know over to watch it.   Obama are you reading this? I want my money and life back!!!!!    Oh and don't buy Hank Paulson's book. He screwed our economy then he dares to write a book on it, are you kidding me? How f-ing dumb do you think we are?
B00F7YHDWC|5|Okay, so the theme song is what got me to download this game.  Very catchy and if I can find a ringtone of it then it will soon be on my phone.  The game is pretty fun too!  Recommended!
B00BB22GQM|3|I heard this group talking about their latest CD on NPR with Terry Gross and they played Diane Young.  I liked it very much and bought the CD for that one song.  I didn't really care for the rest of the CD.
B00005NI5Y|5|I am not going to tell you how good this album is. There are plenty of other reviews here which can tell you that. Instead, I have a question: Why has this man still not been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature? If they can give it to Pablo Neruda, they can jolly well award it to Dylan.     This album will make you weep at the brilliance of this man.
B00QW8TYWO|5|All it is is very very very funny.
B0043UB0BQ|5|Great show...well worth it. Not for the squeamish.
B005ZOBNOI|5|An interesting take on a love story that you know isn't going to have a happily ever after ending from the start but you just can't help but read it through to the end and still smile
B002ZG99G8|5|Great movie.
B004DLPXAO|2|I don't know why screen for reading is not white how it suppose to be. I can read but screen is awfully dark - darker than my Kindle reader. Please can somebody tell me if I can adjust brightness on this Kindle app on my ipad ?  All other screens for games or internet are nicely white - why the same does not apply for Android Kindle app? I removed Kindle for Android app and reinstalled it but pages are still very dark and not white.
B00CWV8TIU|4|pretty interesting characters and plot .. of course Jude Law and Channing Tatum aren't hard to look at .. and for the guys .. the twist on the female lead characters will have their attention im sure .. lol .. overall entertaining
B0000DJZA5|4|I have to admit, Let It Be was never my favorite Beatles album, mostly because I didn't like all of the orchestration on the album, it didn't seem to fit with the songs lacking orchestation. 'Across the Universe' sounds much better without the female voices, and although it was available without them on the charity recording, this version is a bit slower and a little more passionate. All in all, I don't think that this album was completely necessary, but let's be honest, neither was the original album. However I must say that this is a marked improvement over the 1970 version. My only problems with it are the fact that two songs were cut from the recording, and the original banter in between songs is now gone.
B00H2N05W6|5|Reasonably easy to figure them all out...
0143125788|5|Very well written. Really enjoyed it.

B00H5KRPD8|5|My favorite of all four seasons so far!  Very dark.  James Cromwell and Jessica Lange are amazing.
B0014D6PCO|4|A great conclusion to a great series.  If you enjoyed the first two films in the series, this a must-watch.
B005UA0FLE|5|This is a great reprieve from the old Christmas Albums.  What a great new voice we have in Michael Buble.  Fresh and clear, sweet as he can be.  Beautiful album.
B00HVJB4VM|1|Not too impress and repeating know facts to an experienced investor. With information available in many internet souces, nothing new, at least for me.
B00ILHW6AG|3|Entertaining but not real deep
0393072231|4|I've never read any of his previous books, but since I am a hedge fund manager, I decided to pick up this book. The start of the book was somewhat dry, but once I got past the first chapter, things started to get interesting. But again, I am in the investing business, so I can relate to what the author was writing about. But for those that aren't in the finance industry, it is worth the read to educate yourself on what happened during the real estate boom and bust
B00FAXJHCY|5|bought, prepared and now ready for the movie release.
B00CL68QVQ|4|It was  good to watch on a rainy day
B00CWY76CC|4|I wasn't sure if it was going to be too hard but it turned out really fun! You have to try but, it's not so hard that you just give up
B00005JMJ4|4|Emotional states cannot be communicated using language? Are you kidding me? Is this what passes for 'avant-garde' in the age of decadence and debauchery? A brackish blend of quotidian malaise and deplorably vapid psychology, this movie leaves one certain of two things: primo, that we're out of ideas, and, secundo, that most everyone is suffering from some sort of mnesic deficiency that prevents them from noticing and makes hacks like Sophia Coppola rich and famous. <br />This isn't groundbreaking, folks, and it's too cliche to warrant further dissection. Contrived, banal, and puerile. Fine acting, but who cares when the movie isn't entertaining? No aesthetic pleasure will be found here - move along.
B00VXGTJMU|5|Awesome
B000B6CO52|5|My kids have seen this movie on TV and now they can watch it any time on their hand held gaming device! Great purchase. No problem with seller either.
B000FBJHZS|5|My initial concern with the length of this Dan Brown story was soon alleviated once I began reading.  It kept my interest up and I now appreciate the abundance of research that good authors like Brown put forth in their novels.  I highly recommend it and am now enjoying the Di Vinchi Code and once again finding it's length an asset rather than a liability.  Three cheers Dan Brown.  You now have me as a loyal reader and fan.
B008673ZAQ|4|I really liked the first Crossfire novel, and, like most, was anxiously awaiting this new one.  I thought this was a great follow up that kept me intrigued.  If you liked the first book or if you are looking for a new series, this is a great series (with the third and final book yet to come) to get into.
B008Y7N7JW|5|This is not the movie for when you're looking for light, breezy entertainment. Set in future time, The Hunger Games takes us to outrageous exploitation of the poor by the rich and powerful, and demonstrates that the weak and poor themselves may have the power to end their exploitation, simply by refusing to continue playing the game. On another dimension The Hunger Games also suggested to me the nature of war: the children of the poor sent off to kill and be killed for the benefit of the powerful. Not an easy entertainment, but greatly worth the time invested in viewing it.
B0076DCT2G|5|DeMille at his best. My favorite author and he doesn't disappoint.John Corey up to his usual sense of humor.A good read
B002QE3CTY|5|This is the best book I've ever read. I couldn't put it down  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an exciting read
B003MC5N28|5|I read this once before in school. I'm very pleased to have read it again. I finished it in 2 short days!
B005HSG3TC|5|I purchased this for a gift and when I recieved it, it was gray and not black like in the pictures; nevertheless works great and the person I gave it to loved it.
B00BCZU8WM|5|Very enjoyable and loved the new sound. I watched him sing on Jimmy Fallon and knew I wanted the cd.
B0000TB01Y|5|I bought this to listen to for our girl's night out at the show. The show is fantastic!
B007SGLZP8|4|Entertaining with surprise ending
B00FEMJF6O|5|This is such a great game! I can't stop playing! I highly recommend it! Only problem is, I can't find an alliance to join. I keep getting rejected :(
B007TKT2SK|5|This is he best app I Have on my kindle. This is the app student have been waiting for. it is we'll worth the $0.99 cents. And you can use it for fractions or regular.
B000SMWUPS|4|RIP-OFF. This is the WORST transaction I have EVER had. Ordered the stroller that should have been rushed and this accessory. After telling vendor we'd made a mistake on which order the express shipping should be on (the cost by the way was more than the actual Buggy Buddy!) I don't know who CAN'T correct an order a lousy TEN MINUTES after it was made. You people are excellent at taking money from customers with the excuse it can't be corrected. BULLLLL. As I'm sure you won't keep this one posted because you look BAD, hope someone sees it before it's pulled. Thanks for nothing.
1455524190|4|Titus Welliver seems to be the PERFECT choice to read this book, right?  He IS Harry Bosch in the Amazon series, and he has experience reading the WONDERFUL Robert B Parker Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch series.  However, he misses some of the marks on this outing. He does get his stride after a few chapters though.  How can a reader not know how to pronouce &#34;Shamu&#34; from Sea World?  When the story makes reference to Joe Friday, intervewing, the reader does not parrot Joe Friday's style.  Is it perhaps the problem from who directed the reading of this book?  I haven't been pleased with the reading of Connelly's books since Dick Hill stopped reading them. HE was perfect!  This was a fine addition to the series and by now readers have found that Harry Bosch teams up with Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller next.  Detective Harry Bosch has retired from the LAPD, but his half-brother, defense attorney Mickey Haller, needs his help. The murder rap against his client seems ironclad, but Mickey is sure it's a setup. Though it goes against all his instincts, Bosch takes the case. With the secret help of his former LAPD partner Lucia Soto, he turns the investigation inside the police department. But as Bosch gets closer to discovering the truth, he makes himself a target.  The Crossing will be released on October 22 in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and on November 3 in the USA and Canada.  That was from Connelly's web site. So, Harry leaves the LAPD ...again! There are still a lot of story lines we can follow and Harry going rouge has lots of possiblities.  Still, I think there should be a storyline with Mickey and Harry's daughters getting into some kind of trouble and both Daddies having to come to their rescue.  Connelly could still do some incredible cross over stories will his characters.  My two cents on this book is it was MUCH better than the last book.  My only complaint with the Harry Bosch stories is that usually the villian is always a high rank official and Harry is up against a mole or internal corruption. Sometimes is fine, but always gets unbelievable.

B0007GAERG|3|Carey has proven to us for some time now, that she is able to make it in the Urban Genre.  Some may criticize her for this decision,having moved from Adult Contemporary ballads and all. Carey herself has claimed that her true expression is in Urban.   However, it's time for this well rounded artist to move on.  Her grasp onto Urban style is getting monotonous and isn't very sharp.  Her songs do not grasp us viscerally.   <br /> <br />One thing that I find admirable is Carey's abilities to write her own material lyrically.  Makes you miss her collaborative days With Walter Afanasieff.  With Afanasieff's composition and Carey's lyric's, the product proved much success.   What ever happened? <br /> <br />This ablum, though techinally proficient, lacks substance.   \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" I would describe as Urban Blase.
B00ARF92HK|4|I avoided watching this for a long time because of the reputation of the movie from the 90s it rebooted.  I was wrong to do so, it is nothing like Stallone's &#34;Judge Dredd&#34;<br /><br />This movie is dark, gritty, and viscerally bloody. It is not campy, but does contain dark humor.<br /><br />It takes place in a sci-fi world, but it feels real, authentic. Very little suspension of disbelief is needed.<br /><br /> Urban's performance was a little over the top,  but I suppose that goes with the territory of playing an over the top comic book character.  Olivia Thirlby's performance was fantastic.<br /><br />Those of you who groan at the inauthentic close quarter combat tactics that are portrayed in Hollywood will be glad to know that this movie does it right.  Someone who knows about tactical engagement was definitely on set to make sure they did it right.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it, IMDb rating for it is 7//10, Rotten Tomatoes is 78%.<br /><br />Watch it, rate it, tell your friends about it and just maybe, they might make a sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|3|What's with the new updates? I hate them. I don't want to have to complete quests. I like it how it was. I still like the game but it's way less fun now.

After following the instructions and running it through the carbon then the ceramic slots, the knife came out duller than it was going in.

Blade forums has a good discussion with pictures on how bad these sharpeners are. You can read it at [...]
B00BHMF578|5|Ben Affleck and George Clooney made a movie that was entertaining, historical, interesting, and intense.  I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew the end result. It deserved to win best film of the year.

B0042JTDXK|5|I have listened to the album just a few times. Sometimes I need to hear a new song a few times before I really appreciate how talented this guy is. Each time you hear that clear voice and the magical lyrics he sings, the albums gets better and better. Can't wait to see him get the recognition he deserves. Love the new album.
B009FZHYKU|5|A little melodramatic at points and sometimes suffers from the dragon ball z effect (&#34;We're going to fight, but let's spend 3 episodes building up to it.&#34;). Overall still one of the highest quality shows on television and rivals/surpasses most feature length zombie outings.
B00007AJF9|5|...Cate was robbed!  If anyone anywhere was ever robbed of the Best Actress Oscar it was Cate Blanchett. Everytime I think of how Gwyneth Paltrow ( someone who couldn't act if you taped her mouth to Meryl Streep's face ), came up and stole the Oscar we all know belonged to Cate I'm reminded of why Hollywood is now in such a horrid mess. Since then I truly realized Hollywood didn't care about real talent but who was hot at the moment. Cate had a lot of things against her: she wasn't American and she wasn't the \\" conventional \\" beauty though I think she's ten times more beautiful than most of the women on the big screen now. All you need to know is this is the best Elizabeth film ever made!  Since I saw it I became a Cate Blanchett fan and bent down to kiss the ground to show god how glad I was to finally find a truly great actress since the 80's. Cate Blanchett played Elizabeth with the right amount of sexuality, innocence, essence and power that could only describe the woman who led England through \\" The Golden Age \\". I believe Elizabeth (I) would have been honored to have such a powerful presence portray her as Cate Blanchett did.  Cate stripped the character of tasteless glamour and became the virgin queen right before our eyes. If there was ever a woman born to play a role it was Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth. If you don't see this film you are missing a wonderful version starring a mesmerizing, charming little lady who took acting to new heights. This proves once again that the Oscars has nothing to do with talent but personas. Cate will always be the Best Actress winner of 98-99 in my book. Get this film and I am sure you'll agree.

B0000CABJ1|5|There's just no question about it.  Donna Summer was one of a handful of shining stars to emerge from an otherwise lackluster decade in the history of American popular music.  Lots of people agree that the 1970's left a lot to be desird musically.  Having said that, between 1975 and 1989 Donna Summer would place an impressive total of 31 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart.  Of these, nearly half hit the Top Ten while 4 of her records made it all the way to #1!  She was definitely the exception to the rule!  In 2003 UTV records released the impressive single disc anthology \\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer.\\"  This sensational collection features 17 of Donna's biggest and best hits as well as 3 brand new recordings for you to enjoy.<br /><br />One thing that makes \\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer\\" so unique is that this collection includes hits from Donna's tenure at four different labels.  As you might expect, most of Donna's biggest hits from her days at Casablanca records in the 1970's are featured here.  Enjoy once again all-time favorites like 1978's \\"Last Dance\\", \\"Heaven Knows\\" recorded with the group Brooklyn Dreams and her #1 remake of \\"MacArthur Park\\".  Also included is Donna's huge duet with Barbra Streisand.  \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" also rose to the top of the charts in the fall of 1979 and stayed there for a couple of weeks.  I was also pleased to see that a pair of personal favorites from later on in Donna's career, namely \\"She Works Hard For The Money\\" and \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\" also appear on this disc.  As I mentioned earlier, \\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer\\" also includes three brand new tunes.  I enjoyed all of them but most especially \\"That's The Way\\" which I really thought had all the earmarks of a huge hit for Donna.  But alas, that never happened.<br /><br />\\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer\\" also comes with a nifty 16 page booklet that will add to your enjoyment of this collection.  I thought the remastering job was outstanding!  As far as I am concerned this is the best collection of Donna Summer you will ever find.  Very highly recommended!ought the remastering job was outstanding!  As far as I am concerned this is the best collection of Donna Summer you will ever find.  Very highly recommended!
1400049628|5|If the Nostradamus quatrain that says &quot;the dead will rise from their graves&quot; makes you nervous, then you should read this book.<br /><br /> I wonder how long it took this guy to do the research for the book - he obviously knows his weapons, etc. because eveything is so extrememly detailed. The history of zombie sightings in the back is so damn interesting that he could have sold that section as a separate book.<br /><br /> My Dad did three tours in Vietnam, and he remembers coming across one of the areas mentioned in the history section; he said they purposely took the long way around the area because his entire unit was getting the creeps - they all agreed there was something unnnatural in the area...maybe it was zombies left over from the previous incident mentioned in the book, or maybe there was some solanum nearby.<br /><br /> History buffs will also recognize some of the other dates/places, such as the missing Roanoke colony, or the fort in Africa with the hundreds of skeletons.<br /><br /> Even if you've never bought into the theory of zombies before, you will think differently after reading this book. Don't let the humor label fool you - it is a very serious premise.
B002MQYOFW|4|Easy to read, very descriptive. Can't wait to read the rest.  Challenging subject matter written in a very accessible way.
B004W2V254|5|Well acted and shot like a documentary (in realism). I have never done technical climbing, only being on Mt. Whitney and Mt. Fuji, but I can say this film takes you to the North Face of the Eiger visually and emotionally. Being subtitled in English and shot in German, it takes nothing away from being a beautifully done film.
1883010039|5|This is the very best book I have seen or used to learn to weave.  It is extremely detail oriented and procedes in a step by step manner.  I have been involved in spinning and weaving for 9 years and still refer back to it.  Get it in a spiral bound ed if you can so you can lay it flat as you work.
B004UXUX4Q|5|\\"I'm ready to be a real husband and father, just wake up. Please Liz, just wake up.\\" Mike King (Clooney) is having a rough time. He is the trustee for his families land in Hawaii and is about to finalize the sale of it. He has two daughters he is trying to raise with thier mother and his wife in a coma. At the time he gets the news that his wife is for all accounts dead he finds out that she was also cheating on him. There are some movies that are so good that after you watch there really are no words to describe it. This is one of those movies. Anything I say may cheapen the way this movie makes you feel. I can say that Clooney did an amazing job in this movie. He plays a guy that is down on his luck and a type of \\"everyman\\"...and he makes it believable. For someone like Clooney to pull that off is amazing. Also the girl that plays his older daughter is absolutly wonderful and almost steals the movie. This is again a movie that needs to be watched but there are not enough words to describe why. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and I have to say \\"The Artist\\" must be amazing in order to beat this for best picture. I give it an A+
0307743721|5|It isn't that Munro's STORIES are so good, because they're not remarkable at all, really.  What's remarkable is how well she perceives little interactions and then communicates them so effectively to the reader.  So often - especially in \\"Haven,\\" for instance - someone does or says something and you understand the situation she's conveying, but then Munro as the narrator says something that confirms it to you:  this is what that REALLY means, and you find yourself saying, yes, we're really on the same page here, you've really nailed that perception or that person or the attitudes in that world precisely.  It's that kind of intimacy with her that's so thrilling.  It feels intimate and universal at the same time, mainly because she's so absolutely awesome in making you understand not only the character but their entire world.  Her complete oeuvre of stories is one of the greatest treasure troves in the entire language.
B007ZD17XO|5|I love this Gamev. Great game to kill time . Better than candy crush because of the graphics and  bonus levels
B00AO2P3GA|5|What an Awesome game! I'm half paralyze, I can barely move my fingers and I can still play the game. To the people who says that this game sucks and the control is difficult well there's probably something wrong with them. Anyway for me this game is totally awesome.
B00NW2KZYY|5|It is a awesome game

0143113100|1|The most fascinating thing about this book is the nearly complete lack of honest critical response to Doidge's book.<br /><br />Doidge, a Freudian psychoanalyst, has no training in neurobiology, and prior to this book has published next to nothing relevant to the topic.  He makes two fundamental errors in the way he tells his story.<br /><br />The first of these is the division he makes between \\"localizationists\\" and \\"neuroplasticians\\".  No one working in neuroscience would take seriously the straw man position that Doidge puts forth for localizationists, that there is \\"one location, one function\\" and that the brain operates as an unchangeable machine.  It is one of the most fundamental axioms of neuroscience that neural changes underlie any learning mechanism.  No one would seriously postulate that brains *don't* change a great deal during the life of an organism.  Even those involved in the practice of understanding how functions are localized (e.g., speech in the left hemisphere) would not suggest that there is anything special or unchangeable about the physical location, that this location couldn't change after brain injury.  Mainstream neuroscience, not a marginalized fringe, has long been aware of the adaptations and plasticity that can happen after a stroke or other brain damage.  Doidge seriously misrepresents himself as the champion of a movement.<br /><br />The second error is the implication that brains are infinitely malleable.  He presents a cherry-picked set of case studies and select experiments that might suggest that this is the case, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest exactly the opposite conclusion.  Doidge even goes as far as to intimate that any neurological condition can be fixed with the right training.  Autism, dyslexia, maybe even Alzheimer's.  This is seriously misleading at best.<br /><br />One of the traps that Doidge falls into is the excessive use of \\"brainspeak\\".  Many of the examples and implications that he talks about are behavioral, and a brain description is really not the appropriate level.  After a while, the term \\"brain map\\" has lost a good deal of it's punch as it's applied to anything at all.  He suggests that Freud was ahead of his time because, in essence, psychotherapy is \\"changing your brain maps\\".  Well, yes.  But so is any learning at all; there's no privileged place for psychoanalysis.  In essence, Doidge is trying to convince you that evidence for brain plasticity should let you know that YOUR brain (and life) can be changed.  But in many ways the brainspeak is an unnecessary diversion.  The world is full of stories of personal triumph, and those enough are evidence that personal triumph is possible.on is really not the appropriate level.

B007K3JFUQ|5|I love the new Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are fantastic. It is as good as the first, so if you liked it then check this one out too.
B00280LYIC|5|An amazingly inspiring book with real world problems twisted into a mystical world of God's and magic. With its realistic approach to grab the reader and dive them into the story I was trapped by the wonderful descriptive language and setting that seemed just a little too close to home. The wonderfully mastered figurative language kept me guessing at every turn and I was put aside and surprised by many of the decisions made by Percy. I feel if I had written this book I would have gone in a different direction on many things and would never even think of what Riordan would have done, but I have found this to be a very positive point in the book and better than anything I could have written myself.
B0055SWM08|5|love it! so happy I downloaded this game. it never gets boring and the graphics are beautiful. I highly recommend if you like puzzle games!
159562015X|3|The value of StrengthsFinder 2.0 is not the book itself, it's the survey that you take. It comes with an access code (WARNING: Don't buy this book used or your book will be worthless) that enables you to take the Gallup StrengthsFinder survey. You get about 20 seconds for each question - go with your first answer. At the end you get a report that will detail your top 5 strength areas. This is better than typical personality tests (e.g. DISC) in that it focuses more on what you do well as opposed to trying to label you as \\"dominant\\" or \\"steady.\\" With all that being said...the book itself is pretty worthless. The first 25 pages provides a summary of the theory that we waste our time trying to fix our weaknesses when we get more \\"bang for the buck\\" by working on our strengths. The majority of pages simply reprint the report summaries (though insight on how to work with others' strengths is useful). Worth the price in order to take the survey, but the book itself isn't that valuable.
B00UENHBAU|5|It's a great but wait for Halloween a 4 one is suppose to come out then
B005PK1G76|5|This fits well for the UppaBaby Vista, seems to stay put & plenty off room for drinks, Keys, phone etc.<br />The only draw back for me is that with the Vista it has the foamy kind of handle (which is the only thing I hate about the stroller)... anyhow after positioning the organizer I'm worried that the remaining velcro that is exposed will mess up the handle so I'm going to see if my husband can wrap that part of the velcro strap with some black electrical tape (hopefully it won't be noticeable)
0240815807|5|This is one book you won't want to put down.  It is written with the user in mind and yet it is able to convey complex material in an easily digestible format.<br /><br />Everything you need to know to improve your mixes for both the novice and the professional.<br /><br />Really well written!<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and don't even think about it just get it now.
B001GCUO5W|5|Marshal Teddy Daniels arrives at Shutter Island to investigate a prisoner that has vanished without a trace. As his investigation progresses, he makes many shocking discoveries about the island. He learns that there are some places that never let you go no matter how hard you try to break free.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. Leo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams are awesome as always. This story has tons of action, mystery, drama, and suspense, as well as a bit of a horror film vibe. The story is complex and very gripping. Shutter Island is an excellent movies that you don't want to miss.
B007ZXK08C|5|I don't normally read thrillers but I had to read this one as I felt completely out of the loop when people kept asking me if I had read it. Glad to say it completely lived up to its reputation and was one of the most original and intriguing books I have read for a while. The story of a dysfunctional marriage Gone Girl shows us just how messed up most of us really are but don't probably show it. In this book we see the consequences of what happens when people show their true colours. There were also lots of subtle but very clever lines scattered throughout the book that made me feel that Gone Girl was much more than just a thriller, it is a social commentary. Would love to be able to write something like this myself, that appeals to everyone but is so much more than another page turner.
B0092MKTL2|5|I love their music! This is one of the best albums I have ever purchased and it was a bit cheaper here than elsewhere which was nice.
B000BBOV8U|5|love Bryan Adams, GREAT CD!!
B00BSBR9N6|5|Enjoyed reading this book that was recommended by my daughter-in-law. She had read it as part of a book discussion group. The main character comes across as quite odd at the beginning, but as the book progresses, he's very likeable. He starts trying to use scientific principles to find a wife but that digresses when a mistaken participant has a problem that he tries to help solve. Along the way, he falls in love with her even though she doesn't meet many of his criteria. And he doesn't recognize that it is love until he almost loses her. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.
0765325950|5|I must tip my hat to Brandon Sanderson. It must have been a daunting task to try and fill the shoes of Robert Jordan, who was so beloved by his readers. But in all three of the books he he co-written, I think he's done an admirable job, and \\"A Memory of Light\\" is no exception. I DEVOURED this book. If it weren't for my pesky job and night school, it wouldn't have even taken me 3 days to read it. Naturally, the book is not perfect. Some things were not resolved to my satisfaction, some plot lines seemed to get wrapped up a bit too abruptly, and of course I was left wanting more. That's to be expected after having been a fan of the series for the last 16 years. I have been reading these books for so long I almost didn't want it to end. Overall, however I don't think I could have asked for more. The emotions were raw and although I new some characters would have to die, I was shocked at some of the victims of the Last Battle. And speaking of the Last Battle, it was EPIC. Consider this, the chapter entitled \\"The Last Battle\\" spans nearly TWO HUNDRED pages. I will need time to digest everything that happened. I can't wait for a few years to go by so I can re-read the entire series, from start to finish, all over again.<br /><br />And now a side note. To all the whiney, spoiled, entitled, mewling little brats who are giving this book a one star review JUST because the e-book version isn't available yet... GROW UP. I love my Kindle, but there is something wonderful about an actual BOOK. And aside from that, if you are unhappy with the MARKETING decision to release the ebook version later than the hardcover version, a BOOK REVIEW is not the place to voice your displeasure. A BOOK REVIEW is so people can get reader feedback on the actual content of THE BOOK. Write a letter to Tor if you don't like their decision, and give people who actually want to READ the book a chance at some accurate and honest reviews of its content.
0307276902|5|I have kept up with all of the controversy with Mr. Frey's work.  However, the things that are in dispute had no bearing on the most important element of the book, which is the description of his addiction and its hold on him.  I had an alcoholic father and at 42 years old had never understood his addiction until I read Mr. Frey's book.  I had read lots of other books that didn't describe his disease nearly as well as Mr. Frey's did in the first 100 pages of his book.  Thank you Mr. Frey, I will always cherish this book as the one that gave me the answers I needed.
B006VR65OQ|3|I was disappointed with (digital rental) poor playback on a TiVo Premiere.  There was pixelation, bad enough to wipe out half the picture at times, and you couldn't tell if the video was stumbling or that was a director effect in the beginning.  We watched with our pre-teens (PG-13) and the language was coarse and probably explains the rating.  The movie was a bit long.  It was interesting to see how statistics transformed baseball.  Or, did it?
B009EHDU7U|4|Wildly improbable, but so well done! This book was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed reading it. There were many 'smiley' moments, when enjoying the ridiculous.
B00HV2KU5A|5|So I have never seen Frozen until I bought it for my boys and have to say Disney has done it again. I was riveted during the entire movie and had to tell my kids to hush when they started repeating the movie so I could hear everything. Just overall a very cool movie.
141659521X|5|Vince Flynn delivers again<br />I've found re-reading the previous novel from the prior year refreshes my Mitch Rapp 'dossier' and believe this is even better than 'American Assassin'<br /><br />As a fellow p-c survivor I can only say that Vince's prostate might have taken a hit but his novels still 'radiate' action while providing an insider's look into counter-terrorism<br />'A Must-Mitch-Rapp-Read'<br />McP
0060537639|4|There is no question that the Great Fleet existed and that the Indian Ocean and the East Coast of Africa were explored and colonized by the Chinese in the 15th century. Louise Levathis older book &quot;When China ruled the Sea&quot; is not mentioned by the author but it is more serious and less sensational.The book&quot;1421&quot; is wonderful to read but leaves a lot of circumstantial evidence to be confirmed by serious scholars.
B0054JZC6E|5|I could sit and play this for hours on my kindle fire....great time waster and this app is as explained.  you have to play to earn points and have to beat a high score on some to unlock more games.  I see this as a challenge and I dont get bored playing the same game over and over.  I thoroughly enjoy this app and there are plenty of ways to gain bonus points!!!
B00004W55E|4|An interesting individual who sets has set her soul to music.  Four stars!!
B00BD99JMW|3|Great series with a strong ending. This book will keep you reading and want more. Different style from the other two but gives a very specific view from four and tris. Not sure how I feel about the ending but overall it is a great series.
B00HWWUQWQ|5|Another movie for the wife.  Loves those Hobbits almost as much as Harry Potter
B008XCPO2Q|5|I don't care if the story line leaves a little to be desired, I genuinely enjoy this movie.  Hot guys, upbeat music, and sexy dancing. It all works for me. Plus I love Channing Tatum. Wins all around.
0792845730|5|Before director Paul Verhoeven starting pushing the limits of on-screen sex and kinkiness with movies like Showgirls and Basic Instince, he was pushing the limits of cinematic violence, and Robocop is a fine example of  that.  This movie has so much cleverly done graphic violence that is is  great fun to watch and listen to.  The effects are superbly done, a mixture  of outstanding costuming and pretty good stop-motion, not to mention  makeup.  Of course, this movie completely represents the american police  forces (they're not allowed to shoot to kill, and they're not allowed to  cause thousands of dollars of property damage to stop a petty theft) but  who cares, it looks cool!  The acting is good, especially on Weller's part,  and this movie does a prime job making fun of the past &amp; the future  through commercial interludes throughout the film.  Boddicker is still one  of the most cold-hearted SOB's to appear in a movie, and Robocop is still  the most human non-human.  This movie makes fun of large monopolizing  corporations, conspiracies, and the military, but not too blatantly, and  it's got some excellent sequences where people take baths in toxic waste  and their flesh starts melting off their bones.  This movie is simply a  thrill to watch, an almost unrivalled gory, over-the-top action movie.
B000654YRY|5|One of the best guitartist/songwriters of my generation, with his masterfully honed band, playing some his classic work.....a priceless CD for Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fans.
6302799066|5|This is the best comedy ever! And what scares me, is that it is probably very realistic. Fiction can never outdo reality!!! Thats the genius of this film. If you like sick sick sick comedy, you`ll just love this movie.<br />Just notice this.. The plot is serious and it is possible to believe it. Its the stupidity of the carachters and the entire world-political system that makes me smile.<br />Imagine this. Both the presidents in the movie can destroy the whole world. But they only have a bad phone line to communicate with to each other.. Hehe...<br />And of course, we have the &quot;ragnarok&quot; expert Dr. Strangelove. An imported German scientist, that of course is raving mad, and has the right solutions for the situation that occures at the end of the movie. <br />I challenge you all: Is there any better way to deal with a worldwide nuclear catastrophy then the solutions Dr. Strangelove got????<br />But remember, if you`re wong, you got to answer to the coca-cola company!!!
B008602KQI|5|My daughters favorite movie. Had it on a projector in the back yard! Had friends over. An event!<br />worth the money.
B003E8P9G0|5|I absolutely love  this series, Rick riordan has to be on  of my favorite authors. so when he brought two of my favorite things together- magic and Egypt- I couldn't help but fall in love with the stories. worth reading, every single time.
B0000AQS0F|5|I bought Firefly on a whim from Amazon a few months ago, intrigued by all of the stellar reviews that it had gotten. I wasn't expecting much..having never been a fan of science fiction shows or westerns for that matter. However...this series completely blew me away. After just one episode I had to order Serenity so that I could watch it when I was done with the series (which I finished the next day). Amazing, amazing show. It's smart, touching, very well written and acted, hilarious, everything you could want from a TV show. It breaks my heart that it was cancelled so prematurely.    For a little show that was only on for half of a season, shown out of order and with almost no marketing - to have inspired this much passion from people...you know that this is something very special.
B00AMBLXP8|4|Good. I am not a huge Mark Whalburg fan, but he does really well in comedies. Better than I expected.
B009FZHYKU|3|Great series alltogether. 3rd season was lacking a bit compared to 1 and 2 in my opinion. How can you not see it though?
B0038M2AZA|5|This movie is a great film and very inspirational.  Temple is a great lady who has taken the problems life handed her and made an awesome life full of meaning.  Her mom is a woman of great strength and an inspiration as well.  I highly recommend this movie to all.
B005GFPZYK|5|Was expecting a book written by a military person. Instead i read a book written by a great author. Gave me a view of how war can affect strong people and shake marriages. A very intense read. Sorry he won't be around to write any more.
1101946342|5|OMG can't wait for more of Mr. Grey!!!!
1781162646|5|Stephen King never disappoints. This is a great summer read and it  was thoroughly entertaining. Written In true King style!
B000QRIGLC|5|A couple of things first... 1) I typically do not enjoy non-fiction reading material all that much, and 2) I am a girl and tend not to read a lot of war-related novels.<br /><br />Having said that, this book was FANTASTIC! I had already seen the movie (and it's rare for me to read a book once I've seen the movie because I struggle with already knowing what is going to happen), but when my husband and I bought tickets to go see Mr. Luttrell at a speaking engagement, I decided I wanted to read the book before we went. I picked it up in the morning, and I didn't put it down until I had finished it that night. I know there are many books out there that chronicle what it's like to become a member of the military's special elite forces, but what was really nice about this book is that it is written just as though the author were standing in front of you and telling you the story of his life as a Navy Seal. I guess what I mean is that the writing has a very personable, relatable tone to it.<br /><br /> Additionally, even IF you have seen the movie, the book is still a very worthwhile experience. There was so much that wasn't portrayed in the movie, and even more that isn't possible to be conveyed through a mere cinematic experience. It was very enlightening, heartwrenching, and engaging, and is a book that shouldn't be missed by anyone who lives in this country. If you ever want to know what others sacrifice to protect our way of life, give this one a try.
B00AIUUXHC|5|I like is because it is so fun to play and it shod be upgraded more to be even better.
B006IGZX0C|5|Price should be lower more renting would happen , also if a card holder  should  have at 5 free a monthly
B0081KTHEQ|2|Predictable.  Director relies heavily on &#34;shock cuts&#34; you'll quickly learn to anticipate.  Daniel Radcliffe maybe had 3-4 pages of dialog - - the rest of the time he's sneaking down hallways, peering around doors, creeping up stairs, looking in bedrooms, etc.  If, like a toddler you enjoy being startled, this movie may have something for you.  Otherwise you can maybe make better use of your time.
B0037UUZQY|5|my kid girl will love it. is exactly what she is waiting for.<br />The delivery was great and fast as promised.
B002SSUQFG|5|Great watch for the price. Replace the band and you have a beautiful timepiece. I would recommend it to anyone who likes automatics.
B009PNQUXO|2|Its not like the regular YouTube. I could not access my account and my favorites. I could only watch the suggested videos and adding one was a bust.
B009GEEMLY|4|Movie was great, I've been a fan of the Avengers since an early age and I enjoyed the thus great action movie!
3836501899|5|This book shows very fashion collections of polaroid photos. These photos are beautiful and give me some ideas of taking photo.
B0076DELIG|4|I belong to a book club for writers. We read books about the craft and in different genres. I'm not much of a mystery buff, but I enjoyed The Black Box for the writing and the story. The writing was clear and had a good balance of police work and Harry's personal issues. The plot was twisted enough without being out of the realm of reality. It helps that I live in California - years in LA and in San Francisco East Bay, so I am familiar with all the sites Harry Bosch frequented. And I liked the character of Harry Bosch - a man of my generation. He is a character I can root for. I will read more Harry Bosch mysteries.
B0064T6LV8|5|Great graphics and action. Almost like playing classic arcade machines in the good ole days. Hope they continue to publish more of these classic games for all kinds of people to enjoy.
B005WBBYXO|5|I really liked His Dark Materials. It  had a lot of action. If you just like those boring classic books, this book is not for you.
B00VRYCGLO|5|This game is addicting! I can't get anything else done.
B00MELK918|4|have always enjoyed Jeffrey archer as an author.this book is just a shade off of one of his best.
B001KOFH2G|5|A dramatic finish to the prematurely euthanized series Firefly. Has all of your favorite characters, some of which are dropped in some pretty heart-wrenching scenes. It's not as satisfying as another season would have been, but it's a good bundle of entertainment in its own right.
B000JRYOPG|5|👍👍☺
B00LDNE3FG|5|as shown
6304696515|2|This is one of a handful of truly outstanding costume dramas.  John Malkovich is the malcontent bachelor of romantic conquests, spurred on to ruin a young virgin's (Uma Thurman) hopes at a successful marriage and destroy a chaste maid's (Michelle Pfieffer) chances at happiness by a rich dowager (Glenn Close) who's promised him a chance to have an affair with her.  Follow me so far?  The dowager has no intent of letting the bachelor get his wish or fulfilling her promise to him.  It's all just a sadistic game to her.  She wants everyone to suffer. <BR>Unfortunately it is we, the viewers, that suffer the most throughout this movie.  Warner Brothers has done a dismal job on this transfer.  Aside from the usual wear and tear on the original camera negative, contrast levels are way too low.  Colors tend to be strained, garish or even, in some cases, bleed into one another.  Edge enhancement is minimal but pixelization is everywhere and really distracts at times.  The sound on this disc is also inconsistent.  In some scenes there is a ringing echo around dialogue and in other instances the sound is strident, course and grating on the ears.  There are no extras.  All around - a very disappointing transfer.
B007FEFLTO|5|Makes reading history fun and interesting. I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight sometimes but I really enjoyed this book!
B008YWY0HK|5|Keeps my daughter from crying for her grandfather hours after I leave for work. Great movie. Lol
B00ABXA1HI|2|I tried ever which way to set it up but wouldn't work. Maybe its because I tried to set it up the wrong way... and maybe someone more savvy will make it work... but it didn't for me.
0345803493|4|Loved it
B005HEPIDS|4|excellent
B000FCK65W|5|This is my favorite book of all time, and if you haven't read it, you deserve to give yourself this gift.  It is a book to be treasured, read, re-read and savoured.  Betty Smith's \\"Joy in the Morning\\",  \\"Maggie Now\\" and \\"Tomorrow Will Be Better\\" are also great reads. For sentimental reasons, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" was the first digital book I purchased for my new Kindle.  I read the hardcover edition until it fell apart.
B008BQ8VOC|5|I'm hooked on the characters and story line.  It's fast paced and has enough law, politics, love interests, drama and comedy for me.  More intelligent that LA Law and all the other mainstream law shows.  Love the wardrobe...the women wear gorgeous clothes on their skinny bodies.  The characters are pretty to gorgeous, but not so much so that I can't relate.  I've been hooked.
B005HXGE9G|5|I liked his genesis stuff going back to foxtrot to the lamp album. his solo stuff is good as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I enjoy having the different areas to send Minion. it keeps the game from getting boring. I have played. this game for months and still. not bored with it.
B00CO4GO7I|5|Readers will not be disappointed. Especially those with a military background. He ia a man to be admired. We need more men like him!<br />Hjm
B004WCTLNY|4|This movie is probably not for everyone, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt as though the movie was never slow. The intrigue of trying to figure out the premise of the movie and how their world works, kept my attention for the entire time.<br /><br />The ending was not 100% satisfying, but it fits the rest of the movie, as well as the 4 stars that I gave it. The acting is OK, and the action in the movie is realistic (i.e. not full of crazy special effects).<br /><br />I would consider this movie as a romance-thriller, and for that genre it was pretty good. I usually prefer comedies, but I still enjoyed The Adjustment Bureau. I would recommend this movie.
B000005JA8|5|Yes yes yes. It's cacophonous, it's gritty, it's unpleasant. Put it on at a party and watch people make a mad dash for the door. Just try and dance to some of the arhythmic beats that fill the album like a car being thrown down a large flight of stairs. It's not popular music was never meant to be and will never apologize for not being so. It is as about an acquired taste as you can get.<br />Nonetheless, I truly think this will be one of the albums that survives the twentieth century. I think people will still be listening to this in a few hundred years when the concept of music changes and dissonance and staggering rhythms are as harmonious as the choir in the fifth plane of heaven. Rock has produced nothing like this up to this point. Nothing with this sense of exploration and personal vision. Nothing as playful, nothing as fun. Nothing that stretches the boundaries of what people think of as 'rock music.'<br />I don't think 21st century music listeners in America are ready for this. To truly appreciate this album for what it is you need to have a different definition of music and rhythm from the norm. No words will prepare you for how jarring it is. Your friends will hate you, people will think you're insane or on drugs (Beefheart, by the way, was not a drug user even in the early 1970s). My girlfriend still won't allow me to play it when she's home. People plain wonder what's wrong with me. Why would I listen to such tripe? Such ridiculous trash?<br />The answer is that if you're one of those like myself that discover what's in this music, you simply can't stop listening. It's not for arty reasons, or reasons of influence (I could care less who Beefheart influenced, to be honest), or showing off my tolerance. There really is something here for those who can find it. I get more and more from every listen.
B000JMKTLO|5|This is the second book I've read by Gillian Flynn, and I must say that she is quite impressive. Her writing is full of mind games and completely unexpected outcomes. I highly recommend this author and her novels.
0446554995|5|I enjoyed Two Graves a great deal. It did have lots of fantastical elements and cliffhanging predicaments. Poor Pendergast's body must look pretty grim by now, with all the abuse he suffers. I like the slight overlap with the Cabinet of Curiosities, my favorite Pendergast story of all. Preston & Child's writing style makes good, intelligent yet light, fast and exciting reading. Corrie Swanson's character has been beefed up with more accomplishments, so we can expect more of her. A new character is introduced that I'm sure we'll see more of in future Pendergast books, too.
B0047CTO9A|5|Most of the hate towards \\"Pink Friday\\" is related to the fact that it's not rap. Well...apart from a few verses here and there, it really isn't. However, I can't understand how people can dislike it. I mean, I can't even think of a track which I skip, and no track sounds out of place.  Standout tracks for me are \\"I'm the Best\\", \\"Did it On'em\\", \\"Right Thru Me\\", \\"Blazin'\\" and \\"Super Bass\\", and http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin=B0047CTO9A&store=music\\"Roman's Revenge\\" is definitely the winner here. I definitely suggest this to anyone who appreciates any genre of music. If you're buying it expecting a rap album, you won't like it, even though I did the same and still managed to appreciate it for what it is. I'm really looking forward to her sophomore album in fact
B009EAO38C|5|I enjoyed the Piano guys music. Their sound is very unique on how they mix the types of music.<br />Great traffic driving music, calms the nerves.
B007J4T2G8|5|These books are the most captivating, luscious, loving, yet eerie and dark reading thats ever come along!! Wheres book 4??
6305358613|5|This is one of the best period films I have ever seen!  Great character development, wonderful scene location, and some of the most amazing costume design. Haunting story line that will stay with you forever. A must see!
1451627289|5|As an avid SK fan, I wanted to continue my collection of his books and found this one to have an unusal twist, Hard to put down but very enjoyable
0062082353|5|I can't believe I found a book my husband actually read! It was his first completed book ever! Heart tugging and thrilling, hard to believe it actually happened at times. Recommend for everyone military or not. Really shows how the lives of military and spouses are affected by war!
B004VMUS9G|4|I love this because when the alarm first starts it's at a low volume and then gets louder the longer it goes.
B00004S6GL|5|Elliott's beautiful melodies and lyrics all intertwine here, and become some of the most haunting and memorable of his work.<BR>As of late I've been awakening to 'Happiness' playing in my head, still unable to understand why he chose to leave so soon.<br />Please check out his self-titled album, as well as either/or and xo. They are all amazing, and deserve to be heard.<br />He had such an amazing ability to communicate to so many the emotions and sweetness which too often go alone in our hearts; I hope that he found a comfort in knowing the pleasure he gave us in hearing his gorgeous songs.<br />Elliott, thank you.
B00BHMETKC|5|Great to hear Jimmy Carter speak at the end letting people know they had to keep this secret to protect the hostages.
B009KS4XRO|3|Enjoy playing game .  Recommend
B006MW3UZW|5|Great series and a must see for TV. Very addictive.
B000FC11A6|4|Good book.
B00H6JBFOS|1|I resorted to skimming which I never do. Read the cover there isn't much more than this guy name dropping.
B004XJRQUQ|5|My granddaughter talked me into it and she thinks it is WONDERFUL!  She read the series in about three days.
B009NY43NY|3|Definitely not as good as the others-end isn't what I expected<br />For being the last book in the series-she didn't put much effort
B00821OX98|5|Great tv series!!!! Must watch!!!!! Can't wait for june and season 3 to start!! Yeah boy! Who's ready I know im ready!!
B007HO392S|4|Ok. So here's how I think the album is. There are some INCREDIBLE songs in the album. There are some which are not as good. If you are a country fan, you will love it. If you are not a country fan, you will still love it.<br />So here's my song by song review. The marks in brackets below are out of 10.<br /><br />1. 'Good Girl' - A good song but resembles of Cowboy Casanova a little bit. Even though I like the song, it is just a little bit unoriginal.<br />(7)<br /><br />2. 'Blown Away' - An excellent song with excellent lyrics. This is one of the best songs EVER by Carrie and it is very catchy. It is in my top 3 for this album. This song is filled with metaphors and a lot of smart lyrics.<br />(9.5)<br /><br />3. 'Two Black Cadillacs' - An even better song than Blown Away. Musically, Carrie shows that she can do her job without screaming all through the song and still deliver. The song has a VERY effective storyline and this song could be a huge hit for her. The lyrics are very smart again and this is definitely my favorite Carrie song from all albums.<br />(10)<br /><br />4. 'See You Again' - Not a bad song, not a brilliant one. I like listening to this one. This one is the first song after Good Girl to have a country feeling to it, but not a lot of it.<br />(8.5)<br /><br />5. 'Do You Think About Me' - This is a nice country song but the chorus is too repetitive and after all the great lyrics beforehand, this stays a little weak (this is the case for many songs on the album)<br />(6)<br /><br />6. 'Forever Changed' - This is an emotional song which Carrie herself loves. For the fans, it might be a little boring but this one also has some strong lyrics.<br />(7.5)<br /><br />7. 'Nobody Ever Told You' - A very cheesy song but very likable. It has the same subject as Fireworks by Katy Perry but better. This is like the country version of it. I really don't like the weird speaking voices in the middle of the song. I suppose it is a reference to Snow White but it's very pointless<br />(7)<br /><br />8. 'One Way Ticket' - A fun song. As other people told, has a Reggae feeling to it. It's like 'Screw everything, live your life!'. I like it.<br />(8)<br /><br />9. 'Thank God for Hometowns' - An emotional song which I kinda like. Carrie's voice shines in this song. Another song that shows people that she shouldn't shout to sound beautiful (which is what she did on her previous albums).<br />(7.5)<br /><br />10. 'Good in Goodbye' - An excellent melody, actually. And an excellent instrumental. Good message. She's great to deliver it. Lyrics could've been smarter but yet a great song on album. One of my faves.<br />(8.5)<br /><br />11. 'Leave Love Alone' - This is another case which lyrics fall very shortly. VERY repetitive for the whole song. The chorus is weird. It's likable but nowhere as good as most of the songs. The country feeling in it is nice but the song generally is not VERY strong.<br />(5.5)<br /><br />12. 'Cupid's Got a Shotgun' - Another very powerful song from the album. AMAZING rhythm. I love the lyrics. Very, VERY catchy. Amazing song. Definitely the best uptempo song on the album. It's a great country song, but non-country lovers can like this as well. 'I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark...Cupid's got a shotgun and he's aiming it at me!'<br />(9.5)<br /><br />13. 'Wine After Whiskey' - Another emotional songs. Good lyrics. Good song. Nothing special but not boring. It doesn't make me jump up and down as well.<br />(7)<br /><br />14. 'Who Are You' - A great way to finish the album. Mid-tempo, not boring at all, great lyrics. Noting much to be said about it.<br />(8)<br /><br />So when finding the average for the marks I gave it makes 7.8 which is a solid 4-star. BUY IT, NOT GONNA DISAPPOINT.
020530902X|5|The Elements of Style is a must have book for all writers. Strunk &amp; White are incredibly forthright in their approach to composition, form and style. I was particularly appreciative of the enlightenment of Chapter four. My understanding of commonly misused expressions was drastically challenged after completing this segment of the book. I personally enjoyed the no nonsense &quot;attitude&quot; in getting straight to the point. The Elements of Style is a powerful tool to assist writers in every aspect of expression. I can truthfully say that this book comes highly recommended. It isn't long and drawn out but it certainly packs a punch! My fiction and non-fiction writing will never be the same as I apply these principles to my forthcoming manuscripts. Kudos!
B005MLOKXA|5|This is such a smart, well written and acted show. I can't believe I waited this long to start watching but I am glad I have so many episodes to look forward to.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Great turnaround very good service.,
B004AO6VFK|5|Doctor Who is always a great series to watch and watch again. The prime instant video is auto fast forwarding....
B00AN93Q0O|5|Love these guys! Saw them live last month. Super upbeat and always puts me in a good mood. Especially Ode to Sleep and House of Gold.
B003G4W49C|5|I became aware of Orson Scott Card by reading his articles and opinion pieces in a locally published newspaper.  As time went on, we had kids at the same schools and he was frequently asked to talk about the life of an author to our school children or other civic groups.  Middle Schools assigned Ender or Bean stories to classes.  I have worn the cover off my paperback copies, read by two students and repeatedly by me on long trips in the family van.  He describes houses, ponds, trees, bugs, smells... of the area I have lived for 50 years.  Add in waiting in carpool lines behind his large sedan with the obvious license tag...and you know you can ask for an autograph or tell him how much you liked his latest release.  My husband likes to crank him up on the most recent stupidity from the school board or the city counsil.  He is a deep thinker, and that is reflected in all of his books.  I am a fan for life.  I support our local artists, and he is one that makes it easy to do.
B004HW7JHE|5|I was not watching this series originally, and had to catch up.  The best of the series was season five, and I highly recommend this to those of us especially of the 60's era.
B00006FXB6|5|I bought this CD the first day it came out and it blows my mind.<br />Ive been a huge QOTSA fan since I first saw them open for WEEN<br />a couple years back. Then at Coachella they continued to draw me in with songs like &quot;Song for the Dead&quot; and &quot;No one Knows&quot;.<br />This is a definite must buy for those of you who are sick of<br />&quot;Clone Radio&quot;! BUY IT MOTHER F$$KER!
0860074382|1|I saw the movie, and while I didn't love it, it was interesting enough for me to try the book. Big mistake. It's like peeking at the diary of a cloying, annoying, lonely woman. At times I felt sorry for her, but mostly just angry at myself for spending the money to get the book.  The only amazing thing about this book, is how many people love it.
B0064MPXFA|5|I can't believe I waited this long to watch this show....it is highly entertaining!
B003O86FMW|5|You won't want to stop reading it. Great sequel to the other hunger game books. You'd want to get this book
B00BSBR9N6|5|A wonderful read. I've never read a book about a compulsive life style. Loved the development of the characters, and the ending was worth the entire read.
B0063IH60K|5|This is the best free solitaire game I have played.  It is fast, great looking, and with all the features that make it fun and entertaining.  Number 1!
B00BSBR9N6|4|A good glimpse into spectrum of autism or aspergers. Would recommend for unusual writing style and good storyline
B001G70M6S|5|At 30 years old, most of the people around my age can at least remember seeing a Polaroid camera as a kid, so everytime I break out my Land Camera models, art directors, family and friends all go ape shump over it. This works perfectly, fits perfectly, and brings a smile to everyone's face. Sellers will vary so I can't guarantee that your order will be good, but I've had 100% luck with the black and white so far. The only tough thing is getting a proper exposure outside since it's 3000 speed film, but there's certainly ways around that, and it's incredible in doors.
B00EYNGP8A|1|DOMMAGE!<br />WHICH MEANS SHAME!<br />If you've never read Christie's Poiret novels, don't go near this, no matter how many reviews tell you it's good. You will do yourself a great disservice. This is pastiche at its worst -- all the superficial characteristics are in place but all of it in the service of an extraordinarily gimcrack plot that Dame Agatha would, I believe, never have countenanced -- not for a second. The pastiche is, as well, in the service of characters who are reduced to stereotypes of themselves: Poirot is only unlikeable, whereas in Christie he is a complex man with profoundly honorable qualities. The Hastings substitute, Catchpool, is a laughable dummy -- I use that in both senses of the word. Poirot is one of life's treats, as is Miss Marple. One can return again and again and still savor the exquisite construction, the genuine moral sense of evil that permeates her books, the puzzle that is as genuine as its solution has the clarity of the inevitable. Dommage on Christie's estate for permitting this!
B009NQKPUW|5|I've watched this film about a dozen times. Each time it's more interesting and beautiful.  This only has a mild connection to the Aliens films because it does place them in the same science-fiction universe.  And remember this is FICTION.  It's not meant to be fact. It's meant to be an entertaining and thought-provoking movie.  Which it is. And while the film presents us with many questions I feel that's the best basis for follow-up sequels.  If we're lucky Cameron will get to make at least one if not two more related films.
B002UWH8P6|2|Not worthy of the name stargate.  Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos.  very little to do with good  sci fi.....  Got better toward the end of second season but  I had to keep asking &#34;who writes this crap&#34;
0670022411|3|Although I enjoyed this book and read it twice before I put it away.  I find it extremely frustrating when authors begin a series without indication to do so. I had no idea from pre-release or reviews that this was simply an introduction of characters and conflicts that would take at least 2 more books to be resolved. I am of the further opinion that the overly oppressive(protective) nature of the male main character leaves quite a bit to be desired.  I find it implausible that a forward thinkning, exponentially powerful witch would allow herself to be bullied by anyone.  Harkness has Diana acting just like Bella in Twilight over a love interest.  Where is a heroine who insists her partner treat her as an capable and equal partner?
B002NZTZ8S|5|Great movie and price!
B000JBWWRY|5|love it
B001C08RHA|5|With incredible performances from the cast, great visual effects, and spectacular direction by Jon Favreau, &#34;Iron Man&#34; will thrill audiences of all ages. Highly recommended for anyone who cannot get enough of action movies!
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Really easy read with real characters.... I would give it a 4.5 if we could give. 1/2 stars.  Interesting characters, and plot twists keep you interested from start to finish .
B00A3Z384M|5|This movie made all super hero movies possible
B004J4WNL2|5|Susan Cain's book is a great service to all the world's extroverts. I am so much more aware of the great communication divide that exists between extroverts and introverts. This book has made me appreciate our differences and I am sure will help me have a greater understanding of how to bridge some communication gaps.  What I found more important is that I need to work at being more introverted, and that is not a bad thing. We all need to stop talking so much and start really listening. We also need to stop trying to change our introverted friends, co-workers and family into extroverts. We just have to quiet down and listen to what they have to say. It just might change our lives for the better.
B0016B6ZKG|5|I love this album.  I played it at a local bar/restaurant and the crowd was very excited.  Many of them were in their 20s and only thought of Donna as an oldies act.  The album is very current and exciting!  For those few of you giving it one or two stars give it another listen and make sure you crank it up!
B009HUB40Y|5|what a fast paced game. its great. I like that it has a sort of heartbeat as time runs out. really cool.<br />/
B004SIIBGU|5|It allows  you  to get right to the site without having to type and click anything. It lets you get right where you want to be. Looking for the products and bidding or purchasing what you want.
B00HDMMISA|3|Took me a bit to get into the story, but loved the twist at the end! I preferred The Husband's Secret, but did like this story a lot. Very relatable especially if you are a parent.
B00J3AW23G|5|This game is very challenging.  I really like spatial reasoning and this game makes me stop and use my brain. It does get harder pretty fast.  I might have liked a few more easy ones. Lol
B0036S4B6M|2|I expected more character development with this book. I really thought I was not challenged at all reading this. I realize where it is on the buying charts but that does not automatically make this a well written book. It lacked any depth and was actually a little painful to complete which I did because my book club was discussing the book.
140053271X|5|I gave this to my sister for Christmas who said it was the best thing she got this year.  She loves it and the wall adapter I got for it.  Excellent price, excellent purchase.  Next time I will buy it for myself.
1250010403|5|This is second in the series - equally as good at the first. I am enjoying it very much.  Hard to put down.
B000HT3Q3M|5|I would say this is one of the best CD's you can possibly expect especially in the recent decades of lousy music by \\"high school\\" bands with snobbish attitude. It certainly reminds me of what the creative spirit can make a difference. Besides performance and music arrangement, their selection of music compositions is superb and entertaining. Although being recorded in the stereo format, it sounds great through my seven channel surround system. Thank you George and Al for a great work. Keep it up for us.
B00MB6IYHW|5|My favorite Marvel movie. Great for the whole family.
B00003CXMG|5|I wanted to add my voice to say that this is a lovely little gem of a movie. The actors are perfect for their roles, the soundtrack is great, and the coming-of-age story feels authentic and raw thru the whimsy. This is a movie that I can watch over and over without tiring of it.
B006VRDZ44|5|Please put the rest on for unlimited streaming !!!!
B00GLP47UM|5|Very enjoyable to hear the music again after seeing the movie. I laugh and shred a tear all over again, I'm a kid at heart that loves Disney movies. I also pre-ordered this movie with the Disney movie club in which I get Disney points, you can order it here as well ,I checked the price and it is the same here. Idina Menzel  has such a beautiful singing voice and so does the rest of the cast of Frozen. I watched her on Glee, and knew I would enjoy having this soundtrack.
B005MMY9A8|3|This was a good movie...  Acting could have been a little better.  I was impressed with the special effects Thanks
B006GWO5NE|4|I never knew how dependent I was on my kindle until I couldn't charge it anymore!  The new cable worked!  However, I wish it was a faster charging cable like the original one that comes with the kindle.  I'm still happy with my purchase!
B00005ATQC|4|I went to see this movie with my sister and at the very end she told me that she would be better not seeing it. Well, even I didn't like it right away, and look that i'm a die hard Kubrick fan, but I think now a bit different and I would like to share this thought about it./ There are many plots in this film, like in every Kubrick film, and at first you're supposed to take the fidelity theme of the film but, with sure, there are other sub plots. Take Full Metal Jacket, for instance, wich was about war but had also the Jungian discussion about Colective Unconcious where the character, Joker, has his individual personality smashed by his war persona, &quot;is that you  John Waine or is this ME?&quot;./ Jan Harlan told in a recent interview that to understand Kubrick films you can't watch them apart but as a whole pack./ Well, let's go back to EWS, I think if you take the Jungian discussion in FMJ it will serve here alright. 'Cos the fidelity of the Harford couple is also a confrontation of their social archetypes with their unconcious personal desires./ I won't be long here anymore with this psycological plot but I hope it can give some clue to help other people digging this film out.
B004EFYZ1C|4|Finally an app that will show me the phase of the moon right on my phone's home screen.  It not only eliminates the need to look up, but you don't even have to get off the couch and look out a window.  And no rumageing around your phone for Moon Phase either, when you need to know the phase of the moon just press the on button and its there.
B00127RAJY|5|This is a great workout tool to use at home! The DVD is easy to follow and Jillian is such a motivator.
B009MF56GC|5|The Expendables 2 was awesome. The first ten minutes was incredible. If you love to see some great action and some stuff blow up then you will love this. It is a little cheesy but it blows all action movies away that are made right now.
B00V7MJXJ4|4|After spending an entire level beefing up the car and finally maxing it out you can't use it anymore. You should be able to carry your car over to the next level. Give a buy app option to remove the ads and add slightly higher payouts for progression. Disable in app purchases if you buy the game vs the free in app purchase model.  I liked the original game's business model hands down better, at least as the consumer.<br /><br />Killing zombies, jumping the car, blowing stuff up, and building the car out. You can't ask for much more in a game. Great job again.
B003UNYCJO|5|Arizona Dream has to be my favorite \\"odd little movie that could\\". The first time I watched it, I became more than just a fan of Johnny. I became a lover of his courage while choosing projects. He typically does not make his decisions based on the amount of money he could earn. He waits for a script to speak to him, and picks from the heart. Though one could never be 100% sure of everything this quirky movie is trying to say... It obviously has a great deal of heart, and an over abundance of deliciously strange!
B00CH26TL8|1|Not enough energy to play.  Takes too long to rebuild.
B00C2IJJLO|5|Classic neo noir. Loved the story, direction, and performances. The transfer on the steel book blu ray is stunning. Great release.
B004LWZW4C|4|An absolutely great movie, loved every min of it. The blue ray is great, however the iTunes digital copy is only SD (I was expecting HD since it came with the a blue ray). I'm only giving it 4 stars because of that, otherwise it is a 5 star movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Love everything about the show
B004GTLVIQ|5|As always Diana Gabaldon creates another great book
B00IUBM8PQ|5|Good Flick
B008GJV4F2|5|Entertaining parable about growing up and choosing to be open or closed to life. Outstanding performance by Alfred Molino as the count.
B006MW3UZW|4|Better than season 1
B007HC3LHS|3|Good premise. Interesting inclusion of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and its maddening rituals. Otherwise, it's Sleeping with the Enemy in England.
B00BLCHZC2|4|Solid acting, intriguing plot lines, beautiful scenery--a very decent show.  Would recommend this for people tired for reality television and trashy tv.
B0064X7FVE|5|Love having a detailed weather report at all times everywhere I go and it seems to be more accurate that every other forcast I see on T.V.. Would recommend highly!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Well priced for what it does.<br />Jana

0064407667|4|Like many intelligent authors do, Snicket instigates a conflict in the story line of The Bad Beginning in its initial chapters. Although, this does not mean that Snicket is just like many intelligent authors because, unlike most authors, he chooses to conclude the book in such a way that no solution to the conflict, or shall I say conflicts come about. In fact, all that the story really even contains is conflicts, and troubles, and \\"unfortunate events\\" for the main characters, the Baudelaire children.<BR> It is terrible enough that Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire must try to cope with the bereavement of their loving parents. The charming Baudelaire children did not deserve any of the dreadful misfortunes that were to follow the first ill-fated event, a horrible fire that caused the death of their parents and destroyed the beautiful mansion that they called home. But to follow that event with another crisis, and another dilemma, and another difficulty, all equally horrible, makes for a very unfortunate life for the Baudelaire children. After the death of their parents, the children are forced to live with a distant relative, who, to say the least, is not a fan of children.<BR>Count Olaf, their only relative who lives close by, treats the amiable children extremely poorly and forces them to do demanding chores all day long. Though Violet is just fourteen, Klaus is just twelve, and Sunny is only an infant, Count Olaf makes them chop wood, repair windows, and even prepare a large supper for fourteen people while he is away at work. After being treated so badly, Violet and Klaus begin to realize that Count Olaf is more than just a terrible man; he is trying to steel the inheritance that Violet received from her parents, one that is not available to her until she is grown-up. The two older children, who are very intelligent for their age, must then find a way to stop the plan that the malevolent and sneaky Count has devised in order to get the money, and they must come up with a plan to save their young sister, who has been kidnapped, put into a cage, and hung from the top of a tall tower. Finally, just when things seem to be going the way the Baudelaire children would like, and just when the story seems to be ending on a happy note, more unfortunate events creep in.<BR> The Bad Beginning is an unforgettable book. Because of its nature, its unhappy beginning, middle, and ending, it stands out as one of a kind. Though it may seem that a book containing only terrible incidences would be one worth overlooking, Snicket disproves such a theory. The Bad Beginning is entertaining and comical, and can reach children at many levels.<BR>  To begin with, Snicket grasps the spirit of children by turning the narrator into a very likable storyteller, one who could actually be sitting with the readers on a rug, sharing his story and his thoughts. At different parts of the story the narrator stops to explain what a word means or pauses to warn the readers that the events that follow are not any happier than those which have already been told. This is one way that Snicket makes the readers feel that they are there where the story is taking place.<BR> Snicket also clutches the emotional side of children. Though the events that take place in the lives of the Baudelaire children are more horrible and outlandish than most children face, Snicket finds a way to share their emotions with the readers. The beginning of chapter two illustrates this very well. The narrator says, \\"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed. If you have ever lost someone very important to you, then you already know how it feels, and if you haven't, you cannot possibly imagine it...\\" When children can relate emotionally to characters in a story, the story becomes powerful and moving. Children can learn and grow just by relating real life experiences to those in a book. It seems that Snicket is aware of this fact.<BR> Finally, a book that only contains unfortunate events could teach children a great deal about life. How often do children think that their own lives are so much worse than their friends or relatives? As soon as they get to know Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire it is likely that they will realize their lives are not so bad after all. For once, children that are unappreciative might even become grateful for the fortunate lives that they have.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Could not put this book down.
0446579939|5|I found The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, captivating. Nicholas Sparks is a #1 New York Times best-selling author with over fifty million copies of his books in print worldwide and translated into over forty languages. Other titles include: The Rescue, A Bend in the Road, The Guardian, The Wedding, True Believer, At First Sight, Dear John, The Choice, and Three Weeks With My Brother. Nicholas Sparks has also had four of his novels adapted into major motion pictures including: Message in a Bottle, The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe. Nicholas Sparks resides in North Carolina with his wife and family.  While in his third tour of duty in Iraq, U.S. Marine Logan Thibault happens upon a half-buried photograph of a beautiful young woman, simply known as E. After no one has claimed it, Logan finds himself drawn to it and carrying it in his pocket wherever he goes. More importantly, he discovers it brings him luck. His friend, Victor, seems to think it was his fate to find it and calls it his lucky charm. Once he is back home in Colorado, Logan can't seem to get the woman out of his mind. Understanding just how crazy it was, he sets forth on foot from Colorado to North Carolina in search of what very well may be his destiny. He didn't have any illusions of what might await him, but he sure wasn't expecting the instant attraction to Elizabeth, the sincere fondness for her Nana, the friction with her ex, Clayton, or  to fall immediately in love with her ten-year-old son, Ben. Pursuing the path he chose and attraction for Beth, they ignite a passionate affair of the heart, never knowing that the secret of how he came about the photo could destroy everything he had waited his entire life to find.  True to form, and with a power-house ending, it's no secret why Nicholas Sparks has captivated readers worldwide for some time now. How rare it is to find a man who can craft a story in this genre with so much insight in the human condition, affairs of the heart,the importance of family- and to do it in a manner that always seems new and unique. I find that to be the best part of this author, that when he has you crying, laughing, or ready to spit nails, he has the power to make you believe that anything is possible- that fate and destiny are not myths, after all. (Insert sigh here), Another great read from a true gem in this genre.  The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, is an engaging, charming, and witty tale, determined to restore your faith in happily ever after again.    Kelly Moran  Author and Reviewer
1400082773|4|Very insightful with respect to race/class issues in the world. The second half of the book details Obama's first trip to Kenya to meet relatives on his father's side. I learned a lot about Kenyan people and culture. Also, Obama was called Barry growing up with for some reason I think is hilarious - President Barry. Heh.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4|I LOVE THE GAME. I only have two things I don't like about it 1: it's a minecraft wannabe 2<br />you cant CRAFT armour. witch stinks. other than that great game I play it with my sister all the time.
B0083P1QUM|5|Interesting character dynamic, left you hanging a bit in the end. Can't go wrong with a Scarpetta novel, though. I'm a fan.
0671646788|5|Had a copy in the 1970's when I was affiliated with AMWAY...lost it somehow.  Fantastic read.  The World According to Jim (me) feels that if you don't buy into Schwartz's book...you don't buy into yourself.  Must have.
B001UTW7QU|5|Love it,
B002XMGGK6|5|My favorite movie of 2009. I am also bias since it was shot in my home town. Just an over all great movie. Props to the casting cre, the actors were Wonderful.
B00LP1MVSW|3|I'm surprised more reviewers are not complaining about the time restricting energy bar.  Essentially you<br />are able to play for 15-20 minutes and run out of energy units.  You then must  wait for an hour or more.<br />waiting for your units to build back up UNLESS you ante up money /coins to buy energy.  Corrals the kids I guess.  Kinda sucks the enjoyment out of the game.  Come on, GluMobile, crap like that doesn't enhance you're brand name.  Otherwise a great game.... graphics and other game play are excellent.
B0097EWK3A|4|This is the first HO game I've played on my kindle fire, and I enjoyed it a lot. Free actually means free trial, b/c you eventually will have to pay to unlock the full version. I decided to take a chance and was pleased w/ the game. The storyline was interesting and engaging, and long enough that I played for a few days. The only problem I had was that I often got confused where to look for clues b/c there were so many locations to search. The hint button was very helpful for that. Even though I had to pay, in the end I didn't mind b/c I really had fun w/ it.
B00FGM0JTY|5|I really loved this documentary. I thought I had a hard life, until I learned how Rick Hall grew up! This man has went through so much and is an inspiration. I've always wondered about Fame Studios and the history of it all and now I know. Almost cannot believe how many famous people have popped up in Muscle Shoals! And to think, I might have walked right by some of them in Wal-Mart and didn't even know it. lol. The music, interviews, and images are great!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love this game, so addictive and fun. This one has my vote everytime. Every level is a different challenge to challenge yourself with.
B00CKJ2KK2|5|pLz upddate the game plz bruh
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is really fun and addicting. The graphics are good and the idea is unique. Overall this a great app to get
B0049U4NQO|5|I loved the ending to the this book! I can't wait to read the new one! I believe this book is worth your money!
B00JVZ0DQG|5|A bit time consuming and works better with wifi so you can buy and sell your , great game for goods. All and all tbough, great game to kill time with.
B009UX2YAC|5|Love it, so much fun for me and my little girl. I love the fact that the city you play in changes every so often. Very enjoyable game. Would recommend it to young and old.
B00005JMXX|5|Thank You very much for the quick service. The DVD i purchased was in excellent condition. If i have a chance to buy from you again i will!
B00IFORVEQ|5|Love, Love, Love it! I can't wait to view the webisodes.... a return to the series would be nice too! #TeamLogan #LoVe
B00F0O8SZK|4|delivered on time and as described
0385352107|5|Like Moby Dick, nothing really happens until late in the book.
B00014TJ6Q|5|Great CD...had the vinyl but haven't listened to in years, wanted to update to CD.  The songs sound great and George playing and singing are some of his best.  AAA+++
B005G6QF8Y|5|I got the cut Wonderland from Amazon for free. And the album was recommended to me several times by Amazon. Then Amazon put the silly thing on sale for $3.99 and I couldn't turn it down. Frankly I would have been happy paying the full price. The songs are fun, catchy, some explicit and are a really pleasant surprise. I never expected it to be that good. I was wrong. If you enjoy Wonderland or listen to other songs on her website then please buy this. She deserves our support.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I started this book not really knowing what it was about. I soon found myself falling in love with Hazel and pretending to be at least half the person she is. Even though he is a character in a book Augustus Waters stole my heart almost immediately. I fell for his charming and goofy personality right along with Hazel. This book changed my life. It changed the way I look at things, allowing me to realize what this life has to offer and appreciate everything that I have because nothing is forever. In all honesty this book helped me to find my own Augustus and I am thankful for him each and everyday. I recommended this book to My Own Augustus so that he could love it just as much as I do and he does which made me fall in love with him even more. I don't think anyone should ever be afraid to fall in love because it's really the only thing that matters in life. I think that Hazel finally figured that out, and in turn did not regret the person that had to hurt her when he left this world. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who needs some help figuring who they are in this world, who knows you might just find your own Augustus.
0805017445|5|My son's preschool teacher told me he asks her to read this book quite often. I had never heard of it before, but when I asked him about it he broke into a rythmic rendition (much was hard to understand) of \\"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?\\"<br /><br />I immediately ordered a copy and when it arrived he actually \\"read\\" it to me. This book is so great for kids. He loves to \\"read\\" it to us quite often and when we pack a bag for an outing this book has become a staple. Now I need to order the rest of the series.
B008Y6WRIA|5|A very pleasant and fun movie
B00AFCEIB0|5|I have read Tales of Enchantment By Wendy Riley.    A very uplifting read taking you along many journeys.The writer has made it easy for you with small stories twenty two in all.    It is a book you can read over and over again.    Donnie Fraser
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is the greatest game i have ever played in my life. It is a great game. You should play it right NOW!!!!!!!
0143039504|5|This edition is pure Jane Austen. Once you are past the introduction, there are no footnotes, no annotations, no nothing, except the magnificent expanse of the author's words. There is nothing to take you out of the worlds she creates. Occasionally I couldn't live without an explanation of a word or phrase, but there is plenty of help online-- Austen sites with glossaries, etc. The physical book itself is beautiful. Satin cover surface, with image of layers of delicate Regency papers. No matter where you are in the book, you can set it down on its spine and it lays open without stress. The whole look and feel of it is like the quality of Austen's writing-- gracious, relaxed, and whole.

B000065V3H|5|good movie
B00005JL78|5|I've seen a lot of reviews for MINORITY REPORT, both good and bad, and have come to the conclusion that those who criticized the movie may have largely missed the point. With any movie that deals with future event/time travel, there are going to be minor inconsistencies or incidents that require some suspension of belief (BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 is a case in point here).<br />I'm not going to rehash much of the plot because you can read about it here on Amazon. Let's deal with some points about MINORITY REPORT's \\"flaws\\" first:<br />1) Some reviewers have mentioned the eyeball scenes where John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is able to gain access to government buildings. One reviewer said that the eyeballs would have started decomposing by that point. However, the movie does not specify how much time elapsed since Anderton's eyes were removed; in fact, we know it can have been no more than a day, because he is \\"scheduled\\" to commit murder in 36 hours, and that's way before his eyes are removed (i.e. more time has elapsed, so there is closer to 24 hours remaining).<br />2) I agree with others that some suspension of belief is required for when Anderton re-enters the Precrime Unit so he can kidnap Agatha. In such a \\"perfect\\" system, it seems highly unlikely that the authorities wouldn't revoke his access immediately when they realize he is wanted for a future murder.<br />3) Some reviewers have said that it would be impossible to predict the future because it hasn't happened yet. This concept depends on your beliefs (possibly religious) and your view on the paranormal. There are many who believe that hindsight and consequence are closely linked and that anything one does to try to alter the future is completely missing the point. Trying to change the future implies that it CAN be changed, when in reality it is already predetermined and your actions, including trying to alter any future events, are also predetermined. I will leave that for you to make you mind up about.<br />MINORITY REPORT is arguably one of Spielberg's finest movies for a long time, probably the best since SCHINDLER'S LIST, although the two are very different genres of films. It's an action movie, but only to some extent, because the action is always supporting the fascinating plot developments (and there are many) that keep the audience guessing. The action is great and some of the special effects scene are breathtaking, particularly the first chase scene which features a sprawling suburban freeway system, complete with futuristic vehicles and roadways. <br />There are also many sinister moments, which portray a dark image of what life might be like in fifty years. One scene, where robotic spiders enter an apartment complex, is particularly sinister, with residents forced to submit to retinal scans so that the Precrime cops know that they are not the fugitive they are looking for.<br />The best moments of MINORITY REPORT are, however, not the action scenes, nor the sequences packed with special effects. It actually has some astonishing drama, with Cruise in his best form since JERRY MCGUIRE. One of the movie's climaxes (because there is more than one), where Anderton comes face to face with Leo Crow (the man he is supposedly destined to kill) for the first time, is heart-stopping stuff. Anderton has had no intention of killing Crow; after all, he doesn't even the man... but what he finds in Crow's apartment, as the clock counts down towards the moment he is meant to murder him, turns the whole movie on it's head. The question is now...will he or won't he pull the trigger?<br />The movie is worth watching just for this one sequence alone. If you liked THE MATRIX, BACK TO THE FUTURE, BLADE RUNNER (or even a lesser known made-for-TV series called MILLENNIUM [with Lance Henriksson] that aired in the 90's), you'll love MINORITY REPORT. Ignore the bad reviews and give the movie a chance. I'm the guy who foolishly walked out of the theater during THE MATRIX because I couldn't understand what was going on. When I watched it again on DVD, I loved it. Maybe those who doubt MINORITY REPORT need to sit down and watch it again. Open your minds and your wallets - you won't be disappointed.
B003IKMR0U|5|This is a simple mindless game, perfect since you are a zombie hunting for brainzzzz! I'd recommend for any group, just to waste a few minutes in a fun game.
B00NG4K8UO|5|Is perfect, the best keyboard for android
B00LXPR0EA|5|OK,Great movie,Loved it,have it on Blu-Ray already. So,would someone tell us WHY we should buy this issue of it?
B00AKS656U|1|WHAT.THE.HECK. This game was horrible! It sounds like its super cool and an actual THINKING game, like escape the room.But instead I get..... this? Graphics are horrible. Garfeild always looks sickly, and Odie looks bad too. Story line is pathetic. Also extremely hard. Don't buy.
0061245097|3|These books are not bad if you don't expect much from them. I was attempting to fill the gap in my life after Twilight and this did not help at all. They are a quick and easy read but extremely cheesy. Definitely not the best writing but are enjoyable if your bored. I would never really recommend them to anyone though. I'm surprised they have such high reviews.
B00EOARZ4G|5|This book was filled with so many different characters and it keep you guessing until the end of the book.  Really enjoy Jack Ryan Jr. and the growing through the book.  It is a must for anyone to read the book.

B00I6IKSZ0|4|The controls are good,the gameplay is fast paced,looks minecrafty and different form call of duty thats the pros that the game has.But the game has so much pay to win another than about the pay to win problem is that every win u get like 3 coins so making pay to win mandatory the final thing about pay to win is that u only get gems by leveling up.the last con is that I found a really nad glitch were after my game crashed EVERYTHING reset I lost all my wepons and coins.please tell me if u found this helpful :)

0670880728|5|I loved this book! If you are (or were) single and nearing the dreaded age of 30, you must read this book! Helen does a great job of capturing what it is like to be single and the harrasment that comes from family and married friends. Always trying to set you up, pointing out men, &quot;casually&quot; placing you with a male guest at a party... Bridget always seems to have bad things happen to her... she's late for meetings at work, burns food when she tries to cook, lots of one time dates, no cards on valentines day, etc. The diary blurbs are hilarious as like many women, Bridget weighs herself, counts calories, number of drinks and cigarettes. I am also in the middle of Edge of Reason and it is every bit as funny!
B008Y2FRFO|4|a great game when you need something to pass a little time. doesn't take any effort. a game my daughter can play also.

B0040HO01Y|4|Good BBC comedy/drama.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|The only problem is when there are updates it takes longer to get them on kindle compared to iPhone.  Everything else I like about the game and being able to play on both and progress being saved on both.
B00004YW6I|2|I have liked everything that Pj has ever done.  but this? this is schmaltz.  Some people have said that it's her most accecible as if that's a good thing.  accesibility on records generally means that the writer wasn't trying hard enough, that this music isn't anything you havn't heard before. very true with this album.  this stuff is hardly original, hardly deep.  Now, i won't blame Harvey for being happy, you can't hold that against her.  But i will blame her for not trying.  There is no depth here, especially in the production which is sqeaky clean and edgeless.  This album bored me.  Two stars because of the song horses.  not a bad one.  and the tom yorke songs come kinda close to being good. the last song is horrid, fluffy, cheesy you name it.  SOrry Pj, i do feel bad giving this a bad review, but it wasn't that long ago that your albums were works of art...what happened?
B000002UWF|5|This collection is fantastic! I defy any one to listen to familiar songs like &quot;Jump, Jive, and Wail&quot; or &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; and not want to dance around your living room. It speaks to Louis' skill and artistry to note that the more familiar covers of these tunes kept most of his scat and intonation to their vocals. He did it best and it would be hard to improve.<br />Some of my favorite songs from this CD, like &quot;Angelina&quot; and &quot;Beuna Sera&quot;, have a distinctly &quot;Italian&quot; lyric. Under this, however, is a distinctly New Orleans swing groove. The combination elevates what could be cheesy lounge music to a unique and innovative jazz sound that is surprisingly fresh even today.
B00005JLFC|5|I dont know how many times I have watched Yentl! more times than I care to remember I'm thinking, and each time I watch I find more to learn and more to enjoy, it has been a very real blessing to me, I dont find any hidden meanings only a young girl with a great desire to find her God and find her purpose in life, at a time in history that didn't allow girls to do so. I think I understand a little of Barbra herself because she    dedicated Yentl to her father. Its a beautiful film well acted and I'm sure theres a whole new audience in the younger generation who would get a great deal out of seeing YENTL on DVD
B00ECW9UJY|5|A buddy borrowed me his copy years ago and I was very impressed. Even my dad found it interesting and he hates sci-fi stuff. The actors are convincing and their moods give depth to the story. They never go overboard just for the sake of it and it's not hokey. The meat of the story is the drama of the men fighting to have those around them believe what they saw is true. &quot;That their friend was abducted by a craft after a logging job in the woods and hasn't returned since.&quot;  I wasn't even expecting the creepy scenes inside the craft since the movie is mostly effect free. It may have a made-for TV feel to it if your watching it for the first time, though the abduction scenes are top-notch. Gonna watch this again soon.
B004P1JDJO|5|It is rare that a book successfully challenges my basic assumptions.  Daniel Pink does an outstanding job presenting a new, to me anyway, paradigm on personal motivation in the workplace.  It's not so much at the all the individual elements were a revelation, rather it was how they fit together to challenge the concept of the carrot and the stick that my generation ('85 grad) was taught.  The book is well written and generally an enjoyable read.  Thanks to the book I feel energized with the new challenge to apply the lessons from the book to my day-to-day leadership responsibilities.  No, I am not going to throw out our current business model and jump blindly into this new world (we are a 'best company to work for').  However I will give more consideration on how to allow our people to be more autonomous and self directed and that could add significant value to our work.
B008M7BQHE|3|I was a big fan of this show up until they introduced the parallel universe concept. Seriously!!! Before this whatever they used to show seemed to be believable despite we all know that most of the stories are too good to be true. For e.g. walk through a concrete wall or amber thing but still there was some sanity in those concepts but this parallel universe is load of crap.<br /><br />PS: I am still watching this show only because of the Bishop boys. I just love them.

B000002MP2|5|Gotta love it how they named their third LP after sh-t huh? Anywhoo, every song on this cd is worth buying it for. &quot;She&quot;, &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, &quot;Basket Case&quot;, &quot;Havin' A Blast&quot;,  &quot;Chump&quot;, &quot;FOD&quot;, and Tre's second song, &quot;All By  Myself&quot;. I could go on..... It's freiken great.

B000BTC5LW|5|I had forgotten how great a major concert can be. Over the years I'd lost interest in Pink Floyd, too commercial, too slick, too boring etc, but this show (from a series of performances in London in 1994) is GREAT, the music, lighting, props, and film/projection at the show as well as production value of this DVD is top notch. I'd gladly spend big bucks to see a show like this now - live (as it was I surprised myself staying up way too late to watch the whole thing). I'm used to much smaller venues these days, but getting 30 to 40 thousand people together for a Vegas style sound and light experience is really something special and remarkable. The crowd looks suitably blown away, and it got me high too, (and brought tears to my eyes during the vocal solos of Great Gig in the Sky).<br /><br />I remember The Distant Sound Of Thunder CD having a distracting amount of audience noise (they never seemed to stop and listen!), and was pleased to have it be much more in the background for this concert's mix. The sound is really good (even as just audio). Having Dark Side of the Moon performed in entirety was great (alot of emphasis on the trippy projection and lights), and the encore of Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell was powerful with the grand finale' of lazers, lights and explosions being over the top but fun too. However, I liked the beginning of the concert (disc 1) more. The only other concert DVD I've seen close to this level of art and grandure is Peter Gabriel's '03 GROWING UP tour, but this is much more intense and cohesive. I missed Waters and wondered how much better or different it would have been with him, but overall, the show is complete as is.<br /><br />The DVD has alot of special features that I haven't yet explored, but I'm sure they will be fun.<br /><br />What impressed me most was the way the band appeared to have fun, playing consciously, relaxed and yet restrained, fully aware of their effect... It made me seriously think this is a good expression of the peak of our civilization (union of technology, art and consciousness, materiality and spirituality presented as entertainment, but delivering much more.)<br /><br />Even for the casual Pink Floyd fan this is a must see.the peak of our civilization (union of technology, art and consciousness, materiality and spirituality presented as entertainment, but delivering much more.)

B0001ENY6M|5|I have to admit, I never saw \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" nor do I have any desire to for other than I know the story so why would I want to see a glorified violent version of it on the big screen? The only reason I own a copy of the film score to the film is simply because I love the music. When I saw the trailers for the film a couple of years ago, the music really stood out especially during the crucifixion scene. John Debney's film score reminds me of Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's work for the \\"Gladiator\\" film and a bit of Dead Can Dance with the Middle Eastern influences in the music. The orchestral film score is truly of epic proportions. John Debney certainly knows that music does play an important key role in movies. Despite not having seen the film, the titles of the tracks do match the songs themselves. I can almost envision the emotions of the characters in the particular scene that the song accompanies. Regardless of my personal feelings of the actual film, I absolutely love the music to \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".
B00632HWOG|4|Had Yahoo on my computer and enjoyed, so why not on my kindle.
B004LOMB2Q|5|This app has so many options. I use it in many areas of my life. I'm a mother and a writer so I use it for everything. From shopping lists to impromptu chapters. Job well done.
1849904251|5|Wish it had more detail; it's essentially a repeat on the stories with lots of pix; nothing new.  Still it was fine.
B007HACDLK|5|I think its a great Mitch Rapp book.  While some of the terrorist characters are a bit cliche, this book as a few twists and turns in it that make it one of my favorites in the series.  I read every one of them and am sorry that this is the last one we'll get with VF as the author.  RIP Mr. Flynn.
B0095XPZBC|5|A fantastic installment to the franchise! The picture quality of the blu ray sets are simply amazing! I am a huge fan of Star Trek and have watched all the seasons of Deep Space Nine and Voyager but never got around to getting The Next Generation on DVD so it has been a real treat watching these blu ray sets. This is a must have for any Star Trek fan.
B000FA5SMK|5|I read it when it first came out and needed a good read again.  I enjoyed the crazy sarcastic banter and the great story line as much this time.

B002YM8M3E|5|This charming romantic comedy was originally intended by writer/director Harold Ramis to be a far darker work.<br /><br />In GROUNDHOG DAY, Bill Murray portrays self-centered TV weatherman Phil Connors. After traveling with a remote crew to Punxsutawney, PA. to film their annual Groundhog ceremony, Phil gets trapped in a cosmic loop and is forced to relive the same day over and over. His inital disbelief about what's happening soon turns to anger then despair, but once Phil surrenders to the phenomenon and concentrates solely on becoming a better man, February 3rd finally arrives and with it, true love.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.2) Groundhog Day (1993) - Bill Murray/Andie MacDowell/Chris Elliott/Stephen Tobolowsky/Brian Doyle-Murray/Marita Geraghty/Robin Duke/Ken Hudson Campbell/Harold Ramis
0553386794|1|I attempted to read the first book of this series a number of times due to some mass delusion about this series. Seems to me people are using this series for some kind of mass acceptance of some kind rather than being sincere about how horrible the beginning and layout is. When I read I like people and places to be gradually introduced. I do not want to be teleported instantly from person to person place to place between each breathe.<br /><br />I read novels for entertainment.<br /><br />If I want random and complex I will spend my time with DNA, Physics, electromagnetic energy particles and think about looking through a pair of glasses that see everything and everyone as atoms and molecules and quarks as packets of 3 dimensional computer code. How anyone can compare ice and fire to being equal to any of the top fantasy authors works is incredible.<br /><br />There are much more enjoyable leisure time reads than this. Many of the better series are finished so they can be read in entirety. I say skip this melted ice and heatless fire series and skip the mass delusion about how great this series is.
B0055SWM08|5|The game was aesthetically pleasing and wonderfully put together. The music was eloquent and the game play was not too complicated, but at the same time not too simplistic. It is completely the price.
B007J4T2G8|5|Despite others negative reviews...I really enjoyed the trilogy. I couldn't put it down!  There is a lot of sex in the books but not at all what I expected. It's more of a love story than anything. People that call it porn have never read it.

B006ON41FC|5|Lol! This game is so much fun and so addicting! My advice to you is get! Way worth the money!
B000FCKBCU|4|Cute book! Great book for a weekend or beach. If you've enjoyed other Sophie Kinsella books, you will enjoy this one. (And if you haven't, you are in for a sweet treat!)

B003YHSE7W|4|The movie was good, but it focused too much on Tony Stark and not enough about Iron Man.
0307276902|3|<br />Even though A Million Little Pieces is a colorful, first hand account of an addict undergoing treatment and recovery, to me it still carries the stereotype of addicts: grim, little hope of recovery. For a different, hopeful view of life after addiction, I recommend Sandpaper Sisters, which captures the voices of women \\"on the streets\\", during and after recovery. Sandpaper Sisters is about the success stories of former addicts helped through a residential faith-based treatment program. the first of its kind in the U.S. and the model for others.  <br />  <br />Reading Sandpaper Sisters encouraged me because I had heard, \\"once an addict, always an addict\\".In this book I found addicts who gained hope and confidence, were able to change, and went on to become community builders. Miracles do happen! <br />  <br />

B00H2EQFBK|5|Great storylines, believable characters, excellent filming.  I'm looking forward to season 2, and have added this series to my watch list!
080508990X|3|Not as easy to read as &#34;Brown Bear&#34;.  Wished that Bill Martin had kept it simple and fun to read as his first one.
B00DU74U74|4|i did not see as much publicity on tv for this movie. I could not get into the book. However, I had no trouble falling into the storyline.  I enjoyed the movie and was surprised to see a great cast including William Hurt.
0891416811|5|I have thought about this book for years. I read it at some point in the past- probably in the early seventies when I was in middle school or HS- and to this day I remember it as one of the most captivating  &quot;reads&quot; I have ever had. I have not yet re-read it, but now  through the power of the net I have found one of my old friends. HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED!
B000001ESN|5|Great
0345803507|3|Did not read them got for a good price and sold them on Ebay for a profit I hear there is a movie coming out oh joy
0810983915|3|Over all I liked it, and thought that 3 stars is fair. The first three books made me laugh out loud, and they still do. However, Dog Days seems to be missing something. Maybe it's because this book deals with Greg and his summer vacation and the others dealt with school. I don't know, just something was missing. Don't get me wrong, this book made me chuckle at parts, but I didn't laugh out loud.<br /><br />This book deals with Greg and his summer vacation. Over the vacation he deals with his family, birthdays, friends and trying to find a summer job to pay off a bill.  In this book, Greg seemed to whine a lot.<br /><br />Over all, it wasn't bad, just not as funny as the first three.
B001DJ7PQ4|5|Well, maybe my favorite after Captain Jack.  I love humor and energy her character brings to the series, and the absence of all that romatic mooning of Martha.  There's also an air of sadness throughout the series as the doctor becomes increasingly aware of his coming demise in the specials.
B00HAQCLNQ|4|Cate Blanchett is superb in this film! She takes you on her journey into the thin veil. What a performance! The ensemble was terrific but it was Blanchett's film all the way. I loved it!
B008K9SG9K|5|This CD is awesome.  I had never heard of this band before but took a chance after I heard one of their songs on the radio. I really like the variety of sounds; each song is unique with it's own style.  The songs don't sound all the same like with some artists. You can't go wrong with purchasing this CD, you will not be sorry!  I Love It!
B00005JA8B|5|Awesome movie
B00CSGYLQI|5|my girl loves it, that's all that matters. was fairly easy to assemble. closes up with everything inside without a problem
B00DJFIMW6|5|This is one of the best games i have played in my life but they should add more costumes in the game
B005ZOBNOI|3|I wanted to like it, I really did but all it did was romanticize cancer. I tried to like it but I couldn't look past that. I have read other John Green works and this follows his blueprint so it's not outstanding. The only thing that kept me going was that the dialogue was a little different than I'm used to seeing in books, and there was a slight twist, but nothing shocking. I found some of the characters (the mother for one) to be incredibly.... not smart.
B000PMGS8G|4|I would give the movie itself five stars, but the DVD and Blu-Ray presentation are not as strong. The 1980 Flash Gordon movie is one of the funnest romps in the space opera I have ever experienced. Much more true to the Saturday morning serial kind of sci-fi that Star Wars was paying homage to. There is an inherent camp value that this movie never forgets and it just makes the film a joy to watch. Plus the soundtrack from Queen just ups the fun factor even more. You would think this combination of music and content would make for a very campy film, but not necessarily. While the movie definitely knows it's roots and is having fun with that you really can't call Flash Gordon a cheesy B-movie.     The Savior of the Universe (SotU) Edition DVD lacks the very energetic commentary by Brian Blessed (plus production stills and other static extras) that the European Silver Anniversary Edition DVD and even lacks the commentary by Same Jones and Melody Anderson made for an International Edition (that of course we never saw in the U.S). In spite of that you do get a remastered film with 2.35:1 anomorphic widescreen, 5.1 Dolby Surround and the movie trailer (none of the European releases had that). While the SotU edition was remastered and looked a ton better than the previous releases it wasn't perfect. While background matte effects are noticeable they are easily forgiven considering the sharper picture, but there were certain matted special effects blocks used on the spacecraft that were painfully obvious in the remaster. Either they didn't bother to digitally clean them up or it wasn't technically possible. Audio also sounded rather thin considering this was supposed to be digitally remastered.     Another thing that bugs me is SatU DVD is set in an impressive and slightly oversized case, but when you open it up all you get is the DVD and the pencil art insert from Alex Ross. No booklet detailing any info on the movie... not even a single page chapter list. Yeah, Yeah... most of you would say \\"but the remastered movie is what's important\\" but considering the sendup (and packaging) I would expect at least something more than just a disk and a sketch. I have seen movies with far less noteriety get more in their packaging than this.    Where the Savior of the Universe Edition improves upon the previous U.S. release significantly the Blu-Ray edition really stands out heads and tails above the rest. The visual difference is breathtaking. Details and textures come out that I have never seen before (and I was one of those kids who played the VHS of this film to death). Some scenes show so much clarity you would be hard pressed to think they were done recently. I think the sets that were done to be interiors stand out more for some reason so it's not really inconsistent mastering. The special effects problems that were very obvious in the SotU Edition are still there, but the matte blocks are far less noticeable with some cleaned up entirely. Audio is stand out amazing. Don't bother looking for any noticeable surround, but then again this movie was done in stereo. Now it's in crystal clear, deep and full stereo. No more 'thin' soundtrack.     The packaging for the Flash Gordon Blu-Ray is identical to any other single disk Blu-Ray you may find. That makes it a lot easier to fit in with the rest of your collection unlike the SatU Edition's oversized box. You still get nothing special as far as any booklets or liner notes. Also you no longer get the art insert from the previous release. So still nothing really special on that front.     Both the SotU Edition and the Blu-Ray release have identical features with just a little irrelevant extras added to the Blu-Ray What you get on both is two featurettes. One is from Alex Ross (the guy who painted the DVD cover) on how much he loves the movie. He actually does a really good job of making his featurette much like an analysis of the movie and would have worked great as narration for a documentary. Instead you just get Alex in a chair with a few movie clips thrown in here and there. The other featurette is called Writing a Classic by screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr.     The Blu-Ray exclusives are just BDLive and some annoying streaming ticker that will give you \\"news\\" from Universal Pictures. If your Blu-Ray player isn't connected online you may be able to spare yourself the latest in invasive advertising. The movie case promises exclusive content from the BDLive features, but none of it is related to Flash Gordon. Currently all you get are more promotional tidbits for other movies. You know what guys? This would be a great place to add those freakin' commentaries you keep leaving out.     I can't for the life of me figure out why they didn't just add the European edition commentaries to the Blu-Ray release and maybe add the new things to sweeten the pot. But to have a Blu-Ray missing some cool bonus material that's already out there? Not the smartest move in my book.     So which edition should you get? If you have a Blu-Ray player definitely the Blu-Ray edition. It is the best remaster visually and sonically by far of any edition, European or otherwise. If you REALLY want that Alex Ross pencil insert exclusive to the SotU Edition then you may have to make a choice or double dip. Unfortunately there is no definitive edition for Flash Gordon, but the current winner in at least presentation of the film is Blu-Ray.
B000XUBFE2|4|This book was surprisingly captivating. After each chapter I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  It was written as a narrative, and I like the way the narrator takes the reader into his confidence. The characters were well developed and some had lots of depth and warmth (i.e. Papa).
B006LSZECO|4|Could not put down. Riveting from start to finish.
B00AB7HESI|5|I have the Scribblenauts version for my 3DS but I didn't bring it on a trip. I found an email that Amazon sent letting me know the new deals and apps for my kindle. I saw that this was only $.99 and got real excited, downloaded it right away and played it for most of the trip we took. I even played it in the waiting room waiting for my nails to get done. Pretty close to the gaming console versions and pretty cool.
B000002G26|2|when Bryan Adams first came out i dug his stuff.songs such as cuts like a knife,run to you,somebody,summer of 69,heaven were catchy.but then he went into mellow mold.his music has gotten super sappy and boring.
B0020BUWX2|5|Great read!
B000JMKTLO|3|Nowhere near as good as &#34;Gone Girl&#34;. I did get to the end of this one, but was disappointed
B006OCM0G0|5|restraunt story is the best thing since farmstory i love it!!! i give it &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; five stars!!!!!<br /><br />but the gems drive me CRAZY please lower the prices or remove them
B00846REIS|4|Thought it was quite different than \\"Fifty Shades\\". Ms. Day is a true artist in writing this book. Truly a good read.
B00FEMJF6O|5|I've played this game for a year now, and I still haven't tried of it. It's my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; game on my Kindle . No bad experiences here.
B00005BJ2O|5|For the few disbelievers out there (aka movie critics), this film is going to be HUGE!  Saw it last week at a preview in SF and the hype is all true... people clapping during sequences, standing ovations, etc.  And with close to the highest per-theater box office ever in its opening bow in NYC and LA, should be massive.  The tango-fied Roxanne sequence is visually and musically incredible and Ewan's first singing lines in Your Song are absolutely chilling!  Get the CD, see the movie, and hope that Baz gets out there to make another film asap.
B007EC27QM|5|great. love the large size - easy to use.
B003TML0VO|2|The first thing I noticed about this CD was the title, and I must admit this is a bad title. These songs are definitely NOT, in my opinion, the greatest guitar songs of all time. That being said, I'm a HUGE Santana fan and was really looking forward to listening to this album. I couldn't wait to hear Santana's interpretation of these songs and was hoping he would have some monster guitar playing on here. Boy, was I disappointed. At best, some of the songs are OK (I like the spanish guitar-influences on While My Guitar Gently Weeps. I also think the guitar playing on Sunshine of Your Love is top notch). But a lot of the songs left me with a \\"What were you thinking\\" frame of mind. The version of Back in Black is ridiculous, and Dance the Night Away was equally as disappointing. They sound generic, the guitar doesn't seem to be the focus of the recordings, and the overall quality is not up to par with Santanta's past efforts. Simply put, the album has no flow to it. I know Santana has released other CDs with various singers, but those flowed well and sounded great. This doesn't. Had I listened to this before I bought it, I would not have purchased it.
0465043577|2|I knew this would be a complicated read when I bought the book. I have to say that the book leaves you with a rather empty feeling. Mandlebrot's discovery of fractals is one of the major advances in 20th century thought. It is understandable that his ego is as large as his discovery. I don't have a problem with that. If you are interested in fractals in general, or in Mandelbrot personally, you might consider the book a hit. But this is not supposed to be a book about fractals in general or Mandelbrot. It is supposed to be a book about the fractal nature of markets. Sadly this is where the book falls short. My guess is that less than half the book is actually about markets and the gist of the commentary is that markets are more volatile than we expect them to be. 100 pages to explain that markets don't fit standard deviation or bell curves. Hey, I already expected markets to be volatile. Taleb's, The Black Swan or Gunthers, The Swiss Axioms would be much more valuable for those interested in markets. This book is a hit for fractals but a miss for markets. That's why I rated it two stars.
B004EPYZZ8|2|The dvd arrived promptly, but was scratched in places. We used it anyway, because it was for a birthday party and did not preview the movie.
0920668364|5|Wonderful story that makes it's point clear. The love between a mother and child is special and everlasting. Some of the reviews are odd and point out a darker meaning behind this lovely story. Read this book many years and never made the connections these people make. I guess Snow White had questionable a relationship with the seven dwarfs?? How about Pinocchio?? What did that old man really want with a little boy? Hate to go there, however, some people can turn a sweet story into a seedy one!
B002YCVWXQ|3|Silly surprise ending asks too much belief suspension of the audience.
B000PTYPAC|5|I loved paramores first CD but didn't get around to listening to her last songs, even though i had the CD for a year. But this CD was the best the more and more i listened the better it got. Usually songs on CD's go from good to bad so no one listens to the last songs, but i loved every song. I still always have some song by them stuck in my head from listening to it so much in the summer. Buy it, it's worth every penny.
B000GKW4HG|5|These Papo dinosaurs are by far the best dinosaur toy/sculpts I've ever bought. I'm an artist by trade and the quality of each toy blows me away. Very detailed sculpts, wrinkles, scales and skin stretching are all visible. The paint job is always extremely well done. It seems to be a combination of ink wash, dry brush and airbrushing where needed. The small scale detail really pops when given this paint treatment. The toys are made of a very durable plastic, but you might not want to be rough with them because there are some very thin areas on a few dinos. Arms and fingers of the theropods could break off. Hasn't happened to any of mine yet and my kids play with them, but not harshly.<br /><br />I'm going to be duplicating this review for all of the papo dinos that look really good.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Interesting insight into history.
B0058EBNAO|4|Love this ap, don't like clutter on my phone but devoted a whole page to the widgets for this one. Options are fantastic for customization by the menus can be a little confusing... Beautiful graphics.
B004RSCWZ2|5|when tedeschi and trucks got together that was a good match to bring us there good southern music for all to enjoy it get a copy
B00JVUAJ2O|3|This season continues the abysmal drop in quality but as someone who loves this world, I continued to watch and continued to be disappointed. To think I paid for this. I strongly suggest for those who haven't seen it yet, wait for it to get on Amazon Prime because you will be sorely disappointed.
B005NJ2K6U|4|Pretty cool game, just way too many mb's for what it is. Clear out some space on the SD card for this one.
B000AADYRQ|4|Plans is a wonderful album. Not nearly as emotional or put together as Transatlanticism, but there are some beautiful songs on there that I know, according to Death Cab's evolution over time, could not have been made on any previous album. The only song that strikes me as odd is \\"The Stable Song.\\" I kind of just don't like it. But who knows, maybe I'll grow to like it, just like I grew to love \\"Natural Anthem\\" (Postal Service). Actually, I would've preferred if DCFC made an EP instead of a full-length...I feel like there's this pressure to fill a quota so some songs are rather pretty but also pointless (i.e. Different Names for the Same Thing). <br /> <br />For those who shop by song, I recommend the following: <br /> <br />    * Marching Bands of Manhattan <br />    * Soul Meets Body <br />    * Summer Skin <br />    * I Will Follow You Into the Dark <br />    * What Sarah Said <br />    * Brothers on a Hotel Bed <br /> <br />Marching Bands and Soul are probably the most talked about songs thusfar because their sound is the newest for DCFC. Lovely, in-love lyrics (Marching, I feel, has a tinge of the unrequited with it's \\"Your love is gonna drown\\" -- beautiful words by the way). I was elated about Soul Meets Body because there are simply not that many in-love songs being written now. <br /> <br />The real gems of this album, however, must be What Sarah Said and Brothers - retaining the simplicity of Transatlanticism, even transitioning into each other in one recording a la Tiny Vessels --> Transatlanticism --> Passenger Seat. What Sarah Said is definitely my favorite right now. The piano part sweeps through your headphones (yes, new Death Cab fans, DCFC is only fully appreciated with decent audio equipment), climbing high, starting low in one ear and flying off into the other, quickly so that your closed eyes follow it like watching birds take off one by one. And then the ending. Oh wow, the ending - easily reminds me of \\"I need you so much closer. So come on.\\" Myfavorite lyric of the album so far: <br /> <br />But I'm thinking of what Sarah said, <br />That \\"love is watching someone die.\\" <br /> <br />So who's gonna watch you die? <br /> <br /> <br />Sarah dealt a lot with death, and the first verse is pure genius. <br /> <br /> <br />And it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to Father Time <br />As I stared at my shoes in the ICU that reeked of piss and 409 <br />And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself that I'd already taken too much today <br />As each descending peak of the LCD took you a little farther away from me <br />(Away from me) <br /> <br />Yet Brothers is definitely the more beautifully composed of the two - starting off slow and then surprising you with a beat you'd think to find in a trance mix. It will definitely hit a chord with most, more so than Sarah, especially if you're like me and suddenly realize while listening to Sarah, \\"Hmm, but [significant other's name here]'s not dying.\\" Brothers is a little more mellow, a goodbye that makes you sad but you've accepted it.  Also, I can relate to it a bit more. <br /> <br /> <br />And I have learned that even land-locked lovers yearn for the sea, like navy men <br />'Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides <br />Like brothers on a hotel bed <br /> <br /> <br />I think the major difference between Transatlanticism and Plans is that Transatlanticism was much slower. The pace gave you time to absorb each note and every word to its full emotional potential, in turn using all your breath when you sang along. The theme of missing someone seemingly an ocean away in itself is just a much slower feeling, much more empty, so it makes perfect sense for one instrument to do its thing at a time, simple and true. I feel that the emotions that Plans wants to convey are much more complex in themselves and so the million parts at once makes sense, an attempt to recreate that nostalgic, yet full feeling in your chest. Plans is definitely fasterpaced, with Sarah fit for a walking pace and Brothers good for a leisurely stroll. (Transatlanticism was intended for a state of rest, otherwise something would have conflicted - your heartbeat with the drums.) <br /> <br />Transatlanticism, having the luxury of covering a relatively simple emotion, was able to work with that and create the rollercoaster: the intro with The New Year, gradually laying out the story and the mood, until it suddenly hits you with Tiny Vessels, where your heart drops and you're a goner. If played at the right point in life, you're an emotional wreck from Tiny Vessels to Transatlanticism, and then comforted with every song afterwards - namely Passenger Seat and A Lack of Color. <br /> <br />Plans could not do this. <br /> <br />So Transatlanticism is indeed the stronger album but I don't think it's because of a lack of ability - as seen in the key songs of Plans - but because of the lack of focus. <br /> <br />A blessing in disguise, though. Those who had difficulties listening to Death Cab in the past (and yes, Transatlanticism was quite a hard album to listen to and appreciate) will find their work done for them with Plans. It is incredibly easy to listen to Plans, easy to see wonderful lyrics and hear pretty music. <br /> <br />For me, Plans could be a letter I sent to someone today, perfectly applicable, strategically timed in its release date (\\"Then Labor Day came and went and we shed what was left of our summer skin.\\")
B00633W614|5|Jeffrey Archer is a very gifted writer.  I couldn't put this book down and couldn't wait to read the next one.
B008Y212PI|4|Similar to picross.  only complaint is that pictures revealed don't exactly match the shapes you uncover.  game is challenging but not so hard you can't figure the puzzles out.
B001GZ6QEC|5|Fast shipping, product as described. Super clean discs
B002KDSBGA|5|It has been years since Ive seen this movie and it is still a great movie. Nice clear picture, glad they didnt colorize it. Disappointed that this wasnt one of the Prime movies.
B004LP3AYI|5|Amazing story with lovable characters, has some slow points and every book is littered with filler explaining the past books but always recommend for any fantasy reader.
B000FBFN1U|4|This book was amazing. Another too long story for my liking but amazing regardless! This was much better than book two. So much happened in this book that I can't even begin to describe it. The author did a great job pulling us into his world of dragons, knights, killings, kings and plain ol' whores. I loved it! I can't wait to read the next one.
B0060MYM7O|5|We wanted to start from the beginning instead of starting in season three so we were glad we<br />did.  Now that we are caught up we are looking forward to season four.
B0028R3NCU|5|got this as a spare for at work, works perfectly
B003YL4LYI|5|Great
B009CPES4I|4|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a winner. No violence or<br /><br />There is no violence or exotic sex scenes in this movie. It is intelligently crafted and develops the characterization of each actor. A must see.
B002SSUQFG|5|For such a low price ($50) I wasn't expecting much from the watch. Honestly I was just hoping to try out using an automatic watch before dishing out for a more expensive one. Now that I've been wearing it for a week or so, I feel completely satisfied with this one! It has kept perfect time (admittedly, it is still a little early to tell) .. The elegant face makes it easy to read at a glance and is very attractive over some of the more gaudy or bold designs. It isn't a huge face like some of the recent watch designs, but I feel it looks very nice while being comfortable and convenient.
140130916X|4|I do love the movie PS I Love You, but let me tell you something, THE BOOK IS NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE!!! we all know that people say the book is better, or a little different here and there, but let me tell you something, it's completely different! The book was okay the movie was GREAT. Perhaps if I read the book first I'd say the book was GREAT and the movie was okay.
B0020BUWX2|3|I thought the book was good, the ending , well I don't want to give it away, I was a little disappointed.
B003IPC5SO|5|From the stunning cover art to the songs, this is a perfect album. Heavy on dance tracks with a few pop songs thrown in, this is a can't miss album and should have been huge. It wasn't though, but that hasn't stopped me from listening to it every day.
0143118420|5|this is an absolutely great good and I read from beginning to end in a heartbeat!!!!  very insightful and humorous at the same time!
B0001NBMBC|4|Well, my favorite band didn't give me what i really wanted to hear.  I thought that Corey (#8) would be dropping F-bombs and stuff, but he just doesn't.  He wanted to get out of what they had made themselves- he said.  They wanted to become better artists, than what they had been.  U can still be artists, and cuss all the time.  The cussing just gave the other albums more feel to them.  Plus, Corey hasn't got all of that Stone Sour crap out of him.  I really dont feel like listening to the acoustic guitar, especially when im listening to SLIPKNOT!  I don't mind the Xylophone though.  This album is more melancholy, and dull, compared to the previous two.  Those were just full of hate and rage.  Well, the 9 angry guys just finally softened up.    <br />This album is groing on me though.  I still do like to hear all the screaming, and the fast rap which still does include hatred, but not enough.  Vermilion pt. 2 is acoustic, but im starting to like it, even though im dissapointed that slipknot is doin that.  In that song, to me, i think when Corey says &quot;She isn't real, i can't make her real&quot;, i think that he is talking about &quot;Love&quot;.  I think this cuz, in all of his albums, he has never talked about how he has liked anything, besides &quot;Hate&quot;.  I love Corey's attitude, and cuz of his badass attitude, slipknot has had great success.  Pulse of the Maggots is an awesome song, dedicated to all of the pathetic people out there.  Im not pathetic, but i love it.  I love the rest of the cd too i guess.  I need to get used to it more cuz Slipknot won't be makin another cd for a while.      <br /> I am still a HUGE slipknot fan (aka MAGGOT).  The best part too them is their MASKS.  They are so cool to look at.  Mick's mask is my least favorite, but it is still cool.  Shawn's clown mask is still cool, even with the bandage around it.  I miss Sid's gasmask, but oh well.  And Corey's is awesome, like before.  I hope their next cd, which wont be coming soon, will have a PARENTAL ADVISORY sticker on it.  Then i'll know Slipknot is returning to old habbits along with their new ones.  <br />SIC
B00B5HQKNI|5|Outstanding! Action at a high level.  Always a pleasure to see the sites and characters - the roles are well filled.
B007L6VR12|2|Oddly, in a movie where your emotions should be vested in what happens to two misfit runaway kids, in \\"Moonrise Kingdom,\\" you just don't care.  The problem is that none of the characters connect emotionally in the film. The dialogue is delivered in a robotic, deadpan way throughout, such that what you get is dialogue trying to sound cutesy but without any real emotional connection to the people who are actually delivering the dialogue.  It's almost like robot-speak.  This becomes tedious, affected and deadening, and unfortunately the script is far less eccentric or humorous than it would seem to believe itself to be.  Here's about as close to any real bond as we get between the runaway boy and girl, starting with the girl: \\"It feels hard.\\" \\"Do you mind?\\" \\"I like it.\\" \\"You can touch my chest.  I think they're gonna grow more.\\" I mean, is this for real?  It sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks by way of David Mamet.  Even as the movie spins out of control at the end, which is all too predictable, you don't really care about any of these characters.
B0055OO4V2|5|Excellent...

B00280LYIC|5|Reading this book to my boys has sparked an interest in mythology and in reading. We will continue to read the series together.
B0000AXE8I|5|By itself this film gets 5 stars but when viewed with Revolutions it gets about a three.  I'll explain more about this later.  When I saw the film in the theaters I was blown away.  It was a combination comic book come to life, a philosophical excercise and a rumination on the great conspiracy theories.<br /><br />There are very few movies that make me literally sweat while watching them, Saving Private Ryan and The Exorcist being two examples.  This movie had so many of them I was exhausted after seeing it.  I'm an avid motorcyclist and the chase on the freeway made my knees weak.  I haven't watched the behind the scenes making of the chase on the DVD just because I don't want to ruin the magic.  I'm sure 90 percent of it was done digitally but it doesn't matter while watching the film, it's that well done.  The ghost twins are the best movie villains since Darth Vader.  The scene with Morpheus slicing the SUV open is a visual work of art.<br /><br />All of the action in the world wouldn't amount to anything if the story was no good but this one is interesting and fun to follow.  The twists, turns and theories presented kept my cousins, brother and me discussing the possibilities for a few days after seeing it.  I totally disagreed with critics and fans that the dialog and story line dragged down the action.  The first Matrix was a good, solid, streamlined science fiction story where this one is dense and complex but it never overwhelmed the action.  I think anyone who had that complaint also had a short attention span.  There were some slow moments in Reloaded but I remember thinking the same thing the first time I saw The Matrix.  And while I loved the story here that leads to the big problem with Revolutions.  The entire build up for this movie was a waste of time.  Everything my family and I discussed after seeing this movie was much more interesting than what was presented in Revolutions.  I felt cheated that the payoff was just a big long fight with no follow up on the ideas presented in Reloaded.  It instantly made Reloaded absolete.  It feels like you're just wasting your time re-watching knowing the end will disappoint.  Revolutions wasn't a complete waste, it was still a decent movie just not the one I was hoping for.

It instantly made Reloaded absolete.  It feels like you're just wasting your time re-watching knowing the end will disappoint.  Revolutions wasn't a complete waste, it was still a decent movie just not the one I was hoping for.  Maybe I had built up my own expections too far.  I did enjoy the way the story ended.

B002JH3TW8|5|I have two of these cables to support some older 400 FireWire drives on new Apple hardware with 800 FireWire ports.  These work flawlessly.  The connectors and cable material are high quality.  There may be some older equipment that may not be supported as suggested in other reviews, but read the specs by Moshi and the specs for your equipment.  Pin out could play into whether there is support for a specific device.  For the reports that reference \\"it broke\\", I cannot imagine the quality of this cable adapter being subject to breakage unless you drive your truck over it.  Great cable.
1416550542|5|A little Dickens, some Secret Garden, a touch of Wuthering Heights and a dose of Grimm's Fairy Tales all rolled together into a story I couldn't stop reading. I don't say that often, but I was really captivated by this book. I'm generally not a fan of having chapters in different time periods with different sets of characters and realized pretty quickly that if I didn't pay close attention to each chapter's place/date note, I was going to be in trouble.  You do have to stay alert to keep the generations straight, but once you figure that out, it isn't too hard to keep it all sorted out, and frankly, I don't know that this story could have been told any other way.<br /><br />I found the writing style very appealing--a good blend of lyrical description and action, and although I yearned to speed things up a bit in places, mostly the pace was good.<br /><br />I really loved the included fairy tales.  They were filled with vivid symbolism and depth and were just dark enough to make them intriguing.  I wish I had the book that is so fondly treasured throughout the story.  (message to Kate: publish illustrated fairy tale book).<br /><br />This is a complex story that spans multiple generations.  Each time period felt authentic to me and I yearned, right along with the modern characters, to solve the mystery of the little girl's identity and abandonment.  Even though I figured out most of what happened sooner than the characters did, I remained interested to learn how all the loose ends tied together, and they did.  I found this book one of the most satisfying and enjoyable I've read in a long time.
B00FX8FY14|5|This song is great. Makes you want to sing along with it and tell your lover, hey this one is for you.
B003YL4LYI|5|I would recommend Dance with Dragons because it continues the story line of The Song of Ice and Fire. It left me with many unanswered questions which hopefully will be answered with the next series.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is my favorite game. I think it's awesome because you get to be all these cool characters and run around and get coins and mystery boxes.

B000002L9B|4|Prince's cinematic follow-up to \\"Purple Rain\\" proved a self-indulgent fiasco, but this engaging album survived the wreckage. \\"Parade\\" (1986) has little filler and a fair share of classic tracks. \\"Mountains,\\" \\"Girls & Boys,\\" \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\" and the minimalist-funky \\"Kiss\\" showcase the eclectic genius at his best. Strangely enough, the music from \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\" (including the effective title ballad) was underutilized in the film itself. Nevertheless, \\"Parade\\" emerged as a welcome improvement over the erratic \\"Around the World in a Day\\" and set the stage for the dazzling brilliance of \\"Sign 'O' the Times.\\"
B000MR9D5E|5|I had no problems with this order. It arrived very quickly and in good shape.  It was exactly what was advertised. Thank you - I would order again.
B006TX276C|4|this cd is pretty straight up...a collection of Davids' work...I like the images that accompany this double set...as well as the construction of the packaged product....so eveything was quite straight up as far as a cd goes...arrived in good shape...and quite speedy in delivery....thanks
B00594XOZU|5|This free app is the best testing app of all time and its FREE too. I would recommend this app to anyone who asks for a good testing app
B00B7Y0206|2|So far it's difficult to use. Don't expect it to respond like the pc version we all are familiar with. So far, I find that all app versions of websites like this are like that. I don't like it.
B00HDMMISA|5|What a great story -  I couldn't stop reading! Loved the characters and I think we all can relate to at least one of them. Great twist at the end. Highly recommend this one.
B00COGZ8FU|5|Worth the time and the monies especially if you are a Tom Cruise fan, he and the rest of the cast did a great job.
B0001NBMBC|5|Volume 3 is a very well done piece of work.Its got something for everyone.I was very impressed with the musicianship on this album.This album is probably going to be the one that that will seperate the fans frome the true fans.Those who really truly loved this band from the start will like this one,and those that say they are fans just because it was cool to like them will be sifted out from the rest.I read some reviews from ppl who claim that \\"This Is Not What Slipknot Stands For\\"and they blame the success of StoneSour for the change..Well My question to you is \\"Who Are You To Decide What Someone Else Stands For\\",And there are only 2 songs that have the StoneSour Feel.If they didnt stand for it,they wouldnt have done it.Now With That Being Said I Will give my opinion on each Track..............Track 1 - \\"Prelude 3.0\\" -3.5 stars-When I first put this cd in and heard this song,I was very dissapointed.I thought that this was going to set the tone for the rest of the album....I Was Wrong.But It is a very poor song to start an album off with.   Track 2 - \\"The Blister Exist\\" -5 Stars-Very good music, I love Joeys drumming.Hes one of the best for this type of music.    Track 3 - \\"Three Nil\\" -5 Stars-I Frikkin Love The Guitar Riff In This Song.And The Small Drum rolls at the end of the song are amazing.  Track 4 - \\"Duality\\" -5 stars-This is the first song that has the \\"StoneSour\\"feel to it.Very Good Song.    Track 5 -\\"OPIum Of The People\\" -4 Stars-I liked the guitar Harmonies in this one.And The Way Corey Harmonized his voice in the Chorus is pretty Good.    Track 6 - \\"Circle\\" -5 Stars- Like alot of people who have heard this one,I was completely shocked.This song is the one that will sift out the true fans from the others,especially if it makes it to radio.And it will make alot of people scream \\"Sell-Out\\".I dis-agree strongly.Like I said before,If they didnt stand for it,they wouldnt have done it.This Is A Very Well Done Acoustic Song.   Track 7 -\\"Welcome\\" -4 stars-Reallywasnt anything Special about this song.It really doesnt have any kind of major things goin on.but its still a decent song.    Track 8 -\\"Vermillion\\"-4.5 Stars-I read some reviews of this album and every review praised this song.Although it is good ,I dont think its as good as some of the critics say it is.It does have a great chorus though.    Track 9-\\"Pulse Of The Maggots\\"-3.5 stars-The Song has a cool opening riff but thats about all I liked about this song.it got very repetitive.    Track 10-\\"Before I Forget\\"-5 stars-This is one Of My Favorite songs on the album.This is the other song that has the \\"StoneSour\\" fell to it.The chorus is very good.    Track 11-\\"Vermillion pt.2\\"-4.5 stars-Another song for people to scream \\"Sell-Out\\" to.This is another Acoustic song.Oh No...God-Forbid Slipknot do something differant.    Track 12-\\"The Nameless\\"-5 Stars-This Is an amazing song.It pretty sums up the sound of the whole album,its got its heavy moments and its mixed with some really (dare I Say)pretty guitar work and vocals.    Track 13-\\"The Virus Of Life\\"-4.0 Stars-This song could of been alot better,its just missing something and I cant put my finger on it.    Track 14-\\"Danger-Keep Away\\" -5 stars-This is probably my favorite song on the album.its the type of song that will put you in a trance.I wish this one was longer than 3 min.The Chorus sounds very Alice in Chains-ish.very well put together...................................................................................................................................................................................Although I really like this album I do have 2 complaints.the first is the quality isnt all that good and in some of the songs the music overpowers coreys voice.And The Second Complaint is with 9 members in the band,you really dont hear that much stuff going on...........I Still Think that there firsst album is there best one,But this is a very close second.It is alot better than Iowa.I reccomend this to everyone who is into this style of music,and dont let all the \\"StoneSour\\" remarks turn you away.................................. Stand Out Tracks Are:    \\"Three Nil\\"      \\"Circle\\"      \\"Vermillion pt.1 & Pt.2\\"     \\"Before I Forget\\"      \\"The Nameless\\"
B002KKF7I8|5|I like that you can self adjust the headband on this headphone so it can either fit on my small head or pass it over to my big headed brother. For the price I would say this is worth it. The ear pad is my favorite, Goes over your whole ear.<br /><br />Ear cushion is soft, Comes with a bonus pouch to carry it.. that's always a plus. Good for long trips or plane rides.
