044024238X|5.0|This book is about a woman who abandoned her entire life, to re-create herself and find new happiness. The book follows the main character while she pretends to know how to be maid...even though she has no idea how to cook or clean. A romance blossoms, and the writing surrounding it is very descriptive, which makes you want to breeze through the book. This is a great way to dive into Kinsella's writing. This book will have you laughing out loud, and blushing at the same time. Good read!
1400063515|4.0|I gave this book a 4 star rating but I really wanted to give it a 3.5 star rating.  That is not an option however, it must be a result of the Gaussian hegemony.  I say 3.5 stars because the import of the subject matter is definitely deserving of 4 stars but the presentation was only worth 3 stars.  I found myself very interested some of the time and bored or confused the rest.      The author insinuated often that the individuals who are users of standard statistical analyses are morons.  While I do agree with him that the statistical methods used in industry are deeply flawed, especially since they are, almost all of the time, manipulated by bias (intentionally or unintentionally), I disagree with his assertion that a new form of analysis will be immune from manipulation.  There is no question, however, that this perspective on random events is very deserving of focused study.    Being a metallurgist, I don't deal with statistics often, but I'm very interested in seeing the results from investigation into this type of thinking.  I think it has great merit and will benefit our understanding of the things around us.
B000063DGC|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time. As a guitar enthusiast, nothing even comes close to the sound demonstrated by Randy. His combination of MXR distortion and classical style brought to life Ozzy's Black Sabbath material. Not to mention, resurrected Ozzy's career.<br /><br />Hits like 'Crazy Train' and 'I Don't Know' are simply amazing. Too bad `Over the Mountain' is not on this album.<br /><br />Of all the styles available to guitar players, I love Randy's the best. It's a shame he's passed on because no one has come close to his level of talent. He was the best.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" is a good film.  The two DVD set is an excellent one.  I enjoyed learning about how Fleming's book had been tangled in legalities and was unable to be made until now.  I also enjoyed the clips of watching interviews with many of the women including Halle Berry and Maude Adams who have been \\"Bond girls.\\"  \\"Casino Royale\\" was even nominated as Best Picture by Oklahoma Film Critics Circle Awards.  Five won Best Sound from the British Academy Awards for the film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig came onto my radar screen in [[ASIN:B0009X7BDC Layer Cake (Widescreen Special Edition)]] as well as a smaller role in [[ASIN:B0009G3B0G The Jacket]].  He played a doctor with Nicole Kidman in \\"The Invasion\\" and will star again with her in \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  As James Bond, he brings an intelligence and intensity to the character.  The scene where he drinks a poison and must run to the car and avoid cardiac arrest was intense and gave a sense of reality, even to this Bond movie.  I felt like Craig's Bond established a relationship with Vesper that made the film's conclusion memorable.  The British Academy Awards honored Craig with a Best Actor nomination for this film.<br /><br />Eva Green who was in \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" and with Craig in \\"The Golden Compass\\" plays Vesper Lynd, a treasury official trying to manage the government's investment in the high stakes poker match.  She won the Orange Rising Star Award in 2006 from the British Academy Awards.  She passes well as the highly intelligent woman.  The plot does have her move into the damsel in distress role during several hacking scenes in the hotel.<br /><br />As the DVD explains, the scenes set in Madagascar were actually shot in the Bahamas.  Sebastien Foucan whose exploits as a free runner bounding over British rooftops plays Mollaka who initiates one of the first chases complete with sky high footraces on a construction crane.  Simon Abkarian plays the Bahamian poor loser Dimitrios who lasts all the way to Miami.  His girlfriend Solange is played well by Italian beauty Caterina Murino.  Mads Mikkelsen who was in [[ASIN:B0002YLCG0 King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)]] plays the chief villain LeChiffre.  His cold ruthless calculation and the blood that drips from his eye make him a chilling villain.  The torture scene where a naked Bond is flogged by LeChiffre was extremely intense and well played by Craig.<br /><br />Judi Dench with her six Oscar nominations and her trophy as Best Supporting Actress from \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" in 1998 plays M with an intelligence and intensity that fits Craig well.  Giancarlo Giannini who was nominated for an Oscar back in 1977 for \\"Pasqualino Settebellezze\\" plays the double-dealing ally Mathis.  Jeffrey Wright who won both an Emmy and Golden Globe for \\"Angels in America\\" in 2003 plays the American CIA agent who is not so good at poker and stakes Bond when Vesper shies away.  Steven Obanno is a rebel leader who follows LeChiffre to the hotel.  He is played with an edgy performance by Ivory Coast actor Isaach De Bankole.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is an excellent Bond for the new century.

B000UR366S|5.0|I've followed Joni ever since I saw her do \\"For Free\\" on The Ed Sullivan Show, in the 60s. Sure I have my favorite albums, like \\"Ladies Of The Canyon\\", \\"Court & Spark\\", and \\"Turbulent Indigo\\"; but I have them all, and like them all. Joni has never been afraid to stretch and explore; lyrically and musically - acoustic, electric, folk, rock, or jazz. \\"Shine\\" is a deep and soulful album with Joni and a few select top shelf musicians. She sings about the current world around her and what it has become (\\"Money makes the trees come down...\\").  Her remake of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" fits in well, still today.  She does offer hope (\\"If\\"). \\"Shine\\" is a another Joni album where she tells it like it is, and offers it all with a very high level of musicianship and production.  Get it.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|I will probably get flamed for saying this, but this series is unfulfilling and lacks any attempt at subtlety or originality. The jokes and dialogue are not particularly insightful, witty, nor relevant - Seinfeld or Friends would be more comical in the same premise. It is not curiously ambiguous and thought provoking the way X-Files was. Rather, it is two dull half-wits wound up in illogical and unbelievable adventures. This is a flat, tedious show as far as I am concerned... but perhaps I was never really into the genre (Charmed, Buffy, etc.). Perhaps compared to those, it fits comfortably among them.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This was my favorite movie in English in high school and I really wanted to watch it again to refreash my memory for a class assignment. This Hamlet is the closest one to the real play and for some reason the way they act it out, it just makes more sence then to crack open my book again. I'm tempted to get \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" also because I forgot how well Kenneth Branagh acts when he's doing Shakespeare. We'll find out soon, won't we?
B000VSBX34|4.0|1965's \\"Help\\", 42 years on, has a refreshing air of innocent fun about it, along with some excellent music and a silly plot involving the Beatles with a mystical but murderous Eastern Cult.<br /><br />It hardly seems possible that John, Paul, George, and Ringo were ever this young; \\"Help\\" captures them as their collective fame had just begun to take hold, but before it devoured them altogether.  The storyline involves a huge ring that Ringo has been given by a young girl.  Unfortunately, the ring is a key prop in an Eastern Cult that periodically sacrifices people.  The Cult, led by Leo McKern in a perfectly hilarious role, is mad to get the ring back and pursues our four young heroes from London to Salisbury Plain to Switzerland to a finale in the Bahamas.  The Cult's exotic plots to get the ring back generate a nice mixture of suspense and madcap chaos, framing a series of pre-MTV music videos featuring such hits as \\"Help\\", \\"You're Going To Lose That Girl\\" and \\"Ticket To Ride.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, there are lots of sight gags and lots more banter among the Beatles themselves.  The humor may be slightly dated and very British, but holds up well.<br /><br />This movie is a priceless bit of collective memory for the baby boomers who remember the Beatles phenomenon as a current event.
B000GGSMB2|4.0|I watched this film on cable recently. I mistakenly thought it was a Martin Scorcese movie, so I looked it up on Amazon to see who the director was. It turned out to be Brian DePalma. Even though this movie is so old, the script was pretty strong.  The photography was good, although it can't compare with today's films.  I'm not really a fan of Pacino, but he was convincing in this movie as a Cuban immigrant.  I did not like the Michelle Pfeiffer character, she was really shallow. There was alot of violence but compared to Scorcese's recent films such as \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Departed\\" it was not really shocking. Hollywood seems to be losing the ability to shock us with violence and language, they need to shock us with better written scripts and more in-depth character development.

I knew this as soon as I learned that the making of this \\"Masterpiece\\" was not so much all \\"Fun and Games\\" as I had originally thought.<br /><br />While watching the \\"out-takes\\", as they call them, I noticed that there was a moment that John Cleese was neither smiling, nor funny...<br />What a jackass he must be to not appreciate the \\"Charmed\\" life he is having at all times.<br /><br />It is for this reason that I highly recommend the \\"Holy Grail, Special Edition\\"...<br /><br />It is funnier than my recommendation.<br /><br />C
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I am always on the look out for movies that are child friendly.

One of the best I have found.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has a refined sense of smell and a love of good food.  His hero is the late, great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), and thanks to his TV show and cookbook, Remy has the knowledge to be one of the best chefs in the world.  The only problem?  Remy's a rat.<br /><br />When Remy's family is forced to evacuate their home, Remy gets separated from them.  He winds up in Paris just outside of Gusteau's restaurant.  Since he can't resist seeing where his idol once worked, Remy sneaks inside.<br /><br />And that's how Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano).  Linguini is the new garbage boy at the restaurant, and he's something of a klutz.  When Linguini accidentally ruins a soup, Remy can't help but fix it.  The new recipe is a huge success, but only Linguini knows that a rat made it.<br /><br />And so beings their partnership.  Remy provides the cooking knowledge and Linguini provides the human form.  Together, they begin to turn the reputation of the restaurant around.  But can they keep their secret hidden?<br /><br />I have been a Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, but this was the first one I didn't love.  Maybe it's director Brad Bird since I didn't like his The Iron Giant, and I had to watch The Incredibles a couple times before I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Maybe I'll enjoy this one more after I see it a few more times because there are lots of things to recommend it.  There are some truly funny parts, especially the scenes where Remy is trying to control Linguini.  And their first scene working together is a riot as well.  The animation is wonderful with a few breath taking shots of Paris.  And I liked the fact that Remy could only talk to other rats.  The fact that the humans and animals couldn't talk is a nice twist on the standard animated film.  And the animators do a great job of using body language to convey their characters every thought and feeling.  And the voice cast of well knowns and unknowns does an excellent job.<br /><br />So where exactly did the movie fall apart?  It was just too busy.  Remy has a storyline with a couple plots.  Linguini has his own issues.  And neither one is really given time to develop fully.  We focus on one issue for a while, then move on to something else.  Item three gets resolved, then we get item four before going back to two, then five, then....  You get the idea.  If they had taken out one of the sub-plots, anyone of them, it would have allowed more time to better develop the plots that remained and even develop the characters better.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the movie really isn't aimed at kids.  I'm not arguing with the G rating.  There just isn't that much action to hold their interest.  Elementary age and above should be able to track the story, so they will enjoy it more.<br /><br />This is an entertaining movie that is worth seeing.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|This was fun to watch, I bought this film after watching 'Hot Fuzz' which was hilarious.  Although Shaun of the Dead was not as funny, it was still a great movie and one that I will watch over and over again.  It was purchased via Amazon.com and as always the service was of a high standard.
0393061310|5.0|First, the book starts off as a bit of a tough read but if you wade through the first 100 pages it develops a flow.  I appreciate the authors unbiased delivery of the facts--displaying no religious, political, or passionate bent that could distort his delivery.      This is an important book that fills in the blanks of questions I have held since childhood on the very nature of human existence and how we ever advanced in the first place.  Everyone should read this book.

B000WSJNWQ|4.0|Egyptian-American Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Metwally) is returning to the United States to see this wife Isabella (Witherspoon) and son.  When a CIA official (Streep) receives intelligence that El-Ibrahimi may be involved with a North African terrorist attack, she orders him subjected to rendition, the policy of shipping detainees to foreign soil so they can be tortured to elicit information from them.  Soon he is being interrogated in part by CIA analyst Duncan Freeman (Gyllenhaal), who comes to believe he is innocent.  Meanwhile, Isabella goes to Washington to try to find her husband.<br /><br />\\"Rendition\\" attempts to tackle a current issue and has mixed success.  The story is compelling, but Anwar's guilt or innocence seems pretty cut and dry.  That robs the story of some of its punch.  Witherspoon and Gyllenhaal, as the leads, seem to have less screen time than would be warranted for lead actors.  Witherspoon has the meater role as the terrified wife, while Gyllenhaal spends a lot of time watching the actions of other characters.  \\"Rendition\\" is a politically charged film that obviously takes a shot at the current administration, and those that may be turned off by that should probably look elsewhere.  Overall, \\"Rendition\\" is a good movie that could have been better.  While slightly disappointed with it, it is still worth seeing.
6305350205|3.0|First off, let's be real. Star Trek V, The Final Frontier is not the worst Star Trek film to date. That \\"honor\\" will always go to [[ASIN:B00005JKHP Star Trek - The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]. No matter how many times they release new \\"Director's Cut\\" versions, that movie was horibble. It had only one redeeming quality: It was the first effort for the Trek film franchise. Compared to that, ST V is quite good.<br /><br />The problems with ST V are many, though. It was William Shatner's first (and only?) opportunity to direct a film. And although he brought an interesting view of the Star Trek universe, the film does fall flat on many levels. The \\"nemisis\\", Sybok, isn't that interesting as a character for Kirk & Spock to play off of. The plot was one dimensional at best. And the final scenes where Kirk and crew are opposing some ridiculous, god-like being is almost laughable. Add to that, the soundtrack was nothing original. Shatner just used the theme that was from the first film, which was then appropriated by the Next Generation show. After James Horner's beautiful, and sometimes haunting, score from Star Trek II & III, and Leonard Rosenman's more upbeat music for Star Trek IV, this re-working of an 8 year-old soundtrack was disappointing.<br /><br />Having said all that, there are some things to like here. The look of the film is different than any ST film before or after. Shatner seem to purposely give it a darker look & feel which I found intriguing, especially during certain scenes. The opening sequence, with the \\"not-so-sane\\" person digging holes out in the middle of nowhere, and then him seeing a horse and rider coming at him partially obscured by the heat waves rising from the desert is just an outstanding look. Also, the scene where Sybok takes McCoy & Spock back to view their inner-most \\"pain\\" is well done and almost hypnotic. But unfortunately, these are small islands in a not-so-great ocean of mediocre scenes. The promise of what could have been after the great lead in of Star Trek IV is, I believe, what makes this movie very disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this movie a pass unless you are buying it only to round out your collection.of what could have been after the great lead in of Star Trek IV is, I believe, what makes this movie very disappointing.

B0000042H4|5.0|I have owned three versions of this classic recording.  My first as a set of cassette tapes that I worked part-time one summer just be be able to purchase.  The second version was an early CD recording, and my third purchase was this remastered set.  This is the definitive listening experience for anyone who loves music, art, poetry and literature.  I have long felt that the musical drama is the apogee of art, in that it combines so many art forms into one experience: poetry, music, singing, instrumentation, narrative, costume design, and set design.  One does not experience all of these by listening to a CD recording, but we all cannot travel to Bayreuth every time we want to experience Wagner.  I own many recordings of THE RING, and eack one has something to offer.  But for sheer enjoyment and power, Solti's RING is it for me.  It is my desert island disc set!
B000TUXL2A|4.0|I love Mark Knopfler, so I tend to buy anything he does. This cd is very smooth.....and interesting. Most of the songs are quite catchy. I tend to listen to it at least twice through while I'm driving around before I change to something else. Golden Heart is still my favorite, but this is definitely second.
B000FVRACK|5.0|Just a few comments on this amazing performance.<br />1.  The technical quality is outstanding.  The picture is crystal clear and there is no static....you could hear a pin drop during the silences.<br />2.  There is a section in this DVD where Rubinstein is listening to and feeling the orchestra's music (when he is not playing).  He is joyously engulfed in the sound.  Seldom do we see this part of Rubinstein because his playing always looks so effortless and his body is so amazingly still except for the movement of his hands.  This footage alone is worth the cost of the DVD.<br />3.  The camera angles are wonderfully creative in a way that draws you into the drama.  I don't think I've ever felt so present in a DVD symphony.  I did not, however, feel this until after Grieg's concerto.  In my opinion, this is when all the musicians go beyond the technical into a very emotional interpretation.<br />4.  If nothing else you can rent this DVD from NetFlix; just don't miss it.  It is a valuable piece of history for all music lovers.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I love this album/CD or whatever they call it nowadays.  My favorite song is \\"Lilian\\" which unfortunately they did not sing at their concert, but \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" and \\"Precious\\" are fantastic, as well!

But really - EXACT same plot as \\"Sid & Nancy,\\" or more recently, the Stones' \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" video.  I couldn't even make it thru a single watching...well, after she quit running around naked, anyway...so I gave my VHS copy to my beloved Ex, who said, at first, \\"hey, ain't that the lil' girl on 'The Seventies Show'?\\"  And then when \\"that lil' girl\\" grew up...QUITE nicely, Ex's husband and I, sort of begrudgingly put down our guitars for a minute and attempted to \\"view\\" \\"Gia\\" with Beloved Ex - that is, until those 2 guys...(brf) kissed.  \\"THAT'S ENOUGH,\\" we screamed in unison,\\" BACK TO JACK DANIELS AND THE GUITARS, I AIN'T INTO THIS $h!+!\\" But, hey: It's all been done before, from \\"The Billie Holliday Story,\\" thru that hideous Striesand/Kristofferson...thing, \\"A Star Is Born,\\" and thru the two mentioned above.

B000001F7J|2.0|In the early to mid-80's KISS had awkwardly evolved into an 80's hard-rock/hair-metal band. Personally I rank Animalize (1984) in the worst 3 or 4 albums of the KISS catalogue. But don't get me wrong, it is still worth a listen if you are a KISS fan (and I think that everyone is deep down).    Unlike the early years when there were four stars in the band,   by this stage it was strictly the Paul and Gene show.  KISS had all but abandoned the sound (and make-up) that had been so successful throughout the 70's.     The harder musical style of this era was definitely more suited to   Paul, whose rangy, powerful vocals often lift an average song. Unfortunately Gene's vocals tend to take it the other way.      Song By Song:    I've Had Enough (Into The Fire) (Paul)  Decent song, near-metal with gutsy vocals. I like the song a lot more now than I did back in the 80's.  At the time I wasn't quite used to Paul's more aggressive, raspy vocals.    Heaven's On Fire (Paul)  A KISS classic, what else can I say.  If it wasn't for this song, I might have given up on KISS back in the mid 80's.    Burn Bitch Burn (Gene)  Gene, what were you thinking?  Somehow this throw-away, trashy 80's rock song has actually aged reasonably well.  Packed full of innuendo such as\\"I wanna put my log in your fireplace\\".    Get All You Can Take (Paul)  Fairly cool rock song.  Perhaps the first use of the \\"F\\" word in a KISS song?  If only Paul's vocals weren't so strained.  Good guitar riff.    Lonely Is The Hunter (Gene)  A boring, mostly pointless exercise in rock.    Under The Gun (Paul)  Another Stanley excursion into thrashy, Judas-Priest-like metal.  A reasonable effort. Unfortunately KISS did a few too many of this type of song in the mid 80's.  This style was done better by other bands at the time.    Thrills In The Night (Paul)  Average commercial rock.  Sounds a bit like a Gene song.  Paul's quality vocals manage to keep it interesting.    While The City Sleeps (Gene)  There are just so manybetter ways to spend three and a half minutes of your life.    Murder In High Heels (Gene)  A decent riff but little else. Gene obviously saw no need for a chorus in this song.  Perhaps he assumed that no-one would get through While The City Sleeps.    The album was produced by Paul with Gene and the overall sound is a bit cheap. The drum tracks were produced by Michael James Jackson (who produced COTN and Lick It Up) and the drum sound is pretty good. Most of the guitar solos are just mindless wank, as was the way at the time.    Overall this is not classic KISS, but it has its moments and contains enough highlights to make it worthwhile.
0060557818|1.0|There are hundreds of reviews here summarizing the plot of `Neverwhere,' so I'll cut directly to my opinions.<br /><br />The main characters are tired archetypes. Richard is the average guy (er, bloke) out of his depth, and then there's the sexy female fighter, the orphan girl with strange powers (who is also sexy), and the sarcastic and selfish mercenary-type. Secondary characters are introduced and often killed a chapter later with no impact upon the plot or the emotions of the other characters or the reader.<br /><br />Gaiman's dialogue can be excruciatingly precious, in a poor imitation of Douglas Adams' style, or it can be aggressively corny: a villain's shout of \\"You're [bleeping] dead!\\" is a real clunker.<br /><br />My understanding is that Gaiman adapted this novel from his TV series of the same title. If so, this is probably why there are extensive descriptions of the sights of London Below - I'm betting there were certain visual devices from the series that Gaiman didn't want to sacrifice in the adaptation. Either way, his descriptive passages are long-winded and strike me as one of several tactics designed to artificially stretch the novel to its 400-page proportions.<br /><br />The most irritating of these tactics to me as a reader is the mile-a-minute referencing of creatures, alliances, places, secrets, etc. that are never explored, explained or ever mentioned again afterwards. When Richard (quite understandably) inquires about these mysteries of London Below, he is almost always told that the subject in question is \\"something he's better off not knowing about.\\" A few references of this type would give this world some color, but they come so thick and fast that I can only conclude Gaiman had no intention of fleshing them out. This level of laziness borders on antagonistic to the reader.<br /><br />There are some cool ideas in here that warrant exploration. \\"Undercities\\" around the world apparently harbor legendary monsters - but where did they come from? Lots of magical trinkets and powers appear, but with little to no explanation behind them they're reduced to a string of deus ex machinas.<br /><br />I was interested enough to finish this book, and I did genuinely want to know how the story ends, but `Neverwhere' so deeply flawed that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I can see why some of its qualities - the episodic nature of the storyline (as noted by another reviewer) and the excessive descriptions of its settings - may have helped make Gaiman's name in comics/graphic novels. But long-form prose is not his medium: the stilted plotting and lack of character development cause me to agree with the reviewer who likened this to fan-fiction.
0767817478|1.0|Change the title and I'll give it three stars. This is NOT Godzilla. This is a movie about a giant iguana that is about half the size of the King of Monsters, and has none of his strengths or powers. I saw this in the theater...only the money I spent kept me from walking out. Search for Godzilla again and purchase the new Gojira/Godzilla Deluxe Collector's Edition DVD. Use this DVD for skeet practice only.
0767817664|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie when it first came out and was pleased to purchase it in dvd format as my vhs had worn out. This is a classic for any horror movie fan. Chris Sarandon is great as the vampire and Roddy McDowall is perfect as Victor Vincent the great vampire slayer. I also liked Brewsters little buddy Evil Ed who starts out helping Charlie with ways to kill the vampire but eventually becomes a member of the undead portraying a very good werewolf type creature. We watch it every year on Halloween and basically anytime I want to see a well made horror flick. So set back, turn out the lights and beware of a sinister pair of red eyes that may be watching you from your window. You'll see at the end of the movie. Nuff said.
0446577391|5.0|Baldacci has written another outstanding story about the adventures of the Camel Club.  It doesn't matter whether you read his previous books (but you should), you'll get right into the thick of the Clubs latest adventure.  Loaded with suspense, twists and a great ending - Stone Cold is a winner.  David Baldacci has a great writing style - short chapters which alternate dueling story lines, and each chapter is full of adventure.  This is a don't miss read!!!!
B0001I55OC|4.0|timeline is another one of those well done flicks that take place in a whole different era. it was a good one for me. the cast itself did a nice job, and the whole story was sweet. a group of archaeologists on a dig led by professor edward johnston. are just beginning to uncover the castle of la roque in france from back in the 14th century. when they happen to stumble upon a lens piece that wasn't yet invented in that time. getting suspicious and with professor johnston missing they head to itc, where they find more answers than they expected. itc being this corporation who's been in the process of inventing a different way to ship things from here to there, when they accidently discover a wormhole that leads back to 14th century france. time travel, if only. but here you can. that's where the professor happens to be, and they must go and locate him to bring him back. so goes chris, his son, kate his student as well as francios, and marek, his assistant. it's a once and a lifetime deal, and it's risky and uncertain, but they must do it for the professor and the experience. once gone, they're on their own. then something unexpected occurs and who knows if they'll ever be able to get back at all. so they are on a time limit and they are putting their lives at great risk. hoping the experience would be a short one, they are in for a big adventure, and a fight for their lives, as well as unexpected romance. will they mess up history and change the future, or will they become history. it's a race against time both in the past and present. a good ride all the way through. the battles and the era were done very well. paul walker, you can't help but notice him. gerard butler, very well done. great actor. makes his own mark. action, adventure, and romance blend them all together like this and you can't miss.
0143038419|3.0|Eat, Pray, Love.. was a joy to read. Ms. Gilbert is a accomplished writer. I did not know what to expect from this book. What I got was mostly witty and profound. I really enjoyed her humor. Her struggles were real. Her spiritual tranformation was inspirational. I have rarely read a book that didn't provide me with something to think about and some wisdom to take with me. This book was no exception. Saying all this, however, I did have some difficulity with the book. It is hard for a person without the money, fame, success, contacts, etc. of Ms. Gilbert,to relate to a lot of the book. I thought my chances of following in her footsteps quite remote. Ms. Gilbert is obviously a very intelligent women with an amazing grasp of cultural literacy. Some reservations aside, I would recommed this book to a friend.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This film about forbidden love during a time when coming out of the closet could get you killed is truly heartbreaking.  The screenplay stayed true to the short story and the actors took on their roles with maturity and dedication.  Anyone who refers to this film as 'that Gay cowboy movie' has probably not watched the entire film.  The story goes far deeper than sex.  Excellent writing and direction as well as beautiful scenery.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I'm not entirely sure what kind of sound Britney was going for on this album. She experiments with several different kinds. And it seems as though she's trying to invent a new sound that hasn't been done before. It's a mix of dance, trance, and techno. This new \\"sound\\" is found on several tracks on Blackout. The sound is so different that I've found it a little hard to get use to. I had to give the album several listens before I could fully appreciate the new direction Britney is taking her music. She's saying goodbye to bubble gum pop and introducing us to some very interesting tracks. The album's first single \\"Gimme More\\" is probably the most popish song on the album. The next track \\"Piece of Me\\" has a very unusual feel to it. The lyrics are fitting. Brit basically talks about all of the attention she gets from the media. The beat is unusually catchy, with jarring sirens and some cool sound effects. This track seems to be a fan favorite. The next track is \\"Radar\\". This is a very fun upbeat song. It's simple, not too over the top like some of the other tracks. The following track, \\"Break the Ice\\" is one of my favorites. It's incredibly sexy and delivers some fun lyrics. It's also got a great beat. The next track is \\"Heaven on Earth\\". This song has got a techno vibe to it. It reminds me of 80's rave music. It's a fun track you can just zone out to. Next we have a string of bizarre tracks...\\"Get Naked\\", \\"Freakshow\\", \\"Toy Soldier\\", and \\"Hot as Ice\\" are almost unbearable to me. None of these tracks have a steady beat and the melody in each one is all over the place. Like I said, this new sound Britney experiments with on Blackout doesn't work for all of the tracks. When I put this album on I literally have to skip past these four tracks because they sound messy and disorganized. Next is \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\". I like this song because it has a nice melody and it's got a laid back vibe to it. It's not as much of a dance number as some of the other songs. The next track is \\"Perfect Lover\\". I love this song. It's got a great beat, it's incredibly sexy, and the lyrics are hot. This track would be a great club banger. The last, and for me the most memorable track on the album, is \\"Why Should I Be Sad?\\". I love this song. It's the closest thing to a ballad on Blackout and the lyrics are great. I would like to see Brit release this as a single so she can put Kfed to shame. He's a creep and he deserves to get ousted for the things he did to Brit (which she talks about on this track). As a whole this album is different than anything out right now. Most people will put it in a pop category. But this is definitely not pop music. There are a couple of pop tracks, but this album experiments with several different sounds. It was practically made for underground clubs and raves. However, the album is a little too out there at times. But still, it's worth a listen. And it definitely shows that Brit's still got a little fire in her, despite what we see in the media.      My favorite tracks:    1. Why Should I Be Sad?  2. Perfect Lover  3. Break the Ice  4. Ooh Ooh Baby  5. Radar
B00009Y3L4|5.0|`Cabaret' is one of my all time favorite movies and is my favorite musical every recorded to film.  It is, with all due respect, a perfect film.  It's witty and charming, much like you'd expect from a film in this genre.  The music is entertaining and wild, much in the vein of the recent `Chicago'.  The acting is top notch and to a degree downright iconic (Liza Minnelli gives one of my favorite female performances ever here).  What sets `Cabaret' apart from the rest though is that it is far more than just a good time musical for it breaches deeper and darker subjects like racism, loneliness, unwanted pregnancy and some `taboos' as well.  It manages to deal with these concerns beautifully and delicately.<br /><br />The film is based on `The Berlin Stories' by Christopher Isherwood and revolves around a young man named Brian who moves to Berlin in the early 30's.  He rents a room across from the eccentric and spirited Sally Bowles.  Sally works at the Kit Kat Klub, a local Cabaret theater.  Sally is aggressive and desiring and soon Brian falls in love with her.  The film presents many tests to their relationship including a Baron who falls in love with not only Sally but Brian as well.  As Nazi power rises in Berlin trouble arises as well for not only our two main stars but their close associates as well.<br /><br />The Cabaret, a free spirited form of expression, is used throughout the film to address the current feelings or mood the film is attempting to get across.  There are musical numbers poking fun at the Nazi regime, numbers addressing the destructive power of greed as well as the love triangle.  As you watch you will see how the events taking place outside the Klub coincide with the musical numbers taking place within.<br /><br />The acting is astounding here.  Liza Minnelli is of course the HUGE standout but fellow Oscar winner Joel Grey is electrifying as The Master of Ceremonies.  They play off one another brilliantly and serve up one of the greatest on-screen teams of all time.  As they prance around the stage in perfect unison singing songs like `Money' the audience is deadlocked on their every move and even apart they are astounding.  Joel Grey parades about the stage in numbers like `Two Ladies' with such comedic grace that he comes off like a singing Charlie Chaplin and Liza Minnelli is so musically talented that when she belts out her final song you are dying to hear some more.  Michael York does a fine job with his role but he has no chance when sharing the screen with Minnelli of standing out, she is far too magnetic.<br /><br />In the end all I can say is that `Cabaret' is orgasmically good.  Bob Fosse directed a pure masterpiece here that in any other year would have won the top prize (as much as I LOVE this film I can't deny that `The Godfather' is the better film).  If you haven't seen this film yet (and you may not have, it took me a long time to get around to it) please see it immediately.  If you are a fan of recent musicals like `Moulin Rouge!' or `Chicago' then you will adore this film for it far surpasses those very films we've come to know and love.me.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|If you havent heard of these guys... it's basically Creed with a new lead singer.  Im sorry, I dont care what people think, Creed wasnt a bad band to begin with, ditch Scott Stapp's boring and played out vocals, for their new lead singer, and add more of a hard rock edge and you have a great album.  That was true for their first album, not a bad song throughout.  Im happy to say that their sophomore album is even better.  Their new lead singer's vocals are amazing, one heck of a voice.  Their sound is great, rock with a nice hard rock edge from time to time.  There isnt a bad song in the whole album, so these guys are 2 for 2.. how often can you say that about a band??  You can listen to BOTH of their CD's all the way through without hitting the \\"next track\\" button.   Now that's an accomplishment!
0143038419|1.0|So THIS is what all the noise is about?  I guess I too could write a \\"memoir\\" about my trip to Italy and all my great meals and drone on and on about my ex boyfriend.  The India section?  Total impenetrable stereotype.  Indonesia?  Hunh?  Another work from a moneyed, privileged NYC writer that makes women appear superficial.  I'm embarassed to have bought this.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I remember being very excited when Grindhouse first came out. I was, and still am, a big Robert Rodriguez fan. And I liked Kill Bill Vol. 1 but not any other Tarantino film since \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" Yet the night came and my friends and I bought our theatre tickets. All I can say is that it was a good thing for us that \\"Planet Terror\\" came first. Because after the last of the fake previews, when \\"Death Proof\\" began, I started to fall asleep. This is a movie that has the worst car chases, and the most one-dimensional characters I've seen in a long time. Now granted this was supposed to be a homage to the genre of the exploitation flick. But that doesn't excuse having a 30 minute circling steady-cam shot of four women chatting about nothing in a diner. I'm serious, it looked like he just went to a damn Denny's and left the camera running. yet the worst of it was that not even the great Kurt Russell could save this crap fest. The only silver lining to the whole grindhouse experience was that the movies were released onto DVD sperately. So if you want to watch a good Tarantino film, check out \\"Resevoir Dogs\\", or \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and let this one rot at the bottom of the bargain bin.
B000URDEB0|5.0|This is a very special album, for those who can take it that is...I wasn't sure what to expect but judging form the picture of the artists online it was going to be quite a ride! I loved all the songs and the marriage of orchestra with hard metal and some make believe dialogue that made me feel as if I was watching a raunchy version of Lord of the Rings.    I cant recommend this album enough for those who think that symphonic power metal is delish, I am such a person. It's also a funny coincidence how so many bizarre and cool at the same time musicians emerge from Finland, it's quite a place for creative existence.      Poet and The Pendulum is glorious, starting off as an eerie fairly tale reminiscent of movies such as \\"The Company of Wolves\\" which is a dark take on the Little Red Ridinghood story as one can literally hear snow falling and soft whispers reeling in the bait, followed by something dark brooding nearby by. That is taken over by a glorious army of guitars wrenching the listener from make believe onto a battlefield of sound and energy. The latter part of the song reminded me of one of my favorite fantasy movies \\"Kull the Conqueror\\" which is a glorious marriage of orchestra and metal. The vocals are sweet and powerful which makes the sound glisten like a blade of an ax ready to strike imaginary forces. The song is loud and long with many different dynamics and themes, changing from a sad cello to a mosh pit showdown.      7 Days to the Wolves is another fantastic piece, it's different I know, so different in fact that people can have a hard time understanding it but I can blast it of as loud as my poor ears can take it and it even makes me walk faster if I'm listening to it on my ipod. There's no way that I can listen to it and not feel like I'm in a different universe. The guitars here are pure pleasure and give the song a movie like feel, for someone who loves soundtracks this one tasty morsel. The violin in this one song, about half way thought almostmade me cry when it clashed with the guitar not to mention the vocals on top, oh man...good stuff.    The best part of this album is the crazy mix of sounds, from war ballet to battle music and ballads with an edge this is one cool piece of music. Honestly I love all the music on it but the two pieces I dissected a bit are my favorite, even my dad likes Nightwish, but hey he's a cool dude who is into martial arts and all this funky movie stuff, so it makes sense! For all the picky critics out there, go ahead, rip it apart but it only matters how each person perceives it, I don't want everyone to like this, it will make it common and washed out, I respect Nightwish for creating what they like to hear and I am proud to admit that I love all their creations. The effort and creativity breathe in this album, the full chorus and what I am imagining to be a huge string section adds seductiveness and fairy tale like charm that stands out, add a little heavy metal and presto, a winner!    Happy listening, don't forget your battle ax...    - Kasia S.
0345494768|5.0|This is a great book covering everything top to bottom. The level of detail is amazing, there are many things I have learned that I didn't know previosuly. If you are looking for the definitive book on Star Wars, this is it!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie will appeal to the young and adult alike. If you are one of those people who likes watching cooking channels this movie is sure to please.  The story centers around rat who becomes an unlikely star chef.  I beg to differ that \\"anyone can cook\\" as the movie claims..I certainly can't but I love to watch!
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I used to refuse to give Michael Buble' credit for anything.  I thought of him as just a pretty boy who sang covers and standards.  Since he was singing mostly quality, familiar material, I knew that of course some people were going to like him.  What I didn't understand was why his albums were selling as well as they were.<br /><br />Then I heard \\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\".  I heard it over and over, I loved it, and finally I decided that I had to find out what this was all about.  I listened to samples and heard enough to buy this CD.  And what I found is that Michael is a talented guy with a strong but smooth voice and a romantic nature, capable of great variety in his work.  In \\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\", he manages to convey the intensity of the relationship as well as its fragility and probable doom.  But he is equally at home doing Swing (\\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\", \\"I've Got The World On A String\\", and \\"That's Life\\", which includes a touch of gospel), earnest ballads (\\"Lost\\" and \\"Dream\\"), light breezy pop (\\"Everything\\"), and Latin beats (\\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\").  Speaking of Latin beats, I know Eric Clapton's fans will hate me for this, but I like Michael's Latin take on \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", with tinkling piano and strings, better than Eric's original.  I also single out \\"I'm Your Man\\", in which the singer reveals his rather obvious lustful intent.  In a similar vein, \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" is short on lyrical content, but Michael's urgency, the intense 60's spy-film arrangement and the presence of Boyz II Men make it a very strong track.  On the flip side, his good-natured, self-deprecating humor in \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" makes him seem sort of, um, irresistible.<br /><br />I guess the moral here is \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", because the content may be much richer than you think.
B000W4HJ44|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, even went to theatre to see it before it was out on dvd.  I have to say there is nothing that exciting about this movie, I much prefer the original picture with Ricki Lake.  The parts with Jon Travolta were alright but the makeup could have been better all they had to do was cover his hairy knuckles.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is the album where Pantera really hit their stride.  Cowboys from hell was really good but it had some hair metal moments and operatic vocals(besides cemetary gates) are just not my thing at all.  But with this CD the lyrics are powerful and intense without being overdramatic and the music is amazingly heavy with just enough groove to it.  One of my favorites of all time

031286504X|4.0|I've had I Am Legend on my list of books to read ever since I read an interview with Stephen King a couple of decades ago where he cited it as one of his favorite books ever.  When I saw that the trailer for the soon to be released movie I knew that if I saw the movie first then I'd never read the book.  I ordered the copy from Amazon that had the coolest cover and read it when it arrived on Wednesday.  First off, I'll be surprised if the newest movielization of this is any closer to the written story than The Last Man on Earth or Omega Man.  The story is very well-played...but I was completely bamboozled by Amazon when I Am Legend came to an end halfway through the book, and I realized that the other half of the book was a collection of short-stories.  I thought I had quite a bit of story left until I realized that the \\"next chapter\\" I had just begun was a completely different story.  I looked the book over, and the only indication that the whole book wasn't I Am Legend was a small phrase on the back just above the bar-code...\\"The complete novel, plus several more unforgettable tales.\\"  I can't really complain...more stories!...but I thought that it could have been a bit more apparent say...on the cover...or the spine...that I'd bought half a book of filler.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|So glad I belong to the people who didn't watch any episode of Friends prior to season 10! 9 whole seasons being discovered...  And this is amazing to be able to get the whole collection in just one box (with a pamphlet and many special features).     We didn't complete the box yet (40 discs!), but so far the Friends are a wonderful team, playing any situation brilliantly. Lot's of fun!    The only snag (sadly had to put 4 stars for that) : two of the six discs we saw so far were damaged. While we took great care removing them from the box, two discs had scratches. One of them was not even readable. The scratch seems to be from the manufacturer [it's not some finger prints!). Amazon sent us a new box.

B00005JPS9|5.0|Based on the anonymous 700AD poem, Beowulf tells the story of the titular hero (Winstone) who lands in Denmark in 507AD to rid the country of its scourge - the monster Grendel (Crispin Glover). Beowulf slays Grendel, but his attempt to kill its mother (Jolie) comes unstuck when her beauty muddies his clarity. Zemeckis picks up where he left off with 2004's The Polar Express and delivers a fascinating looking animated film (this reviewer was lucky enough to see it in Scotland where the screening was in 3D but unfortunately this won't be the case everywhere). Where the story is thin on the ground, Zemeckis's visuals more than make up for it and the film is a treat from start to finish. The 12A rating is puzzling, however, as ultra violence (including dismemberment), nudity and a genuinely freaky-looking monster are all to the fore. Maybe the fact that Beowulf is animation swayed the IFCO, but the characters are so realistic - Gleeson looks like Gleeson, Hopkins looks like Hopkins, Jolie looks like Jolie but, oddly, Winstone looks like Sean Bean - it certainly goes some way to blur the lines between fantasy and reality. Beowulf might exist as only an exercise in how far Zemeckis can take his new look, but at the end of the day it's pure entertainment. Alison Lohman, John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn also lend their voices.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|It took me awhile to buy this, only because 2007 has been a difficult year on the wallet. But I have never not bought a RUSH album. They never cease to put out something good in all their years of putting out stuff to listen to. I've never truly been disappointed by RUSH. There's always something there. And I can think of countless bands where creativity starts sliding to a gradual halt, and it's a basic regurgitation of previous ideas and past glories. And I've never seen RUSH do that. Though VAPOR TRAILS was slightly disappointing, and that was mainly in its sound, there were gems there.<br /><br />Until you get to Snakes & Arrows.<br /><br />For me this has to be one of the best albums they've released in ages. And when I say that, I don't mean it to sound like they've been coasting for years. One of my favourite albums by RUSH is Presto (1989). I think that album is brilliant. I loved Counterparts (1994) almost as much. And it's not to say Roll The Bones, Test For Echo, and Vapor Trails are not worthy of distinction. It was just that Presto and Counterparts were just always in my CD player where RUSH was concerned in the late 80's, 90's and recent years. It was just something about those two albums.<br /><br />When I first heard Snakes & Arrows, it wasn't a wonderful setting. Sitting in a kitchen on a stool, late at night, because it was the only place I could go to get some solitude and time to myself to really listen to it. The first thing I noticed was the vocal sound of Vapor Trails was sort of back. And I think this dropped my sights a bit low on first impressions. Vapor Trails had a kind of \\"sameiness\\" to its production values, and I thought S & A was going to go down the same route. I got 5 songs in, and shut it off. I wasn't disgusted or anything. I quite liked Armour & Sword and Spindrift on first listens. They stood out. But it just wasn't grabbing me.<br /><br />I had purchased the MVI version of the album, and watched as much of the documentary as I could. Heard Lifeson, Lee and Peart speak about the working conditions and how the album was put together. Thought about it. Went back and listened to the CD again.<br /><br />All of a sudden, it clicked. And it was listening to \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" that did it. The first time hearing it, it truly did nothing for me. I liked it, but no urge to hear it again like Spindrift. That second time with the CD, I listened to it. And realised Workin' Them Angels is like \\"Red Barchetta\\" for the 21st century. I heard it. It had the same vibe going through it. And I smiled, because I realised RUSH still do their thing regardless of how people say they abandoned their prog roots to go synth and la de la de la la. RUSH is still there in everything they do. They just do it differently and when the mood is right. Workin' Them Angels revealed RUSH still creating Moving Pictures, but updated and relevant to now, not a repeat of premise.<br /><br />From that point on, I listened to the whole album, and realised it was one of the best things they've ever released. I'm absolutely happy with this album and what's contained within. EVEN though I would have (as a producer) suggested that maybe an instrumental link between The Way The Wind Blows and Hope would connect those two better, or that Hope come after The Main Monkey Business, and segue into The Way The Wind Blows. Maybe that's nitpicky, but I just heard something there in the 3 songs that could've connected them a bit more, made them 3 parts of a whole. My only desire with the finished product. Because what I found in this album was a vibe and feeling running throughout the whole work, and it made it one of the most listeneable RUSH albums in ages. Every song works with one another very well, they all make sense together. And I found my favourite to be \\"Faithless\\". I think that's one of the best songs they've ever written.<br /><br />That's really all I can say. It's one of their most musical albums in years, the inclusion of 3 instrumentals does this album no harm whatsoever, and it's got Faithless on it. I am really quite happy to say this is one of RUSH's best albums ever released. A major thumbs up.it's got Faithless on it.

B000WQ9UA8|1.0|First off the tracks are up beat and catchy! Yeah For Brit! But Where is the slow songs...? Missing! Is it cuz she cant sing high notes so she chooses song that show case no vocal ability or is it that she was to wrapped up in her life to actually notice there was no slow songs...She shows no growth as a Performer (Not Artist) on this album from the last. in fact since the CD \\"Britney\\" she has the same sound and same subjects. It rather boring after awhile. Artist in her Peer Group like Christina Aguilera and Beyonce have evolved both of there sounds. Christina has a Blue old school R&B Feel and Beyonce has created a sound of her own. Also, They both co write every track on their albums. Britney still lacks the Artist quality with only co writing part of the songs and still no vocals. Strange that she based her career off stage performance and as shown at the VMAS she can't do that anymore. What's Left but a over the top pop album that has the appeal of a sophomore CD Sound. Grow up Brit become an artist no a hopeless performer who still lip-syncs all her shows. Bottom line, if you like her Cds Of the past get the Album, if your expecting a more Mature Brit your be disappointed. Just a quick question, Does it seem to anyone else that from her performance at the VMAS, blowing off big named producers like Timbo and Justin, and Neyo, to The Cds Album Art to the Video for \\"Gimme More\\" to the Album itself... that Brit is putting little to no effort to this sorry project? Her fans now are living in the past. She is not the same Britney from three years ago. Let it Go!
B00005O3VC|5.0|What's not to love?   This Python film has so many classic lines and scenes, it's hard to choose the best.  No wonder the play \\"Spamalot,\\" which was \\"lovingly ripped off\\" this film, has been so successful!
B000MR9D5E|2.0|WARNING SIGN: \\"Spoilers\\" abound. If you wish to preserve \\"shark and awe,\\" please read no further. This beautifully shot series captures images never seen and ones that will be lost forever. So much for virtues:    Planet Earth unrealistically emphasizes the dramatic, big, bloody, cutesy, sad, and cuddly. The eco-message doesn't make up for the superficiality.  For the most part Planet Earth, like Wild Kingdom,  seems most concerned with generating emotional responses in humans.     Most of the animals are depicted in a way that appeals to a hardwired emotion \\"big,\\" \\"cute,\\" \\"cunning,\\" fierce.\\"  As for how creatures evolved to be what they are and what makes them tick, we learn little or nothing. We learn a lot about animals killing and get killed.  Like \\"When Animals Attack,\\" Planet Earth shows us only the real world. This is the here and now, and these are the things that are happening, on the surface.  However, nature is infinitely more subtle and varied than the biggest flocks of birds, the scariest looking cephalopod, the biggest herds of grazers, the big cats bringing down an elephant, the big fish eating the seals, and the sad or cute little dramas that serve as appetizers or desserts to the real action.     The helicopter just happens to be hovering overhead at the right moments for encounters between sharks and seals. Of course that's  representative - sharks eat seals. For example, if one dropped a seal into the water from a helicopter I have no doubt that a shark evolved to eat seals would indeed eat it. We are equally interested to witness the random encounter between komodo dragon and anaconda but of course that would be non-credible. Charlton Heston fought the army ants. Charlton Heston fought the talking apes. These are fascinating encounters, but did either happen exactly that way? I have no information about the Planet of the Apes. However, army ants ARE found in South America, so what's the harm of showing what would happen if they attacked a ranch and Charlton Heston had to defend it. And the pathos. The mother defends her eggs, baby etc. but predator gets the eggs, baby, etc. In a tear-jerker \\"Dumbo\\" the baby becomes separated from Mommy elephant. Poor baby follows her tracks - the wrong way. Planet Earth is on the spot to film yet another dramatic incident. Perhaps inspired by Star Fleet's Prime Directive they keep hands off as the sad drama unfolds. Or do they? I was surprised not to see the brutal conclusion.    In almost all other instances ones two minute attention span is amply rewarded. An antelope escapes Cape Hunting dogs, causing an uneasy moment as it swims in a lake ( during which time we are reassured that sooner or later it must emerge. Tick-tock, more footage of antelope swimming). Not to worry! Within a minute, and against production deadlines as we are told in the Commentary, a dead antelope mysteriously turns up. Against all odds the footage of the dogs ripping it apart is captured. We are told the Cape Hunting dogs have to kill once a day to survive. Well, maybe that's just untrue but the point is that nature is \\"kill or be killed.\\" As Dan Ackroyd said in \\"Trading Places.\\" But not really.     In the Simpson's, the Troy McClure-narrated video explains the \\"Food Chain.\\" The ape reaching for a banana is itself snatched by a shark. My children understood immediately that they were watching a parody of the natural world, in this case as brought to them by the Meat Council.

B000068FXX|5.0|Supertramp's fifth album Even in the Quietest Moments was released in April of 1977.<br />In July of 2002, I took a gamble by buying this remastered CD and all I can say is that it is the best disc the band ever recorded.<br />Guitarist/singer/keyboard player Roger Hodgson dominates on this album as witnessed on the album's opening classic track \\"Give a Little Bit\\" (which became Supertramp's first Top 20 hit in the U.S. and had a classic 12-string acoustic guitar riff from Hodgson), the atmospheric title track (which featured another memorable 12-string acoustic guitar riff), the mystical second half opener \\"Babaji\\" (which had Hodgson on piano and guitar and I liked the solo section where it was Roger's guitar and saxophonist John Helliwell's saxophone playing in unison with one another) and the classic epic album closer \\"Fool's Overture\\" (which was almost like listening to a classical work by Mozart or Beethoven and is powerful and rivals other great epic songs from 1977 such as Yes' Awaken, Rush's Xanadu, ELP's Pirates and Pink Floyd's Dogs and also has one of John's best saxophone performances ever).<br />Keyboard player/singer Rick Davies contributed the shuffling whimsical \\"Lover Boy\\" (which was one of the best songs he ever wrote for the band and featured excellent guitar work from Roger), the piano and voice piece \\"Downstream\\" (which ended the first side of the album) and the album's other hit \\"From Now On\\" (which is about someone wanting to escape the dull routine of daily life to go in a fantasy world).<br />I can see why Even in the Quietest Moments was Supertramp's first album to go Gold (500,000 plus copies in US sales) and broke the US Top 20 for the first time in the summer of 1977 peaking at #16, and it is because all of the songs are timeless classics and have withstood the test of time unlike some of the other albums that came out that year (musical mediocrity like Barry Manillow, Thelma Houston, David Soul and Glen Campbell anybody) and sounds just as fresh today as it did then, especially with the remastering job that Greg Calbi and Jay Messina did with this and all of the other A&M albums that were reissued in 2002.<br />Highly recommended!day as it did then, especially with the remastering job that Greg Calbi and Jay Messina did with this and all of the other A&M albums that were reissued in 2002.

But this was a mountain pass, and the only safety for the Greeks that needed time to form and consolidate their forces in preparation for what was to come, and as we well know, time waits for no one!!!  The Spartans gave the rest of the Greeks the time they needed, even though King Leonidas had trouble with his own parliament (as in divided in support)!!!  Still, his action (of the 300) saved the Greeks from what would have been very sure destruction!!!  And there would have been no such thing as a marathon, in or out of the Olympic Games!!
B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles' fifth studio album (and sixth overall) Hotel California was released just in time for the Christmas sale in December of 1976.<br />The album is always regarded as the band's best and for good reason.<br />The album was the band's first album of new material since 1975's chart-topper One of These Nights.<br />A chart-topping Greatest Hits album which hit #1 was released in February of 1976 as a holdover until the band got a proper replacement for guitarist Bernie Leadon whom left in late 1975. Enter solo superstar/ex-James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh as he joined drummer Don Henley, guitarists Glenn Frey and Don Felder and bass player Randy Meisner and went to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida (with some overdubs at The Record Plant in LA) that March to record the band's classic contribution to rock and roll history.<br />The opening chart-topping title track contains one of the greatest dual guitar solos of all time with Felder and Walsh alternating ala Clapton and Allman and the song itself is a treat about a state of mind called Southern California as it was in the 70s. The first chart-topping single \\"New Kid In Town\\" follows and harkened back to the early Eagles sound and tells the story of fame and failure and knowing them as impostors that they are sung by Glenn Frey. The hard rocking Top 20 hit \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" is next and brings Walsh's guitar riff together with biting lyrics from Henley and Frey about excess and self-destruction. The first half ends with the classic \\"Wasted Time\\", which slowed things down again and is a great Philadelphia-soul sounding ballad about a good person in a bad relationship with a beautiful Philadelphia-soul sound type string arrangement.<br />The second half kicks off with the \\"Wasted Time (Reprise)\\" before rocking out again with \\"Victim of Love\\", the only track without overdubs at all. We slow down again with the first Joe Walsh vocal on an Eagles track with the ballad \\"Pretty Maids All In a Row\\" with Joe on piano and synthesizers. Randy's \\"Try and Love Again\\" is a mid-tempo song and would be a great way for Randy to finish his time with the band as he would leave in the summer of 1977. The closing \\"The Last Resort\\" is a great ballad and the lyrics are about the world destroying its environment and is a song that still holds up today.<br />Hotel California deservedly hit #1 on the US album charts (staying there for over eight weeks) upon release in late 1976/early 1977 and has sold a staggering 16 million copies in the US alone and still holds up today, especially with the remastering job courtesy of Ted Jensen in 1999.<br />Highly recommended!ers.

B000M4RG42|4.0|Depressing, but somewhat true to fact!  Good movie.  War hurts.  Terrible aftermath.  Difficult journey.  Not for wimps.  Massively hard to keep morale high.  Relationships in war difficult to maintain after war.  No support network, results in continuing problems, now called PTSD, among other things.  I find something very disturbing, though--no space allowed for balance--the constant emphasis on depression even dampens humor, which is always present during times like these (especially war); its absence is a glaring flaw.  Some will think this 'normal'; not exactly!  Necessity not explained, only expediency.  A mercenary aspect is emphasized, which, although, present, is skewed too much in its emphasis.  This picture seems to say there are no redeeming values to be had from war.  Abjectly--not true!!!
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Pink Floyd singer/guitarist/songwriter David Gilmour released his self-titled solo debut in June of 1978 in the US (was released a month beforehand in Europe).<br />David Gilmour's self-titled effort was recorded during down time in Pink Floyd's history.<br />At the same time David Gilmour was making this self-titled solo album, bass player/singer Roger Waters created demos for The Wall and The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (which would be his second solo album in 1984) whilst drummer Nick Mason was producing artists as diverse as jazz musician Michael Mantler, punk rockers The Damned and art rocker Steve Hillage. Lastly keyboard player/songwriter Rick Wright was making a solo album of his own Wet Dream.<br />David Gilmour's album was recorded in late 1977/early 1978 at Superbear Studios in France with David producing and handling all of the guitars, vocals and keyboards. Also joining him were ex-Roxy Music and eventual Foreigner bassist Rick Wills and Quiver/Sutherland Brothers drummer Willie Wilson, whom both had played with David in the power trio Bullet in 1967.<br />All of the tracks were written or co-written by Gilmour himself (except as noted).<br />This album kicks off with the great instrumental \\"Mihalis\\" which is a great guitar workout for David. The next song is \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" (written by Unicorn member Ken Baker) and is a laid back classic delivered with the minimum of fuss and overdubbing; Gilmour's voice rarely rising above a breath. This track was originally recorded by the band Unicorn as \\"No Way Out of Here\\" and this song was the single off the album doing well on rock radio in the US in 1978. In fact, this was the song that sent me looking for the album in March of 1988 on cassette (I have on CD now). Next is \\"Cry From the Street\\" (co-written by Gilmour and Eric Stuart) is a great rocking number with some great playing. \\"So Far Away\\" is a nice ballad which has David singing calmly throughout and one of his best guitar solos (the harmony parts at the end of the solo remind one of Queen). Mick Weaver plays some piano on this track.<br />The rocker \\"Short and Sweet\\" kicks off the album's second half and was co-written by David with fellow Harvest labelmate Roy Harper and is a great song. \\"Raise My Rent\\" follows and was the second instrumental on the album with more fretwork from Gilmour on the Fender Strat and the riff was inadvertently resurrected in 1994 on Pink Floyd's The Division Bell on \\"What Do You Want From Me\\". The bluesy \\"No Way\\" follows and has a great Gilmour vocal and superb lap steel guitar work. The instrumental \\"It's Deafinitely\\" follows and has superb guitar work from Gilmour. The album closes with the atmospheric \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" which sounds like it could have appeared on a Floyd album and rocks out to a collage of Stratocasters and lap steel guitars.<br />David Gilmour's self-titled effort was a modest success as it peaked at #29 here in the US and went Gold and has held up well over the years.<br />David Gilmour's self-titled solo debut was finally re-released on September 12, 2006 on Columbia Records with digitally remastered sound thanks to longtime Pink Floyd mastering engineer (since 1979's The Wall) Doug Sax plus fully restored artwork.<br />The remastering is amazing and many of the tracks have longer fadeouts(Raise My Rent, No Way (now to have a lap steel/Strat duel at the end), There's No Way Out of Here, Mihalis, So Far Away and I Can't Breathe Anymore (now with another lap steel/Strat duel)) and the sound is better than the original CD by a longshot!<br />David Gilmour's self-titled album is Highly Recommended!end of the solo remind one of Queen).

B003ZZAXNG|5.0|Pink Floyd co-founder/original guitarist/singer/songwriter Syd Barrett's first solo album entitled The Madcap Laughs was released in January of 1970.<br />The album would not be released here in the US until the Syd Barrett double album entitled Syd Barrett came out in 1974.<br />The album was recorded throughout 1968 and 1969 with producers Malcolm Jones whom produced most of the first half of the disc and the closing classic \\"Late Night\\". It was also produced by Roger Waters and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd.<br />By this point, the effects of Syd's drug use sadly started to deteriorate his songwriting skills and his mental state (he sadly passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2006).<br />There are an abundance of great tracks like the opening \\"Terrapin\\", \\"No Good Trying\\", \\"Here I Go\\", \\"Octopus\\", \\"Golden Hair\\", \\"Long Gone\\" and the aforementioned \\"Late Night\\".<br />The songs that show Syd stripped and just him and his guitar are the haunting \\"Dark Globe\\", \\"She Took A Long Cold Look\\" (now, as of 2010 called \\"She Took a Long Cool Look\\"), \\"Feel\\" (which has him stopping and flipping the page and continuing the song) and \\"If It's In You\\" (complete with its false start).<br />In 1993, as part of the UK boxed set Crazy Diamond, the album was digitally remastered and re-released with six bonus tracks. There's different takes of \\"No Good Trying\\", \\"Love You\\", \\"She Took a Long Cool Look\\" and \\"Golden Hair\\". There's also the first takes of \\"Octopus\\" and \\"Love You\\". Now (in 2010), to coincide with the release of An Introduction to Syd Barrett, EMI Europed re-release the CD which now has the original album artwork and also the booklet has updated information and the CD has the original Harvest/EMI label on the CD art.<br />This is a great album nevertheless and if you liked Piper at the Gates of Dawn era Floyd and are a Floyd connoiseur, I recommend you buy this album and its follow-up Barrett!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I've seen most of the James Bond flicks, but, this one, somehow, doesn't register, and I can't understand why.  All the elements are here, it is well-acted and well-presented, but--I don't know--I'm still cold--maybe I've changed!  The movie is well-done, but there seems to be some kind of a lack of continuity, and I'm not sure what I mean by that.  There is a hard edge that doesn't belong.  There is a meaness that doesn't fit, strangly enough.  I get a rote feeling, rather than a devil-may-care feeling.  There is an aspect of depression which does noy belong.  Am I beginning to see more and more depressing movies that illustrate the war between optimism and pessimism?  With optimism losing, supposedly!!!  NOT!!!  It seems 'they' take 'old' up-beat movie themes, and convert them into depressing, 'dead-end' type motifs.  Is this the beginning-of-the-century of noire flicks???  I may not be paying for this stuff much longer!!!
B00000811N|4.0|Roger Waters of Pink Floyd's first solo album was a collaboration with avant garde musician Ron Geesin entitled Music From the Body released in November of 1970 in the UK and was to be released in the US but Capitol Records rejected it at the time and the album didn't get a US release until the 1980s on a small independent label.<br />Roger Waters was the first member of the classic lineup to release a solo effort and was a collaboration with Scottish composer Ron Geesin whom worked with Waters on Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother album also released in 1970.<br />If you like Amused to Death or Pros and Cons, prepare for disappointment as this album is not like other solo projects he has done. However, if you liked Pink Floyd's most avant garde material like Atom Heart Mother and the Ummagumma studio album, you are in for a treat.<br />Roger has a few songs interspersed amongst the sound effects heavy Ron Geesin tracks.<br />Roger's \\"Sea Shell and Stone\\" and \\"Chain of Life\\" are acoustic pieces that would have fit well on the More album by Floyd. \\"Breathe\\" is an early take of \\"Breathe in the Air\\" on Dark Side of the Moon but with different lyrics and the music of Sea Shell and Stone. Roger's last song on the album was \\"Give Birth to a Smile\\" which featured Waters' bandmates David Gilmour on guitar, Nick Mason on drums and Rick Wright on keyboards.<br />Some of the instrumentals like \\"Our Song\\" have Roger and Ron working together. Not a bad solo effort but not for everyone.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Probably the real story in real life, but it is debatable from the starting premise.  It is also very gritty, and true to the land (with actors actually suffering in making the movie), and that gives it it's realistic 'truth'.  Well-acted, well-played, and well-presented!  It will scare you, and you just might identify with some of the players, but that is always a danger, isn't it???
B000002GXJ|5.0|The Eagles' seventh album Eagles Live was released in November of 1980.<br />By 1980, The Eagles were going through a schizophrenic time. The band had another chart-topping album out of The Long Run but inner tensions between drummer Don Henley and guitarist Glenn Frey reached fever pitch. The strains of keeping up with success were taking a toll on messieurs Henley, Frey, Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Timothy B Schmit.<br />Before splitting up, the band decided to release a live album recorded from its 1979/80 Long Run Tour with some tracks recorded from the pre-release tour in support of Hotel California from November, 1976.<br />The 1980 portions consists of spirited versions of \\"Hotel California\\" which is arguably better than its studio counterpart with Don Felder's excellent Gibson double neck guitar and Joe Walsh's Fender Telecaster work, a rocking \\"Heartache Tonight\\", a soulful \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\", a soul-tinged \\"The Long Run\\" featuring some excellent alto sax work from Phil Kenzie (whom played on Al Stewart's Year of the Cat and Time Passages albums), a laid-back unplugged \\"Saturday Night', a stellar \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" and the closing extended rocking \\"Take it Easy\\" which is better than its studio counterpart with some excellent guitar work from Walsh at the end.<br />The 1980 portion also included the band's take on two of Walsh's solo tracks \\"Life's Been Good\\" (arguably better than the original) and the then new track \\"All Night Long\\" which buried the sterile sounding version on the Urban Cowboy Soundtrack. Lastly, it featured the acoustic \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" which was a country number the band would play in rehearsal (see the 1977 Hotel California concert film for proof) and would be the band's last hit for 14 years.<br />The songs recorded from 1976 featured \\"New Kid In Town\\" and \\"Wasted Time\\" which were at the time the performances were recorded unreleased, an unEarthly version of \\"Take It To The Limit\\" with original bass player Randy Meisner hitting an A flat to F Sharp near the end and given a STANDING OVATION for it. Lastly, \\"Doolin-Dalton Reprise II\\" was an orchestral interlude to \\"Desperado\\" which was a good version.<br />Eagles Live upon release hit #7 on the album charts and quickly hit Platinum status. Millions have been sold since then (I helped the cause when I was 8 when my folks got me this on cassette as a Christmas present and then on CD and now the remastered CD).<br />Recommended!ng an A flat to F Sharp near the end and given a STANDING OVATION for it.

B000068FWC|5.0|Supertramp's sixth album entitled Breakfast in America was a perfect example of the classic Dickens quote \\"it was the best of times and it was the worst of times\\" end quote.<br />When it was released in March of 1979, the album was embraced heavily in the United States as the group had just come off the heels of their first Gold selling album with Even in the Quietest Moments, which was released in April, 1977 (Crime of the Century went Gold shortly after Even in the Quietest Monents went Gold).<br />Breakfast in America had three Top 20 hits guitarist/singer/keyboard player Roger Hodgson's \\"The Logical Song\\" (a Top 10 hit hitting #6 in the spring of 1979) and \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" (peaked at #10 that December).<br />Plus, keyboard player and singer Rick Davies' \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" (#19 that summer).<br />Other standouts on this classic are Davies' haunting opener \\"Gone Hollywood\\", which was a third person's view on the negativity of living in L.A., \\"Just Another Nervous Wreck\\" and \\"Oh Darling\\" (both also written by Davies). I also loved Hodgson's \\"Lord is it Mine\\".<br />Despite the fact that it's musically and lyrically a fun, warm and happy album, tensions between Hodgson and Davies were increasing during the recording sessions of this album.<br />The title track to Breakfast in America Roger had written when he was 19 but Rick despised it and didn't want the song on the album. He also didn't want the album titled Breakfast in America neither, Roger won out on both counts.<br />\\"Casual Conversations\\" was seen as Rick's stab at Roger and the closing \\"Child of Vision\\" was Roger's equivalent to Gone Hollywood and attack to Rick with Rick surprisingly adding in his responses to Roger's accusations and featured a burning sax solo at the end of the track by saxophonist John Helliwell whom is arguably the best sax player in rock.<br />Despite all the turmoil, Breakfast in America hit #1 in the US (as well as Europe, Canada, Norway and Australia) and sold over 4 million copies in America (15 million worldwide).<br />Hodgson felt that Supertramp should have ended with Breakfast in America instead of 1982's follow-up Famous Last Words although some fans disagree(like me) with his sentiments.<br />Over 28 years on, Breakfast still holds up musically today.<br />The remastered version of Breakfast which was released in June of 2002 has better sound quality that buries either the original CD or the Mobile Fidelity version.<br />Highly recommended!orldwide).

0143038419|5.0|This book floored me. I have been an avid reader my whole life but have yet to encounter so much wisdom packed into one book. I wish I could thank Elizabeth personally for her words have meant so much to me. The stories she tells are so delightfully funny, honest and heartbreaking. The lessons she presents are so useful in this everyday practice of life.  Elizabeth starts her book out by thanking her teachers (hence the reference to the 109th bead) and then artfully presents her experiences and findings, so generously sharing with the rest of us.   I have recommended this book to the people I love most in the world and hope that you'll read it too. I wish I was as eloquent with words as the author is so as to adequately convey what a gift this book is!
B000007VLL|5.0|I love this cd and the artist.  Bonnie Tyler is a great voice that is just wonderful to listen to.
B000WQW988|5.0|First of all, this show took place on my 21st birthday.  While I was not there, I remember being absolutely floored when I first saw this performance on MTV.  You have to remember, Nirvana had never played these songs acoustically before this -  they were grunge, loud, full of feedback.  Then they go and play this show.  It gave them such a new dynamic, a sign of things that could've come for Nirvana had they continued.  Not a dud in the whole show, every song is a classic, from their incredible interpretation of Bowie's \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" to the show closer \\"All Apologies\\".      I have seen thousands of concerts by hundreds of bands, both live and on video (I'm a video DJ and collect live concert footage), and I would have to put this in as one of the top 5 shows by a single band ever.  Absolutely amazing....    Now when is Pearl Jam's Unplugged show going to come out?
B000TUXL2A|3.0|I've always liked Mark Knopflers writing style, and have really  admired his guitar playing abilities ~ my feeling \\"the best\\" ever. Something about the tracks on this recording though, leave me wondering what he was thinking. The words don't flow like normal, they feel strained. The music started out the same way, but the more I listened the more it grew on me. Overall the CD is good ~ not great. Maybe my expectations have been so high, that when something just ordinary comes out, I'm just shocked.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I was wandering around a Barnes & Noble brick and mortar store and caught a listen to a sweet voice and piano accompaniment playing in the store.  I immediately went to ask who is was and they showed me Sara's album.  I bought it on the spot.<br /><br />It's been lovely to listen to.  She reminds me of a female Jason Mraz with her catchy rhythms, timing and lyrics.  She really excels on the pieces like \\"Gravity\\" where you can really feel her pain.  I love that.  A little Sarah McLachlan ... a little Fiona Apple.  I hope she continues and makes a good name for herself.<br /><br />My kind of artist.  I've worn the CD out (well, almost).  I love it.  Recommended!
B000UVT3OI|4.0|This is a great collection, no question, however there are a lot of songs that are missing from here, \\"The Red Strokes\\" for instance. What this album does is presents the entire original 18 songs from \\"The Hits\\" album with other songs released since that time. The focus though is primarily on the first half of his career. The DVD features videos for every song on the album, using live clips or TV show appearences for the songs that didn't have videos made.    Last year Garth released \\"The Entertainer\\" set which included all the missing videos from this set. It also included the full length concerts from which many of these clips are pulled.    Contrary to popular belief the four new tracks on this set are not the first songs we've gotten since his retirement. In 2005 he released his \\"Lost Sessions\\" which were all brand new songs recorded in 2005, they may have been written prior to '05, but they were all recorded in '05, and a great album that was too.    Garth has always been about selling records, so this set should come as no surprise to anyone. For the price you can't argue with it and even though it is missing some great songs, what you get here is Classic Garth.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I've been watching the Matrix Trilogy DVD set the last few days, with<br />commentary by Ken Wilber and Cornel West. What you get from those guys -- and which is clear watching the movies -- is the richness and complexity of the themes, the cinematic originality and artistry, and the different levels at which the trilogy can be appreciated.<br /><br />They also emphasize watching the entire trilogy, although the first movie, The Matrix, is significant in its own right. They talk about the social and political levels of the movies, with Wilber concentrating on the spiritual aspect. Cornel West is a philosophy professor at Princeton and appears in the Trilogy in a small part.<br /><br />Wilber and West agree that the Matrix trilogy stands alongside Moby Dick as great American epic works. They compare the Nebuchadnezzar (the \\"space\\" ship that houses and carries the main characters) to the Pequod -- the boat -- in Moby Dick. If you read a description of the Pequod and look at the Nebuchadnezzar, there's a lot of similarity, as well as similarities in other ways.<br /><br />Because of how characters are essentially intertwined, what appear to be distinctly separate characters in the first Matrix movie, are seen in the second and third movies to be not so separate. Moby Dick has that intertwining too, between Ahab and Ishmael, Ahab and the whale, the Pequod and its history/people/purpose. Are these intertwined things the same? Separate? Both? Neither? Shiva, Shakti, heart sutra, all those nonduality themes, possibilities, and teachings underlie the trilogy.<br /><br />Like any great work of art, you can see whatever you want. You see yourself, basically. Cornel West, for example, says that many people consider it a Black movie. Significant scenes were filmed in the Robert Taylor projects, southside Chicago, the Hood. Cornel, a Black man, says, \\"All this source of wisdom right there in the hood.\\"<br /><br />Wilber and West note that the Wachowski brothers -- Larry and Andy, the writers and directors of the trilogy -- bear not only great literary, spiritual, artistic consciousness, but social and political. Here's something I transcribed from the commentary of Cornel West and Ken Wilber on The Matrix regarding the social/political and artistic side:<br /><br />West: So many cities throughout the country actually thought Matrix was a Black film, when you look at all these Black folk in positions of authority. Unbelievable status, intelligence, creativity, grace, it's quite rare, atypical for a cyber thriller.<br /><br />Wilber: Well if you know Larry and Andy you know how deeply they believe this. It's wonderful actually.<br /><br />West: Absolutely. The humanity of persons right across the board. Colors, hues, race, class, sexual orientation, right across the board.<br /><br />West and Wilber get into the war in Iraq and how Americans love to see things as dualistic, Manichaean -- either good or bad, dark or light -- and can't handle ambiguity, and that neither can Iraqis.<br /><br />The Matrix trilogy starts out dualistic, but in movies two and three becomes more Socratic than Manichaean, to use the terminology of West and Wilber. Cornel West says in his commentary, \\"Most of the American public, they can't take it. They're banking on this Manichaean project. And yet I think as the years unravel and unfold you'll see, especially after Iraq and some other political situations that make it difficult for Americans to hold onto Manichaean conceptions of themselves, that they're gonna be forced to be Socratic, and lo and behold we'll begin to see the Socratic energy of the film itself. So there's a sense in which as you said before, we can't jump to two and three but two and three are kind of waiting for America in the next five to ten years as America has to confront itself for what it really is.\\"<br /><br />The trilogy is rich and timeless. You'll see whatever you want. You'll see yourself and your world on many levels.<br /><br />JerryKatz
B0000009RX|2.0|Yes the Zappa-heads will be whining loudly after they read this: WOIIFTM is the most overrated disc in FZ's catalog. The real masterpiece of this era??? Absolutely Free. AF has better songs, and the studio tricks are incorporated smoothly into the music. The tunes on WOIIFTM wear thin after about 2 listenings (I mean c'mon; how many times can you listen to \\"Bow Tie Daddy\\" or \\"Flower Punk\\" once you know the joke????). If you want \\"weird\\", go to Lumpy Gravy or Uncle Meat. If you must have this though, stay away from the Rykodisc versions with the \\"new\\" drum and bass tracks, they are horrible. Let the whining begin!!!!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|As a kid growing up in the country in the 60s and 70s, we only had 3 TV channels to choose from, and musical/variety TV shows brought a myriad of entertainers and celebrities into our home. Some of my best memories were gathering in the living room of our family's home to watch the Johnny Cash Show, and this DVD brought all of those great memories back to life. Johnny Cash was a classic, a one of a kind, and so is this collection of highlights from his TV show! My only wish is that they would release all of his TV shows in a DVD collectors set.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|All great bands evolve, and Linkin Park is no exception.  Your average really good band has the same sound over and over again, some good enough where you don't even notice, but the truly great ones want to achieve more and are brave enough to do so.  I love Hybrid Theory and Meteora, yet I can't get enough of this album either.  Once you listen to it a couple times, you realize it's the same band, but they are giving you much more.  This is the future of Linkin Park, and I'm glad.  These guys have some serious guts.  A few albums from now they evolve even further, and we fans who get it will keep eating it up.  The Beatles did it, so did U2, Zeppelin, and numerous others... all the great bands keep moving forward.  Thank god for Linkin Park.
B000VLOKQI|1.0|I thought it was a cheesy money-driven movie at most. The only way I could sit through it was because of the rare clips but any movie can have rare clips and that doesn't make it good. This is \\"Behind the Music\\" treatment and the band had barely anything to do with it. This movie was talked about in the begining with much ambition in the fact that it was supposed to be featuring full- length live clips, unreleased interviews ect. The Who should be embarrassed. If someone showed this to me to get me into the band I don't think it would do a very good job. I mean, it may be the gateway to TKAA don't get me wrong, but I would  surely not watch it again. I understand that there wasn't very much money involved but they shouldn't have promised something brilliant and then release just another boring everyday documentary just because they want to make a few bucks before Christmas.
B000UGG3A0|3.0|I'm not really into this CD, at least not yet...until now, I would've said that the Murphy's were maturing instrumentally with each passing album, keeping their sound fresh without abandoning their style.     I like the sound of the \\"State of Massachussetts\\" though. I actually first heard it live, and found it to be extremely catchy (if you haven't seen DKM live yet, do yourself the favor).     As for the album, the middle seems to be the strongest.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Imagine Kill Bill and the Matrix blended together and made by people clinically free from any trace of talent. Actually, you don't have to imagine it - here it is!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|The pros:    This a really, really good album. It's the best Pumpkins album since Mellon Collie, and its reminiscent of the earlier pre-Adore Pumpkins records. Billy Corgan's guitar playing is the strongest its ever been. He's obviously a real musician that isn't comfortable  if he doesn't improve his skill level over time. (Sadly, most of today's pop \\"musicians\\" do a disservice to those of us who really do care about the craft.) This is lightyears ahead of the majority of the tripe on the market today, and its a welcome refresher for a child of the nineties who grew up in the days when MTV wasn't saturated with rap and dance \\"music.\\"  Sonic landscapes remind me of my youth and a better time for music. Thanks, Billy    Cons  It is reminiscent of but no where near equal to Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie. I'd tie it with Gish and maybe, the outtakes CD. But there is still something missing. Even though Billy is band leader, and his descision to go along without Darcy Wretzsky and James Iha is perfectly understandable; I feel the album is hurt by their loss.      To conclude, if you liked the Pumpkins in the 90s, you'll like them now so pick it up. Just don't expect the glory days to return anytime soon. What this album does tell us is that we can expect the Pumpkins to continue turning out quality material in a sea of mediocrity. And for that I am thankful.
031286504X|4.0|I remember seeing a preview for a movie called I Am Legend a few months back and it looked alright.  When I started talking to some co-workers about it, they urged me to pick up the book before the movie comes out (about a month as of this writing).  They couldn't say enough good things about Matheson's I Am Legend.  So, I purchased it.<br /><br />From the moment I started the book, I knew what to expect, but I had no idea that this short (170 page) story would be so engrossing. It tells the story of one man, Robert Neville, who is the last man alive in a world that has been taken by vampires, living and dead.  By day he hunts/gathers, studies, does work on his house; at night, he hides to survive another day to do it all over again. But how long can he keep it up?<br /><br />This book is both scary and funny, a very quick and easy read, yet highly enjoyable. The realization at the end of the book in the last few paragraphs really makes this book stand out as one of the most unique vampire tales that I've ever read.  The book also contains more short(er) stories from Matheson in the back.  I haven't read them yet, so no review on those, just I Am Legend. Defiantly worth picking up.

B000VI6T6K|4.0|I am very glad they finally re-released this whole concert if only for one song: Hey Joe. Don't get me wrong - there is plenty more, but that was the one I was waiting for. I first heard the version from Monterey on the soundtrack to the Jimi Hendrix movie and I enjoy it in some ways even more than the studio version which is damn close to being perfection. It is rough but demonstrates Jimi's showman style mixed with his powerfully fluid rhythm/lead style. There are a few clunkers here, particularly Can You See Me and Wild Thing which suffers mostly from being a visual treat much more than an aural one. Listening to a guitar burning or being smashed is not the preferred medium for such an act. Beyond those two, however, this is a solid live effort, something that is difficult to find in the sprawling mess of Hendrix live material available. The excellent version of Like A Rolling Stone, the take on Rock Me Baby that later became Lover Man, and the bludgeoning opener of Killing Floor are all superb. This was an important show for Jimi and it shows. Despite reportedly tripping his face off on acid dosed just prior to taking the stage, the show is pure Hendrix brilliance - flamboyant, incendiary, wavering on the edge of chaos, and jaw-dropping. Making for an added novelty is Jimi's between song babbling as he tunes up between nearly every song, a consequence of whammy-ing your Stratocaster into the next dimension. While the Jimi that set the world on fire this night was to become an image he came to see as a burden, it is also what propelled him to transcontinental fame and guaranteed the world would never forget this amazing man.

075640407X|5.0|I have a very hard time getting into \\"first person\\" books.  They've never felt real to me -- until THIS one.  The author very skillfully guides us into the first person narrative by making it the major part of a 3rd Person story.    We start out with standard narrative, with multiple POVs, and then the main character gets talked into telling his story -- in first person.  It works!  And, he breaks it up by slipping out of the story telling and back into the traditional POVs.    The action and anticipation and characterization is all wonderful.  The world is well defined.    Brilliantly done.  I can't wait for the next in the series.    In fact, that's probably the only thing I did not like about this book.  It felt like the story was simply cut off, to be continued.  I did not get a sense of one part of the story being finished, but with more to come.  Literally, the main character stops his story telling and says, \\"well, that's enough for one day.  I'll tell you more tomorrow.\\"  And, that's the end of the book.
0525457585|5.0|If you enjoy the Jim Henson production of this tale you will LOVE this book.  The whole story encompasses what the first two movies covered but there is more heart and detail in the book.  I highly recommend this book for children to adults
055358894X|5.0|From very early on, this book grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  Great world building.  Believable and likable characters.  Lots of fun.    The only thing I didn't care for in this book is the frequent use of foul language.  I'm sure that was intentional to give a harsh sense of reality, but I didn't care for it.  Lot's and lots of \\"F\\" words.    I prefer Robert Jordon's technique of making up cuss words for the book's world.  If it weren't for the language issue, I'd really want my son to read this.  It's great.
B000VI04HK|3.0|CDs: 3.5 stars; DVD: 2.5 Stars<br /><br />This is the first official live album release in REM's illustrious career, and what a curious choice it is. This is released 2.5 years after its recording at 2 shows at The Point Depot in Dublin, Ireland (why now, and not say 2 years ago?), when REM was touring behind the \\"Around the Sun\\" album, arguably its weakest album ever.<br /><br />As to the audio CDs, \\"R.E.M. Live\\" (2 CDs, 22 tracks, 103 min.) brings a mix of the newer tunes, mixed with some older tracks. The album starts off with the best track on here, a blazing \\"I Took Your Name\\" (from the underappreciated \\"Monster\\" album). The problem is there are way too many tracks from \\"Around the Sun\\", 6 to be exact, bunched up in the first half of the show. Yet, there are some great nuggest as well: \\"Bad Day\\", \\"Orange Crush\\", \\"What's the Frequency Kenneth\\" and \\"(Don't Go Back to) Rockville\\", with a guest appearance from Daniel Ryan of The Thrills (from Ireland), obviously getting a huge crowd response.<br /><br />As to the DVD (105 min.), well it's almost unwatchable, to be honest. Edited in MTV-style, it changes angles literally every second during most songs, just about causing motion-sickness. I couldn't stand for most of it. There are no extras whatsoever on the DVD, no interviews, or other goodies you might expect from this.<br /><br />R.E.M. released a concert movie once before, \\"Road Movie\\", taped in the mid-90s durng their \\"Monster\\" tour, and still available as DVD. While the editing is just as migraine-inducing, the music on it is MILES better than this release, so if you wanna explore REM at their height of a live band (with Bill Berry as their drummer), I would highly encourage you to check that out.
0765350386|5.0|First, let me say that when I became a big Robert Jordan fan, (could it be 20 years ago?) I had never read a more engaging book. Robert built worlds I could SEE.  He introduced me to characters I grew to understand and love (and miss).  His magic system was unique and compelling.  He was seldom predictable.  Even though his later books began to drag, I still felt I'd never find another author to pull me so deeply into his world.  And, for many years, I was proven right.  I read many other fantasy books, but never with the same satisfaction.  (I'm going to miss Robert Jordan.)    Until now.    In the Mistborn books, Brandon Sanderson makes me feel like I did in Robert Jordan's WOT books.  I'm amazed.  I loved this book.  Totally engaging -- engrossing.  Believable.  Just the right amount of descriptions -- and WONDERFUL descriptions at that.  He doesn't just tell the story, he lets us into the heart and minds of his characters.  And, they're so REAL.    I'm also excited that:    1) Brandon is still very young and HEALTHY, so I hope to have him around for many years to come.    2) So far, he's putting out his quality books very quickly.    3) He has a blog where he shares deeper insights into his writing and phylosophy, and he let's us know about his books in progress.    It does appear, from his blog, that Mistborn is to be a Trilogy and not a long, drawnout series.  (I've mixed feelings about that.  I'll be happy to have an ending, but I'm going to be sad to see the Mistborn world go away.)    Brandon now has in me a dedicated reader for life -- as long as he keeps up this kind of quality.
0891419195|5.0|One of the most powerful books I have read on the Pacific war. This is the gunsight view of the war written by a very gifted writer.
0765316889|5.0|I agree with the reviewers who said this was a slower moving story.  But, I still found it intense.  Much of the conflict occurs WITHIN the characters, not BETWEEN them.    I found it very believable to discover the harsh reality following the great victory of Book 1.  Kelsier DID leave a mess for the others of his crew to mop up.  And, of course it wouldn't be easy.    I really enjoyed how the author allowed us to snoop on the characters' deepest thoughts and emotions as they struggled with who they are and what they should or should not do -- and why.    I disagree with the one review who said the villains were just silly.  I thought they (as well as their actions) were believable and understandable -- even though I didn't like them.    And, just because WE knew how powerful Vin was, doesn't mean the villains really knew (or believed) it.  So, their actions were not out of character.  Nor was Vin really portayed as invincible.  She clearly had her weaknesses, despite her obvious ability to cause some serious damage.      I'm very much looking forward to the third (and I believe final) installment.    Brandon, I won't mind if you decide to continue the Mistborn series beyond the third.  Maybe you can simply create another trilogy, allowing this story to come to a complete finish, but still allowing us to enjoy the interesting world you've created.

031236198X|5.0|Although fables have been written and shared for many centuries dating back at least to Aesop (said to have lived as a slave in Samos around 550 B.C.), it has been only in recent years that the business narrative in the form of a fable has become popular, notably with the publication of Who Moved My Cheese? By Spencer Johnson who wrote the Foreword to this volume, co-authored by John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber.  I was amused when noting its subtitle, \\"Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions,\\" having seen the Luc Jacquet's documentary film March of the Penguins, co-produced by Bonne Pioche and the National Geographic Society, in which the Emperor Penguins and those who filmed them endured (and most of the penguins survived) temperatures around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Antarctica that fell to -80° Fahrenheit. How many human enterprises could function under such conditions?<br /><br />Kotter and Rathgeber offer a fable in which the central character, an Emperor Penguin named Fred, struggles without much success to convince his colony's Leadership Council that his research statistics indicate \\"the shrinking of the size of their home, the canals, the caves filled with water, the number of fissures, causing by [their iceberg's] melting.\\" If they do not relocate to another iceberg soon....<br /><br />What happens next is best revealed by Kotter and Rathgeber within their narrative. They are brilliant storytellers who first introduce their lead characters, and create a situation, then identify conflicts that build tension as the plot develops, until its conclusion (sort of). As with George Orwell in Animal Farm, their primary purpose, however, is not to entertain but to instruct.  As they explain, \\"Our goal in writing Our Iceberg Is Melting was to draw upon the incredible power of good stories to influence behavior over time - making individuals and their groups more competent in handling change and producing better results.\\"<br /><br />Specifically, to use their story to illustrate  \\"The Eight Step Process of Successful Change\\" that Kotter introduced in his book Leading Change (1996). In a sequel to it, The Heart of Change (2002), he and Dan Cohen examine \\"the core problem people face in all of those steps, and how to successfully deal with the problem.\\" And the central issue is never strategy, structure, culture, or systems. \\"All these elements, and others, are important. But the core of the matter is always about changing the behavior of people, and behavior change happens in highly successful situations mostly by speaking to people's feelings.\\" (Those who do that effectively have what Daniel Goleman characterizes as \\"emotional intelligence.\\") Kotter and Cohen structure this book around the eight steps \\"because that is how people experience the process. There is a flow in a successful change effort, and the chapters follow that flow.\\"<br /><br />Fred follows \\"The Eight Step Process of Successful Change\\" (without identifying it as such, of course) and achieves at least some temporary success but Kotter and Rathgeber leave no doubt in their reader's mind that change is a never-ending process rather than an ultimate destination. Precisely the same barriers that Fred encounters are certain to reappear when the Leadership Council is called upon to consider other proposed changes when the colony seems threatened.  In many (if not most) organizations today, their decision-makers are facing one or more meltdowns of various kinds (sales, profits, ROI, attrition of valued employees, client and/or market share, etc.). What Kotter and Rathgeber recommend in their business fable is, effect, a framework by which to understand and then respond effectively to whatever challenges may appear, challenges that require changes of what is done and (especially) how it is done, so that these organizations can succeed \\"under any conditions.\\"<br /><br />I presume to offer a specific suggestion when concluding this brief commentary: Purchase a copy of this book for each of several key people and then bring together to discuss it in ways and to the extent that Fred and his colony are relevant to the given enterprise...but don't stop there. Take full advantage of this opportunity to formulate, together, a plan by which to institutionalize \\"The Eight Step Process of Successful Change.\\" To repeat, beneficial change is an on-going, never-ending process and has one requirement more important than any other: adapt or perish.for each of several key people and then bring together to discuss it in ways and to the extent that Fred and his colony are relevant to the given enterprise...but don't stop there.

0525950079|5.0|Anyone who read Pillars of the Earth and saw this book announced in the trade earlier this year ran to get it and find out what Follett would do with Kingsbridge 200 years later.  I was not dissappointed.  For several weeks I was lifted out of my daily life and transported to another world, and introduced to living and breathing characters who will be hard to forget.  When you get done with a book like this you feel like calling the writer and thinking him for such pleasure.  It may be guilty pleasure because this isn't Proust or Joyce, but who can resist a fat, juicy historical page-turner that opens up a long-lost world?    When I finished the book I felt like something was missing.  As much as I enjoyed the ride, I realized that I didn't have the same feeling I experienced in 1989 when Pillars came out.  The feeling that makes you think back 18 years and remember what a lovely experience you had reading a book.  Not many books cause that feeling.     I read Pillars on a trip to England in 1989, when my now-dead partner and I rented a narrow boat in Guildford and motored down the River Wey to the Thames and back.  It was one of the best trips I ever took, and on the way down the river we passed the abandoned Newark Abbey in a field next to the canal.  We moored the boat in the trees and walked through open fields to the 12th century ruins, which aren't important enough to attract tourists or signs out on the highway.  Which made it all the more magical and wonderful to explore alone with Bill that day.  We did not know the name of the ruins or even what it was because there were no signs and they were not in any of the guidebooks we had on the boat.  I discovered the name several years later when I saw a Turner painting in the Tate that was obviously of the old ruins by the canal, depicted from the river just like we had seen them that summer day.  I had Pillars with me on the narrowboat, and I was half-way through it when we visited the old abbey.  During the rest of the trip, down to the Thames, up to Windsor and over to Hampton Court, I read the book, loved it, and imagined that Follett was writing about the old abbey we had discovered in the field.  On the way back up the canal/river to Guildford, we passed it again at sunset, and I took a picture of the old stone pillars rising from the earth that now sits in an old album.  The book, the abbey, my lost partner and the canal trip are all together in my memories of those halcyon days.    And that's what's missing in the new book.  The cathedral.   No one ever captured the building of a medieval church the way Follett did in that first book.  And as delicious as WWE is, as delighted that I am to read it, and as interesting as the bridge and the new tower are, they don't quite make up for the construction of that ancient, lovely, Gothic cathedral sitting somewhere in an imaginary English town called Kingsbridge.

B00007LTIC|3.0|\\"Going For The One\\" will not stand out in the Yes catalog for the quality of its content (although there are certainly some memorable moments here) but rather as a bookmark for the history of this remarkable group. This album would prove to signify the end of a very creative era for this legendary unit.  The rock music business was becoming an altered landscape when this album was released in 1977. The industry was \\"going corporate\\" and FM radio was the tool that was being used to institute those changes. The British Art Rock movement that Yes had been a major player in was dying out and those bands that were left no longer fit into the new ideal. On this record the band appears to have ignored the signs and continued to stick with the same formula that got them there, in this case lengthy, high-browed classical influenced pieces with the exception of one short and sweet number called \\"Wonderous Stories\\" that was probably thrown in to keep the guys in the suits off their backs. The result was all too predictable. The single would find its way to the friendly skies of the airwaves and the rest of the album was given the cold shoulder.  In retrospect, this effort does show the group's fuel tank running a bit low and the lure of a solo career may have had the boys thinking that they could do a lot better if they didn't have to split their paychecks. From here they would go on to produce a very uninspired album of radio- friendly material and then split up only to reappear later in much different format.  I don't recall \\"Going For The One\\" spending nearly as much quality time on my turntable as some of their previous releases. I too may have been caught under the spell of mainstream music or perhaps like the members of Yes, I felt it was time to move on to something else.

0596007124|2.0|At first I was digging this book, towards the middle I ripped it up into shreads (just like the OOA/D book by head first) and threw it away. As a matter of fact, it's sitting in my trash can as I'm writing this. If you're looking for a book explaining design patterns, like many of the cartoons within it, this book's a joke. They could have reduced this book to a fifth of it's size. Instead, you get a load of childish and repetitive fluff. You'll feel like you're getting introduced to design patterns by the dumb jocks who used to beat you up in high school. For goodness sake, we're software engineers not cheerleaders. People, get a real book.

Its definitely a keeper in my book...Great little fantasy storyline and the characters are quite cute.

B000000NN4|5.0|This 1976 release by Vangelis appears to be a favorite amongst prog fans.  As a prog fan myself, I enjoy this album because the music is very exciting, with great drumming (by Vangelis no less) and dramatic flourishes on banks of synthesizers.  Although the dreamier, spacier tracks on Albedo 0.39 are enjoyable, I also like it when Vangelis \\"cuts loose\\".<br /><br />Vangelis plays all instruments on this album including bass guitar, various bits of percussion, a full drum kit, xylophone, and a gamelan (on Freefall).  Although the exact synthesizers used on the album are not listed, it is likely that (based upon what I have read) some combination of the following synths was used:  Minikorg 700S; Roland SH-1000; Roland SH-3A; Korg 800 DV; ARP Odyssey; and ARP sequencer.  Non-synth keyboards that I can make out include pipe organ, Rhodes electric piano and acoustic piano.  Found sounds on the album include recordings of the speaking clock and conversations between astronauts taken from the Apollo moon landing.<br /><br />Vangelis really plays up a storm on this album and his drumming is pretty darn good.  As is the case with his albums, he creates a number of moods with loads of keyboards and synthesizers - speaking of which, his use of sequencers on this album reminds me somewhat of Larry Fast's work around this time.<br /><br />The nine tracks on the album range in length from 1:45 to the excellent two-part Nucleogenesis suite (a little over 12 minutes in length).  The moods on the album range from deeply haunting and sad to vigorous and frenzied - I have to say that Albedo 0.39 features a bit more in the way of dynamic contrast than some of his other albums.  Overall, there is a sweeping, almost symphonic grandeur to this album that I find very appealing (Alpha is a fine example of this).<br /><br />All in all, this is an exceptional album by Vangelis and is highly recommended along with Opera Sauvage (1979) and Chariots of Fire (1981).

B000001ESP|5.0|While Permanent Waves (1980) brought Rush to a wider audience, it was Moving Pictures (1981) that really put the band on the map.  As I recall, Tom Sawyer and Limelight were in constant rotation on the radio and I remember just being thrilled with these new sounds - I had just discovered Rush around 80-81 and my reaction to this album was that of pure excitement (the Moving Pictures tour was spectacular as well).  Unfortunately, this was the last album by the band that bore the stamp of full-blown prog.  Although the follow-up album Signals (1982) was very good, it was clear that Rush was heading in a more streamlined direction (I knew that change was afoot when Geddy started using that odd-looking Steinberger bass during the Signals tour).<br /><br />The lineup on this album included Geddy Lee (lead vocals; Rickenbacker bass; Fender jazz bass; Oberheim polyphonic synthesizer; OB-X; mini-moog synthesizer; Taurus bass pedals); Alex Lifeson (6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars; Taurus bass pedals); and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, and lyrics). These guys were (and still are) top shelf musicians.  I remember being absolutely blown away by Geddy's bass playing on this album, particularly on the instrumental track YYZ.  Alex Lifeson does a great job on the guitar and Neil Peart was not only a fantastic drummer but wrote extremely sophisticated lyrics as well.  The band also worked well as an ensemble and managed to crank out a huge sound for just three guys.  In the end, it was a combination of instrumental and conceptual sophistication that rendered them the \\"thinking person's metal band\\".<br /><br />The seven tracks on the album range in length from 4:19 to 10:58 (Camera Eye).  Musically, the album continued the format of Permanent Waves, although there was a bit more in the way of smoothing off the rough edges.  The tracks on the album include a mixture of powerful progressive hard rock tunes (Tom Sawyer; Limelight; Red Barchetta); a blazing instrumental chock full of instrumental pyrotechnics and virtuosity (YYZ); a somewhat lengthy full blown prog track (Camera Eye); the dark and ominous Witch Hunt, and the closing track Vital Signs, which seemed to serve as a precursor to the material on Signals.<br /><br />This remastered effort is pretty good and is about as close as folks will get to the original vinyl album.  In that my vinyl version of Moving Pictures is long gone, having this remastered album brought back some good memories.  The sound quality is stunning - this is the album that was used to test stereo systems (I think it may actually still be used) so remastered or not, this will always be a crisp recording with deep, rich bass; crystal clear highs; and excellent separation of individual instruments.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine collection of extremely well played and thoughtfully assembled progressive hard rock/metal pieces.

B000EGCITG|5.0|After the dissapointing \\"Try This\\" you might have been expecting less from Pink (Alicia Moore).  Well she certainly got our attention this time.  She made waves with the video for \\"Stupid Girls\\" the first single.  It didn't chart as well as pop-rock masterpieces like \\"U + Ur Hand\\" and her most recent \\"Who Knew.\\"  She also takes on politics with \\"Dear Mister President,\\" a must listen for liberals everywhere!  You can tell this is a very personal album from her and one of my favorites from 2006.  Pink continues to emerge as an artist onto her own.  From \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" to \\"I'm Not Dead\\" Pink has managed to create another masterpiece.  It may be a \\"Long Way To Happy\\" for her but I certainly hope the sucess of this album makes her feel good.  She certainly deserves it. Go Pink!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Universal released this in early 1931 and it is an early talkie with no music score. While there are fine performances from Van Sloan and Frye, the aspect of the film that fascinates all these years later is the great performance by Bela Lugosi. While Lugosi may not have been a great or a versatile actor, he had played this part on Broadway for a few yaers prior to making the movie. He is absolutely perfect- every line, every movement of the eyes, every gesture is true. Being from Transylvania, he even had an authentic accent.   There are some weak performances in this movie but Lugosi's Dracula more than makes up for them. You can't take your eyes off him in any of his scenes. While many other actors have played the part, only Bela Lugosi IS Dracula.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold stated in multiple interviews leading up to the release of their fourth record that fans who liked Waking the Fallen would also enjoy their new self-titled disc. M. Shadows promised that it would be fast, heavy, and pack a punch. For better or worse, his description is only true of half the album.<br /><br />“Critical Acclaim,” full of chugging riffs and nasty backing vocals from The Rev, and “Almost Easy,” the first radio single, are a pair of heavy-hitting opening tracks that have since become live staples, and for good reason—both are great songs. The third track, “Scream,” boasts some decent riffs and a catchy solo, but it is also plagued by poppy vocals that grate on my ears by the end of the song.<br /><br />“Afterlife” fires things up again with another batch of catchy riffs and more vicious backing vocals from The Rev. “Gunslinger” and “Unbound (The Wild Ride)” will please City of Evil fans, and “Brompton Cocktail” ends up being the closest thing to a Waking the Fallen song on the album. “Lost,” the only clunker, starts off with a wicked solo but quickly goes south when Shadows opens his mouth. I’m not sure what possessed him to auto-tune the vocals on “Lost,” but it was a mistake. An annoying solo later in the song doesn't help its case.<br /><br />The end of the album is very interesting. “A Little Piece of Heaven” and “Dear God,” the only songs to exceed six minutes, are unlike anything else Avenged Sevenfold has ever released. “A Little Piece of Heaven,” which I understand was written almost completely by The Rev, sounds like it's straight out of Nightmare Before Christmas. With its comical lyrics and theatrical instrumental bits, it can only be classified as “experimental.” The last song, “Dear God,” is a country tune (of all things) that is surprisingly well done.<br /><br />Concerning the musicianship, Shadows gets the job done, but let's face it—he's not the most talented vocalist in the metal world. The guitar work is pristine, as always, and Johnny contributes the occasional bass line that'll get you grinning. The Rev proves once again on this record why he was the most talented member in Avenged Sevenfold, rest his soul. He drums like a demon and contributes outstanding backing vocals on half of the songs on the album. “A Little Piece of Heaven,” which he cut for the record, may go down as the band’s best song.<br /><br />To put it simply, Avenged’s self-titled album contains enough brutal riffs, piercing solos, and screaming to please fans of the band’s earlier material while still breaking new ground, though not always in the right ways. Their self-titled album is a solid record that I still enjoy listening to from time to time years after its release.vocalist in the metal world.

Thomas Pynchon does a wonderful job of evoking the sense of an underlying order to society that drives so many conspiracy fanatics in their quest for meaningful patterns.  Although this short novel is dense with fascinating ideas and quite humorous, Pynchon's prose style is frequently aggravating.  He writes long, convoluted sentences with ambiguous prepositions and pronouns, which can make the reading a pretty hard slog at times.

B000BB14YY|5.0|We meet the warlord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) as a pleasant old man, satisfied with his success in life, desiring only to bring peace to the land by dividing his kingdom among his three sons (Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu, and Daisuke Ryu) and to spend his waning years spending time with each in turn.  Soon, the colossal hubris of the man becomes apparent.  He disowns the one son who has the integrity to tell him to his face that his idyllic plan will never work.  Hidetora should have listened.  After a lifetime of subjugating others with his armies, he believes that his desires will come to pass simply because he wishes it.  However, his remaining sons have been raised in the house of a warlord during a time of constant warfare, and they have no intention of living in peace.  Rather, they fall upon each other in a struggle for supremacy, turning the old man out as an inconvenience.    As our sympathy for Hidetora grows, we are also made to realize how richly he is reaping the seeds that he has sown through two important characters.  Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), who manipulates one of his sons into facilitating the downfall of his house, watched her family murdered by Hidetora.  Tsurumaru (Mansai Nomura), a young blind man who lives a wretched, solitary existence, suffered the plucking out of his eyes at Hidetora's command when he was a young boy.  Growing increasingly senile, Hidetora wanders through a land in chaos as the suppressed passions generated by the horrors he perpetrated bear full fruit.  This is a complex, dramatic and often beautiful film.

B000H305U0|4.0|Although Justin is clearly inspired by iconic pop superstars from before his reign in pop music, I still believe he has this IT factor that makes his music, his music videos, and his overall act addicting and enjoyable in his own right.    Credit where it's due, the producers are excellent in the album. I'm no longer feelin' the tired beats from Timbaland who I believe needs to move on to a new sound, but the chemistry between himself and Justin is just right for the tracks. My suggestion for JT is for him to find and collaborate with someone who is obscure and of course talented so that he can generate fresh material. I honestly think that that would be the best for the future of his career in the long run.    My Love is one of my favorite songs on the album, but I could live without the rap break from T.I. SexyBack is that one super radio-friendly hit that won't carry my interests in the long run, but it's still a fairly addicting song. The track I love the most is Until The End of Time, which is quite possibly the most beautiful slow song I've heard in awhile. I only wish the interludes could have their own track numbers or just eliminated altogether.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I saw the previews for Dexter and went out and bought the first season on dvd.  It was well worth the thirty dollars. The show is brilliant.  The acting and dialogue hit on all levels.  The show manages to be part horror, crime drama, and comedy all in one.  Dexter is the most likeable serial killer I have ever seen, even more so than Hannibal Lecter in Silance of the Lambs.  Dexter is a nice polite guy who just happens to enjoy dispensing justice.  He does very bad things to very bad people.  It makes it easy to sympathize with him.  The show doesn't drown us in senseless gore.  All the gore in the show has a point.  The interactions with his sister and girlfriend are very funny, but it is often the interactions with his victims that are truly hilarious.  My personal favorites are the coyote couple he gets relationship advice from and a murderous psychiatrist that also gives him a little help. Buy this show and hope that they keep making more and more episodes.

B00006GO99|4.0|This is undisputably a fantastic record.  So much so, I bought it twice... once in the 80s and again when Columbia reissued it in the late 90s.  The problem is this, though: the remastered version is kind of different.  Most obvious are the name change for \\"Bolivar Blues\\" (now called \\"Blue Bolivar Blues\\") and the full thirty seconds missing from \\"Bye-Ya.\\"  (It's gone from a 6:00 minute track to 5:30, losing much of the tune the precedes the piano solo.)  I've checked around and haven't found an explanation for these differences.  Does anyone know?    Regardless, if you don't know the original, this won't matter to you.  So buy away!

0767830555|5.0|**SPOILERS INCLUDED**    I write this on the day after the release from prison of Arthur Bremer, would-be assasin of Democratic Presidential candidate and segregationist George Wallace was gunned down and paralyzed for life in a Maryland campaign stop. I was a grade schooler when this shooting took place and it was one of the more horrific events to see on TV at that age. Screenwriter Paul Scrader and directer Martin Scorcese based \\"Taxi Driver\\" on the events of Arthur Bremer's life and diary, a man with a pathetic and lonely existense who sought quick fame and acceptance by assasinating a political figure. FIrst he tried to blast Richard Nixon, and when that proved too difficult, he made Democratic front runner George Wallace his target.There was no political motivation in Bremer's actions, only a desire to rise above the emptyness of his existence.    Lead Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is an insomniac Viet Nam veteran who turns to driving a cab at night to make a few extra bucks (he may have a disability check, but that's never clear) and to try to relax his spirit a little. In pre-Guiliani NYC circa 1975, it's not a good move. The city is crawling with hookers, pimps, dope addicts and general filth. As Bickle motors away his evenings, the atmosphere begins to rot his soul and exacberate his mental condition.    Attempts at normacly fail. Bickle, as many crazed people, seems to have honest perceptions and a nothing-to-lose attitude which impresses Cybill Shepard (a political campaign worker) enough to accompany him on a date. Bickel proves to be socially inept however and scares her away, further plunging him into first despair, then a desperate regiment of push-ups, calisthenics and target practice. Eventually, with no ideology or clear motive, Bickel makes a failed attempt at shooting Jack Pallandine, the Presidential candidate his romantic interest works for.  Still with bullets and blood on his mind, Bickle goes to the Lower East Side and instead blasts HarveyKeitel, the pimp of underage hooker Jody Foster  as well as a brothel goon and a reputed Mafioso client. Taking bullets himself in the exchange, Bickel survives and is accepted briefly as a hero by a public who surely does not understand the depth of Bickles insanity or the fact he had attempted earlier to  assasinate a politico.    It is unclear in the film if the shooting Bickle is involved in serves to normalize his life. He is seen driving a cab and back to work at the end, but one can only guess how stable he really is. Also unclear is whether the script intends to qualify victims, ie- it's OK to shoot child-pimps but a no-no to shoot politicians, and that the difference between being a hero and a kook is the choice of your target. Perhaps as myself you will come away from this realizing how misunderstood many people are and how easily the media and public can misinterperet an event. That said, it is very intense and scary to see how Bickles life descends to a point where he feels he will be immortalized by an action that takes several seconds. The time in which he is moving to shoot Pallandine and the methodical rampage within the trick pad are some of the tensest moments ever put to screen.  Scorcese does a fine job here. The isolation that is projected by the limited interaction of Bickles life and the \\"confined to a cab\\" metaphor work to show what insanity may be like. The street scenes and characters are first rate. Even in a city that was worse after crack cocaine hit the streets, Scorcese shows the decay that was so prevalent in the 70's and 80's. Also worth thought is a comparison to a later event of the \\"Subway Vigilante\\" Bernard Goetz and whether his acts were a similar cry for help or a legitimate defense of self and property.    A great film. Watched by many and probably interpreted in as many different ways.
B0000029DD|5.0|I had never heard of Jeff Buckley until I heard a song dedicated to him from Pete Yorn on Yorn's 'Live From New Jersey' CD, also an excellent recording.  I purchased 'Grace'  a week or so ago and was blown away by it after my first listening. This recording is a must for any music collection. Intense, creative, and powerful. I typically don't like falsetto vocals, but Jeff Buckley's vocal range is staggering.
B000PMG16U|5.0|fox chose blu ray because of its many advantages all of which will help this eventual release to be utterly amazing. the extra storage space will be necessary to handle the length of these films, the advanced audio and high definition extras. transformer's shortcoming showed us that insufficient storage space and the ability to transfer data quickly (bitrates) can massively cripple a disc's content. judging by fantastic four, the day after tomorrow, and the early reviews of die hard from abroad show us that fox knows how to deliver the best high def content.    and with blu ray leading disc sales, with nearly twice as many discs sold and that number growing with record setting releases such as spider-man, ratatouille, cars, and the coming releases of pirates 3, the die hard quadrilogy and that blu ray capable hardware numbers in the millions, there is little argument from truly neutral parties. hd dvd only leads \\"stand alone\\" players by a few percent. but when the ps3 (blu ray) and the xbox add on drive (hd dvd) are counted Blu ray is massively in the lead.    I cannot wait to get these on blu ray. the HD cable broadcasts of them were very impressive for cable, but still have the limitations thereof. so i can only imagine how these will look in 1080p and sound with uncompressed (lpcm) audio.
1416523359|5.0|i'd give this more stars if that was a possibility.  a great story.  it had the supernatural/scary elements that stephen king is known for, but mostly this beautiful love story about the connections we have, even after death.  Most of Stephen King's books have scared me.  This book made me cry.
0790729725|5.0|I can watch this over and over and never EVER get sick of it. It is about three decades in the Mafia, Narratted by Hank Hill, a irish/silician wiseguy, who in the end, rats out his crew in order to save him and his family's life. De Niro is incredible and doesn't fool around with his acting in this movie. This is the second movie, that I think that really \\"made\\" him (the first is the 1973 classic \\"Taxi Driver\\" by Director and long time friend Martin Sorcese.)Pesci is memorizing and Hilarious as Tommy, The silician wiseguy that is up for being \\"made\\" by the big wigs of his crew. Director Sorcese made a Mafia Masterpiece, which is now a staple in my DVD and VHS collections. If you like biographies, interested in Mafia History and movies and Love to see some great acting by a slew of incredible actors and actresses, do get this film. This mafia masterpiece will never grow old and stale with film viewers.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|This movie was amazing.   I didn't think it was slow at all, in fact it was perfectly paced.  I have a terrible time sitting though some 90 minute movies; but I never got restless watching this movie, even though it was over 2 hours long.   So fantastic!!
0451526384|5.0|Persuasion, Austen's final completed novel, is set in 1814, an interlude in the long Napoleonic wars.  The men are home from the campaigns, with fortunes made and loves lost.  It is a time for healing and renewal, while time allows.  Austen herself was in deteriorating health and did not have long to live.  For her characters too, there is a sense of time running out.<br /><br />In fact, although it is completed, there are signs that Austen would have reworked or further developed some of it, had she lived.  A major character (the one who did the initial persuading) is never fully realized, other characters are similarly neglected toward the end, and the novel is relatively short.<br /><br />Persuasion does not have the depth of characterization of Pride and Prejudice, or quite the passion.  It also lacks the cynical edge that is found in much of her work.  The prose never reaches the sublime heights that she achieves elsewhere, but it is always very fine nonetheless.  This makes for a slighter, more comfortable read, and a promise that, only love faithfully, and autumn must somehow become summer.<br /><br />There are references in the novel which will be obscure to most of today's readers (for example, &#34;the inimitable Miss Larolles&#34;) and an edition with notes would be a good idea, if you can find one.  The Signet Classic edition has no notes, but has quite a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, although it summarizes the plot, so read it after the novel, not before.
B000M341QE|2.0|I just watched this movie on HBO and was extremely puzzled and disappointed. Disappointed because I could not follow the confusing plot at all. Flashbacks and generally choppy editing made it impossible to get drawn into this plot. Puzzled because I have no idea why Martin Scorsese got an Academy Award for this film, except (as popular belief holds) it was finally \\"his time\\" and they decided to give him one before he died. This movie made no sense and is full of pointless profanities and violence.     To me, the movie mainly serves as a signal that Jack Nicholson needs to find a different part to play other than Jack Nicholson. In this movie, he just plays what he's been playing for 20 or 30 years now -- some sarcastic, bitter SOB who is totally evil. Then he collects his fat paycheck for another \\"acting\\" job.     Avoid this movie! It's all hype and little payoff.
0375846735|1.0|I loved \\"The Golden Compass\\" and liked \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" but the third in the trilogy, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" disappointed me.  What a sad, empty ending for this brave girl and boy!
B0001O3YC6|4.0|I watched this with some trepidation, as Vin Diesel is not a great actor and most of the other films I've seen him in have been - well - awful. However, this film, rather like the Terminator films for Arnold Schwarzenegger, suited him perfectly and it was much better than I expected.<br /><br />Its a tense Sci-Fi/horror film in which a spaceship crash lands on a planet and the surviving crew have to contend with the planets less than pleasent inhabitants as well as Riddick (Diesel) who is a dangerous prisoner being transported on the spaceship. Riddick is no ordinary prisoner though, and because of their desperate situation the crew enlist his help to try and survive.<br /><br />Its all well done and in places pretty scary. The cast all give good performances and the director and cinematographer have done a fine job creating another world. Some of the camerawork in particular was cleverly done and this especially added to the tension in the film.<br /><br />Obviously it owes a huge debt to Alien and Aliens, but it is sufficiently original to hold up in its own right. OK it isn't as good as Alien or Aliens but if you watch this with an open mind you'll probably be surprised at just how good it really is.

B000001E7L|4.0|\\"No Need to Argue\\" is the best selling album the Cranberries have released before their current hiatus. The album contains two of their finest singles \\"Ode to My Family\\" and the controversal \\"Zombie\\".<br /><br />Though their music hardly can be called folk, there is an umistakeably influence from traditional Irish Music. On some of the strongest song  find this influence obvious.<br /><br />The album opens with beautiful \\"Ode to My Family\\" and the album continues with three more great songs. \\"I Can't Be With You\\" is one of the few upbeat rockers on the album - a catchy tune. Like \\"Ode to My Family\\" \\"Twenty One\\" is just beautiful and the powerful voice of singer Dolores O'Riordan is bound to hit you on the haunting \\"Zombie\\".<br /><br />You may easily get the feeling that you're in the middle of listening to one of the few perfect albums in rock, but unfortunately the next handful of tracks do not live to the opening four. Though well-performed the songs are simply not as good.<br /><br />Luckily the high standards are reset with O'Riordan's waltzy ballad \\"Dreaming My Dreams\\". \\"Yeat's Grave\\" is, inspite of its dark lyrics, quite uplifting.<br /><br />The hymn-like title track is a fine closing track to the solid, but slightly uneven, album with some really great songs and the powerful voice of Dolores O'Riordan.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Yet another excellent collection of his music, and just in time for the holidays. Glad I ordered mine!
B000UX6TRK|5.0|I am one of the lucky people who were actually there at the concert last May (I live in Paris) so I was extremely happy to be able to get the show on DVD so that I can relive the experience over and over again.  The sound and image quality of the DVD (European version)is absolutely fantastic.  Lionel Richie at his best !!
B000Y179KO|5.0|The greatest band of all times is back, and at times better than ever.  With each member a star in their own right, the combination is awesome.  They take four incredible voices, add four part harmony, fantastic music, and the Eagle magic.  I like the first cd better than the second, but CD 2 is growing on me as well.  They start CD 1 with four part harmony, then take turns with lead vocals for the balance of songs.  I could not possibly pick a favorite but Busy Being Fabulous, Waiting in the Weeds, and Do Something really stand out.  Guilty of the Crime with Walsh is sassy and cool, but will probably not be a single.  Timothy Schmidt is awesome on all of his songs.  What I really love about this album is that ALL of the Eagles take a turn, it is just not the Henley/Frye show (although you do not get any better than either of them).  Even with trading off lead vocals, the music and harmony is still pure Eagles. This album is truly a collaboration, and very well done.

0312360266|4.0|Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird has just been Marked as a fledging vampyre.  Shunned by her mother and stepfather, she leaves to enter the magical world of the house of the night where she finds out what it will take to become an adult vampyre.  Even with her Mark there is still a chance her body won't accept the change, meaning she will die.    At the House of Night, Zoey finds she has been marked as special by the vampyre Goddess Nyx.  Zoey discovers her amazing powers but along with this come bloodlust.  To add to this she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite group, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts.  Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny.    This is a fast-paced read, similar to MaryJanice Davidson's Undead series.  Zoey is likable as a teenager who suddenly finds out that she is Marked to become the very thing those in her family and town shun--a vampyre.  The only thing that held the story back was the overuse of current slang, which might date the book.  There also is a reference to a sexual act in the hallway of the school.  Other that that this book will appeal to those who like a good YA vampire tale.
B000Y179KO|2.0|After all of these years I must admit that The Eagles still have their harmonies and vocal magic, but don't be fooled by all of these people that are saying that this album sounds like the good old songs.  Only about 3 songs out of the 20 sound like the good ol' days and the rest sound like a mixture of Prince, Backstreet Boys, and New Kids On The Block.  After about song #6 I was wondering how much longer I could listen to this album without falling asleep.  I enjoy classic rock and classic country, and classic country-rock like The Eagles used to sound, but this album is neither.  So if you want some slow, soft, easy listening music than this is for you, but if you want something you can stomp your feet to and crank up loud and feel good about living than avoid this album at all cost.
B000VT6FAO|4.0|To sum it up, Dave Gahan's second solo outing is far superior to Paper Monsters by leaps and bounds, though still not quite up to par with the overall caliber of material being created today by Depeche Mode.    While I will not compare DG solo to DM( that's a no-no in my opinion because of our own preconceived expectations, ) I will go so far as to recommend Hourglass to fans of those moody yet obscure DM ballads( think: The Bottomline, I Am You, Macro, or even Comatose, though most fans didn't particularly enjoy the latter two, I, for one, enjoyed them immensely. )    Whenever I listen to this album I get visualizations of Dave sitting in the back of a dimly-lit tavern, cigarette in hand, crooning his endless shpeil of emptiness and the dark side of love, sex, and physical longing, which is fine by me. We can all relate to the emotions served up in Dave's unfettering voice as he sings each note as though to a secret lover in that hypothetical tavern beneath a veil of smoke. One such song which evokes such a feeling is the moody closer, \\"Down\\", a song which will undoubtably be overlooked in favour of \\"Kingdom,\\" which has everything going for it for all the right reasons( and justifiably so, as it's a great song. ) When Dave sings: \\"I need some company. I need you tonight...\\" his voice sounds as though he is a lost, empty soul crumpled up at the bottom of a bottle( perhaps a reminder of his own past addictions? )grasping for any sort of true form of human emotion left to him. And as he breaks into the entrancing chorus, we can feel the angst in his voice and believe him when he strains to sing: \\"I feel so old...\\"  It's a sad, heartbreaking song which I can connect with on many levels, though I believe that it is also about finding hope and beauty in a lonesome world which seems void of such things( now doesn't that sound familiar? But I wont make the obvious comparison. ) This sentiment can also be mirrored on the entrancing \\"Saw Something,\\" which also carries considerable emotional pull, though not quite as well written. However, \\"Saw Something\\" is much more dramatic and gripping, as it builds up almost in a DM-esque fashion, and has that ethereal feel to it, which makes it much easier to like on first listen, and love after the second. It is the true powerhouse of the album, and will probably do very well as a single among loyal DM and DG followers( but then, I'm sure the \\"loyal\\" ones would buy the National Anthem if he released a version--I know I would. )    Overall, \\"Hourglass\\" is a quietly intense electronic album that should ideally be listened to late at night after a long, stressful day. Although slow in spots, and guilty of one clunker of a second-rate \\"World In My Eyes\\" knock-off of a song, IMO( \\"Deeper and Deeper,\\" and yes I will make the comparison here, because it's unavoidable in my opinion. ) Dave's second album is excellent progress and a good album that stands up well on it's own. Judging by his progress from \\"Paper Monsters,\\" it is my expectation that his third( if he chooses to release a third, ) album will be outstanding.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|First of all, I wanted to address something. A7X by their own admission is NOT a metal band, nor a rock band, nor any other genre band. Avenged Sevenfold is just that...Avenged Sevenfold. Now, on to the album. I knew beforehand that the CD was going to be different than the previous three releases. Thats what A7X does, their sound changes along with the membered that make up the band. And I hae to say, this IS the BEST A7X cd to date, in my opinion. And I've been listening to them since before Sounding the Seventh Trumpet came out. I love the progression. I love this CD. It starts off amazing, Critical Acclaim and Almost Easy are in my opinion the two most standout...old A7Xesque...songs. Than Afterlife, Lost, and Dear God. Those three songs alone made this CD well worth its price. As a musician myself, I get the same feeling that these songs deal with. (I do have to comment...Critical Acclaim is the only political song on the CD...which sorta makes it nor fit in as well...but still a great song.) On Gunslinger...the hair literally stood up on my arm the first time I heard their transition from the nice acoustic section to the hard hitting thereafter...amazing. Finally, Track #9...so amazing and so experimental and awesome.     All in all. I knew this CD would end up pissing alot of people off and gaining the band new fans as well. To those of you who find it necessary to be negative about how the band has changed over the years...its called maturing. Something alot of ya'll prolly don't know anything about. No one wants to hear the same A7X record over and over again. Change is good, change is perfect. And this band has perfected the art of changing, without ever changing who they are, or starying from where they came from. AMAZING CD!!!    All in al
B0000073BG|5.0|1975's \\"Scheherazade And Other Stories\\" continues the winning streak of the great band Renaissance, who effortlessly tossed off one magnificent album after another during their 70's heyday. \\"Scheherazade\\" is a beautifully crafted album, expertly sung & played, filled with lush, orchestral progressive pop-rock that's guaranteed to sweep you away. There are only four pieces on the album, but they are all winners. \\"A Trip To The Fair\\" is a heavenly 11-minute dreamscape. \\"The Vultures Fly High\\" is a short but very effective prog-rocker. \\"Ocean Gypsy\\" is a gorgeous song, and one of the band's all-time classics. And then, of course, there's the 25-minute, nine-part epic, \\"Song Of Scheherazade,\\" the band's magnum opus that reinterprets Rimsky-Korsokov's classical tale about the Sultan and the magical woman, Scheherazade, who ultimately wins his heart. With orchestral accompanyment by the London Symphony Orchestra, the band perform this opus with tremendous power and beauty. Once again, the whole band shines throughout the album: Annie Haslam's magical singing voice, Michael Dunford's brilliant guitar-playing, Jon Camp's powerful basslines (and co-lead vocals on \\"Scheherazade\\"), John Tout's phenomenal keyboard work, and Terry Sullivan's incredible drumming. Long live Renaissance! \\"Scheherazade And Other Stories\\" is an outstanding album.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is a movie which should be on the viewing list for adults and young adults who appreciate challenging their thinking. It takes place in the not-too-distant future when humans are biologically engineered to be perfect before birth via embryionic \\"adjustments\\". Those who come into being the old fashioned way are deemed abnormal and not suited for important positions in society. The story revolves around one man's challenge to the system. Will he be able to travel in space to Titan even though he is imperfect?  He exchanges his identity in order to achieve his dreams. The movie has lots of tense moments and unexpected twists. I don't think you will regret having seen this movie and it may just provide conversation for a long time after you do.
B00004TH83|5.0|There is not a bad cut on this it is well written easy listening to neo classical music, begining with the song that got her noticed in the U.S.; \\"I Will Love Again\\", \\"Giving Up On You\\", \\"I Am What I Am\\", Yeliel(My Angel), Adagio and \\"Love By Grace\\".  Stands to repeated listenings without it hardly getting old, Lara Fabian is a beautiful lady with a beautiful voice and an expertly produced album to boot.
B00006HAZG|4.0|This version of David Copperfield was done as a miniseries for TV. While it gives us a decided flavor of Charles Dicken's rich characterizations, it leaves some important characters behind. This is necessary, in part, due to the enormous length of the original work. Still, when I used it in my English classes, it helped high school students with learning disabilities to visualize the historical climate and serves as a springboard for reading chapters from the novel and discussion. Student comments were positive for overall enjoyment of the movie. For those interested in the actors, the cast is not only recognizable, but accomplished. You will be delighted at some of the portrayals!

B000P0J0G0|5.0|I cant see how a comedy fan, especially of cutting edge British humour can avoid these two clowns. At their best they are just supremely silly and possess a Python Silliness Reciprocal Coefficient Constant (PSRCC) of 0.987 which is the 3rd highest rating recorded in this part of the milky way since the early 17th century. For this achievement alone these two little rascals should be knighted and put in cold storage for further medical examination. We must as a species, find out what exactly this genetic abnormality is in a philosophical and sexual sense and how to harness its potential to combat the looming crisis of global warming. Its the only hope we have left to us now...............
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I just bought this box set from Best Buy for my girlfriend, and I've had to return it TWICE!!! Most of the DVDs were severely scratched right out of the box, and wouldn't play on my DVD player. The Best Buy employee went through 4 box sets on the shelf, and all of them were scratched. HBO has basically put out an incredibly shoddy product. Even if you love Sex and the City, DO NOT buy this set! You will regret it. Hopefully, HBO will have the good sense to issue a recall one of these days. In the meantime, I'm considering never buying an HBO product again.

The raw talent, combined with practice and learning serves as a multiplier that accelerates growth and the ultimate payoff. The book itself is a good reference, but the online test is what you are paying for.

0613174674|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. The early scenes when the young Michael was with Hanna were good; afterward the story just had too much telling, not enough showing.

B00005JPFH|1.0|I'm very disappointed of this movie. It's the worst of the 3. terrible plot and script. In fact, this is the Loverman not the Spiderman. Venom only appeared in the last part of the movie-what is the main plot? what is the subplot??? I'm really angry!!    poor dialogue, decent special effects and poor performance.    Don't waste your money and time on this movie. It's horrible..awful...I can't describe it!!!
B000UFAURI|3.0|I give Dave Grohl heaps of credit.  The man who once played drums behind the greatest songwriter of a generation set his sights on greater ambitions and emerged victorious atop the modern rock pantheon.  Album releases are always consistent: the content within never fails to sell the notion of the redemptive powers of rock and roll.  Yet for all of his songwriting chops, I feared this new Foo Fighters album might exhibit Grohl as his own worst enemy, a man who, in a recent interview (I believe it was Spin), conceded that his comfort zone had always resided near heavy melodic rock.<br /><br />\\"Echoes, Silence, Patience, & Grace\\" is not short on the gratuitous melodic rockers, but it does demonstrate a more varied and vulnerable approach to the Foo formula in a manner far less contrived than 2005's \\"In Your Honor.\\"  Four out of the first five tracks are classic howlers, with Grohl purging his emotions through snarled vocals amidst a backdrop of thunderous drumming and crushing distortion.  See \\"Let It Die\\" or \\"Erase/Replace\\" to get a picture.  Exploring more subdued textures and atmospheres, the Foos give us tracks like \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\" \\"The Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners,\\" the latter of which features the deft guitar work of Kaki King.  Closing things out on a highly introspective note, we are given the song \\"Home.\\"  Allegedly a songwriting milestone for Grohl, the tune is also the most likely musical connection to the album title.<br /><br />After 12 years of pursuing the \\"if it ain't broke...\\" formula, it's a refreshing to see America's most reliable rock and roll outfit pushing themselves, even if just a little bit.  Studio release #7 should be spectacular.

0374280967|5.0|In the best of all possible worlds, the Uncommon Reader of the title would include Alan Bennett in the New Year's Honours Lists for penning this little gem of a book. The author paints a gentle portrait of a very real woman, isolated by definition, whose life of dutiful dedication becomes richer and more enjoyable with the discovery of reading for pleasure. And, human nature being what it is, as soon as this pleasure is made evident, the stuffy bureaucrats, whose routine is upset by what represents an aberration in THEIR schedules, do their best to spoil it.<br /><br />Bennett treats his Uncommon Subject--that is, his Monarch--with love. His dry and often acerbic humor is reserved for the politicians: the anonymous French premier, who has never heard of Jean Genet, or the equally anonymous and bellicose Prime Minister upon whom Her Majesty thrusts volumes about the endangered archaeological remains of the Cradle of Civilization. Needless to say, the books go unread. And then there is Sir Kevin! But to discover Sir Kevin's brand of singular contumacy, you must read the book.<br /><br />You will not regret it!

B000Y44LBG|4.0|This is a fascinating, interesting story.  Telling the tale of Frank Lucas, the black \\"businessman\\", whose business was to run the Heroin trade through Harlem and much of the NYC area in the early '70s was a fine idea.  The study of his approach to his business (avoiding flashy clothing to escape notice, a genteel attitude, surrounding himself with family) feels very specific and authentic.  His occasional bursts of brutal violence and temper are all the more shocking because of his normally placid demeanor.    Juxtapose that story with that of the cop who finally brought him to justice, and you've got a juicy story.      The film is exceedingly well crafted.  It feels like NYC of another era, before it was cleaned up.  You can practically smell the smoke and uncollected trash.  Director Ridley Scott brings a great attention to detail, and he never overplays his hand.  He's not always been the best at showing restraint...but here he knows that carefully layering this story and bringing the two threads closer and closer together is the right approach.    Scott has also cast his movie very well.  Lots of familiar faces in smallish roles, including Chiwetal Ejiofor as Frank's brother, Ted Levine as the police captain, Cuba Gooding Jr. as a rival drug dealer and Rudy Dee as Lucas' mother.  But the central focus is on the two lead performances:  Russell Crowe as the honest cop and Denzel Washington as the suave crime lord.  Crowe is dirty, disheveled, sweaty and apparently a pretty bad husband and father.  He's also very honest.  Washington is clean-cut, intelligent, charming and a psychopath.    Crowe is one of those actors who immerses himself into each role.  I think back on how different he was in THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR and A BEAUTIFUL MIND (three Oscar nominations in a row).  Each character looked different, felt different.  Crowe carries himself differently no matter who he is playing.  In AMERICAN GANGSTER, he's aware of his faults, yet clings stubbornly to the idea that he's doing the right thing.  Not out of nobility, but really because that's the only truly good quality he has left...an uncompromised approach to his work.  While it isn't his greatest acting achievement...it is solid work indeed.    Washington has long brought the exact same suaveness, quick smile, even quicker frown to his work.  He oozes charisma, and he brings it on big-time in his role here.  He needs it, because we must care to some degree about this horrific man.  But I'm not seeing anything Washington hasn't done about 100 times before.  He hasn't really stretched his acting chops in a long time.  The role is more outsized that usual perhaps...but his portrayal is, frankly, a little predictable.    The whole movie is just a smide predictable.  It feels like a really well executed episode of \\"Law and Order\\" for much of it.  I'm so tired of the cliched bulletin board with push-pinned photos of all the bad guys hanging from it.  Seems like every cop movie or TV show made these days has a version of this.  How often can we see a montage of the cops standing around and rearranging these photos as a way of indicating that their investigation is progressing.    For every lazy scene like that, the film does have one or two inventive ones.  All the scenes that feature the corrupt cops (led by Josh Brolin) crackle with violence that almost but never quite reaches the surface.      In the end, as the story began to wrap up, I realized that while I was content to see how everything played out...I didn't really CARE all that much.  After investing nearly 2.5 hours, I should have been much more tense or excited.  But I was merely interested.  Not much passion there.    So while there is much to admire, and I certainly do recommend it for an adult audience...this movie is not quite the classic it aspires to be.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|Going into a Quentin Tarantino movie, you know you have to expect carnage.  In his latest picture, `Death Proof' I thought by mid-movie, I had entered into a misogynists' paradise.  Not so.  Although you'll understand my misconception.  As most people have pointed out, this film is Tarantino's homage to B-movies.  It even has moments with threads going down the movie or reel changes done like you are sitting at a local theater in the day when they didn't have multiplexes, and the technician showing the movie was asleep at the wheel.      Taking place in Texas and Tennessee, a Hollywood stunt car driver, actually named \\"Stuntman Mike\\" (Kurt Russell) stalks beautiful models and Hollywood actresses on the scene, so that he can take them for a ride in his professional car.  He calls it \\"Death Proof\\" because of its design.  What he doesn't tell them is as dangerous as his grudge.  Using a black car with a white skull and crossbones, the whole affair comes across like a Joyce Carol Oates short story without the feeling of tragedy.      Making a comparison to his other movies, some of which I truly enjoyed, revealed my problem with this one.  `Pulp Fiction' [[ASIN:B000068DBC Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] had us involved with quirky situations and the characters played by Bruce Willis and John Travolta, entertained us so well.  In 'Kill Bill 1' [[ASIN:B00068ULLY Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 (Box Set)]] we were dished out a martial arts extravaganza culminating in an exquisitely violent and beautiful sword scene played out in a winter garden.  Then, 'Kill Bill 2' we were enthralled by the twists, turns, and tension laid out by the key players.  In both movies, we empathized with the pathos, comedy, and tragedy as experienced by Uma Thurman's character.  Our meeting with Bill, played by David Carradine, was no anti-climax, either.  We were in awe and shock mode, and knew that mostly we weren't supposed to take it all so seriously.    My main problem with 'Death Proof'is that, although we have finely drawn characters in the film,' we don't care about them.  The chic chatter of the core female protagonists is meant to get us to hope for their demise.  In the end we hope the road rage ends both the misogynist (played skillfully in a creepy way by Kurt Russell) and the prima donnas who end up in his sites.  The road chase scenes are lively and capture a close up brutality, and the honky-tonk bar scenes certainly provide an exposition that is sordid and detailed.  He's got it right conceptually and visually.  It's just much of the story and characterization often fail.  What we get is a lot of wasted talk time and little of the novelties of past Tarantino adventures.  It's just no fun anymore.       (One thing that does match 'Pulp Fiction' is the soundtrack.  'Death Proof' may not be on the top of my list, but the soundtrack surely is.)

B000EGEVZK|5.0|Quite simply, if you are a fan of the ramones or just a fan of honest straight forwards guitar, bass and drums music then this is for you.    If you are looking for screaming guitar solos and pyrotechnics then no, the Ramones were about the music especially live simple as that.    Not big on bonus features, interviews and 3 low budget videos I had not seen, but with about 4 hours of live ramones what do you want?
B000SFJWLU|4.0|Let's get things straight, I don't like metalcore, its c***-tease metal. All the songs sound the same, start off heavy scream, scream, scream then have the obligatory breakdown where they sing. Ya get me worked up and moshing and then the singing comes and just sounds out of place, and I can't do anything with it. They only metalcore band I like a lot is Unearth.     Now I have two metalcore bands I like.    Getting into FFDP was pretty easy: I saw their name on the bill for the Family Values Tour and said \\"That is the most ridiculously awesome name!\\" and checked out them performing Salvation on YouTube and was hooked. I never heard anything from Motograter or Ghost Machine, so I wasn't even part of the Ivan Moody fan club until hearing this.    Ivan Moody is a big part of why FFDP works, the man can scream and grunt, and sing really well. His voice is completely void of that whiney emo tone that plagues a lot of singers in the metalcore business. The other aspect of this band that works is that they don't completely change the momentum of the song with the breakdowns; they go from hard head-banging riffs to more melodic work without a hitch and throw in guitar solos and other interesting elements with ease.     But the album has some elements that don't completely work. For one the song structure is pretty similar, scream the verses sing the chorus, repeat (except \\"The Bleeding\\" where they switch it). This method works flawlessly for the first 5 tracks in pure awesome metal goodness. We then hit \\"The Devil's Own\\" and we reach the first dud in the album. It's a personal pet peeve of mine hearing about people whine about mommy and daddy problems. Ivan, you're like 30 dude, if your parents cause you that much angst, get some therapy or stop sending them Christmas cards.     \\"White Knuckles\\" and \\"Can't Heal You\\" keep the album going good, and do play with the song structures and have some really addictive guitar work. \\"Death Before Dishonor\\" really doesn't work for me,I find the melody of the chorus clunky and well nothing really works on that song for me. But the album ends on a strong note with \\"Meet the Monster\\" a crunchy track that is hard not to scream along with.    So all in all Way of the Fist is a good album, and once Five Finger Death Punch has had time to gel with one another and push their talents even further I'm sure they will become a bigger, better, meaner fist ready to punch some metal in our eardrums.
1594200106|3.0|No spoilers<br /><br />As much as I wanted to agree with the stellar reviews this book is getting, I can't. When it comes to the content of the story, I thoroughly enjoyed the way it unfolded, the characters, and the unexpected twists. What I didn't like, and the reason for its 3 1/2 star rating is that this book is wayyyy too long and drawn out. I'm not at all against reading long books if there is a purpose, but with The Shadow of the Wind, it seemed as if Zafon set a page total in his mind, and forced himself to drag the story out until he got there.<br /><br />Despite that flaw however, I did enjoy the story and if you are a fan of books themselves, then you will enjoy it to. The bottom line is that if you read a lot, then I suggest you pick this up because you will like it and the time you spend on it won't be of much significance. On the other hand, if you don't have the time to read a lot and need to be sure that each and every book you read is a gem, skip this one.
0375703861|3.0|The start of this book intrigued me. I liked the writing and general atmosphere. I liked the multi-cultural background, and did enjoy seeing the world from Samal's eyes, a Bangladesh-born man living in England.The novel was funny and insightful, and my hopes were high for this book. Unfortunately, the more I read, the less interest I had. While the characters were interesting at first, they were not believable, nor particularly likeable. On top of that, there was not a plot that I could follow with interest. Yet in spite of those weaknesses, there continued to be small scenes that I did enjoy. This felt like a quality book that just just did not grab me.

Day after day...The ugliness...With you violence is a way of life, living with violence and death.\\"<br /><br />This is what San Francisco Detective Lieutenant's Frank Bullitt's (the \\"King of Cool,\\" the legendary Steve McQueen, 1930 to 1980) girlfriend Cathy (the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset) says to him.  As well, this quotation pretty well sums up the entire movie (based on the 1963 novel \\"Mute Witness\\" by Robert L. Pike) as the viewer is given a glimpse into Bullitt's world.<br /><br />On this particular assignment, Bullitt has to protect (\\"baby sit\\") a star witness for an important trial.  He was specifically requested for this routine assignment by the ambitious public prosecutor Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn, who has said that this is his best movie role).<br /><br />However, things don't turn out to be routine.  Bullitt's captain (the late Simon Oakland) gives the viewer a glimpse of what has happened (or at least what he thinks has happened) with this \\"simple\\" assignment when he says to Bullitt:<br /><br />\\"What the hell is going on here?  A high-speed pursuit.  And two men are killed.  An officer in the hospital.  A witness almost murdered.  I want to know what's happening and I want to know now!\\"<br /><br />A feature of this movie is the car chase or the \\"high-speed pursuit\\" (between a Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger) mentioned by the captain (described as one of \\"movie history's most memorable car chases\\").  This chase is for real, not an illusion.  McQueen did his own stunt driving and, at times, actual speeds exceeded 115 miles per hour.  The entire chase lasts about eight minutes.  (Some say longer, some say shorter.  It depends where you start timing.)<br /><br />Many people are probably under the impression that this chase is the only good thing about this movie.  I know I was under that impression.  Was I wrong!!  The story presented is quite good.  It is very realistic (for that time period) presenting to-the-letter police, hospital, and morgue procedures.<br /><br />The story itself is quite good.  It has many twists and turns.<br /><br />A note of caution here.  This is a movie where you have to pay attention.  If you don't, the scenes that occur after the car chase will be difficult to follow and you will be disappointed.  (In other words, this movie is not for those with a low attention span.)  Also note that you may still have questions after the movie has concluded since all of them are not answered in the movie.  If you think about what you have seen, you can easily answer these questions for yourself.<br /><br />The acting is in a word: fantastic.  McQueen's performance is superb.  Robert Vaughn does a good job of portraying the ambitious Chalmers against McQueen's low-keyed Bullitt character.  I also liked Simon Oakland's portrayal of the police captain.<br /><br />A fun feature (at least for me) was trying to identify actors in this movie before they made it big.  For example, Robert Duvall has a small part as a taxi driver.  I also spotted Suzanne Sommers in a bit part.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the sharp, sparse dialogue.  There is also jazzy background music (that is most effective in the opening sequence).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in late 1997) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has the movie in full screen on one side and wide screen on the other.  There are also some interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an unforgettable movie starring the legendary Steve McQueen, \\"The King of Cool.\\"  If you decide to view this movie, I urge you to do one thing: buckle up!!<br /><br />(1968;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide/full screen;  22 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXng to-the-letter police, hospital, and morgue procedures.<br /><br />The story itself is quite good.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I'm embarassed to say that I'm 45 years old, but I'd been a huge fan of the Zwick/Herskovitz team since 1980's \\"thirtysomething\\". I watched a few episodes of MSCL and was riveted by their ability to not only cast watchable reality (not overacting) teenagers, but how attractive their male counterparts always were.    Jared Leto must have been every high school girl's version of their first major crush.  This guy took a minor part and parlayed it into a major character for all remaining episodes, much the same way Matthew McConaughey did in \\"Dazed and Confused\\".  Brad Pitt also took a minor part in a third-season episode of \\"thirtysomething\\" and was cast as the lead in \\"The Legends of the Fall\\", his entree to super stardom.    It's practically inconceivable that Claire Danes was 14 when the series was first filmed.  The Z/H team never disappoint and this series is lasting proof.  Although unrelated, my only disappointment is that \\"thirtysomething\\" is not available on DVD as well.

Her amazing voice doesn't compete with Nightwish's sound. It's fluid. It enhances the music rather than detracting from it. Kudos to the band. You guys rock! Wrap Annette in a big red bow and don't even think of letting her go. Before you were unique and good. Now you're unique and amazing. It was like having all the parts without the whole before. Dark Passion Play is a masterpiece. The lyrics are seamless with the music and Annette's voice is a big reason for that. It's kismet.
0761129235|4.0|The author explains that many of us are overwhelmed with the magnitude of the effort, discipline and change required to accomplish a major personal or professional objective.  Many of us try to run a marathon (lose weight, quit smoking, etc) without any pre-race training - the outcome -  pain and/or inability to finish.  So we start, stop, start, stop and eventually we condition ourselves to failure.

1401300529|3.0|David Halberstam was a gifted and intelligent writer and reporter. He also understood that there is not much demand for an account praising general officers, but rather a larger audience for a book praising the enlisted men and company and field grade officers on the battle ground who often appear more prescient and wise than their superiors. There has been a field day by lesser men dancing on General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's grave, when this controversial and complicated man is past defending himself. Even Gen. Matthew Ridgway's account of the Korean War was safely published after MacArthur's death in 1964. While conceding the General's ego and hubris, and the sycophantic and obsequious staff he encouraged in Tokyo, it must be noted, and usually is not, that his putative arrogance - in assuring Truman and the JCS that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea- was based on his not unreasonable belief that should they do so, they would face almost total destruction at the hands of the U.S. Air Force, Marine and Navy air craft. MacArthur no doubt assumed that the Chinese knew this and thus would be too prudent to so expose their forces. However, the Chinese had learned through the Russians that Truman and the JCS had determined that this was to be a \\"limited conflict\\" and that the U.N. forces would not pursue and punish the Chinese north of the Yalu, should they intervene, thus providing them a sanctuary. This information was passed on to the Russians by their British spy in the U.S., Kim Philby, when he was posted to the U.S. as the British M16 (Intelligence) liaison to the U.S. intelligence agencies, especially the C.I.A. Philby was a close friend of top U.S. intelligence officials including the C.I.A.'s James Jesus Angelton, as has been widely reported and acknowledged. MacArthur afterwards always suspected that somehow the Chinese knew of this ability to retreat with impunity beyond the Yalu. Surely he would have hedged his statements about the possibilityof Chinese intervention had he known they would have such a sanctuary.

The end was sappy and I hated the way he acted when he was the dark spiderman. in the comics he was more aggressive, but now they make him seem like some kind of love machine. Very sickening. The jazz scene was also dorky and could have been left out!!!! Not a good movie to buy unless completing a collection.
184195425X|5.0|A few years ago, \\"Life of Pi\\" was the book du jour. You were nobody if you hadn't read it, couldn't discuss it, had no knowledge of it. I've always had a side to my personality that resists this pop-cultural frenzy, and so I left Martel's book by the wayside.<br /><br />Recently, I had trusted friends mention this book in conversation, and I decided to give it a chance. I expected a fable, with whimsical scenes, and an immediate suspension of disbelief required. I expected a deeply philosophical dialogue between a tiger and an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat together. What I found was much more and a lot less.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" follows young Piscine, an Indian boy with an unshakable belief in God. He covers all his bases, embracing Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. The author never favors one over the other, but seems to use this near-universal approach to religion as a means of narrowing his debate to this one question: Does God exist?<br /><br />Martel is a master wordsmith. He takes us into his character's mind, and he gives vibrant details of animal life and behavior. When Pi's family decides to move to Canada, they take a ship across the Pacific, only to have the ship sink beneath them. Young Pi survives, trapped on a lifeboat with a few animals, including a tiger. The descriptions of survival and animal alpha-dominant training ring true, and in fact it's this amazing attention to details that gives the story its weight. The incredible circumstances would seem like nothing more than hallucinations, but they become realistic and credible in the hands of Martel and his young narrator. In the end, this credibility adds impact to his question about God's existence.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is much more than a fable. It's a gripping story, in its own right. It's also less than a thorough treatise on philosophy or theology. It's a simple question posed in such dramatic fashion that it begs to be considered.

B00005JPFH|4.0|If you view this movie as a Spidey versus a Super villain flick, the story is too cluttered and seems confusing.  James Franco is back as Harry Osborn and the New Goblin trying to avenge his father's death against Spiderman / Peter Parker.  Then there is a story revision from the first movie (not uncommon in comic books) that the guy we thought killed Uncle Ben didn't, it was Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who was trying to raise money for his sick daughter.  On top of that, a new photographer has come to the Daily Bugle to expose Spiderman as a bad guy.  This is music to J. Jonah Jameson's ears, so Parker loses income he badly needs to a kid who is trying to do him in rather than just report what actually happened.  The conflict between Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and Peter Parker is the core of the film, but it takes awhile to really gather some steam.  On top of all this there is some kind of living goo that crashed to Earth in a meteor and it is after Peter / Spidey, too.<br /><br />So, is that enough stuff for one film?  Oh, yeah, there is also the love relationship between Peter and Mary Jane that has to undergo a crisis in the film.  And it is closer to this relationship that the real point of the film lies.  This is really a story about Peter Parker becoming a man and having to choose what kind of person he will be.  The huge cast of characters are there to present Spiderman with complex choices.  Will Peter choose the self-indulgent path, give up, or choose to be a good man and a hero?  You can guess which it will be by the end of the film, but it is a circuitous route.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, and the personal crisis story does have its routes in Spiderman story traditions.  However, it isn't quite as much fun as the straightforward good-guy bad-guy smash `em with a building story.  My guess is that they powers that be felt they had done that twice already and wanted something different.  OK.  You did it.  Can we get back to Spidey fighting Rhino, Tombstone, Mysterio, or any of the other dozens of bad guys Spiderman has dealt with over the decades.

I'm often mocked by colleagues at George Washington University who spend all their time reading the Wall Street Journal.      This is the best book I've read in years. I was so excited to pick up a new author and not be disappointed by formulaic characters and plots and unnecessary prose that never seems to end. It is original and enthralling. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a day and half. I was so angry when I finished because I had to go back to crap (with the exception of the last Harry Potter). I refuse to say anything specific because if you're reading this: READ THE BOOK!     So please keep writing Pat, we're waiting anxiously for book 2!
0061120073|4.0|The thing about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is that it is inconsistent in terms of quality. The plot is AT TIMES interesting, and other times so dull I barely even bothered to read what was on the page. The writing is in fact incredibly readable, but that is only because it lacks depth at times and is extraordinarily simplistic.<br /><br />For the most part, the story of the Nolan's is interesting. Francie seems to be a character that falls into a template or a pattern - she is a reader, she is somewhat weak, and she is an intelligent child. These traits have rather become cliches in main characters, but the point is almost irrelevant here. The remainder of the Nolan family is fascinating, but more often than not, we are only given Francie, which is both disappointing and also boring at times. Things do get quite repetitive.<br /><br />There's not much to be said about the writing. It's hardly the most beautiful writing I've ever encountered, nor does it have the greatest consistency or flow, but it reads simple. For readers who don't want to dive into a thick book that is also complex, this would probably be a great choice.<br /><br />The best parts of this book are the little things. The \\"should-be-great\\" parts of the book are merely \\"okay\\". While the overall story is grand and impressive, at times the book and the writing simply stall, giving a few pages of words that really need not be there. Editing, perhaps, would have helped.<br /><br />On the whole, this book can be recommended, though be warned that it may not suit those in search of good writing, and also that it stops at time, or rambles. It is thoroughly readable, though, and overall good.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars - Recommended.
078322947X|5.0|This movie is in my top 3 all time favorites (American Graffiti & Crumb)  I hate to say that I first saw it on cable not knowing anything about the movie and really loved it.  After multiple viewings the Roxie theatre in San Francisco showed both 'Wages of Fear' & 'Sorcerer' w/ William Freidkin in attendance.  I went figuring he would talk for about 5 minutes and split.  After both movies were shown he spoke for about 45 minutes taking questions from the audience.  What an amazing evening as he went into detail about the genesis of Sorcerer...  - when he arrived into the town as they were preparing to shoot the movies 1000's of people were leaving in fear because the Director of the Excorcist was coming to town, and how a river in it's own history had never dried up did just that costing another 100K to rebuild the bridge that you see in the movie earning him the name 'Freddie the Bridge Builder'.    - his chance meeting w/ a band member of Tangerine Dream at a party and that person taking him to an abandoned church in the middle of the night where they lived and rehearsed  waking up the other band members and performing till sunrise.   Friedkin told them that he was interested in them scoring the music for his next movie.  He sent them the script during movie production and every few weeks he would get these cassette tapes w/ bits and pieces of what ended up being the soundtrack for Sorcerer.  He had a ton of stories and my biggest regret was not videotaping this event as I brought a camera but chickened out at the last minute!  Arrrrggghhh!  A Great Movie indeed.  -E-domo

0805079831|5.0|I am not finished reading this book yet, but I need to say what I think of it. Having read some of what Ms. Klein has to say about latin america I have to conclude that she has done her homework and that the results are outstanding. She is not only a great writer, as a narrator she is direct and clear on the issues and so being, she keeps your attention and interest.<br />But the main thing is the story she is telling. It is the true history of what happened in the 70's, 80's and up to here and now..A lot of these things were known by us latinos and some others we just inferred...but reading this book you get the sense that you were correct in assuming that all was connected and that maybe be there was not a conspiracy type of plan but the intention was and is still real...Of course that the help of a lot of our own murderers and thieves controlling state power was important..but this only demostrates one thing: greed has no frontiers...and money, for some, is more worthy than human life. Yes, it all makes sense...
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Just when you think Bruce Springsteen is fading and becoming more concerned with other genre's of music, he storms back with \\"Magic\\", a cd of work that is vintage Boss.  Anytime you put Bruce back in the company of the E Street Band, \\"Magic\\" is what you'll get and this cd doesn't dissapoint.  From the opening\\"Radio Nowhere\\", a strong, upbeat reminder of how great this band truly plays, to the closing, touching ballad \\"Song for Terry\\" (not listed on the cd), this is the Boss we grew up with.  In between the work is amazingly solid, especially \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\", \\"You'll Be Comin Down\\", \\"I'll Work for Your Love' and \\"Long Walk Home\\".  Do not fear, this is truly the man we discovered in the 70's and who luckily for us hasn't forgotten how to create \\"Magic\\" with his music.
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|Robert Plant's first solo effort after Led Zeppelin's end found him pulling from the past and pushing into the future. Working with Robbie Blunt, Plant is able to build his own unique style with a smooth, crisp vocal performance on many of the tracks of this CD. \\"Burning Down One Side\\" starts off the disc and it is the most Zeppelinesque, along with \\"Slow Dancer\\", in my mind. Plant pulls on his vocal chords in these tracks with the old Zeppelin sound reminsicent of some of the Physical Graffitti work. Plant and Blunt stand on their own though whith \\"Moonlight in Samosa\\" and \\"Fat Lip\\" - two songs that flow as though there is no clock in the room. You can't help but just get caught up in the smoothness of those tracks. The same can be said of \\"Far Post\\" which is a bonus track on the CD. If you loved Zeppelin you can't go wrong with this first Plant solo disc. The only thing I will say is don't expect the Jimmy Page solos because Blunt is a different type of musician but a quality one none the less. Also, the arrangements are similar to Zeppelin but definitely not Zeppelin. Plant has done work following this disc that is good and worthy of excellent review but to me this is his best because he needed to grab people after leaving Zeppelin. He did just that because it proves he is by himself more than just a long-haired god to the ladies - he is what many of us knew all along - a unique voice with a stylistic flair for combining his past to build his future.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|I don't know why it's taken me so long to review this movie, but I have to thank Bravo for airing this movie this weekend and reminding me how much I love it. I know it's cheesy. I know it's been done. I don't care. I love Honey. And here's why: 1) Honey starts off as a bartender but she secretly wants to make her living as a video dancer. I always root for the underdog. 2) Everything Honey wears reveals her midriff. Everything. 3) Honey teaches inner-city kids how to dance and then puts them in a music video. That's hot. 4) The line, \\"Someone wants to dip his fingers in the honey jar,\\" said in complete earnest. 5) The wannabe thug manager who flips out when he can't get the girl. You've seen it before (think Terrence Howard in Glitter). 6) Honey's parents want her to dance ballet, but Honey loves hip hop and follows her dreams (think Save the Last Dance).<br /><br />So yes. Honey isn't original. But hey, you steal from the best and make it your own. Honey does that. Yes it's got bits of Glitter, Flashdance, Center Stage, and any other dance movie you've seen in the last few decades. Yes. Honey is cheesy. But who cares? Enjoy it for what it is: a leisurely, entertaining film that ends in a dance sequence. What more could you want?
184195425X|4.0|So, the  first few pages are interesting and then it really drags for about 100 pages.  Then it really picks up and I was sucked right in. This is truly a cool book to read if you give it a chance.<br /><br />I do think it is rather hilarious that he is a practicing Christian/Muslim/Hindu, btw.<br /><br />It is amazing the way humans can adapt to any circumstance. This book is a great companion piece to Robinson Crusoe, I think.  Plus, the author has a nice surprise twist with the first landfall they make.  I really liked that part.  A worthwhile read.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Rataouille is the best film Pixar has come up with yet. As a mom and a movie lover-I have seen every Pixar movie and movie short that is available..nothing tops Rataouille. I could not wait for this to come out on DVD and the first moment I had the day it came out-I went and got it-watched it about 5 times-still get a kick outta every viewing. TOTALLY TOTALLY TOTALLY recommend it!
B000TGJ80I|5.0|I watched the second film first. Not only does the first clarify things a hundred times over. It's also a much better film overall. The storyline is much more intriguing and the characters have much more depth.<br /><br />I love the Blu-ray high-def quality.

630463949X|2.0|Fleetwood Mac, unless you are a true fan, really puts on a senseless, energy-drained show here that you'll sicken of faster than a can of Gummie Worms at the State Fair.  And State Fairs, indeed, are where this group ought to be playing; right next to Whitesnake and Rick Springfield and the demolition derby and blue ribbon goats.<br /><br />Buckingham gets his ya-yas out a couple times on lead guitar, but other than that, the ladies sound old, the bass player John just stands there (like he has for his entire career).  Christine still looks youthful; an unsung MaryAnne next to Stevie's more often photographed Ginger. Christine remains a comely British school marm ready to spank your wrists for looking up her skirt, so that's one redeeming feature. Yet that small pleasure is offset by Mick's still googly eyes and the 1980s vest.  Thanks for putting a camera right by Mick so that I can get scared out of my easy chair every time he stares those cue balls at the camera; nice touch for Halloween.<br /><br />I wish I could say that Fleetwood Mac are rockers, but alas, they are little more than Lawrence Welk on steroids.  Sure, Don't Stop pushes the metronome to 40 mph from Fleetwood Mac's usual school zone 20 mph pace, but seriously rip-snortin' rock and roll this just ain't, brothers and sisters.  No matter how much Dolby 5.1 Surround and DVD fog-filtered quality you throw at this show, the music remains elevator quality drivel.  The passge of time has, in my opinion, shown the Mac's music to be thinner than the veils around Stevie's midsection paunch.<br /><br />Pass on it.
0385486804|5.0|After recently having seen the new film of Into the Wild, I was desperate to read the book. Even knowing how truly fantastic the story was, I could never have imagined that the book would have portrayed the story in such a magnificent way. Jon Krakauer writes like no author I have ever come across and I finished the book in one sitting (a remarkable achievement for me!)    Read this book. You will not be disappointed.

1401302378|5.0|I'm just over halfway through this book right now and I'm sad to say that I've realized I'm not a filter.  I'm not the kind of guy this book talks about who helps others pick through the detritus in a specific niche and guides them to valued purchases.  So I'm trying to change that starting with this review.  The book is an enjoyable read with accessible examples everyone can relate to - not the typical stuffy business book.  As a web developer it is really inspiring to learn about the economics driving the phenomenon of unlimited inventory and social recommendations.  If you are an ideas person I would advise you not to read this book before bedtime because you'll find yourself struggling to sleep after reading each chapter

0345494768|5.0|I was one of those people standing in line back in the seventies the day that Star Wars opened. The impact of Star Wars has been well documented since then. The Making of Star Wars is not just for die hard Star Wars fans but anyone that is interested in the process of how a movie is made or almost didn't get made in Hollywood. The book is based on \\"lost\\" interviews of all the key players in the making of Star Wars. It has Gorge Luca's hand written notes of the various stages of treatment and development of the script. One of the most fascinating things about this book is seeing the changes that \\"The Star Wars\\" went through from the original concept to final product. Spielberg and Coppola both assisted with the script development as well as many of George Lucas's friends and associates. The book is packed with awesome photos of production and the time period, I really like the old pics of Lucas and Coppola having dinner in San Fran Chinese restaurant, what an amazing time it must have been. This book is for anyone that is a movie buff or a hard core Star Wars fan alike. I would have loved it as a holiday gift but I had to buy it for myself just to make sure that I got it.
0743435729|5.0|Having read through the entire Honor Harrington, plus a number of other books that Weber either authored or co-authored, I can readily say that he is one of the best writers in the business today.<br /><br />Every character gets developed so that you feel like you really know them. He carries their lives through each of the books in the series with amazing continuity, including the development of their personalities, the way in which they age, and the development of their relationsnips.<br /><br />This book, as the others, is just a joy to read.
1860468187|4.0|Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 but spent most of his youth in Kobe. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was first published in Japan in 1987, and first translated into English in 2000.    Toru Watanabe tells the story, looking back on his days as university student living in Tokyo. His circle of friends was very small, and he appears to have always been a fairly solitary type. Originally from Kobe, Toru only had one real friend at school - Kizuki, who committed suicide at seventeen. He went on to university in Tokyo, where he largely appeared to keep to himself. There, he did - briefly - have a roommate at his dormitary - though the pair had very little in common. (Toru's roommate is known only as \\"Storm Trooper\\" in the book, a nickname gained through his obsession with sanitation). Nagasawa, a diplomacy student at the university, was more an acquaintance than a real friend. He was very intelligent, and came from an influential family - he took Toru under his wing after the pair discovered a common love of \\"The Great Gatsby\\". (No-one else in the dorm had any interest had any interest in the classics). Nevertheless, they did little together other than drink and chase women.    Toru's two key relationships, however, were both with women. One was Naoko - a Beatles fan and the very delicate one-time girlfriend of Kizuki.The pair meet up again in Tokyo, roughly a year after Kizuki's death and start spending more and more time together. Eventually, Toru falls for Naoko and, on the evening of Naoko's twentieth birthday, things get intimate. Unfortunately, the evening proves a little difficult for Naoko to deal with and she takes off - booking herself into a sanitorium in an attempt to deal with her difficulties. The pair keep in touch write to each other, though, and Toru is keen to see her again.    In Naoko's absence, however, the arrival of Midori Kobayashi complicates things. Like Toru, she studies drama at the university - but she's very different sort of person to Naoko. Lively and outgoing, she combines her studies with helping her father in his bookshop. Gradually, she and Toru spend more and more times together - and it leaves Toru a little unsure which direction to travel in.    A little frustratingly, the book left me with a couple of questions about some of the characters. Despite only being a minor character, I couldn't help wondering what happened to Storm Trooper...Similarly, I found myself feeling concerned for Reika, Naoko's closest friend at the sanitorium - and hoping that things worked out for her. Most of all, there's no indication of how Toru's life progressed, between the book's final page and the flight to Germany that sparked his memories. However, it's an excellent book overall, and well worth reading.
0312983867|3.0|The Plum family's next door neighbour, Mabel Markowitz, needs Stephanie's help. Her grand-daughter, Evelyn Soder, has disappeared with her daughter and Evelyn's husband is threatening to collect on a child custody bond that would leave Mrs Markowitz homeless. The husband is a rather mean dude who lost his bar in a business deal with local nasty Eddie Abruzzi who doesn't hesitate to make overt threats to Stephanie when she begins to investigate Evelyn's disappearance.<br /><br />The fat, unflappable and still on the tarty side ex-hooker Lula, together with Grandma Mazur and a new addition to the cast - outrageous nerd lawyer Albert Kloughn who fancies himself a man of action and gent about town - are all good for some great slapstick belly laughs! But Stephanie herself, over-sexed and under-satisfied, carrying around lots of personal angst and torn between her affection for cop Morelli and her lust for Ranger, the hot muscled Cuban bounty-hunter extraordinaire, is getting tired. Not only is her self-doubt becoming a drag on the series but she seems to be devolving into a stereotypical weak-kneed female who cries out for Ranger's or Morelli's help at every opportunity!<br /><br />Setting aside the silliness of having one of the bad guys trail Stephanie around wearing a bunny suit as a disguise, the plot of \\"Hard Eight\\" is actually darker and a little more substantive than most of the preceding seven titles in the series. So if we've got a better plot with a little weaker main character, I suppose that leaves us with a series that still has plenty of legs. But the legs are getting a little wobbly and only reading \\"To the Nines\\", the next title in the series will reveal whether Evanovich can pull a rabbit out of the hat and rejuvenate the flash and magic that was so charming in the earlier novels.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss
B00000490M|4.0|THE KARATE KID has been around for more than twenty years, long enough for viewers to pass judgment on a film that resonated on so many levels that one wonders whether it still does.  The short answer is yes, that it is as powerfully visual and philosophical now as then.  But after all this time, let's see what drew fans to see it several times then and then let's see if there were anything subliminal that drew us in even as it dared us to connect the dots in a hybrid blend of eastern and western thought,<br /><br />First, the movie was a huge hit because it accomplished what all hits had to.  Viewers could relate to the twin leads, Ralph Macchio as Daniel Russo and Pat Morita as Miyagi, the karate teacher.  Macchio hit all the right notes as the transplanted Jersey boy trying to fit in with the sub-bleached crowd of southern California.  Macchio is your basic nice kid whose skinniness and poverty make him the instant target of the school bullies, most of whom are loathe to admit that deep down they are jealous of his ability to relate to pretty coeds.  What is significant is that the bullies are shown in only two environments--their male bonding when they beat on a hapless Macchio and their inability to relate to those same pretty coeds. Pat Morita as Miyagi steals the show as the handyman whose talents include his being the prototypical wise sensei.  Morita is both wise, understanding, funny, and sad--sometimes all in the same scene.  His best moments are not limited to showing Macchio the rudiments of Karate by painting, polishing, and sanding, although after seeing the wisdom of his techniques I imagine that many students wished their own senseis were equally motivational. What makes Morita's Miyagi the role of a lifetime is his ability to morph from one personality to another in the blink of an eye, and to make us see and believe each unraveling of the chameleon that we see as a transplanted Okinawan who has suffered untold pain all his life, while waiting patiently for the right student to come along who is worthy to receive the benefits of his wisdom, much of which only touches on the martial arts. In Miyagi, we see the whole man who can use his wits to defuse one potentially harmful situation (remember when Miyagi and Daniel go to the lion's den to confront the villainous Karate teacher, well played by Martin Kove?) and can use his fighting skills when wits will not suffice. The audience was sold from the first minute, knowing full well that there had to be an uplifting Rocky-type conclusion, but when we are involved in the lives of leads, we do not care we are being manipulated.  But what of the subtext that becomes clear only after repeated viewings?<br /><br />And this brings me to my second point.  As wondrous a role as Morita had, director John Avildsen chose to present Morita as more of the eastern stereotype of the inscrutable Asian than as one who can function on his own unique level.  Although it is true it was this very inscrutableless that delineated Miyagi's character and invested it with the necessary cinematic magic to permit the audience to swallow the impossibility of teaching a neophyte enough Karate in a few weeks to win a major tournament.  Consider the true man behind the wise and elderly exterior.  We see Miyagi as how we want to view exotic Asian men.  They can sit in the lotus position and try to snatch flies out of the air with chopsticks. We see him as essentially sexless, having lost his wife and son to birth complications more than forty years ago.  We see him as an accomplished bonsai horticulturalist. And we see him as one who can show inner pain only after drinking saki. We did not care then that Miyagi emerged as the true dramatic center because of his Asian culture which gradually invests him with mythic status.  But I think it is about time to acknowledge that our fondest memories of THE KARATE KID come about because of Avildsen's decision to present a movie that fed into some deep-rooted western beliefs about the differences between one culture and another. THE KARATE KID is a monster hit but we should understand just why that it is so.fs about the differences between one culture and another.

B00001NTXN|5.0|Quoridor is our family's new favorite game.  The goal is to move your pawn or place a fence to block your opponent's play.  The concept seems simple, but the the strategy gets more complex the more you play because you learn strategies from each other.  Each time you play is different.  Make your opponent move all the way back to their side and they won't fall for that again.  Make a path along the wall to get to the other side and your opponent may catch what you are doing and make you back track all the way around.  I bought three of this game.  One for my wife and I, one for my parents, and one for my classroom.  I'm looking forward to playing a four player game other the holidays.
1594489505|5.0|Dr. Hosseini has written another blockbuster about Afganistan.  His previous book \\"The Kite Runner\\" was written from a male perspective.  This one is from a female perspective.  These two books are very helpful in understanding what happened in that country in the past 30-40 years.  Since they're works of fiction they're not meant to be scholarly books but interwoven within the mesmerizing stories about people........you can understand how tragic their recent history is, particularly how the Taliban has wreaked havoc and desolation.

6304779356|5.0|Lost boys was another well made modern day vampire story that I was happy to be able to purchase on dvd because, yep, you guessed it, my vhs copy of this wore out also. Dianne Wiest is good as the mom and the grandfather that they come to stay with is eccentric but often hillarious. Jason Patrick has a somewhat eerie presence about him at times and Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as the leader of the vampire gang. What's a good horror flick without a pretty girl for two young vampires to squabble over, enter (Star)Jamie Gertz. It is always a pleasure to see Corey Haim and Corey Feldman together in any movie and they are great together in this one. Special effects are very good, humour is abundant and gore is widespread. The sountrack to this movie is awesome. So, set back, turn out the lights, grab a chineese takeout and oh yeah, are you sure that's a container of rice that you are eating? Nuff Said.

0792838068|3.0|Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) is a raging alcoholic.  When he is fired from his job, he moves to Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death.  Upon his arrival he meets an attractive prostitute named Sera (Elizabeth Shue) and the two strike up a quasi-romance in which he agrees not to condemn her profession and she agrees not to interfer with his determination to kill himself with alcohol.  It is, many critics and fans say, a story of unconditional love.  It is also one of the most profoundly overrated films to emerge from 1990s Hollywood.<br /><br />The primary problem with LEAVING LAS VEGAS is the implausibility of its characters.  There have been, no doubt, men determined to literally drink themselves to death--but the fact remains that men in such an advanced stage of alcoholism aren't loveable, much less reasonably good looking, much less capable of the thought processes depicted here.  There have been, no doubt, hookers with hearts of gold--but those who operate at the level of Sera are seldom memorable beauties and tend to be drug addicted, mentally ill, and often both.  And it is very obvious that not a person involved with the film has the faintest idea of what a flop-house hotel is actually like.<br /><br />Having established these characters, the film proceeds to follow them to a bitter end that I found not in least moving because I never believed them in the first place.  This is not to say that Cage and Shue give bad performances--they are actually remarkably good in their roles.  It's just that the whole film, which touts itself as a hard slice of reality, is so unrealistic that Disney's LITTLE MERMAID looks like a documentary in comparison.  Three stars for the performances, but they don't off-set the film's overall lack of veracity.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B000002H2H|5.0|This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, \\"thinking man's\\" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better.
0790731452|3.0|Suggested by a series of kiddie trading cards deemed so subversively violent that they were pulled from the market, MARS ATTACKS! is a film that tends to divide viewers into \\"love it\\" and \\"hate it\\" camps. Those who love it enjoy its mix of hommage and originality and its remarkably black sense of humor. Those who hate it feel that the humor becomes so black that it descends into a sort of lowbrow meanspiritedness that undermines any amusement involved. Strange to say, they're both right.<br /><br />The story is the classic \\"alien invasion\\" tale given increasingly weird twists. The United States decides to construe the arrival of a Martian fleet of flying saucers as a friendly arrival--but alas, the Martians have a sense of humor so distasteful that a herd of drunken frat boys look like Noel Coward in comparison. Cattle catch fire and stampede! Heads are switched with pet dogs! Congress is wiped out by ray gun! Can a highly unnatural pairing of Slim Whitman and Tom Jones save the day? Well, you never know.<br /><br />The film is rife with sight-gags, and when they work they work go off with a bang--with the Las Vegas scenes the high point of the film. It is true that the Martians are a tacky bunch, but it's hard to be tackier than Vegas, and director Tim Burton successfully works the joke to the nth degree. Trouble is, the rest of the film isn't at quite same level. It's presented as a joke, but it's hard to laugh when the residents of a retirement home are reduced to wheelchair-bound skeletons. MARS ATTACKS reaches for laugh after laugh, but too often the reach is funny and the pay off isn't.<br /><br />The film has a host of actors, some famous, some infamous, and some just plain camp. Jack Nicholson does double duty as President of the United States and a Las Vegas promoter; Glenn Close scores as the First Lady; Lisa-Marie is weirdly snakey as the \\"Martian Girl;\\" and Sylvia Sidney is memorable as the semi-senile Granny armed with Slim Whitman records. There are a lot more: Rod Steiger, Pierce Brosman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pam Greer, and so on, and most of them are as hit and miss as the film itself. I have to confess an unexpected liking for Tom Jones, who dives into the thing feet first and proves a lot fun. But it's the look and style that carry the thing, and it's all very \\"What the hell was that?\\"<br /><br />The DVD is truly no frills, although it does contain a few \\"Martian\\" jokes that are (somewhat like the film) more annoying than actually funny. Recommended as a curiosity and with the warning that you should rent it before you buy it: if you love it, you'll be more than ready to whip out the cash, but if you hate it, you'll grit your teeth for having spent a dime.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer, Pierce Brosman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pam Greer, and so on, and most of them are as hit and miss as the film itself.

B000Y179KO|5.0|The album would be an excellent value at the Wal-mart price - 2 CDs and 20 tunes - even if only half of the tracks were any good....but that's not the case here.  After the first somewhat esoteric track, the second track, How Long, sets the pace and and by the end of the first CD, I'm just shaking my head at how a group of 50ish formerly drugged out 70s rockers can sound so smooth.  By the end of the 2nd CD, I was just shaking.  I wouldn't have thought the Eagles could have improved on their past successes but they have. Their smooth country rock sound, Don Henley's and Glen Frey's harmonies, Joe Walsh's licks, and Timothy Schmitt's added vocals and bottom make this one of the best Albums of the year.  I'm sure after I play it enough, it will probably rank in my top 5 of all time.  Get this album and enjoy!
B000TLYEPC|1.0|Few bands could have gone through the challenges this band has and still come out swinging (Def Leppard is one that comes to mind). It makes one wonder just how much better they could have been had both Duane Allman and Berry Oakley made it to middle age instead of dying so tragically so early on and in such similar circumstances too.<br /><br />Still, Dickey Betts pulls off the guitar parts very admirably by himself on most of the tracks although Duanne is still on a few of the tracks such as the massive (34 minutes long) \\"Mountain Jam\\" and on one of the most beautiful solo acoustic guitar pieces I have ever heard, \\"Little Martha.\\" I have a soft spot for \\"Melissa\\" as it's my wife's name but I still think that Dickie overdid the guitar fills too much and even \\"spoiled\\" the song taking away from its potential as being a really good tender ballad.  Either the guitar fills should have been reduced in volume into the background or Dickie should have practised some restraint or Greg Allman's vocal should have been removed altogether to make this just an instrumental piece like \\"Little Martha.\\"  I personally would have gone with the second option as not all of Dickie's fills were bad but he just plain overdid it.  As a guitarist myself, I know how hard it is to just bury your ego, step back and let the rest of the band do their stuff and yet many times, less is more.  Angus Young from AC/DC said it best when he said we are called the \\"lead\\" guitarist and not the \\"loud\\" guitarist.  This coming from one of the best ever lead rock guitarists who ever lived.  Still, this is a great eulogy and elegy to the great Duanne Allman.<br /><br />This mlps version of the album though is a vast disappointment as the sound quality is very poor and is certainly not remastered. The old adage of judging the book by its cover certainly holds true here and therein lies the great waste. As far as mlps designs go, the packaging is first class as the gatefold design and workmanship plus the super quality cardboard used makes this one of the best mlps' that I've ever seen. An inner sleeve with all the lyrics in English and Japanese is included however, the most important part of the whole package, the cd sound quality, has been left unchanged making this version of the classic album a huge disappointment for the audiophile.

The powers that be have let a great opportunity to produce a high-class reissue version of the album go by. Unless you are a great mlps design fan alone, I don't know why you would want to pay serious bucks for great-looking cardboard when there is no improvement sound-wise to the cd that you already own.<br /><br />If you consider that Duane Allman together with Eric Clapton were probably the greatest blues guitarists of their time when Duane died (just hear their work together on Derek and the Dominoes' \\"Layla\\")the loss is truly great and one cannot but wonder at what might have been.<br /><br />Alas, we'll never know but get this and \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" if you want to get the best of the Allman Brothers' work.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|I simply do not know what went wrong. Brendan O'Brien, the same producer of the amazing return album of Bruce plus E-Street Band, \\"THE RISING\\", somehow managed to ruin production in this one, mainly Max Weinberg's drums. Everything here is muddled, no sharpness, no clear sound definition of any instrument. The songs themselves are great, in true Springsteen form. But they do not sound great due to production, plain and simple. Since Bob Ludwig is superbly accomplished and talented when talking about mastering, apparently the one to blame is Mr. O'Brien. Of course, the so called \\"die hard fans\\" could not care less for my opinion,

B00006JU7T|5.0|This great little low budget gem from 1973 is one of Sidney Lumet's best films,and one of Pacino's best performances!!! The other great character actors(Jack Kehoe,M.Emmett Walsh,Alan Rich and so on) also are in great form!!! This high quality DVD from Paramount has nice sound and picture,and some choice DVD extras!!! One of the best films of the 70's!!! And if you love cop movies,than this one is a must see!!! If you like Al Pacino,then this one and Heat would make a great night's double feature!!!

B000VFGQUC|5.0|Live and Dangerous arrived at my home via Air Mail today from Amazon UK, and I couldn't wait to get it into my DVD player. I was anxious about whether it was a Regionalized DVD (only Region 0 and Region 1 play in US DVD players), especially since the product description on the Amazon UK site suggested that it was Region 2...but it's not Region 2; it's Region 0 (worldwide).<br /><br />This performance of the 1977 Live and Dangerous tour was captured at London's Rainbow Theatre. And this show should be held up not only as an example of the way a rock group should perform live, but also as an example for DVD music producers on how to deliver an excellent product.<br /><br />The Live and Dangerous concert is all show. No indulgence by some videographer that thinks a viewer wants to see effects like cut to black and white, psyschedelic swirling pictures or other video effects. This was a very pleasant surprise considering that kind of video-malarkey was quite popular in the 70s.<br /><br />The full screen picture has been completely restored and looks terrific. Most importantly, the video doesn't jump around every 4 seconds, so you really get to see the performance in a way that feels like you're back in '77 with a front row seat to the concert.<br /><br />If you've got a surround system, you're in for a pounding Hard Rock experience. The sound has an amazing 5.1 DTS remix. If you've got an old DVD player or old surround system that doesn't decode DTS you're out of luck...there's no Dolby 5.1...Dolby Stereo is the only other choice besides DTS.<br /><br />The Live and Dangerous line-up of Phil Lynott, Scott Gorham, Brian Robertson and Brian Downey define Thin Lizzy. And all of the guys are on for the Live and Dangerous show at The Rainbow. Lynott's high energy stage persona is incomparable. The guitarwork between Gorham and Robertson is legendary and it's played precisely at The Rainbow show. And Brian Downey's signature drumming is captured in all its glory.<br /><br />For the classic Live and Dangerous Rainbow show you get the following set list:<br /><br />1. \\"Rosalie\\"<br />2. \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\"<br />3. \\"Emerald\\"<br />4. \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\"<br />5. \\"Massacre\\"<br />6. \\"Still in Love With You\\" - The liner notes actually suggest that this song is \\"Call on Me\\", but The Boys describe each song track by track during the interview segment, and they confirm that it is, indeed, \\"Still in Love Wth You\\".<br />7. \\"Don't Believe a Word\\"<br />8. \\"Are You Ready\\"<br />9. \\"Sha La La\\"<br />10. \\"Baby Drives Me Crazy\\"<br />11. \\"Me and the Boys\\"<br /><br />You also get Lizzy's 1983 \\"Farewell\\" concert (Robertson is out/John Sykes is in) from the UK's Regal Theatre; you get a selection of performances from the Top of the Pops television show from 1973 - 1979; and you get a 45 minute interview segment from the summer of 2007 with Robertson, Gorham and Downey.<br /><br />All of the music on this DVD has been remastered in DTS; the interviews are stereo. Songs at The Regal overlap only with a few from Live and Dangerous as do some of the Top of the Pops selections. Between the two (aside from what's in the Live and Dangerous set), you get:<br /><br />\\"Whiskey in the Jar\\"<br />\\"Jailbreak\\"<br />\\"Waiting for an Alibi\\"<br />\\"This is the One\\"<br />\\"Cold Sweat\\"<br />\\"The Sun Goes Down\\"<br />\\"Holy War\\"<br />\\"Baby Please Don't Go\\"<br />\\"Fighting My Way Back\\" (CD only)<br />\\"Wild One\\" (CD Only)<br />\\"Suicide\\" (CD Only)<br />(The liner notes of the booklet also suggest that \\"Cowboy Song\\" is included somewhere in the collection of tunes, but darned if I could find it.)<br /><br />The packaging and accompanying booklet of the DVD are awesome. Plus you get a bonus CD of a 1975 concert recorded at Derby College in the UK. This is a pretty sweet package.<br /><br />It's the Thin Lizzy DVD release we've all been waiting for.

0525950079|3.0|I had no time to read all the reviews that appear in Amazon.com's customer's reviews. So forgive me if I missed something.    No one paid attention to the quality of the book's presentation. My four stars would alone be earned by some of these qualities.    1. The book bounding is most durably and technically excecuted.  2. It has been printed in excellent quality paper, smooth, a perfect off-white shade.  3. Its design front-to back, and inside-out, is artistically excellent.  4. The dust jacket, a tongue in cheek emulation of a medieval illuminated manuscript, itself wins a second plastic binding, which of course I used to protect it from my rough hands, while reading it.  5. It is a wonderfully \\"big and heavy\\" beautiful book which will make a gift in very fine taste, specially for those whom you know will not finish it, but will love to show it.    In summary the book made me very, very happy!    Joyeux Noel!                              1    Antonio Gonzalez
B000Y179KO|2.0|I had high hopes for this album after hearing the initial single \\"How Long.\\"  Then I found out why it was such a great song...it's a J.D. Souther leftover from 1972 that sounds very classic \\"Eagles.\\"  Unfortunately, that's where the Eagles sound ends and the solo performances begin.  This album sounds like a collection of leftovers from each member's past solo efforts which is why it gets 2 stars.  Other than \\"How Long\\" there are virtually no songs with those harmonies, reminiscent of Take it Easy or Peaceful Easy Feeling.  And of course, Don has to get his political, eco-rantings in on all of his songs.  Don...just SHUT UP AND SING already!  We know how you feel about the environment...no need to tell us on every song.  Glenn's songs sound like they were outtakes from Soul Searchin' and Don's could have easily been cut-outs from The End of the Innocence.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed both of their solo efforts.  Joe Walsh's contributions on the album are honorable and are classic Walsh style.  However, this was supposed to be an \\"Eagles\\" album and it is far from it.  Other than the 1972 How Long, I just don't hear any collaborative songs here, but rather artists with inflated egos who put their \\"solo\\" songs together on one album and deceptively sold it under the \\"Eagles\\" brand name to make a buck.  They should have done what Kiss did in 1978 when each artist released a solo album simultaneously.  At least it would have been more honest.  Some of the songs are good...but most are forgetable and will send you straight to snoozeville.  Other than \\"How Long\\" there's just nothing memorable here.  I Can't Tell You Why, but this album was just Wasted Time in The Long Run.  You won't be listening to it All Night Long because whatever magic the Eagles had that gave us that Peaceful Easy Feeling 30 years ago is Already Gone.  Maybe One of These Nights these Desperados will get it right and Take it to the Limit one more time.

1592402038|5.0|Lynne Truss describes her book Eats, Shoots & Leaves perfectly: \\"If there is one lesson to be learned from this book, it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation\\" (125).  Though its classification as a book dedicated solely to discussing punctuation may convince potential readers that it could be nothing but boring, the book's pages are filled with unexpected treasures which captivate the reader's attention.  Truss herself was surprised at how well the book sold.  In the book's preface, she tells, \\"My book was aimed at the tiny minority of British people `who love punctuation and don't like to see it mucked about with'\\" (xvii).  But Truss's work reached far past her intended audience, across the Atlantic Ocean and into the homes of many who certainly would not call themselves punctuation-lovers.  She further explains, \\"no one involved in the production of Eats, Shoots & Leaves expected the words `runaway' and `bestseller' would ever be associated with it, let alone upon the cover of an American edition\\" (xvii).  Yet `runaway' and `bestseller' certainly have become associated with the book, both in the UK and US, leaving Truss and her company shocked but certainly pleased.  Why is the book such a success, even beyond its intended audience?  Truss's book is a universally enjoyable read because it is an equal balance of appealing to Logos, Ethos, and Pathos, making it attractive to a wide variety of readers.     One way in which Eats, Shoots & Leaves appeals to Logos is through its brilliant lay-out.  Truss breaks the material up into readable sections, dividing the book into chapters which discuss individual punctuation elements and further divides these chapters into subsections.  This clear-cut layout appeals to the logical mind through its easy-to-spot organization and is also desirable for less-serious readers, who need not feel obligated to commit to reading a large block of text but can instead feel at ease as they proceed effortlessly from page to page, the text and information being absorbed quickly and painlessly (even pleasantly).     Moreover, the book appeals to Logos in its comprehensive nature.  Truss provides a well-defined list of the uses of each piece of punctuation, explaining each use through examples.  She takes care to go over (in detail) each punctuation mark, outlining each chapter in a similar way, first giving background information, stories, and providing a general discussion of the punctuation mark, then giving a list of each specific use of the punctuation mark, providing meaningful examples, and concluding with other meaningful commentary on the effect of each mark.       Truss's abundant examples are logically appealing.  When she explains an element of punctuation, Truss is sure to include examples which clearly illustrate the importance of that element.  For example, in her introduction, Truss illuminates the importance of choosing correct punctuation, juxtaposing two statements whose difference in meaning comes only because of punctuation usage:  \\"A woman, without her man, is nothing,\\" is contrasted with \\"A woman: without her, man is nothing\\" (9).  Truss's point is inarguably made that simple punctuation marks can make a grave difference in meaning. Truss's useful examples, depth, and clear lay-out make the book appealing to the logical mind.     Truss is also successful in appealing to Ethos.  The pages of her book are scattered with historical facts and stories, showing her immense knowledge of the subject and drawing in readers of a more authority-trusting nature.  For example, in introducing the semicolon, she states that, \\"the first printed semicolon was the work of good old Aldus Manutis just two years after Columbus sailed to the New world, and at the same date and place as the invention of double-entry book-keeping\\" (111).  Through sharing this and similar facts, Truss assures her reader that she is knowledgeable about her topic.  Likewise, she later gives a short history of the hyphen: \\"The name comes from Greek, as usual [...] the phrase from which we derive hyphen means `under one' or `into one' or `together'\\" (169).  Truss's depth of understanding of the history and meaning of her subject give her a sense of authority, causing readers to trust her words.     Perhaps the most successful aspect of Truss's book, though, is her appeal to Pathos.  Her primary vehicle for emotional appeal is humor, and the book is filled with it.  Her audience may detect her humor through her unique voice.  From the first page of the book's introduction, it is apparent.  As a warning to her readers, she introduces her annoyance with incorrect use of apostrophes, saying, \\"If this satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put this book down at once\\" (1).  Her informal writing style is appealing and classifies her book as a light, fun read, not a heavy discourse (which people would likely try to avoid).  Those who are \\"sticklers,\\" as Truss calls them, can relate to the gasps and pace quickening she references, and her causal voice allows even those who don't experience these sensations to at least find humor in the obsession of others.  These less-sticklerish readers may even be tempted to go against Truss's advice and continue reading, captivated by her style.     Some of Truss's distinctly British phrases are another source of humor, most especially to American readers who are not accustomed to them.  When talking about the \\"full stop\\" or period, she observes that, \\"by contrast to the versatile apostrophe, they are stolid little chaps, to say the least\\" (46).  Later, expressing her exasperation resulting from attempting to break down and understand a previous phrase (about Elton John), she writes, \\"Well pass me the oxygen, Elton, and for heaven's sake, stop banging on about your glitzy mates for a minute while I think\\" (60).  For the American reader, unaccustomedto such phrases as \\"banging on\\" and \\"glitzy mates,\\" Truss's voice becomes even more humorous, making her book ever more attractive.     A final tool which Truss uses to humorous effect is personification.  Punctuation becomes more interesting to her audience as she truly brings it alive, acting as though each punctuation mark possesses thoughts and feelings.  At one point, Truss states: \\"In this chapter, I want to examine punctuation as an art.  Naturally, therefore, this is where the colon and semicolon waltz in together, to a big cheer from all the writers in the audience\\" (105).  Truss's description of two punctuation marks dancing provides a playful image in the reader's mind as is absurd enough to render the text more enjoyable.  Similarly, Truss gives a summary of the uses of many punctuation marks through the use of personification: \\"In the family of punctuation, where the full stop is daddy and the comma is mummy, and the semicolon quietly practices the piano with crossed hands, the exclamation mark is the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly\\" (137-138).  This lively metaphor puts the roles of punctuation marks in common, identifiable terms which readers can likely relate to.  This and many similar uses of metaphor and personification contribute to the tone of the book- a much more playful tone than may be expected from its subject matter, thus appealing to the emotions of the audience.     Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves is truly a success, even beyond its intended audience scope.  She appeals to Logos through a usable layout and comprehensive examples, to Ethos by providing in-depth, reliable background information, and to Pathos through her use of humor, evidenced by her casual voice and through personification and metaphor.  Thus, she is able to reach a wide variety of audience members, many whom are unintended.  All of these elements combine to create a bestseller book which reads quickly, is informative, and entertains.  Even though it's a book about punctuation, a topic of arguable interest, it is truly a difficult book to put down.
B0000024K1|5.0|Public Enemy's sophmore release, It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, takes the angle of entertaining with political and social acknowledgement to uplift Black America.

Chuck D stepped up flow on \\"Bring The Noise\\" as a classic arranged song by its contents and production.  \\"Don't Believe The Hype\\" accessorized by a horn attacks critics and the media.  As more or less a court jester, member Flavor Flav flows solo on \\"Flavor Flav Cold Lampin'\\".  At a time in the genre where DJ's played a significant part of a song, \\"Terminator X To The Edge Of Panic\\" is a tribute to the group's DJ which resembles the highlight of the album \\"Rebel Without A Pause\\".  The interlude instrumentals \\"Mind Terrorist\\", \\"Show Em Whatcha Got\\" and \\"Security Of The First World\\" added to the albums effectiveness.  \\"...our status / is the saddest / so I care where you at, black...\\" on \\"Louder Than A Bomb\\" shows how Public Enemy's music is a form of revolution without violence.  Taking an angle of going on trial for sampling on \\"Caught, Can I Get A Witness\\".  As it is more of the foundation of which the genre hip-hop/rap was found.  Using a hard edged rock instrumentation arrangement on \\"She Watch Channel Zero?!\\" goes into how too much television could brainwash someone.  Taking on when crack/cocaine became an epidemic of the Black community, the classic \\"Night Of The Living Baseheads\\" takes on all sides.  Planning to escape prison on \\"Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\\" is highlighted with the piano looped chords.  As the lyrical content and purchlines such as \\"...to the poor / I pour / in on in metaphors...\\" could be found on \\"Prophets Of Rage\\".  \\"Party For Your Right To Fight\\" has both Chuck D. and Flavor Flav flowing together a top of each other for the political driven track.

The only reason I give this album two stars is because I realise that it might have turned a few people onto Sinatra who hadn't previously listened to him.
B000M341QE|2.0|I also caught The Departed for the first time on HBO, and, for the first time in my life, find myself feeling disappointed in a Scorsese film. I had read the rave reviews when it was released(and tonight i checked Rotten Tomatoes to  make sure I was recalling the hype correctly), and being a lifelong Scorsese fan, I anticipated a typically absorbing, emotionally involving, and thought provoking film experience. Sadly, the film failed to deliver in even a mild way. It wasn't that the plot was too complex to follow, not at all. The film lacked the verisimilitude and honest emotional core typical of Scorsese's work. At times it felt as if some young gun director was flailing about in a vain attempt to imitate Scorsese. Moreover, and I can't believe I'm writing this, it dragged in spots almost to the point of boredom (I found myself checking the clock several times, another first!!). Some reviewers had diplomatically noted that this was not one of Scorsese's  strongest efforts, and I have to strongly, if reluctantly agree. All in all, a sad day in my film watching career.
B00079HZUM|5.0|Everything about Billy Crudup's performance as Ned Kynaston shows that he is one of the most versatile, flexible and believable actors on the screen today. As his character grows in knowledge of himself, he seamlessly progresses from an over-the-top actor of women's roles and the persona he has adopted to go with that ... to a man desperate after losing his profession because men are now banned from taking women's roles ... to the coach of the character played by Claire Danes ... then as actor of men's roles ... from a pretty boy to a man of emerging sensibilities and awareness of his masculinity. Perhaps also to a partial acceptance of his sexual ambiguity.<br /><br />Crudup's co-star, Claire Danes, breathily and breathlessly goes about seeking a way to portray Mrs. Hughes, initially Mr. Kynaston's dresser.  She is only adequate, but fortunately does not have to carry the show herself.  She is surrounded and overshadowed by a supporting ensemble of talented and skilled actors.  Rupert Everett, Tom Wilkinson and Hugh Bonneville are among those who stand out. Zoe Tapper shines in a brief role as Nell Gwynn, one of King Charles' mistresses, though her presence as a character is a historical anachronism.  The direction was superb as well.<br /><br />This movie is well mounted, takes full advantage of some historic sites in England and creates what is otherwise necessary to complete a picture of its time and place in history.  The playwright Jeffrey Hatcher adapts his own play for the screen ... clearly he knows what he's doing.  There are few scenes that are not full of words, and the dialog requires close attention on the part of the viewer.  Hatcher's adaptation is not fully historically accurate, but close enough. The musical score by George Fenton is worth noting ... as always, his work enhances but does not dominate. (I particularly recall his previous scores for \\"Memphis Belle\\" and \\"Dangerous Liaisons.\\")<br /><br />The plot contains a number of ambiguities, not only of the sexual uncertainty of Ned Kynaston but of the actor as person and the person as actor. As usual, in English period pieces the politics of the day are always, if not in the foreground, certainly in the background.<br /><br />A film to purchase and see more than once to savor not only its overall impression but for those who love words to appreciate more fully the elegance of the playwright / script writer.<br /><br />I initially did not give the film a five-star rating primarily because of Danes' performance, but Crudup and the rest of the cast made me rethink my decision. It's now a five-star film in my way of thinking.ainty of Ned Kynaston but of the actor as person and the person as actor.

B000O75F7C|3.0|Review number 150. Should the title be 'Fear Of A Blank Royalty Check'? The music on this latest offering by Porcupine Tree is actually fairly good - but I thought that it (could definitely) have been better. I finally got to catch Porcupine Tree on this very tour of the states and I seriously doubt that I will bother to go see them play live again. Not unless I see a set list in advance and they're playing at least a couple of older PT material. How come Steve Wilson and crew refuses to play anything from 'On The Sunday Side Of Life', 'Up The Downstairs' or even 'Voyage 34'? Only two tracks here that I was impressed with were the almost eighteen-minute &#34;Anesthetize&#34; and &#34;Way Out Of Here&#34;. Seemed to have gone from playing top rate British '90's space rock to artsy fartsy progressive. I mean, I'm glad that Porcupine Tree is finally having some success over on this side of the Atlantic - but in all honesty this particular case of ~selling out~ is a bit too much for me. Some say that they're like a poor man's Yes or perhaps Pink Floyd. See how you like it. You might actually get more out of this CD than I did.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney is as Britney does.      1.  Gimmee More: 4/5  The hit everyone is talking about.  It's a kool song but a bit simple.  A basic Britney jam that leaves more 2 the imagination.  It's Britney Beotch.    2. Piece of Me: 4/5  A Britney documentary that defines her current life. She's livin' a Pop Life, and we all know,  everybody needs a thrill, that's why we all live thru her.    3. Radar: 4/5  An electronic  mess.  Being messy never felt so good. On my Radar?  Ur on my Radar gurrl.    4. Break Tha Ice: 4/5 A catchy dance housy groove.  Play it at a club and u know people will groove on tha dancefoor.    5. Heaven On Earth: 4/5  the electroclash 80's type alternative track.  Britney does pink neon lights and hair gel. (hairspray optional).    6. Get Naked (I Got A Plan): 5/5  Britney flips the script with a sexy dance groove that makes u wanna get naked and dirty dance.    7. Freakshow: 4/5  the song that blends into the woodwork on this cd.  It's a dance groove with a kool beat and easy 2 dance. But doesn't compare with the other tracks on the cd.    8. Toy Soldier: 2/5  an annoying repetative track. Don't forget the aspirin while listening to this track. The weakest song on the cd in my oppinion.    9. Hot As Ice: 5/5  M' fave track.  This is my all time favourite Britney song ever.  It doesn't sound like Britney considering they sped up her voice in the recording.  I love how  T. I got creative and tweaked Britney's voice and made it sound r and b. It takes Britney to the next level and signifies her artistic and diva capability making her a true star.    10. Ooh Ooh Baby: 4/5  a Gwen Stefani type jam. A catchy radio friendly song, we feel ya Britney!    11. Perfect Lover: 3/5  an imperfect groove that screams out ORDINARY!    12. Why Should I Be Sad: 5/5  another Neptunes production, who knew.  Britney jams like it's 1985.  The vocals sound very r and b, thank goodness she went in that direction because it works for her.
B000092ZYX|3.0|My brand new disc i bought is a big sufferer of Audio Clippings, especially on \\"There There\\" & as we all know, once you buy a new cd & open it, you're screwed. Now i have to go to iTunes & buy the tracks that aren't messed up again. I would've rated the album higher if it wasn't for that cheese... My advice is just go to iTunes for this album. Three of my friends bought 'Hail To the Thief' also & they all have the same problems in the exact same spots of the recording. Could we get a re-issue or something? Anyways, good band still. It's not their fault.

B000UR9T8C|2.0|Spider-Man 3 reunites all of the major players from the previous two installments in this wildly successful franchise: Sam Raimi is back in the director's chair, Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane Watson, and Toby McGuire reprises his role as the wall-crawler. The critics and fans have been very kind to this particular comic book adaptation. Most of the parts are well-cast, particularly McGuire as Spidey's alter-ego Peter Parker and J. K. Simmons as irascible Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Dunst, for my money, is nowhere near the out-and-out knockout the role of M.J. requires, but her acting chops are fine and this can be dismissed as a quibble.    What does bother me about Raimi's treatment of the entire franchise is the inappropriate tone he utilizes throughout. Christopher Young's grand, somewhat menacing score, combined with Production Designers J. Michael Riva and Neil Spisak's dark and gothic New York City, are much too evocative of Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" films. Spider-Man has always been rock and roll; bright, fast, stripped down, no-nonsense. Although the pathos inherent in the stories would seem to indicate a big, dramatic treatment, the opposite is true: the lush melodrama telegraphs the rather simple-minded themes and plot developments. What is dramatic and touching in a comic book becomes one-dimensional and even ludicrous on film. As the filmmakers move beyond Stan Lee's original and powerful dramatic framework (\\"With great power comes great responsibility\\") to sow thematic territory of their own, the result is even less substantive.     As with the recent \\"The Fantastic Four, The Rise of the Silver Surfer\\", the film-makers have chosen to blend storylines taken from several different Marvel comic books dating back to 1963: the introduction of the villain \\"The Sandman\\", Harry Osborne's (James Franco) replacing his father as \\"The Green Goblin\\", and the Todd McFarlane \\"Venom\\" arc, which gave us Spidey in a black costume. There is a serious attempt to tiethem together thematically, but the short shrift subsequently given the actual characters fails to properly support the intertwined plotlines.     As the film opens everything is going (uncharacteristically) well for Peter Parker: NYC has a love affair with Spider-man, Pete's in love with MJ, and he is planning to ask her to marry him. But is he ready? Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), in what may as well have been broadcast as one of the movie's BIG THEMES, warns Peter that a husband must be ready to always put his wife first. No sooner does Pete declare himself ready to do this than MJ starts whining about her career and accusing PP of not being there for her and blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm not insensitive to the insecurities of others, but the guy seemed to be being genuinely supportive. The whole thing comes off completely manufactured and unbelievable, in what becomes something of an unfortunate pattern for this film.     While out on a date with MJ a parasitic alien escaped from a flaming meteorite attaches itself to Pete's scooter, and follows him home. This substance will eventually bond with it's host and magnify the host's natural characteristics, particularly aggression (or so says Professor Connors, the expert Pete takes a sample to). More about that later...     Meanwhile, in plot thread two, new evidence suggests that an escaped con named Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church), who, zapped by some kind of rays in a pile of sand has become the super-villain \\"The Sandman\\", was actually the guy behind the death of Pete's kindly old Uncle Ben. This Sandman, unlike the comic book version, has a dying daughter in need of an expensively out-of-reach operation. This adds some dimensionality to a rather under-developed character, but unfortunately the device is about all the character is given, and the daughter is all but forgotten once no longer needed. Spider-man, feeling a little more emotional thanks to the black tar parasite (Venom), seeks revenge.  He perfunctorily hunts Sandman down and defeats him (so perfunctorily that his later return is beyond expected). Enter Aunt May with BIG THEME TWO: \\"It's not for us to decide who lives or dies, revenge can turn us into something ugly\\" (or something like that).     In plot thread three, Harry Osborne is back and looking for a little revenge of his own. He doses himself with his Dad's Green Goblin serum and attacks. Fortunately, a bump on the head induces some convenient short-term (as it unsurprisingly turns out) amnesia, and \\"Good Harry\\" returns. The reason I say \\"Good Harry\\" is because the change is beyond ludicrous. He's warm, cuddly lovable... I swear there's a rainbow above him and a bluebird on his shoulder. That the filmmakers are not exactly trading in subtlety is a supreme understatement.     If that sounds like a lot, it is... but there's more. Lot's more. It's like Raimi was afraid that if he actually dawdled on a single emotion or development for more than 10 seconds he'd lose us.     Needless to say, Pete learns his lessons, is forgiven by everyone, forgives everyone (actually saying \\"I forgive you\\" to Sandman), defeats Venom (That 70's Show's Topher Grace; not bad), the Goblin, and The Sandman, and takes MJ's hand in loving anticipation of \\"Spider-Man 4\\". It doesn't add up to much. The action scenes from the first two films are not expanded upon. In fact, the most interesting effects are the Sandman scenes, and they aren't much different than stuff we'd already seen in \\"The Mummy\\" (what was that, about 10 years ago?). Peter's duality is signified by his combing his hair down and doing disco moves to girls in the streets of NY (really-I'm not making this up), and Harry's duality is so broad that we never have any idea what we're supposed to feel about the character. He's been in all 3 films and it's like he's 2 separate characters, creating no dramatic tension whatsoever. Did Raimi expect us to like him, hate him, like him, hate him... and then actually care about hisfate?  What. Ever.     The film does actually build up some weird kind of grandiose energy toward the end, and the large stable of appealing performers makes the film very watchable. Bryce Dallas Howard is a gorgeous Gwen Stacy, and I could watch Elizabeth Banks (here, a scene stealing Betty Brant, on \\"Scrubs\\", the mother of J.D.'s child) do her taxes. What the film doesn't bother to provide is an engaging narrative or anything to actually feel. The story is needlessly busy (\\"complex\\" would be giving it too much credit), and the plotlines  (or the filmmaker) don't allow the characters to inhabit the story so much as get pulled along by it. It's point A to point B to point C. I ended up back at point \\"A\\"- for \\"apathetic\\".
1400095204|5.0|In the 60's I read Chinua Achebe's great novel Things Fall Apart.  This summer I read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun and I had to reread Things Fall Apart just because of the juxtoposition of the two.  Not until I met the author did I realize what a close connection the two novels have in Nigerian history.  Both books would be my choice if I were to teach a course on African Literature because they reveal so much of the real divisions that Europe's impact on Africa has had.  Chimamanda's book is such a complete and fulfilling read, that it astounded me.  This book is written by a very young person with an insight and scope that just amazed me.  She has an old soul.  And she is a real story teller with an incredible gift that we are lucky to witness.  Read this book and then read her Purple Hibiscus and see if out of the continent of Africa does not come a brillant world writer.  And English Literature teachers should be aware that this novel is a great candidate for your readers.  It has been years since I have read a book of this quality.

B00004W3L3|5.0|THE BEST MARILLION ALBUM    Released in 1985 this was Marillion's third studio album.  It is 41 minutes long and the sound quality is very good.    People shy away from the topic, but these guys were really a copy of Genesis.  In almost every successful form of entertainment, there are copiers.  It is true in TV and it is very true in rock music.  Every successful progressive rock group had their imitators.  Yes had Flash (which was a spin off) and Star Castle, Emerson, Lake and Palmer had Triumverat and Exkeption and Genesis had Marillion.    But, Marillion sounds like what later day Genesis would sound like if Peter Gabriel remained in the band and sang the Phil Collins songs.  Marillion sounds like early Genesis, but only a little more bouncier.  The guitar playing is very much like what Steve Hackett used to do, and a little like Mike Rutherford's after he moved from bass when Hackett left the group.      Even though it is a derivative of Genesis, it is still an excellent album.  It is a concept album and is just one long, 41 minute suite, except maybe for Kayleigh.  The songs all segue into the next song, except for a two second gap between side 1 and 2.  In many cases, it is hard to tell when on song ends and the next one starts.    Although slightly lighter and bouncier, this rivals the best of Genesis, including The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Selling England By the Pound.

0792165020|5.0|It's difficult to make a viewer feel sorry for a killer, so when that's accomplished, it is truly excellent writing.  Tom Ripley is a sympathetic character who lives in poverty.  He's calm and mild mannered, but when a series of events spin out of his control he murders anyone who threatens his new, improved life.  I had difficulty deciding if I wanted Tom Ripley to be caught! Very well written and the acting is astonishing.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

1401300529|5.0|David Halberstam's \\"The Coldest War\\" is a brilliantly written, compelling, and well balanced history of the United States and China in the Korean War.<br /><br />The book is a scathing condemnation of U.S. and U.N. Commander General Douglas MacArthur and key members of his staff, including Generals Edward (Ned) Almond and Charles Willoughby. Almond, MacArthur's Chief of Staff and Commander of the U.S. X Corps, was a racist who continuously underestimated the military capabilities of the Chinese. Willoughby, MacArthur's chief of intelligence, skewed or ignored key intelligence reports indicating the Chinese would enter the war on a large scale. That intervention thus achieved strategic and tactical surprise and resulted in the deaths of thousands of young Americans.<br /><br />Like many historians before him, Halberstam has high praise for General Matthew Ridgway, who replaced Walton Walker (killed in a motor vehicle accident) as Eighth Army Commander. Ridgway later replaced, Douglas MacArthur as the Far Eastern Commander when the latter was (finally) fired by President Harry Truman. One of the Army's most brilliant officers, Ridgway was hyper-aggressive and had much greater respect for his Chinese opponents than MacArthur. He also paid much greater attention than his predecessor to collecting good inteligence and focused on identifying the Chinese Army's key weaknesses, which he exploited. As a result, the Americans managed to inflict tremendous losses on the Chinese Communist Forces at the battles of Chipyongni and Wonju, thus turning the tide of the war.<br /><br />Much to his credit, Halberstam pays a great deal of attention to the strength and weaknesses of both the North Korean and the Chinese leaderships and military.<br /><br />The result is an endlessly interesting and insightful history of what is commonly known as \\"The Forgotten War\\".

B000Y179KO|5.0|After 28 years I wasn't sure that these old farts could pull it off. I did not want to get my hopes up because I didn't want to be disappointed.  The first song, acapella, got my attention immediately.  From there I just listened and went slowly from hopeful to having a big smile on my face.  THE EAGLES ARE BACK!  Don't let anybody tell you different.  This album is impressive. I'm not going to go into every song but this album is worthy of the Eagles name and will go down as one of their better albums. Every song is different and some are better than others as in any album.  But this is two CD's worth of good material, not filler.  The best song on the album, in my opinion, is \\"Waiting in the Weeds.\\"  It's a great song and will go down as an Eagles classic.    The Eagles don't have the hard rock edge in this album that the departed Don Felder brought, but at this stage these guys have matured and don't need it.  I thought that the Eagles would miss Felder a lot more, but Steuart Smith fills in seamlessly - you don't even notice that Felder's gone (Smith also had a big hand in this album apparently).      The Eagles will probably clean up at the Grammys, a la Eric Clapton when he returned with Unplugged.  This album is that good.  My only minor complaint is that the sequencing of the album could have been better.  The best songs are all on the first disc. The Eagles are outselling Britney Spears at the time of this review.  Maybe people do actually appreciate real music.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Rolling Stone gave this 5 stars, making it a classic, an epic recording, and calling it one of the best albums of the year.  I don't think we're hearing the same record!  Yes, this is Springsteen's best in many years.  Yes, Livin' In The Future is probably the best rock song written and recorded by anyone in years.  Yes, Girls In Their Summer Clothes is a beautifully descriptive song. Yes, this record contains some of the best lyrics written by anyone in a long, long time.  But for the most part, the great lyrics and tunes are lost in the jumbled over-production.  Gypsy Biker and Devil's Arcade contain some of his most powerful writing, ever, but the vocals vanish in the poor arrangements.  To quote the Boss \\"I just want to hear some rhythm!\\"  Stick to the rawness of rock, get back to the basics, and stay away from trying to sound pop.  You could have had a classic album!

076781214X|5.0|Peggy Sue Got Married starring Kathleen Turner is a film I absolutely loved as a young girl. Turner is flawless and so vulnerable as the title character, no one else could have pulled off such a real and touching performance. Nicholas Cage is superb as well, his voice is so funny in this one, you have to hear to believe it. This sweet romantic drama was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and look for his real-life daughter Sofia Coppola as Turner's younger sister. This film is a must-have, you will enjoy it.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|I am big MK fan, which is why I gave this album 2 stars. The first star is simply the marvel that Mark is at writing a song about anything. \\"The Scaffolders Wife?\\" Now where in the world did he get the idea of writing that song? And \\"Secondary Waltz\\" is a clever look at puberty from a viewpoint that is incredibly original. I sense a political undertone in \\"Punish The Monkey\\" which is so subtle that I doubt most will ever catch it.<br /><br />Musically the music is as unplugged as Mark gets, and that's pretty unplugged. Generally you can expect at least a \\"Speedway at Nazareth\\" here or there, but not this time. You also won't find a fully orchestrated ballad like \\"Shangri-la.\\" The band is bare, the compositions are lean. More \\"Shot at Glory\\" and less \\"Sailing to Philadelphia.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately it's the limitations that keep the album at 2 stars for me. It's not that I don't enjoy it, I do, but there is nothing that really drives me to play it again. As a headphone experience it's adequate if you're looking to relax in a dark room, but you won't be switching it on while you re-paint the livingroom.<br /><br />Which leads me to wonder why MK produced this album to begin with. Was it a place holder for him? A transition from Road Running to what comes next? Or was it just an excuse to get the band back together and play some new stuff? In either case, it isn't a reason to buy this album unless you're a die hard fan (like me). MK is currently on a European tour, it will be interesting to see how much of this new material makes it to the play list. I would guess by the time it gets to the US there won't be much left of the Crimson set assuming that it does get here, which is questionable with the album currently no where to be found in the Billboard top 100. Not that any of that matters to his fans. MK's discography now is so vast he can meet virtually any audience's expectation.<br /><br />If you're only thinking of this purchase, because you're not a die hard fan,my advice is to wait for the live version, or whatever comes next.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic was one of the biggest and beloved films of 1997, and after a decade later, this blockbuster still satisfies the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are a perfect match in this romantic drama. Their chemistry is like no other, their characters Jack and Rose are so dynamic together, it's hard to ignore their lingering passion. Directed by James Cameron, this film was delayed and critics thought this film would sink but it became a monster hit and won many Academy Awards including best picture. I still think DiCaprio should have been nominated for best actor, he was totally robbed! Titanic is one film that everyone should own, it's funny, moving, and sensational. Happy viewing!
B000P2A256|5.0|Many people complain that Maroon 5's new sound is too clean, too bland - I disagree. It's catchy, clever pop music with amazing replay value.  I listen to this CD over and over again and do not get tired of it - the songs have singable choruses and a good dance beat.  Their music is also pretty sex-oriented - beware of younger listeners - and all songs are relationship songs!    Some of the best tracks are:  Won't Go Home Without You  Goodnight Goodnight  Kiwi (this song is really racy...watch out)  Better That We Break  Back At Your Door    There are songs with heavy beats, there are ballads, there are synthesized songs, there are sweet songs, there are angry songs - this album covers a lot of turf and is very different, but in my opinion, better, than Songs About Jane.  A great sophomore album!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I have loved Pixar ever since Toy Story and I never miss one of their movies and, in fact, wait for each new one with great anticipation.  This one did not disappoint.  While I do think that it's more of an adult movie, the bright and sometimes eerily realistic animation is also a lot of fun for kids.  My daughter enjoyed it but not nearly as much as my husband and I did!    On the surface, this movie is an unlikely story about a rat who dreams of being a chef but the theme is so much more.  It's a story about being true to yourself, about overcoming adversity and following your passion.  Remy isn't perfect but he does have a good heart and he overcomes some very great odds in order to follow his dreams.  This is a wonderful message, no matter how old one may be.    The movie also appealed a great deal to the culinary side of myself and my husband.  We love to cook and own many cookbooks and more gadgets than we can count so we really enjoyed listening to Remy talk about the melding of different flavors.  When the movie was over, I wanted to rush right out and enjoy a fine meal and a good glass of wine.  Who knows how many young chefs this movie may inspire.    Pixar is simply the best in the business.  Others attempt to imitate but don't come close.  This film is just another example of not just their technical expertise but their ability to come up with wonderfully creative and heart-warming stories.  Pixar's writing is top notch and that is what makes their movies--and this one in particular--truly special.

B000I2JKC4|5.0|I love this movie- and Christmas or not (and in any format) it's my all time favorite movie.  It hits home with everyone in one way or another, and it's soooo funny!  Chevy Chase is a genius- I wish he was in more movies.  Enjoy it- it's a great movie!!
075640407X|5.0|At times I have found recent science fiction and fantasy authors of the past two decades lacking in a full package novel delivering clever and complex characters, witty rhetoric, and a compelling tale to write about.  My current reads have been works from Neil Gaiman, Mike Carey, and Matthew Pearl all of their works i have adored being that i enjoy the content they write about. I was walking in Borders having finished The Devil You Know anxious for another book with twists and turns, adventure, the macabre, magic, and silver tongued characters... this novel just came out and was recognized at the store as being \\"noteworthy\\" and not even reading a page i just picked it up and took it straight to the counter for purchase.  The book is over 600 pages long leaving me in question of how long it would take me to read this book being that the only time i have to read is right before I crash in bed.  I have never read a novel so fast in my life and still have the story existing in my head days after finishing it!  I could not put it down and would fight to stay awake to read as much as i could.  Then once it was finished I immediately got online to see when the next novel was coming: NOT SOON ENOUGH!!  Bravo to Rothfuss and may he be done with his revisions soon... very soon.
B000Y179KO|3.0|It's a good thing \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\" didn't comprise only the first disc.  It's also good the price is cheap, because the first disc is truly awful, so much so I dreaded putting in the second disc.<br />  Had the Eagles released only the second disc, I would say it was a great effort.  The title track is evocative and reminds me of \\"The Last Resort\\" and some of Don Henley's other good solo work.  Glenn Frey, who normally is the weakest link in the chain, turns in a simple but nice song with \\"I Like To Watch A Woman Dance.  Joe Walsh gets the best cut though with his \\"Last Good Time In Town\\", which could easily be a first rate Steely Dan cut.  I would like to hear Donald Fagen's vocal on this ultra cool gem.<br />  So it's a bit of a mystery why the CD is so divided;  on the other hand, for those of us who dislike the first disc don't have to wade through the drek to get to the good stuff.  It's no \\"Hotel California\\", but it is better than \\"The Long Run\\", which, admittedly, doesn't take much.  Still, for the price, \\"Long Road From Eden\\" isn't a bad deal.

B000BYA5GO|4.0|The world is a dangerous place. It always has been, it always will be. Even here, in the west, with all our so called civilization and culture, it's still unsafe to walk the streets.    Take any major city, even my hometown of Calgary. There is crime. Petty crime, white collar crime, so called `victimless' crime, and of course, the daddy of them all - violent crime.    Canada prides itself in being low on the totem pole of violent crime involving firearms. But the fact remains thus - no matter where you are, there will always be a need for guns. The criminals will always be able to get guns, no matter what the police and the government tries do to about it.    In the states, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's been said that there are more gun-shops than there are McDonalds.    The same can't be said about Canada. We've got strict rules governing weapons here in Canada. You have to apply for a F.A.C. or Firearms Acquisition Certificate. This involves a background check and other safety measures.     You even have to proof you have successfully completed a firearms safety training course or test, or have been certified as competent to use a firearm.    Pretty amazing, isn't it?  What's even more amazing is, despite these strict rules, what kinds of weapons can be brought into the country. I recall reading the Calgary Sun earlier this week and looking at the picture of the weapons seized. There was an assault rifle with a GRENADE LAUNCHER!    A Grenade Launcher!    It's pretty damn clear that even in Canada, if you want a weapon, you can get it. And yet     If you're willing to pay the fees.    You can get your weapons from the criminal element, or from Gunrunners.     I guess you could almost take Lord of War to be a biography, a life story of one particular Gun runner named Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian Immigrant to the states.    He started out his career as most criminals do. He started small. But as time passed and he gained experience, he went from being a small time runner to one who had ties in very high places, and buyers world-wide.     Although like a drug dealer, he followed a simple rule. Don't use what you sell. It served him well. Keep yourself separated from your clients. Don't get involved except to seal the deal.    Can you, however, stay neutral? Can you deal in weapons of death and destruction without feeling the ramifications, one way or another?    Can you ever get out? Can you have a chance at ever going legit?    And, the biggest question. Can you deal with the consequences of your actions? Can you sew what you've reaped, even if you've tried to stay at arms length?    Lord of War doesn't glorify Gun-runners. It doesn't show it as a glamorous lifestyle, even if the money is good.     It shows you what they deal in, and what it's used for. One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. A Hero to the people on one side, a practitioner of genocide to another.    This movie isn't sugar coated, nor does it shy away from violence.     As per usual, Nicholas Cage does a fine job of portraying a smart and resourceful criminal. And let's not forget that, he is a criminal in this movie.    One last note... as with anything, we here in North America should never take for granted what we have. Sure, there is crime, there is hunger and homelessness, but when you consider what it's like in other countries, especially the Middle East and Africa, and even parts of Europe and Asia, we've got it lucky.    After all, we could live in these countries where `Lords of War' earn their daily bread.    4 out of 5
0618477942|5.0|this is a GLORIOUS book, with wonderful drawings, elegant English, and a story which--no matter how different it is from your own---you will immediately identify with. What are you waiting for?
0525950079|3.0|The plot was good, if somewhat far fetched in places.  There were too many sections which required shutting off that part of your brain which produces snarky commentary when confronted with outrageous coincidences to cover for the writer backing himself to far into a plot twist.  The story sounded like a Young Adult (ages 12-18) adventure until the gratuitous sex scenes started popping up.  I've submitted two for consideration to the Literary Review's Bad Sex in Fiction Award.    The characters were bland stereotypes.  Pop them into any episode of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" or any daytime soap, and they'd fit right in.  There was no depth, no adequate reasons given for some of their odd behaviors.    Was this worth reading?  Sure, it's a decent beach book.  However, I wouldn't give it room on my book shelves.
0618680004|3.0|Just finished reading The God Delusion.  His arguments have not swayed me from my Agnostic perch.  Just from the tone of his writing in this book, I'd say he's the type of person who very much likes the sound of his own voice.  More than anything, I find him to be hypocritical.  There was a little in here that I found interesting and I have a list of books that he referenced that I've added to my list of potential acquisitions.  But I found him to be quite repetitive.  I think he could have made the book considerably shorter if he had only stopped repeating himself.  Funny thing is this is one of his complaints about fundamentalists... said they must have thought if they repeated something often enough it would make it true.  I guess he missed the irony in the fact that he was doing the same thing... seems like he invoked the name of Darwin in every other paragraph.  Of course he says he could not be considered fundamentalist because he would change his mind if science came up with a better theory.  To me, it makes no difference if he would change his mind or not.  He is very much fundamentalist/militant in his atheist belief. [Some will say it makes no sense to apply the term fundamentist to atheism; obviously I disagree]  I would have less of an issue with him if he didn't take the position that anyone who doesn't believe as he does is somehow less enlightened and, basically, a fool.  And, frankly, there is no reason to ridicule the beliefs of others even if there are mountains of evidence to the contrary.  He dismissed creationists/theologians out of hand, and admittedly some of them are deserving of such treatment, but not all of his arguments were backed up with anything remotely resembling science.<br /><br />I also don't see his need to attack religion, per se.  Yes, it's true, that there is bad to come out of adherence to religious beliefs but there is also good.  And, with anything, even atheism, you will have zealots.  His arguments about how religion musthave come about and how it persists were quite weak, in my humble opinion.  He devoted a good bit of space to showing us that God most certainly does not exist.  I think, perhaps, this is one area where he could have spent a little more time.  Natural selection is not the panacea he makes it out to be and neither does it explain the origins of life.<br /><br />I also found him to be a bit disingenuous in places.  The most glaringly obvious was where he was talking about wars and implied that atheism was better than theism and asked why would anyone go to war for the sake of an absence of belief.  The problem with that is that atheism is not an absence of belief.  It is a belief of absence.... the belief that God does not, in fact can not, exist.  And any belief can be subverted.

B000AADYYO|5.0|I am not usually a fan of bands with growling cookie monster vocals.  In fact Opeth is pretty much the only music I own that contains these elements.  The way Opeth mix \\"growling\\" and \\"clean\\" vocals is really pretty incredible especially considering that they come from the same person.  This is a great album that blends all that Opeth do well into one seamless whole.  About 70% of the vocals are clean and 30% growling which works just about perfectly for the material.  The music is all fantastic with the band incorporating elements of goth, progressive rock, metal and even aoucustic sections here and there.  The band definitely seem to have had at least some influence their touring partners Porcupine Tree, as both band seem to be incorporating elements of each other into their respective styles.  \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is a fantastic album and to my ears the best Opeth has done so far.  The band continues to grow and dare I say mature, into one of the best progressive metal bands out there.

0440539811|1.0|This work was along the lines of a badly written Heinlen novel. Or, if you like some of Heinlen's weirder stuff, it must be at the pinnacle of perfection.  The story line is incredibly disjointed, nonsensical,and only manages to gain a focus on the occasional sex scene. Its a great book if you have ADD and lots of time. That's the polite/professional review.   Personally, I was so disgusted with the content, I literally ripped the booked apart and in the trash it went.
0525950079|5.0|I enjoyed this book just as much as I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, which I have now read three times. It's easy to get lost in the lives of the characters, and I found I did not want the book to end.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols' only studio album Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols was released in October of 1977.<br />The Sex Pistols actually started with guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bass player Glen Matlock whom were in a bands together before The Sex Pistols and then were joined eventually by lead singer Johnny Rotten and lastly manager Malcolm McLaren.<br />The mid-1970s rock scene was at an ID crisis as laid-back rock, hard rock, progressive rock and so forth were at a musical stronghold and then punk came when The Ramones released its debut album in 1976. Once The Ramones hit, punk didn't take off here in the US like it did in England and then bands like The Clash, The Damned, The Jam and The Sex Pistols were the first crop of British punk bands.<br />Johnny Rotten then decided to attack stadium bands by wearing an \\"I HATE PINK FLOYD\\" T-shirt despite the fact he later admitted to being a fan. The Sex Pistols, unlike the other punk bands, were getting in trouble and getting banned pertty much all across England. Then, bass player Glen Matlock left the band as he wasn't punk enough so they replaced him with Sid Vicious, a musician who couldn't play.<br />When The Sex Pistols went to record its debut album with producer Chris Thomas (famed for work with Roxy Music, The Pretenders, Pete Townshend, Paul McCartney, INXS and Pink Floyd) and co-producer Bill Price, Sid was not used on the album so Steve played bass on the first two tracks and Glen Matlock was brought back in as a session musician to complete the album.<br />When people brought this album home, they were in for an assault and attack on government, politicians, record labels and basically songs with an us against them disposition.<br />We open with the \\"Holiday in the Sun\\" which just rocks out in a big way. \\"Bodies\\" follows and is another great rocker. \\"No Feelings\\" is next and rocks out once again. \\"Liar\\" is next and just like all of the tracks rocks out. Next is one of the longest tracks on the albums and my personal favorite \\"Problems\\". The first side of the US edition of the album closes with \\"God Save the Queen\\" which was not a remake of the British national anthem but an attack on the monarchy which was hilarious and just killer.<br />\\"Seventeen\\" kicks the second half of the album off picking up steam where side one left off. Next was the band's first UK single \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" which is a classic. Johnny Rotten's snarling vocal was classic as was the music. \\"Submission\\" is next and was not on the initial UK pressing of the album and was on the original US album but not listed on back sleeve on initial copies. \\"Pretty Vacant\\" is next and is another classic. \\"New York\\" follows and is a great song. The album closes with the classic rocker \\"EMI\\", a song about the label they were on when they did Anarchy and was kicked off the label and they were booted from A&M as well and then subsequently were on Virgin for most of the world save the US and Canada where Warner Bros signed them.<br />The Sex Pistols on this album had more guts than someone either burning an inverted crucifix on stage or burning a flag or a picture of the pope or kissing fellow female pop stars to resuscitate a sagging career. God Save the Queen was a response to the silver jubilee couldn't have been more unpopular a statement at the time, and is a good reminder for anyone jumping on a band wagon for something so pointless.<br />Also, unlike The Clash who would experiment with ska and reggae and The Ramones whom got stale and boring after 1978, The Sex Pistols stopped at the top due to on-going in fighting and of course the death of Sid Vicious didn't help matters.<br />Never Mind the Bollocks did well in the UK initially hitting #1 but flopped in the US. Since then, Never Mind the Bollocks over the passage of time went Double Platinum in US sales and is rightfully placed in the pantheon of rock's greatest albums.<br />RECOMMENDED!s and my personal favorite \\"Problems\\".

B000R5N1MC|5.0|I was 25 years old in 1982, and remember going to the theater with much anticipation when this came out.  I was mesmerized, and astounded.  A new level of cinematic power was born.  A masterpiece of science fiction for the ages.    No way to count the number of times I viewed it between then and now.  The attention to detail in every scene just overwhelming.    The one thing I remember, between VHS tapes, and DVD copies, is that the color of Taffy Lewis velour jacket in the club, was never quite the same as it was on the film.  Bluish, or purplish, or somewhere in between.  I always hoped in some distant future, I could have a copy where the masterpiece was in all it's forms perfected to that first viewing from 1982 on fresh film print stock.    Maybe this is it.  To be entertained, by some sort of dazzlement, and philosophical depth.  A Rembrandt portrait, a Beethoven symphony, and Blade Runner.  I await the HD set, glad that I made it a quarter-century later.  My hair is gray, and time has beat me up a little.  2017 just 10 years off now.    It must have been years....
B000ELJBAA|5.0|Pink Floyd's singer and guitarist David Gilmour released his second solo album About Face in March of 1984.<br />The album was co-produced by Gilmour and Bob Ezrin (whom David worked with last on Pink Floyd's The Wall).<br />The album was recorded throughout 1983 in France and mixed at Mayfair Studios in London with engineers Andrew Jackson and James Guthrie respectively. The album was recorded after Pink Floyd disbanded following the completion of 1983's The Final Cut whcih saw relations between Gilmour and bandmate Roger Waters deteriorate.<br />In addition to David on vocals and guitar on About Face, he is joined by Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro, bass player Pino Palladino and keyboard player Ian Kewley (both from Paul Young's band). Plus there are guest appearances by Deep Purple keyboard player Jon Lord, Anne Dudley and Steve Winwood. Also helping on some of the backing vocals are Roy Harper, Sam Brown and her mother Vicky.<br />David wrote eight of the ten songs himself on this album including the pulsating opener \\"Until We Sleep\\", which is a great song. \\"Murder\\" is next and is the best track on the album with David pulling out all the stops on electric and acoustic guitars. \\"Love on the Air\\" is next and David wrote the music while Pete Townshend penned the lyrics to this song as well as the second half opening rocker All Lovers Are Deranged. The single \\"Blue Light\\" follows and is a good funky track. Steve Winwood plays Hammond Organ on this track as he did on Love on the Air. The only thing that dates Blue Light slightly are the horns but still a great track nevertheless. The ballad \\"Out of the Blue\\" ends the first half on a poignant note with the late Michael Kamen's superb orchestrations.<br />The US FM rock radio hit \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" kicked off the second half and is a great rocker. The anti-Roger Waters rocker \\"You Know I'm Right\\" follows and showed David was still angered and upset about Waters' ill-treatment to him during the torturous Final Cut sessions (who knew the two would reconcile in 2005). Next is \\"Cruise\\", which is apparently an ode to an MX nuclear-tipped cruise missile and a great song. The soaring classical music meets heavy soaring electric guitar instrumental \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" follows and beautifully blends Michael's orchestrations with some killer guitar work from Gilmour on his trusty Fender Stratocaster. The fittingly titled \\"Near the End\\" ends this album on a bittersweet but beautiful note and the ending acoustic then Stratocaster solos of Gilmour's at the end are some of his finest.<br />I first got About Face on cassette when I was 12 in February of 1988 and it is better on CD.<br />The album hit a modest #32 in the US and would eventually go Gold (500,000 copies sold) as a result.<br />About Face was finally re-released on September 12, 2006 on Columbia Records with digitally remastered sound, thanks to another Pink Floyd associate James Guthrie (who mixed the original album), and fully restored artwork.<br />The album is longer than either the original CD or original album as all of the tracks have fully restored endings and the sound on this is SUPERB!<br />I highly recommend this album to any Floyd fan!w the two would reconcile in 2005).

B0012GMUI6|4.0|Pink Floyd co-founder/bass player/singer Roger Waters released his second solo album entitled The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking in April of 1984.<br />The album was recorded between February and December of 1983 at Roger's old home studio The Billiard Room and other English recording studios and featured assistance from the legendary Eric Clapton on guitar, the late Michael Kamen on piano and orchestrations, one time Roxy Music drummer Andy Newmark and jazz great David Sanborn on saxophones.<br />The concept was first brought up in 1978 at the same time Roger wrote what became The Wall and the members of Pink Floyd rejected Roger's Pros and Cons concept and went with The Wall. The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking takes the concept album to new heights on this very good solo album. Each of the 12 tracks marks the a scene of a surreal dream (either that or is it a nightmare?).<br />Along the journey, Waters (whom wrote, sang, played bass and rhythm guitars and produced with the late Michael Kamen) deals with murderous Arabs in Germany (on the track \\"Arabs With Knives and West German Skies\\"), a sexual encounter (the album's best track \\"Sexual Revolution\\"), mundane family life (\\"The Remains of Our Love\\" and \\"Go Fishing\\"). He also encounters bikers, truckers, housewives, Shane and Yoko Ono (all mentioned in the album's title cut) and strangers (the album's other standout cut \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\"). The opening \\"Apparently They Are All Abroad\\" and the rocker \\"Running Shoes\\" were excellent but the \\"For the First Time Today\\" tracks are uninspired and \\"Dunroamin Duncarin Dunlivin\\" is a rehash of the opening track which surprisingly is done on the closing \\"The Moment of Clarity\\" which was an alright closer.<br />The album is saved with great doses of Slowhand's playing, the late Kamen's orchestrations and Waters' lyrics.<br />To date, The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking was the only Waters solo album to go Gold in the US and peaked at #31 here in the US. However, notwithstanding sales figures, this album is a very good solo disc.<br />Highly recommended!les figures, this album is a very good solo disc.<br />Highly recommended!

B004ZN9YNC|4.0|Pink Floyd's twelfth studio The Final Cut was originally released in March of 1983.<br />The album was the first Pink Floyd album of new material since 1979's 23 million plus seller The Wall.<br />The album was mainly the work of Roger Waters (bass player/singer) with muted contribution from drummer Nick Mason and guitarist/singer David Gilmour. Keyboard player (the late) Rick Wright was kicked out the band during The Wall sessions by Waters which affected this album greatly and was recorded at ten different studios with Roger Waters, orchestrator Michael Kamen and James Guthrie.<br />The Final Cut was supposed to be the soundtrack to The Wall movie but instead became a gloomy vivid portrait of a morally crumbling post-WWII/Falklands War era England. The album is fixated on the second World War, Roger Waters missing his father who was killed in World War II and what the personal and societal sacrifices of that conflict meant to Great Britain in 1982/1983.<br />\\"What have we done to England?/Should we shout, should we scream/'What happened to the post war dream?'\\" lyricist Roger Waters asks on \\"The Post War Dream\\" which opens the album. Throughout the album, Roger (whom had lost his father in World War II) explores that inquiry. The rock radio hit \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" is next and was one of the tunes that highlights this dark album. The main character in this album is the teacher from The Wall whom was disappointed in the generation they preserved (\\"One of the Few\\" and \\"The Hero's Return\\"), trying to keep a fellow serviceman's dream alive (\\"The Gunner's Dream\\" which is one of the album's best tracks), pursued by ghosts (the first side's somewhat bland closing \\"Paranoid Eyes\\").<br />\\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\" is great and kicks off the album's second half and is followed by one of my favorite songs on the album \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" which depicted Thatcher and Reagan as overgrown infants and tyrants (although myself being an American, I thought Reagan was one of our best US Republican Presidents (the best one during my lifetime anyhow despite what Waters thought of him) but musically the song is great though the lyrics do indeed purely cry out 1982). \\"Southampton Dock\\" was about Thatcher waving goodbye to the men to fight in the Falklands War (a very important war for the UK) and not about wives waving their husbands goodbye to go to war (which is what I first thought when I first heard TFC as a seven year old) and was just filler. The \\"still the dark stain\\" section is the real intro to the title cut. The Final Cut's title track is a great song too and always one of my favorite PF tracks. The rock radio smash \\"Not Now John\\" is next and is a superb rocker and was the only Gilmour vocal on the record (him and Roger fought like mad and David took his name off the credits but still got paid to produce the album). NNJ is my favorite PF track on TFC. The haunting \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" closed the album. Session Andy Newmark plays drums on this track as Nick was forced out as well.<br />By the time this album was finished, Pink Floyd broke up unofficially and there was NO TOUR to support the album due to Waters and Gilmour being at each other's throats.<br />The Final Cut was a #1 album in the band's native UK but in here the US, The Final Cut hit #6 and sold a modest 2 million in the US but was a flop compared to its predecessor The Wall which has sold close to 25 million copies Stateside.<br />In May of 2004, The Final Cut was reissued/rereleased with a slightly amended tracklisting now featuring \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" (in a remixed version as opposed to the mix on 2001's now out of print best of Echoes), which was originally recorded for The Wall Movie and intended to go on The Final Cut but was left off as they felt the song was out of place on the original album. Ironically, the song works very well throughout the context of the album. At first, it was very strange for me hearing this track after One ofthe Few because the clocks faded and then bang into The Hero's Return on the original Columbia/CBS issue. Now, with Tigers in tow, this is the true version of The Final Cut as it should have been.<br />The sound quality on this Capitol/EMI reissue buries the original Sony remaster from 1997 and James Guthrie (one of three co-producers on the original album) painstakingly remastered this album with much better sound. In fact, I sold the 1997 Sony version of this album after I bought the 2004 remaster. Could the remastering get better. It does. In 2011, a new remaster has been issued as part of the Why Pink Floyd? campaign once again remastered by James Guthrie and Joel Plante. The album is the least listened to album I have but still beats any junk out today!<br />This expanded version of The Final Cut is highly recommended!and then bang into The Hero's Return on the original Columbia/CBS issue.

B000002J29|5.0|English art rockers Genesis' released its tenth album and their first double live album entitled Seconds Out in November of 1977. Seconds Out is arguably (and still to this day IMHO) the band's best live album, and is also one of my Top 5 live rock albums ever made.<br />Recorded during the band's Wind and Wuthering/Spot the Pigeon Tour in June, 1977 in Paris (except for \\"The Cinema Show\\" which was recorded on the Trick Of the Tail Tour in Glasgow in July, 1976), this is the band after Peter Gabriel left at its prog peak before they would change musical direction with its next album.<br />Drummer Phil Collins proved an able replacement for Peter Gabriel on vocals, he does excellent on the Gabriel material especially on \\"Firth of Fifth\\" which I think he sang better than Peter (though some may cry foul and call me mad but oh well).<br />The band roars through many of their prog rock gems dating from 1971's Nursery Cryme (\\"The Musical Box\\" (finale)) to 1977's Wind and Wuthering (\\"Afterglow\\") such as the opening \\"Squonk\\", the classic \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" (was mistitled on the original album as \\"Carpet Crawl\\"), the previously aforementioned classic \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", \\"I Know What I Like\\" (complete with Phil Collins' classic tambourine dance and references to \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"Stagnation\\" in the solo section), \\"Robbery Assault and Battery\\", \\"The Cinema Show\\" (recorded in 1976 on the A Trick of the Tail tour and featured ex-Yes/King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford), the nearly 25-minute epic \\"Supper's Ready\\" (best version IMHO) and the closing \\"Dance on a Volcano\\"/\\"Los Endos\\" (with drum duel in middle) medley are all played with great gusto and power.<br />The other tracks \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\"/\\"The Musical Box\\" (medley) and \\"Afterglow\\" surpass their studio counterparts as well.<br />Listening to this 2-disc set, you can almost imagine the band's playing live either in Paris in the Spring of 1977 or even New York's Madison Square Garden back in February of 1977.<br />In addition to Phil's great vocals and occasional drumming, the other members (Tony Banks' keyboards, Steve Hackett's guitar, Mike Rutherford's bass guitar and 12-string guitar work and touring drummer (and at the time) lone American in the band for touring purposes Chester Thompson's drumming) are on fire here as well.<br />Seconds Out is brilliant live Genesis from start to finish. The band's stunning, unforgettable performance of Supper's Ready alone is worth the price of this album alone (I apologize Gabriel fans but Phil sang it better) but all the way around, this is a classic live album.<br />Seconds Out also said farewell to longtime guitarist Steve Hackett, who left Genesis around the time of this live album's mixing stage in the summer of 1977.<br />Seconds Out was the first live Genesis album to chart peaking at #41 on the Billboard album chart in late 1977/early 1978 considering that their first live album, 1973's Genesis Live, flopped initially.<br />Highly recommended!February of 1977.<br />In addition to Phil's great vocals and occasional drumming, the other members (Tony Banks' keyboards, Steve Hackett's guitar, Mike Rutherford's bass guitar and 12-string guitar work and touring drummer (and at the time) lone American in the band for touring purposes Chester Thompson's drumming) are on fire here as well.<br />Seconds Out is brilliant live Genesis from start to finish.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|Rush's thirteenth studio and sixteenth overall album entitled Presto was released in November of 1989.<br />The Presto album was the start of the band's fourth phase of studio album and was the band's first album for Atlantic in the US, although it's technically on the band's own label Anthem which was distributed by Atlantic in the US.<br />Also, Rush switched co-producers from Peter Collins to ex-Fixx and Tina Turner producer Rupert Hine and went to Le Studio to record Presto throughout the spring and summer of 1989. When it emerged before 1989's end, would the album be as good as others or would it be a dud (read ahead as I found out in August of 1990 at the behest of my old friend Jason Keith whom sadly disappeared from my life when he moved from my native Mass back to his native Tennessee just one week after he introduced me to this album (and because of him became a Rush fanatic which I'll be eternally grateful)).<br />The album kicks off with the great rocker \\"Show Don't Tell\\" which was a huge song for the band and the album's biggest hit and an MTV staple. My favorite on this album, and many fans agree on this one, is the anti-suicide anthem \\"The Pass\\" which tells us in the face of all bad, suicide is not a way to go (I wished many people who did take their own lives listened to this song and got some help). Other favorites on this album IMHO are the title cut which got loads of airplay on rock radio (up in the Northeast territory of the US (Mass (where I'm originally from), Rhode Island, NY)), the rocking third single \\"Superconductor\\", the environmental conscious rocker \\"Red Tide\\" and the optimistic closing track \\"Available Light\\".<br />The album's other tracks \\"Chain Lightning\\", \\"War Paint\\", the African rhythm induced \\"Scars\\", the melodic tracks \\"Anagram (For Mongo)\\" and \\"Hand Over Fist\\" are great songs as well although many Rush fans hate these tracks for reasons I can't seem to grasp to.<br />The Presto album is sadly overlooked by fans whom either hated this album or ignored it or whatever and didn't give it a chance and as a result was the worst selling album of Rush's career up to that point peaking at a disappointing #16 on the Billboard 200 and stalling at Gold in sales despite the fact that this is one of the first Rush albums I ever owned in August of 1990 when my old friend Jason Keith who now lives in Tennessee turned me on to Rush. Jason, if you read this, contact me.<br />This album is highly recommended!ignored it or whatever and didn't give it a chance and as a result was the worst selling album of Rush's career up to that point peaking at a disappointing #16 on the Billboard 200 and stalling at Gold in sales despite the fact that this is one of the first Rush albums I ever owned in August of 1990 when my old friend Jason Keith who now lives in Tennessee turned me on to Rush.

B0002NRQTI|5.0|Rush's eighteenth album entitled Counterparts was released in October of 1993.<br />The album was the band's first studio album since 1991's Top 5 million seller Roll the Bones and was also the band's first album with returning producer Peter Collins since the two late 1980s classics being 1985's brilliant Power Windows and 1987's underrated Hold Your Fire.<br />The band recorded the Counterparts album throughout January to May of 1993 at Le Studio in Montreal (the last time Rush would record at this studio) with engineer Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley (whom would later work with The Black Crowes, Iron Maiden and remixing the Led Zeppelin). For Counterparts, Rush (which has comprised of since July of 1974 of guitarist Alex Lifeson, drummer Neil Peart and singer/bass player Geddy Lee) decided to go for pretty much guitar, drums and bass sound like on their older records and do away with the synthesizers moreso than the band's last two albums.<br />The first taste of this album for me and America was \\"Stick it Out\\" which was a huge hit on American rock radio and helped push Counterparts to #2 on the US album charts (only Pearl Jam's Vs would keep Rush from the pole position but Counterparts (along with 2012's Clockwork Angels) would be the highest position any Rush album ever hit surpassing Roll the Bones, Moving Pictures and 2007's Snakes and Arrows' chart placing which the three aforementioned peaked at #3) and Platinum in US sales.<br />Other standouts on this excellent album are the opening rocker \\"Animate\\" (which got some scant airplay on the radio), the rocking \\"Between Sun and Moon\\", the ballad \\"Nobody's Hero\\" (featuring haunting orchestrations by the late Michael Kamen), the great Grammy nominated rocking instrumental \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" (a song that would prelude Neil Peart's drum solo for the next three tours), the wild rocker \\"Double Agent\\" and the rocking with a country feel second single \\"Cold Fire\\".<br />The album's other tracks being the rockers \\"Cut to the Chase\\", \\"Alien Shore\\", \\"The Speed of Love\\" and the closing \\"Everyday Glory\\" are all great numbers as well but many people overlook these particular songs.<br />It was in support of this album that I saw Rush live for the first time with Candlebox opening in May of 1994 and Rush just blew me away on stage in Providence, Rhode Island (especially Neil, the real professor of the drum kit)!<br />Counterparts is recommended!he Chase\\", \\"Alien Shore\\", \\"The Speed of Love\\" and the closing \\"Everyday Glory\\" are all great numbers as well but many people overlook these particular songs.<br />It was in support of this album that I saw Rush live for the first time with Candlebox opening in May of 1994 and Rush just blew me away on stage in Providence, Rhode Island (especially Neil, the real professor of the drum kit)!<br />Counterparts is recommended!
B000069HJL|5.0|Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980.<br />The album was recorded in November of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the final night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Paris is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/singer/keyboard player/songwriter Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes an extremely important live document of the classic lineup of the band, indeed.<br />Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live two disc set, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century (the spirited opener \\"School\\", a slightly extended \\"Bloody Well Right\\", an excellent \\"Hide in Your Shell\\", a superb \\"Asylum', the Top 20 hit \\"Dreamer\\", a uperb \\"Rudy\\" and the closing \\"Crime of the Century\\" which closes this live album), two songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (\\"Ain't Nobody But Me' and \\"A Soapbox Opera\\" both superior to studio versions), two from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments (\\"From Now On\\" and the best version of \\"Fool's Overture\\" ever), and three from the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America (the monster hit \\"The Logical Song\\", the title cut and the Top 20 smash \\"Take The Long Way Home\\") plus one exclusive song called You Started Laughing which was not found anywhere else save the B-side to a song called Lady from Crisis?.<br />Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/singer/songwriter Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards and additional backing vocals, drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is sped at faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section.<br />Commercially, Paris did well peaking at #8 on the album charts and is one of my Top 10 favorite live rock albums ever, especially with the remastering on this album.<br />Highly recommended!great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion.

B000P7V46C|5.0|English progressive rockers Genesis released their ninth studio album (and their first as a three piece) titled And Then There Were Three in March of 1978.<br />The actual number three would prove to be the band's magic number.<br />With the departures of original lead singer/frontman Peter Gabriel in 1975 and then guitarist Steve Hackett in 1977 respectively, many fans and rock critics wrote the band off. When Hackett left during the mixing of the 1977 double live album Seconds Out, this move left Genesis as a studio trio of Phil Collins handling double duties of drums/percussion and vocals, Tony Banks on keyboards and Mike Rutherford alternating between his already famous 12-string guitar and bass work plus now regular lead 6-string work (his lead playing would get better over time), few could have expected the band to achieve Gold success in the US. However, that's exactly what happened with this album and the band's rebirth as a unlikely more pop sounding act began with this album, which introduced the newly slimmed-down lineup.<br />The haunting closing love song \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" (penned by all three Genesis members) introduced the band to the singles charts here in the US (reaching the US Top 30 in 1978) and caused And Then to go Gold in May of 1978 (eventually Platinum) and the album reached #14 on the Billboard album chart.<br />Aside from this track, the album had other great tracks like the haunting \\"Many Too Many\\" (penned by Banks), the great Rutherford rocking number \\"Deep in the Motherlode\\", the epic \\"Burning Rope\\" (penned by Banks, which had some great guitar work from Rutherford whom is a great guitarist although not near Steve Hackett caliber) the fast-paced opener \\"Down and Out\\" (penned by all three Genesis members) and the funny cowboy number \\"Ballad of Big\\" (also penned by all three Genesis members).<br />The highlight of the album is really the Banks piece \\"The Lady Lies\\" which goes for about six minutes and is a great art rock/pop track.<br />The album's other pieces which is the majestic \\"Snowbound\\" (penned by Rutherford), the hauntingly beautiful \\"Undertow\\" (penned by Banks), \\"the whimsical \\"Scenes from a Night's Dream\\" (penned by Rutherford/Collins) and Rutherford's torch song \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" are also great tracks though overlooked (when I hear \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" now, I think of when Phil Collins played the song live in 1978 and the UK leg of 1980's Duke Tour dressed as the drunk Sidney with some funny results).<br />This album paved the way for the decade Genesis would reign, the 80s.<br />I first bought this album in October of 1997 on cassette and played it constantly. Then I upgraded to the remastered CD a month later (which was sonically superior to the cassette, 8-track and CD and sounded as great as the first vinyl issue).<br />Now in May of 2007, Rhino/Atlantic re-released the album as a CD and DVD set. The album is remixed on CD in stereo for excellent sound (very reminiscent to what The Who did with their back catalog in the 1990s when they remixed their albums though fewer Who fans complained about that). The new mixes are AMAZING and I hear things in the new mixes that I have not ever heard before (different guitar parts, extra vocal parts). Also, it comes with a DVD which has the album mixed in 5.1 plus the two promo videos for the album (Follow You Follow Me and Many Too Many), new interviews with messieurs Collins, Steve Hackett (who explains why he left the band), Banks and Rutherford and the BBC documentary Three Days With Genesis (which covered the band's 1978 European tour climaxing with their Knebworth performance that year).<br />Highly recommended!her pieces which is the majestic \\"Snowbound\\" (penned by Rutherford), the hauntingly beautiful \\"Undertow\\" (penned by Banks), \\"the whimsical \\"Scenes from a Night's Dream\\" (penned by Rutherford/Collins) and Rutherford's torch song \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" are also great tracks though overlooked (when I hear \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" now, I think of when Phil Collins played the song live in 1978 and the UK leg of 1980's Duke Tour dressed as the drunk Sidney with some funny results).

B000069HJI|5.0|Anglo-American prog rockers Supertramp's seventh studio (and eighth overall) album entitled Famous Last Words was released in October of 1982.<br />The Famous Last Words album was Supertramp's long awaited studio follow-up to 1979's chart-topping 15 million plus seller Breakfast In America. Also, as fate would turn out, Famous Last Words was also the last album with original co-founder guitarist/singer/keyboard player/songwriter Roger Hodgson who announced he would leave the band in 1983 after the Famous Last Words tour.<br />Tensions between Roger and co-founder/singer/keyboard player/songwriter Rick Davies during the recording sessions were brutal to say the least. They fought over musical, creative and personal directions during the sessions for the album (also, their wives hated one another so it was almost like the Linda McCartney/Yoko Ono feud).<br />Famous Last Words was mainly recorded at Roger's house in Nevada City as he didn't want to leave his wife (at the time) and their then 3-year old daughter and infant son behind. Rick recorded most of his vocal parts at his home studio The Backyard Studio in the Los Angeles suburb of Encino.<br />Famous Last Words also marked the first time which member sang and wrote each track (Roger's lyrics were in yellow and Rick's in white).<br />Roger Hodgson has five tracks on Famous Last Words starting with the up number \\"Crazy\\" which got some extensive airplay on US FM rock radio when released, the beautiful acoustic numbers \\"C'est Le Bon\\" and \\"Know Who You Are\\", the lyrically sad but musically speaking superb \\"It's Raining Again\\" and the haunting closer \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" with one of Hodgson's best guitar solos ever.<br />The album's biggest hit was the up-tempo breakup song \\"It's Raining Again\\" which hit #11 in the US in late 1982/early 1983 and is a great song to lament over the break-up and/or loss of a loved one (this song has more meaning to me now since my mother passed this past March) and featured one of sax player/woodwind expert John Helliwell's best tenor sax solos ever recorded proving he is the greatest sax player in rock history IMHO (I apologize to Clarence Clemons and Lenny Pickett fans but they pale compared to Sir John Helliwell). Its corresponding video depicted a hapless soul losing love and trying to find love (the band members had very small cameo appearances with John as a sax playing busker, bass player Dougie Thomson as a Greyhound bus driver, Roger as a passenger on the bus with the guitar and Davies and drummer Bob Siebenberg as rednecks).<br />Speaking of Davies' contributions, his were the soulful \\"Put on Your Old Brown Shoes\\" (with Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart on backing vocals), the Billy Joel-ish sounding ballad \\"Bonnie\\" which is a great song with some great piano work from Davies, the 50s-ish sounding number \\"My Kind of Lady\\" and the haunting yet atmospheric six and a half minute piece \\"Waiting So Long\\" which is Rick's masterpiece on the album.<br />\\"My Kind of Lady\\" was the album's other hit peaking at #31 here in the US and who can forget the video with the lads dressed as a 50s rock group and doo wop group without their beards and long hair which they all got rid of (Helliwell and Davies would grow beards back permanently whilst Siebenberg and Thomson kept the clean-shaven look (although Siebenberg was clean shaven pretty much on every album sleeve) and Hodgson has had beards off and on (grew back in 1983 then shaved off again in 1984 and grew back in late 1990s and shaved off again permanently in 2002) since the video). John Helliwell's sax and occasional keyboards are in fine tow as is Dougie's bass playing and the drumming of Bob Siebenberg's (Famous Last Words was the first time Bob spelled his last name the proper way after spelling it C. Benberg for years).<br />Famous Last Words peaked at #5 on the Billboard chart and went Platinum although sales should have been bigger but with New Wave and a changing musical landscape heisting the charts it was impossible.<br />This album sounds better today with the remastering that Greg Calbi and Jay Messina did in 2002.<br />Highly recommended!s album sounds better today with the remastering that Greg Calbi and Jay Messina did in 2002.

B000002J2B|5.0|Genesis' eighth studio album Wind and Wuthering was released in January of 1977 here in the US.<br />The album was arguably musically much more developed and fleshed out than it was on its predecessor, 1976's Top 40 charting album A Trick of The Tail, you can sense the band (and singer/drummer Phil Collins in particular) were gaining more confidence in their songwriting and performing abilities after Peter Gabriel upped and left the band in 1975 following The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway tour and with A Trick of the Tail proved they could survive without Peter. Then the band in the fall of 1976 went to Holland (as tax exiles) to record their next album which proved to be their best studio album of the Phil Collins era.<br />The seven minute plus opener \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" (written by guitarist Steve Hackett, guitarist and bass player Mike Rutherford and keyboard player Tony Banks) and starts the album off with a bang and is one of my all time favorite Genesis songs. The next track is the majestic ten minute epic \\"One for the Vine\\", arguably Tony Banks' best song for the band. The live version from the reissued Three Sides Live rivals the studio version IMHO. Next was Rutherford's first self penned Genesis track \\"Your Own Special Way\\", which was an unexpected modest hit (and would pave the way for the road to superstardom starting with 1978's Top 20 charting And Then There Were Three). The Collins/Banks (says on one version of album) or Collins/Hackett (other versions say it was co-written by Collins/Hackett) instrumental \\"Wot Gorilla\\" concludes the first half with a \\"Los Endos-esque\\" bang.<br />Tony Banks' whimsical \\"All In a Mouse's Night\\" kicks off the second half with another bang about a mouse's encounter with a cat (Tom and Jerry, eat your hearts out). Then, Steve Hackett's classical guitar induced fingers are all over his collaboration with Phil Collins on \\"Blood On the Rooftops\\", with beautiful Spanish guitar solos and superb mellotron sounds. The instrumentals \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers\\" (penned by Rutherford and Hackett) and \\"In That Quiet Earth\\" (written by Rutherford/Collins/Hackett/Banks) are a great piece played together and combine both with the majestic closing \\"Afterglow\\" (penned by Banks) is still a favorite song of mine from the band.<br />Sadly, this album arguably marked the end of prog-rock Genesis. Although the band would certainly continue to record prog-rock songs here and there, no album would ever be able to recall the heights of the albums from Trespass to Wind and Wuthering.<br />Strangely, the Wind and Wuthering album would prove to be the band's second album to crack the US Top 40 peaking at #26 in late winter/early spring 1977.<br />I first got this album as a Christmas present from my older brother in 1997 when he bought me the remastered CD and loved it immediately and is a Genesis album I regularly go back to.<br />Highly recommended!als \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers\\" (penned by Rutherford and Hackett) and \\"In That Quiet Earth\\" (written by Rutherford/Collins/Hackett/Banks) are a great piece played together and combine both with the majestic closing \\"Afterglow\\" (penned by Banks) is still a favorite song of mine from the band.<br />Sadly, this album arguably marked the end of prog-rock Genesis.

B0000026NC|5.0|Pink Floyd's first official multiple disc live album entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder was released in November of 1988 (the satellite video was released in June of 1989).<br />The album (and its off-shoot video) was recorded over five nights at the Nassau Coliseum in New York in August of 1988 (the end of the regular Momentary Lapse tour '87-'88. The band would tour Europe again in 1989/90 in support of Delicate Sound with the tour called Another Lapse).<br />The band first attempted to record a live album and video in November of 1987 in Atlanta but the band were not up to par. Subsequently, they tried again in the summer of 1988. As a result, a great live album.<br />The album has superb live versions of \\"Yet Another Movie\\", \\"Round and Around\\", \\"On The Turning Away\\" and \\"One of These Days\\". The fans' much reviled track \\"The Dogs of War\\" is superior to its studio counterpart with Nick Mason playing drums this time and Rick Wright playing on keyboards like he did in the old days (the two are the only two original Floyd members who did every tour) and of course David Gilmour's vocals and superb guitar work.<br />Other standouts are \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Learning To Fly\\". The other tracks are great like \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" while the Dark Side and Wall material are good here but are much better on the 1995 live disc Pulse.<br />Missing on this disc is \\"Signs Of Life\\", \\"On the Run\\", \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" and \\"One Slip\\" which are available on the now out-of-print video version. \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" was recorded but not on either the video or album.<br />Gilmour produced the album and mixed it at Abbey Road Studios.<br />The album did well for a live album as it peaked at #11 on the album charts in the US and #4 on the US CD charts and went Triple Platinum upon release with 3 million copies sold in the US alone. Not too shabby for a live release.<br />I first got this album in November of 1988 on cassette and this was the 20th CD I ever owned when I upgraded in September of 1991 when my father bought me this CD.<br />Highly recommended!upgraded in September of 1991 when my father bought me this CD.

B000002J2F|5.0|English prog rockers Genesis released their first album of the 1980s entitled Duke in March of 1980.<br />The album was the band's first of the decade that Genesis would conquer the world, the 80s.<br />Duke saw Genesis starting to shed away their progressive-rock sound slowly but surely. This was mainly because of the radically changing musical scene as punk/new wave had all but killed prog and also because of singer and drummer Phil Collins' new-found influence within the band as a songwriter (due to a personal crisis which unleashed a budding songwriter) and also to capitalize upon the success of 1978's Gold selling Then There Were Three.<br />Recorded at Abba's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden in the fall of 1979, Duke showcased a more commercial sound, brisker arrangements, and more down-to-earth (some would say merely more prosaic) lyrics. Though keyboard player Tony Banks was still responsible for the majority of the songwriting, turning in the songs \\"Guide Vocal\\", the atmospheric first side closing \\"Heathaze\\" and the proggish \\"Cul-De-Sac\\". Also, guitarist and bass player Mike Rutherford contributed the songs \\"Man of Our Times\\" which was a great mid-tempo rocker and the ballad \\"Alone Tonight\\". Duke also contains Collins' first two solo compositions, the Top 20 US hit \\"Misunderstanding\\" and the very personal \\"Please Don't Ask\\" which was intended for Phil's solo album Face Value (released in 1981) but after Banks and Rutherford heard the demo version of the song, they loved it so much that they decided to record Please Don't Ask as a Genesis track.<br />The songs all three wrote together were the opening classic rocker \\"Behind the Lines\\" and \\"Duchess\\" (which told the tale of a girl singer's rise to fame and fall down the other side (the song would become the band's Morse code and I also see as the Morse code of Britney Spears' career strange but true as her career has now patterned after the song Duchess). The British hit \\"Turn it On Again\\" is a classic rocker with a 13/8 time signature and a great song. The classic finale of \\"Duke's Travels\\" and \\"Duke's End\\" is superb and on Duke's Travels you get the lyrics to \\"Guide Vocal\\" as a sort of reprise.<br />The Duke album was yet another Top 20 smash hitting #11 Stateside and gave the band its first #1 album in their native England and was another US Gold seller for the band (eventually going Platinum).<br />I first bought this CD in October of 1997 when I bought the remastered edition and it is easily one of their best efforts.

B000AMPZF8|5.0|I'm in the U.S. and have been following Muse since hearing Absolution, then on to Black Holes & Revelations, and now back to Origin of Symmetry. And each time, I'm fairly blown away, but am shocked that almost none of my American friends have heard of this band, even though they seem to be very popular in Europe. What's more, almost every time that a friend of mine hears one of their albums, they like it! Even if they're not usually into what I think is this harder-edged, often anthemic rock music with beautiful vocals the likes of, yes, Radiohead's Thom Yorke. I recently saw Muse in concert at MSG and Bellamy is highly deserving of greater fame in the U.S. He appears to be thoroughly multi-talented, with his enchanting vocals, his amazing guitar playing, and even his piano skills.    When I purchased Origin of Symmetry, I was afraid to find a less catchy, less original, less well-developed version of Muse's later albums. I was ecstatic to discover that I was mistaken. There's enough that's the same (e.g., New Born, Bliss, and Plug in Baby) to remind you that, yes, this is Muse's sound (and you love it!) but also enough that's different (e.g., Feeling Good) to make you appreciate their range and inventiveness. Citizen Erased is actually one of my favorites so far, as it evokes for me a real sense of Orwell's 1984 put to music.

B0000542D2|4.0|This DVD set has taken a lot of trashing! The aspect ratio isn't correct on the DVD but, the cropping is not all that bad! I did find that during the many musical numbers the bass was booming way too much through my sub and I had to adjust it quite a bit. The film itself is a classic and anyone growing up with it will fondly rememeber how magical these guy were. A groovy Marx Brothers romp through the early 60's with some of my favorite Beatles songs laced throughout the random comedic elements. Maybe they will make purist happy one day and release this in the correct format but, I'm not holding my breath. I say, if your a fan stop crying and start enjoying this wonderful film, even if it isn't the definitive release of this film on DVD. The transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I saw this picture a few years back and wanted to see it again. If you never bothered to check it out, please do so. This is not your usual \\"Carrey\\" vehicle but, a well told story about hope, freedom and much more. After a car crash causes a young screenwriter to lose his memory, the citizens of a small town mistake him for being a local war hero who died in the war a decade ago. The great cast helps make this movie a must see, It's not quite a 5 star film because I think it would have been much more engrossing, if the audience wasn't aware if the man was the war hero or not right from the beginning. Carrey does a fine job in a wonderful dramatic role and a cast of Darabont's usual charater actors make this one a very entertaining movie. The DVD transfer is very good, but where is the Blu Ray edition?

I have to admit I like this film as much as the first one. The DVD treatment is better than 'A Hard Day's Night' and the Beatles are in color this time around! The film is filled with some of the best Beatle's songs ever recorded by the band and the sound is really jumpin'! The DVD transfer is excellent and the extras are interesting.

B00IXHBS6M|5.0|Led Zeppelin released its superb second album Led Zeppelin II in October of 1969.<br />In 1968, famed British session guitarist Jimmy Page (whom had joined The Yardbirds and was in their final lineup) first joined forces with fellow British session musician John Paul Jones (bass guitar and keyboards) and two musicians from the Midlands of England being singer Robert Plant and the sadly missed John Bonham on drums. Just after the band released its debut album in January of 1969, the band conquered America with ease as its debut album reached #10 in the States without a hit single! Also the band quickly graduated from opening act to theaters to eventually arenas and stadiums.<br />Whilst the band toured for its debut, they recorded, mixed and mastered its sophomore effort with Jimmy Page producing the album and this time Jimi Hendrix engineer Eddie Kramer, the late Andy Johns, George Chkiantz and Chris Huston were the recording engineers and Eddie Kramer did the mixing. Would this album be as great as its debut or better, read on and find out, as I did when I first heard as a 7 year old in 1983 when my third oldest sister's friend brought over the vinyl record and would acquire on cassette in 1985 (with &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; ending Side 1 and &#34;Thank You&#34; opening Side 2).<br />We open proceedings with the band's only US Top 5 hit, the rocking &#34;Whole Lotta Love&#34; which is just a killer tune although its been played many times on rock radio over the years. When issued as a single, the trippy middle section was excised (sacrilege). The song was a group composition based on Willie Dixon's &#34;You Need Love&#34;. Next is Page and Plant's power ballad as it were &#34;What Is and What Should Never Be&#34; which is just a stellar song and has the quiet verses, the loud chorus and an ending which goes elsewhere. Next is the band's collaboration rocker called &#34;The Lemon Song&#34; which is not about lemons. The song has references to blues songs like Robert Johnson's &#34;Travelling Riverside Blues&#34; and Howlin' Wolf's &#34;Killing Floor&#34; but the riffs and the solo sections from Page were all Zeppelin. The first half closes with &#34;Thank You&#34; which is a Page/Plant collaboration which has Jimmy on acoustic and electric guitars, Jonesy on organ and is just a beautiful love song as it were.<br />The second half of the album begins with the group collaborated rocker &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; which just burns and is a killer tune. We then segue into another rocker out of &#34;Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman&#34;) which is a Page/Plant rocker which rocks. Then it's a half acoustic/half electric number called  &#34;Ramble On&#34; which is another Page/Plant collaboration and just is a great song. Next is the instrumental &#34;Moby Dick&#34; which showcased why the late John Bonham was rock's greatest drummer (this song's drum solo would extend to upwards of 30 minutes in later concert performances in later years). We close the album with &#34;Bring It On Home&#34; which is two songs in one which the intro and outro was based on Sonny Boy Williamson and then the rest was Page/Plant with some additional lyrics by Willie Dixon. Killer way to end the album.<br />Led Zeppelin's sophomore effort would go to #1 on the American album charts knocking The Beatles' Abbey Road out of #1 and has sold over 10 plus million Stateside.<br />Now in 2014, the album is re-released and given a superb remastering treatment by Jimmy Page and also comes with a second CD featuring a rough mix of &#34;Whole Lotta Love&#34; with alternate vocal performance and sans the overdubs plus rough mixes of &#34;What Is and What Should Never Be&#34;, &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; and &#34;Ramble On&#34; with alternate vocal and guitar bits. Then there is instrumental backing tracks of &#34;Thank You&#34; and &#34;Living Loving Maid&#34; and &#34;Moby Dick&#34;.  Finally is an instrumental not released before called &#34;La-La&#34; which is an excellentand unique instrumental which is excellent.

B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles' sixth British and ninth or so US album entitled Revolver was released in August of 1966.<br />The album was the last in their mop-top period and still a classic today (over 40 years after its first release). I was already familiar with these songs as heard on the radio. The album saw The Beatles utilize more studio trickery than the previous album (1965's superb Rubber Soul) and a new engineer out of Geoff Emerick. Emerick, along with producer George Martin, helped push The Beatles forward and the first taster of things was the single of \\"Paperback Writer\\" (penned and sung by Paul McCartney) with its B-side \\"Rain\\" (penned and sung by John Lennon) utilizing backward voices and other tape effects no one dared to dry on record before. With Revolver, The Beatles took experimenting one step further.<br />Guitarist George Harrison shines with three numbers including the opening rocker \\"Taxman\\", the Indian sounding \\"Love You To\\" and the rocker \\"I Want to Tell You\\" which would be later covered by Ted Nugent on Ted's 1979 album State of Shock. Singer/rhythm guitarist  Lennon has five great songs here like the atmospheric \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (deleted from original US issue and inserted on Yesterday and Today). Plus the rockers \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" (also deleted from original US issue and put on Yesterday and Today) and \\"Doctor Robert\\" (also deleted from original US issue and inserted on Yesterday and Today) and finally, the psychedelic closer \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is Lennon's masterwork with innovative use of Automated Double Tracked voices and phased vocals among other effects. This track would be covered by everyone from The Grateful Dead to Our Lady Peace to Genesis singer/drummer Phil Collins (his cover was best of the three re-makes I heard)<br />Bass player/singer Paul McCartney has five numbers with the eerie piece \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". Plus the excellent ballad \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" and pop numbers like \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", \\"For No One\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" (Earth Wind and Fire covered this in 1978 for the debacle movie Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton and even Chicago would regularly perform this as a final encore in the Peter Cetera led era (namely in 1982/83 and 1984/85)).<br />Lastly, drummer Ringo Starr sings the John Lennon penned \\"Yellow Submarine\\" showing us that The Beatles could tackle any genre of music well, even kid's songs (the track would inspire the animated movie of the same name a couple of years later).<br />I first got this album in December of 1995 on CD and loved it immediately (although I had heard the sterile US version years earlier on the radio when they played it in its entirety but felt short changed, the UK version of the album is the real Revolver).<br />Revolver was YET another #1 album (even if it was the cheap cut edition here in the US), no surprise and is my third favorite Beatles disc after Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road respectively.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|The Beatles' Let it Be...Naked was released in November of 2003.<br />This new version of The Beatles' Let it Be entitled Let it Be Naked is much better than the mix that demented nutball producer Phil Spector did in 1970 by a longshot!<br />I know alot of fans are complaining about it but Let it Be was supposed to be a back to basics album which was initially recorded in January of 1969 at Twickenham Studios and Apple Studios with producer George Martn and engineer Glyn Johns but the band were not happy with the initial product.<br />In 1970, John Lennon and George Harrison (unbeknownst to Paul McCartney) brought in madman Wall of Sound producer Phil Spector (now as of 2009 is serving a life sentence in prison for murder) and he initially ruined the original vision of the album Paul McCartney and George Martin had with all of that unnecessary violins and choir fluff that permiated the original release.<br />Some of the songs on Let it Be...Naked are the same as the original 1970 release but superbly remastered (\\"Two of Us\\", \\"Dig a Pony\\", \\"Get Back (the single mix sans audition ending)\\", \\"One After 909', \\"For You Blue\\").<br />Then, there are songs that are slightly different like the 1968 recording \\"Across the Universe\\" (which was not ever issued in its very original recorded state until Let it Be...Naked, the 1970 Spector mix was slowed down a semi-tone with choir and strings and the 1969 mix for a charity record was sped up a semi-tone with a kids choir and backing vocals and the Anthology II take was an earlier take), \\"I Me Mine\\" is the same Spector edit but without those stupid orchestrations, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is an unissued take (I think was used in the Let it Be film), the title cut is an earlier take and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is the best of the different takes and is different than the versions on either the original LiB album or the Anthology III disc (the Anthology III version was the same as on the LiB album sans the choirs and orchestrations and Paul scat-singing the solo section with repeat of chorus).<br />Let it Be...Naked is a great version of the intended back to basics album McCartney had in mind than what Spector had in mind.

After page 160 Matheson dives into about 10 or so shorter stories which have nothing to do with the main title of the book.  I enjoyed I Am Legend and I found the short stories amusing but I found it kind of disappointing that I thought I payed for a full book about I Am Legend.  I feel a little cheated considering the cover and the back of the book give no indication that the story only lasts for half the book.  I would recommend to buy but just understand that the whole book has more than the main story.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles' classic album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released in June of 1967.<br />After the last Beatles tour of 1966 which had the Ku Klux Klan burning Beatles records and singer/guitarist John Lennon being branded a Satanist for his \\"we're bigger than Jesus Christ\\" statement, The Beatles decided to no longer play live in concert. The Beatles decided to become a studio band taking their experimentations from its predecessor Revolver to the enth degree. The album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (once again produced by George Martin and engineered by Geoff Emerick) was the start of the band's studio phase and was the benchmark of all future rock albums.<br />The album starts off with the title cut and bass player Paul McCartney just rocking out in a grand way. Next is drummer Ringo Starr singing \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\", which is a great song that will stay in the head for days. John Lennon's \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" follows and is one of the best songs on the album inspired by his son Julian's picture that Julian drew in school and not inspired by the drug known as acid a/k/a as LSD! The rocking McCartney piece \\"Getting Better\\" is a timeless song to sing when you're feeling blue and Macca held this song in high regard and did this song on his 2002 US tour. Another McCartney number \\"Fixing a Hole\\" follows and is a great song to mend a broken heart. The sweet and poignant McCartney with Lennon vocal help \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is a touching piece with a sweet Macca vocal with great backing work from John. Lennon's masterpiece \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" is a great song and makes you feel like you are at a circus.<br />The Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album's second half starts with \\"Within You Without You\\" written by guitarist George Harrison. The track is pure genius with it's Indian sounds and genius lyrics. The funny \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" does a great job of helping the mood and is one of Paul's best songs. The ballad \\"Lovely Rita\\" follows and is a nice little love song written by Paul. \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is a lyrical improvisation written by Lennon and is a great rocker. \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\" is a great and a revolutionary hard rock re-do of the albums intro, thought up and re-written by Lennon with help from Paul. The last song on the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album has been voted one of the best rock songs ever, and it remains that to this day \\"A Day In The Life\\". The song was written by Lennon on a piano with a newspaper in front of him, is the best song by the Fab Four and therefore is a masterpiece and featured some help from Paul. The song and album voted best ever by many classic rock stations finishes with a bang bigger than Hiroshima. Not counting the inner groove jibberish after the last note.<br />The album also broke ground commercially as it was the first album ever to go to #1 here in the US without any hit singles being released and stayed at #1 for many weeks and sold millions of copies (making it the third all time best selling Beatles studio album in the US behind Abbey Road and The White Album).<br />If you haven't already done so, click on the 'Add to Cart' button at the top of the page and get next day delivery immediately. It's worth it and was the album that would inspire more classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next and Born to Run as examples.<br />In 2009, the album was finally remastered and re-released on CD. The CD looks identical to original Parlophone/EMI LP with label and packaging (the cutouts are in booklet).<br />Highly recommended!Lovely Rita\\" follows and is a nice little love song written by Paul. \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is a lyrical improvisation written by Lennon and is a great rocker. \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\" is a great and a revolutionary hard rock re-do of the albums intro, thought up and re-written by Lennon with help from Paul.

B000FS9FCG|4.0|As an initial comment, I have not yet read the original graphic novel, although I would like to when I get the chance, but I have read another of Moore's dystopic creations (also soon to be a movie) \\"The Watchmen.\\"  At any rate, my appraisal of the movie is not based on any evaluation of the accuracy (or apparent lack thereof) by the movie in creating a film replicate of the graphic novel.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure why a film MUST adhere to the source material.  Such criticism is only worth advancing if the film's deviation fails on its own merit, which many here believe, while I do not.    This is the only review I've ever spent much time on, if I even have other reviews, and I only bothered because it seemed like most other reviews were one-sided (pick one side or the other).  Either people saw this movie as \\"telling it like it is\\" and sticking it to the neocon fascists in the Bush administration (whom I firmly believe possess either a profound disdain for the rule of law, or, a disturbingly cynical view of what \\"the law\\" is, but whom I do not believe are personally evil people with per se malicious intent), or, people saw this as the wet dream of rabid and radical liberals frustrated with their inability to really advance an alternative vision or to successfully promote their view of what American values are.  I do not think this movie fits either description.    I like this film, not because I am some blind Bush-hating, liberal (or fill in whichever other stereotype you wish, as I've seen too many in the preceding reviews to cover them all).  I like it because I think the CORE message, at least the one that resonated with me, was depiction of the natural and easy tendency within free societies, to cede liberties and adherence to the rule of law, rather than the rule of men, in order to obtain greater security, when those societies have long enough enjoyed their liberties as to have either, forgotten what life is like in a society which has made such an exchange, or, the society has enjoyed the benefits of liberty and the rule of law so long that is less appreciative  of both its benefits and its demerits (i.e., diminished physical security).  I like how the film manages to show that when the people cede power entirely to the government, by giving up the principle that the law governs, not men, and giving up the liberties which maintain that power, the security achieved is short-lived, and the people soon find themselves facing a different fear and threat to their security from those to whom to they ceded power.    Perhaps this is a movie only someone like me can love while still being aware of these flaws and contradictions; someone who believes that the only thing that keeps our society from descending into cruelty, tyranny, barbarism, and disorder, is a strict adherence to the principle  expressed in the maxim popularized by Lord Mansfield in the Somersett case: \\"Fiat justitia ruat caelum\\" (roughly, \\"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.\\").  I love it, not in ignorance of its not-too subtle, and inartful jabs at contemporary society and politics, but in spite of its bludgeon to the head on those points, and in spite of its failure to address its own glaring inconsistencies.  I care more about that over-arching theme, I suppose, than the particular elemental details which bother me, as well as most of those who categorically dislike the movie.    I am rather young (@25) and perhaps my political views are merely developing, but I neither consider myself liberal, moderate, nor conservative.  I find myself uncomfortable occupying any perspective for too long, or at least, occupying any entirely.  For me, the appeal of this movie is its points on the importance of why the law, and not men (or humans for those who insist on PC language over John Marshall's), must govern.  Yes, the movie definitely takes aim at the current U.S. social and government situation.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  Criticism,especially of the government and our own society is not only at the origin of this nation, but that upon which its vitality depends.  As a third-year law student, looking at entering the legal profession, these themes resonated strongly with me, though I can see why they might resonate less strongly with those for whom a passion for the rule of law ranks below what they might themselves call \\"practicality\\" or \\"realism\\".  But again, that's what I like about the movie, even if it is so blunt as to be insulting about it (I'm cynical enough to think that blunt may often be necessary for clarity): that fascism and tyranny always begin from a point of \\"realism\\" and \\"pragmatism\\".  The law exists in order to temper passions, and temper the reason of the day, with the longstanding wisdom of forethought and basic rules by which a society and government decide they will conduct themselves.  The movie definitely hit my passions there, and that's why I love it.  I think it quite dramatically displays why the law must rule, and why, whenever one begins to think there is good reason or some exigency which justifies abrogating this basic principle of ordered civilization, that such thought must be rejected.    However, my reason for liking the movie also leads to the list of things I found troubling in this this movie, many already mentioned:    -V's own inconsistent stance on the use of violence and terror as just means by virtue of the justiciable quality of the ends to which they are employed (from the view of the one employing those ends).  I think the directors failed to explore the fine line and the biased nature of the distinctions between \\"criminals\\" or \\"terrorists\\" or \\"murderers\\" or what-have-you, and \\"revolutionaries\\" or \\"freedom fighters\\".  We clearly think that some who violently rebel and engage in violent resistance against a government are praiseworthy, while we think others that are, at least facially similar, are quite the opposite.  Why this is so, and the legitimacy, if any, of our distinctions is not really explored or challenged.  V is accepted as a \\"revolutionary\\" and the government as \\"tyrannical\\"...These labels are presupposed, and one either accepts or rejects them, but there is no exploration of why they are so.  I thus find myself disturbed by the ferocity of V's violence against individuals who are merely pawns of the tyranny he opposes, and his casual justification of why it is just that he decide what is right and wrong, while it is unjust that the current government do the same.  The validity of these distinctions would be far more interesting, and isn't explored.  Thus, for me, V for Vendetta is loveable because it gives due credit to the importance of the principle of the \\"rule of law,\\" but disturbs me, and appears to suffer for undercutting this principle at the same time, by failing to distinguish the \\"hero\\" and his ideals, methods, and justifications, from those of the \\"villains.\\"    -the stylized violence typical of movies these days is all the more out of place in a movie that purports to tell a story of \\"heroes\\" who value human life and liberty more than do the villains;    -while I'm not sure what sort of ending I would have liked, I do not think the blowing up of Parliament suits a story that does not have the original source's more anarchic endgame in mind.  I thought the ending was appropriate and stirring up to that point: the marching by the unarmed civilians against the army, that passive non-violent resistance, I thought, better resonated with the themes I loved about the movie which I thought were also its best qualities.  The destruction of the building was a distraction from the real triumph: that the people, unarmed, and in the face of threats to their lives, nevertheless, boldly marched forth to reclaim their liberty and their rule, by law, rather than by the will or whim of men (be they many or few).  THAT was the climax of the movie for me, and I wish THAT had been built upon more, ratherthan the FX extravaganza and \\"WOW\\" or \\"Cool, dude...\\" effect of blowing up Parliament.    So, in sum, I found much to love in this movie, but what I loved, also leads me to wish the directors had been as introspective as they demand their audience to be, and addressed these more significant conflicts in character and socio-political philosophy, rather than simplistically defining the good and evil characters for us.      I very much appreciated the way in which the \\"rule of law\\" as a principle is celebrated, and the dangers of the rule by human will or whim of the day are demonstrated, but thought the directors ignored the obvious fact that the hero himself, as a vigilante, necessarily engages in this same moral failure.  They obviously are aware of the conflict, as demonstrated by the several instances in which Natalie Portman's character questions, or condemns V for his tactics, but they do not really satisfy me (or many others it seems) with their explanations.    Again, perhaps this is only a film only a person passionate about the law, and who has an occasional tendency to become unreasonably idealistic at times about his passions and ideals, can enjoy at those times, while realizing that the movie only matches those ideals in its broad themes, but utterly fails them in the details when examining the characters.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album nicknamed Led Zeppelin IV was released in November of 1971.<br />After the critical hammering and somewhat disappointing commercial sales of 1970's heavily acoustic sounding Led Zeppelin III, English hard rock legends Led Zeppelin (which was lead singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bass player John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham) went back to Headley Grange and recorded their classic contribution to rock and roll history (as I found out in July of 1985 when my older sister got the album on cassette and eventually I acquired copies through the years).<br />We kick the album off with the Top 20 charting classic rocker \\"Black Dog\\" which is a great opener with Plant's vocals rocking out. Plus, Page's electric guitar work, Jonesy's locomotive chugging sounding bass and Bonzo's almost savage sounding drumming just dominating on the track. The 50s sounding rocking \\"Rock and Roll\\" follows and is a superb track (the Cadillac car company has used the song for years as their ad song and the song still rocks regardless). We then take an acoustic detour with \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and is a great folk song with Robert and the late Sandy Denny singing lead vocals with superb mandolin by Page and acoustic playing by Jones. The album's first half ends with arguably the greatest rock song ever recorded, the classic \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". I can see why the track is always voted greatest rock song ever. At eight minutes, it goes from soft to moderate sound then the big soloing climax before ending like it began. This song has held up well over 35 years on.<br />The album's second half kicks off with the heavy rocker \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" follows and is dominated by a killer Jonesy electric piano riff which Page mirrors with his guitar. Next is another superb rocker entitled \\"Four Sticks\\" and was so-named that Bonzo used not one but two drumsticks per hand whilst recording this track, hence the song's title. We then have one more acoustic detour with \\"Going to California\\" and is another great song talking about the band's desire to go back to California and the road. The album closes with the bluesy rocker \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" which is a kiiller rocker with superb harmonica work and relaxing and phased sounding vocals from Plant and impressive slide work from Page and Jonesy's bass work just rocks and Bonzo's drumming just burns.<br />This album has sold over 23 million in the US alone to date because of the material within and not because of the name of the band (the band initially released the album without the band's name on the sleeve nor the spine of the album). Led Zeppelin IV may have peaked at #2 in 1971 but is consistently voted greatest hard rock album ever and Zeppelin proved that the band was about SUBSTANCE and not style (unlike other acts that permiate music today).<br />Highly recommended!th \\"Going to California\\" and is another great song talking about the band's desire to go back to California and the road.

B000WTBMBK|5.0|...and it couldn't come a moment too soon. Easily my favorite album of 2007 so far. This blows his previous release out of the water in my opinion. \\"Massive Attack in 2020\\", like the other reviewer says, hits it right on the head. I can't stop listening to this, trying to get all my friends to listen to it, and now trying to get everyone on Amazon to listen to it.     It's dark, it's atmospheric, it's brilliant. Never pretentious, but always taking the next step. If you liked the trip-hop greats (Massive Attack, Portishead, DJ Shadow circa Endtroducing), you can't help but love this. In fact, this may be my favorite electronic album since Endtroducing, and Endtroducing changed my life. Untrue is that good.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin's fifth album, and first to be released with a proper title, Houses of the Holy was released in March of 1973.<br />By this time in their career, Led Zeppelin had managed to build up a huge following of fans - and a damn good musical sound, as well.<br />Their first four albums to date were nothing short of excellent, but the band was only getting started to experiment with more musical styles. Lead singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bass player and keyboard player John Paul Jones and the late great John Bonham on drums were some of the greatest musicians ever and what they created together will live through the ages.<br />After the success of their untitled fourth album, the band recorded their fifth album at Stargroves (owned by Mick Jagger) and other studios in England and New York in between tour dates on the band's 1972 world tour.<br />\\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is a killer opening track which notes you are in for one Hell of a ride as I was when I first got this album on cassette for Christmas in 1985 when I was just 9 (no lie). We slow down a bit for \\"The Rain Song\\" which is a great piece. \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" is next and starts as another slow tune but turns into a full out rocker. The funky James Brown sounding \\"The Crunge\\" ends the first half of the album.<br />The fun rocker \\"Dancing Days\\" picks up where the end of the first half left off and is a great rocker with some Middle East sounding guitar. The Top 20 hit \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" is a pun on the word Jamaica and was supposed to be a reggae number but turned out to be a parody of early 50s rock and roll. The haunting \\"No Quarter\\" follows and showcases John Paul's keyboard work. \\"The Ocean\\" closes this album out in a grand matter and is still a killer hard rocker.<br />With Houses Of The Holy, the band scored another US #1 album and another monster seller as this has sold past the 10 million mark here in the States to date for good reason as this material is still superb.<br />All of the tracks still receive a good amount of radio play on a regular basis, and with good reason - these songs ROCK.<br />If you're new to the band, start with either this and Led Zeppelin IV or, if you've got the extra cash, get The Complete Studio Recordings box set (The set containing all nine studio efforts).<br />Highly recommended!l receive a good amount of radio play on a regular basis, and with good reason - these songs ROCK.

B000002UDB|5.0|The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour was released as an EP in the UK and album here in the US in time for Christmas in December of 1967.<br />For years, Capitol Records (EMI's US affiliate) had a reputation of chopping songs off of UK albums to create more US albums (Yesterday and Today, Beatles '65 and so forth) but with Magical Mystery Tour, the label finally did something right and (since the EP didn't take off in the US) they added the group's 1967 singles to the second side of a 12\\" album creating a treat for the US Beatles fans that Christmas.<br />Magical Mystery Tour was the soundtrack to the movie of the same name that left a lot to be desired, but the soundtrack is actually one of The Beatles' better albums and was yet another huge success that hit #1 here in the States (all but one or two of their studio albums hit #1 Stateside and sold well during the band's eight years together).<br />I did not hear this album until the spring of 1995 but loved it immediately (not counting the tunes I heard on radio like \\"Strawberry Fields\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"All You Need is Love\\", the title cut and \\"I Am the Walrus).<br />The first six tracks (or side one of the US release) are basically from the movie Magical Mystery Tour. The songs continue in the vein of its predecessor Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, perhaps with more psychedelia thrown in. We open with the psychedelic rocker the title cut which is a great album opener penned from bass player Paul McCartney. We follow with another McCartney number, the ballad \\"The Fool On the Hill\\" which is a great number. Next is the instrumental \\"Flying\\" which is a rare Beatles instrumental. Next is guitarist George Harrison's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" which was inspired from one of his trips to Los Angeles during the Summer of Love which was 1967. Next is the McCartney pop ditty \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" which is a great finger-snapping tune. We end this half with guitarist John Lennon's classic \\"I Am the Walrus\\" which is one of his best songs EVER!<br />The album's second half starts with Paul's single \\"Hello Goodbye\\" which was released before the US version of the Magical Mystery Tour album. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" follows and is one of Lennon's best tracks (in fact, my second favorite Beatles track) and was recorded for Sgt Pepper's but didn't make the album. Paul's \\"Penny Lane\\" is next and is a nice pop song and was the first US #1 for The Beatles in 1967 (this was also recorded for Sgt Pepper). John's underrated B-side \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" is next and is a great song. The closing \\"All You Need is Love\\" is a classic Lennon tune which was a #1 hit in the summer of 1967 and a great song.<br />All you need to do is buy this album (especially the remastered version which was just released in 2009)!The album's second half starts with Paul's single \\"Hello Goodbye\\" which was released before the US version of the Magical Mystery Tour album. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" follows and is one of Lennon's best tracks (in fact, my second favorite Beatles track) and was recorded for Sgt Pepper's but didn't make the album.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles' swan song studio album to be recorded entitled Abbey Road was released in October of 1969.<br />The album was recorded at a time of great turmoil and tensions between rhythm guitarist John Lennon, bass player Paul McCartney, drummer Ringo Starr and guitarist George Harrison were at an all time high. Earlier in the year the band tried to make the Get Back album (which eventually became Let it Be) but the band saw those sessions as a disaster so was scrapped in favor of Abbey Road (one of rock's greatest farewell albums EVER MADE). With Lennon's mind more on recently marrying Yoko Ono and fighting a heroin addiction, McCartney (along with producer George Martin and engineers Geoff Emerick, Phil MacDonald and a young tape operator named Alan Parsons) steered the course of Abbey Road and what an album it is.<br />Abbey Road starts with John Lennon's \\"Come Together\\" which is a great rocker. Lead guitarist George Harrison's \\"Something\\" follows and was the huge hit from the album (that and the previous track hit #1 as a double A-sided single in late 1969) and is a classic even today. Paul McCartney strikes twice first with the humorous \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and the rocking ballad \\"Oh Darling\\". Drummer Ringo Starr turns up some comic relief with \\"Octopus' Garden\\" before the first half ends with Lennon's epic \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" which is a heady piece of music (even if you are not on drugs, especially the ending).<br />George Harrison's beautiful classic \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" kicks off the album's second half before going into the Lennon/Harrison/McCartney harmony vocal induced \\"Because\\" partially influenced by when the band played a classical recording backwards. Paul's \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" follows and is a great rocker. Next is three great short songs from John which were the surreal \\"Sun King\\", the funny \\"Mean Mr Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\" before giving way to Paul's \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\". The \\"Golden Slumbers\\"/\\"Carry That Weight\\"/\\"The End\\" medley is the greatest album closer ever and was Paul's baby. The \\"Her Majesty\\" was thrown in at album's end as a curveball.<br />Today, Abbey Road is the second best selling Beatles single length disc while The White Album is technically the best seller and for good reason, the songs work well together.<br />As always, Abbey Road went to #1 like much of their other albums (until Led Zeppelin's second album Led Zeppelin II knocked it out).<br />No wonder Paul, George and Ringo love this album while Lennon hated it for reasons I can't fathom why.<br />I have gone through copies of this album since first buying this in May of 1995 but now this new 2009 remaster is the version ONE should OWN!

These movies are enjoyed by animation students and fans of Pixar as well as children. Lets hear from the animators and production artists involved! Lets see their work! I will say it's a better release than the Car's DVD was.   It includes a fantastic short hosted by Remmy and Emille! As well as a short behind the scenes with Brad Bird that leaves you wanting more!   I might suggest renting instead of buying due to the lack of extras.

B000654YK6|4.0|Hype! is one of those documentaries that is actually true to the genre by researching the topic at its source.  That research is in the interviews with bands and others in the industry that were truly at the heart of the scene and not just the big names.  This documentary gives even the most self-proposed diehard \\"grunge fan\\" a deeper look into how everything really took place, behind the huge promotional blitz from major labels.  There are some interesting live performances in here and the interviews are simply full of quality responses.  I only gave this four stars for two reasons.  One, I don't think the casual fan of the scene or even some diehard fans would really enjoy the roots of the scene and some of the performances on the disc that evolved from those roots.  This isn't just a Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam festival, there are some wildly different styles displayed on this disc, which is part of the reason why this documentary truly represents the scene.  Two, though I said that they went the right direction by steering clear of some of the more obvious acts, I think it still might have been nice to hear from people like Jerry Cantrell or Layne Staley (RIP) of Alice in Chains or Dave Grohl of Nirvana or any of the other members of the \\"Big 4\\" as they were eventually nicknamed.  Some of the responses that Kim Thayil and Eddie Vedder came out with were very interesting.    If you want to know more about the Seattle scene then this is the place to learn.  It really does debunk some silly myths and there are quite a few hilarious moments such as the Grunge Lexicon.  Timeless.

B000Y179KO|5.0|Since the Long Run release, 25+ years ago, we've been given a linty of crap about this band from the media and from rumor. I'm happy to hear these fellas haven't lost anything. If anything they gained much from life's experiences and growth and put it into their music. The solo careers are a heavy influence on this effort, especially Henley.   A lot of people won't get the messages in this music, because they are looking for the simple pleasures that we enjoyed in younger years. This music talks about today, and reflects on what was better about yesterday. The song list here is not the best they've done, yet they have shown all of us what comes with age is professional musicianship, excellent song writing and impeccable production. Don't forget, these guys are masters at keeping pop music simple and refined. And the funny thing is that none of this music is pop, its just Eagles at their best. Also, I understand why Felder was not a part of this, as he would not have fit well with much on this effort. Joe Walsh, by the way, has grown immensely, and it shows. There's a seriousness to his work here that doesn't let you just \\"walk away\\".  Compared to the garbage that's been out there, and I mean pretty much all of it, for the last 15 years or so, I believe this the best effort from anyone since the early '90's rock scene. The diluted music industry doesn't allow this kind of music to be a major player like it once embraced, so enjoy this serving from one the best American rock bands of our generation.  Dan G 11/11/07
B000Y179KO|5.0|Perusing the reviews on Amazon, I'm noticing a lot of bad reviews for the new Eagles album. I'm thinking, it has been 28 years since The Long Run. Their last complete studio album. Can it really be that bad? Did they blow it? Have the Eagles really fallen that far from their roots? Am I to be disappointed after anticipating this release for maybe 2 years? They had been putting off this release time and time again.<br /><br />I'm happy to say, that I'm not one of the cynical older fans of my generation with a closed mind and a tin ear.<br /><br />I've been an Eagles fan all my life. I lost my virginity listening to these guys in the 70s. Obviously, their music holds a special place in my heart. Here's my feeling about what I consider to be a Classic Eagles' Recording. No one has mentioned this as far as I can see, but Eagles' Love Songs and Ballads reflected a lot of the Loved and Lost themes that made them so important back in the day, to an endlessly broken hearted teenager like myself. Disc One contains a lot of great Eagles' Break-up Music. This is the single most important reason this is a Classic Eagles album to me. So much good music, I almost wet myself. I'm 47, and I've recently had my heart broken by a girl. And the Eagles are playing the soundtrack to my life, yet again. I just knew they wouldn't let me down.<br /><br />This whole album is very very GOOD! It might just be a Masterpiece.<br /><br />Disc One: The opener NO MORE WALKS IN THE WOOD is old time Eagles' harmonies. We're goin' way back to CSNY harmonies, folks. It would have fit nicely on the Desperado album. This one song was worth the whole price of admission to me, when I first heard it. Gorgeous song about a sad time for Mother Earth. Amazing. Like being outdoors, in God's Only Church. Note: The harmonies on this album are softer, quieter, and more subtle than some of their older harmonies. They have matured nicely. HOW LONG is the obvious Single off of this release where you realize a Don Felder guitar hook may be missing. Doesn't matter. Great old chuggin' Southern Rock song that would have fit nicely on the Eagles First album, or their On The Border album. Here's the nostalgic tune I was expecting. Next is what I consider a Classic Henley song on this recording, BUSY BEING FABULOUS. The first of the great Break-up Songs. Henley must have been saving these tunes for the Eagles, because he hasn't written solo material this good in a while. Frey's WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HEART is the first tune on these two discs that has Instant Eagles Classic status written all over it. That spot is usually reserved for Henley. Listen to the harmonies and the lyrics. Right up there with BEST OF MY LOVE. GUILTY OF A CRIME is the only throw away track on this entire album. The Eagles help Walsh put the signature to the tune with the harmonies, but this is the only track that doesn't do anything for me. But, never fear, Joe makes a comeback on Disc Two. Once a falsetto replacement for Randy Meisner, Timothy Schmit proves once and for all that he belongs in the Eagles with I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE. The end of your love never hurt so good. Next is another signature Henley Love Gone Wrong Song, WAITING IN THE WEEDS. Wonderfully executed in storytelling mode, this would NOT have been out of place on the Desperado album. Beautiful song. Frey's song to his daughter, NO MORE CLOUDY DAYS is another impressive Heart Break Song that grabs the Instant Classic status. Wow. That's two for Frey on this disc alone. Next is the Blue-Eyed Soul R&B rocker FAST COMPANY. Daryl Hall would be proud. Philly Soul all the way, Baby. I love it. This song would have fit nicely on their, oft maligned, R&B flavored album, The Long Run. DO SOMETHING is just plain old beautiful PEDAL STEEL Country flavored Eagles, folks. Yeah. The short and lovely, YOU ARE NOT ALONE rounds off this Classic Eagles trip down memory lane. I don't care what the cynics say, it doesn't get much better than this, people. Weused to listen to the Eagles around the campfire in the Mojave Desert when I was growing up. I wish I would have heard this there, first. I would have been in awe just listening to this first disc over and over again. But, there's more.<br /><br />Disc Two is where the Eagles get to evolve and stretch out with some good blues and more. Something that was obviously taking place in the late 70s with The Long Run, but was halted by their break-up. People forget that the Eagles are not afraid to experiment a little with style. I'm thinking of their Classical Western Soundtrack instrumental, JOURNEY OF THE SORCERER from One of These Nights. I was so excited the first time I listened to Disc Two, when I heard they were experimenting. I was not disappointed. But, it's not experimental after all, it's just good good Eagles' music!<br /><br />DISC TWO: Starts off with Henley's follow-up to his Eagles' Masterpiece, THE LAST RESORT. Paradise is dying in LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN. A prescient Protest song about the cultural decaying of America. The title means: we've come a long way to destroy the paradise that was once The Land of The Free and The Home of The Brave. And it too, is a Masterpiece. This song does not have a happy ending. It is hopelessly Bluesy. Great guitar solo by Walsh. And, it's the Best song on the album. And the most Powerful. I absolutely love this side of Henley's music. Keep on preachin', Preacherman. This song means so much to me. I love you, man. Next is the short but sweet Protest Anthem, I DREAMED THERE WAS NO WAR. Beautiful guitar piece with synth strings, that's over much too quickly. The rockin' Western Grunge sound of Frey's SOMEBODY is next. Another Hit. More smooth R&B Blues Rock from Henley on FRAIL GRASP ON THE BIG PICTURE. I'm talkin' smooooth. Great guitar work. The best Rocker on the album includes a pulpit organ sermon on religion from Henley himself. Righteous. Someone else said it. I'm gonna repeat it. Joe Walsh's quirky LAST GOOD TIME IN TOWN would fit very well on a Steely Dan album. Awesome blue-eyed soul and jazz. And blues! The band was groovin' on this one! WOW! Funky smooooth stuff, man! The chorus is a Hit! And the solo smokes. And it's quite simply, the best thing I've ever heard from Joe Walsh. Donald Fagen wishes he wrote this one, indeed. Frey's I LOVE TO WATCH A WOMAN DANCE should have been placed in sequence on Disc One. It's old time Eagles complete with that waltzing mandolin sound that's straight from the Desperado era. Just beautiful. BUSINESS AS USUAL is another Rockin' Protest romp from Henley about the free market and cultural decay. \\"It's a soul-sucking world.\\" Wow. I wish I had wrote that. Nice guitar work. Blues? Yeah, man. CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE might be the most beautiful song on this album next to NO MORE WALKS IN THE WOOD. Makes me want to cry. Absolutely gorgeous harmonies. Touching. Rounding out this superb collection is Frey's Tex-Mex song IT'S YOUR WORLD NOW, complete with marimba and Mexican horns. Quite simply, an Eagles Hit!<br /><br />I'm in Heaven. This is Classic Eagles Music! Ten years down the road, I know I'll STILL be playing it! I just hope it's not 28 more years for a new album. I'll be dead by then. If they actually played music like this on the radio anymore, this album would score big with a plethora of Hits!<br /><br />JUST A LITTLE TOUCH OF PARADISE IN A DISAPPEARING EDEN.<br /><br />I can't believe it. I'm STILL an Eagles fan!und the campfire in the Mojave Desert when I was growing up. I wish I would have heard this there, first.

1400079179|5.0|The Da Vinci Code has been called \\"an exhaustively researched page-turner\\". I don't know about the \\"exhaustively researched\\" part, but I can vouch for the fact that it is a page-turner. A murder in the Louvre, cryptology, a beautiful and sexy Sophie Neveu, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail, the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and countless other elements will keep the average reader hooked. The problem is when one wants to start looking at this book as a historical one rather than a mystery/thriller. Those who find fault with this book are searching for the wrong thing in the wrong place. Just read it for fun... oh what a roller-coaster ride it is. It is Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code that inspired me to read several other books with a Jesus element including [[ASIN:0440136482 Holy Blood, Holy Grail]], [[ASIN:0875161685 The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ: The Philosophic and Practical Basis of the Religion of the Aquarian Age of the World and of the Church Universal]], [[ASIN:1430327545 The Rozabal Line]], and [[ASIN:1879181037 The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail]].
0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's New York Times Bestseller, \\"Eat, Pray, Love; One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia\\" is an easy read, with friendly, self-deprecating, and honest writing.<br /><br />In her thirties, Elizabeth realizes she is not living the life she wants. She wants to find her bliss. Elizabeth recognizes with sadness that her life has been wasted - she does not want a cookie cutter life in the suburbs doing what other people want her to do. After much angst, she makes the decision to leave a unfulfilling marriage.  She fights a deep depression from a unhappy marriage and hurtful divorce.  Although she offers friendship and money, her ex won't forgive her choices.  Elizabeth does not blame anyone for the divorce, however, she begs closure and wants him to be her friend and he can't.<br /><br />To cure herself, to fight the deep depression with faith and hope, she decides to travel. We follow her to Italy, India and Indonesia - all countries that begin with \\"I\\" - it is time for taking care of herself.  In Italy she learns the Italian language, something she always wanted to master, as well as to enjoy and love the taste of the wonderful Italian Pasta.  In India, she learns the joy of Yoga and meditation.  In Indonesia, she stays in Bali and that last part of her journey seems more involved with characters and acceptance.  There Elizabeth finds true love with a 52 year old Brazilian man and sails off into a Bali sunset.<br /><br />The book shows it is hard to hold on to blissful perfection, and one quote hit me:  \\"We search for happiness everywhere, but we are like Tolstoy's fabled beggar who spent his life sitting on a pot of gold, begging for pennies from every passerby, unaware that his fortune was right under him the whole time.  Your treasure - your perfection - is within you already.  But to claim it, you must leave the busy commotion of the mind and abandon the desires of the ego and enter into the silence of the heart.\\"<br /><br />In the end Elizabeth has learned much about life and herself.  Time heals, and she needed a year, which is the usual mourning period for loss.  She also needed time to find the truth about herself.<br /><br />There are 108 chapters in this very readable book.  She wanted the book to have as many chapters as japa mala beads  - beads that Yogis, Hindus, Buddhists wear and use to stay focused during prayerful meditation.  Her introduction explains how this book works using 108 tales - 36 for each country.  Each tale is is personal and full of exquisite insight.as learned much about life and herself.

0066620996|4.0|Underneath all the hype, statistics and jargon, lies one simple an amazing fact. You can have great managers with great ideas, but the companies that stand tall are those that had CEO's who were not afraid to get into execution. They were not afraid to get their hands dirty. They were not afraid to get into the realm of systems, processes and implementation. So if you want the summarized version, it goes pretty much like this: \\"Great companies are those in which the leaders are able to transcend the curse of competence, think differently about the role of technology, and create a culture of discipline.\\" Now get the book. A must read for anyone who aspires to be a leader or for any leader who wishes to do better.
0307387178|3.0|This book was chosen by my book club.  Initially, I didn't care for the book because I felt that Chris/Alex was just one of those self-centered people who feel that they can break the rules and not suffer the consequences, invincible at the expense of others.  The author sort of jumped around a bit for my personal liking (I prefer more chronology.), but as the account unfolded, I found myself more able to relate to Chris's sense of adventure and/or need to escape.  I feel the author's goal in this book is to prove that Chris/Alex was not a crackpot or some stupid kid, and I feel the author acheived his goal eventually.  Even so, I still am frustrated with some of Chris's decisions and not a lack of sense but his refusal to use it sometimes.  He felt free by giving everything away, but I don't view that as free, I view that as being at the mercy of whatever charity some stranger threw his way whether it was a car ride, a meal, or a place to stay.  Maybe he would've been happy to walk, starve and suffer the elements, but I just felt by unburdening himself, he burdened others.  You could make the argument though that they chose to be burdened by him...  Anyway, I think this book portrays many kinds of psychological aspects, so it was really interesting to read.  I'm not sorry I read it, but I didn't love it, however it was chosen for book club, not something someone like me would normally pick up.  So take that for what it's worth!  Oh, and we would have liked to have seen more of the pictures Chris took and maybe have had more than the very little amount of his personal excerpts.
1844138518|3.0|I was surprised to see that there are no customer reviews for this book. I guess this, in a nutshell, sums up the long tail. In this brilliant work, Chris Anderson, says that the internet has changed many things but the most important one is the fact that it has created a long tail of niche products that by themselves mean very little but when one aggregates their deman, they add up to a lot. This website is a prime example of that long tail where bestsellers and POD books rub shoulders. This book has been written in a light, casual, entertaining style, but still manages to convey some serious information. Great idea and well written.

0312330537|5.0|Oh what an incredible book. I was scared to start Shantaram because of its size but once I got going I was enthralled. To think that descriptions of Bombay slums, underwood gang lords and overflowing toilets at Arthur Road jail could be interesting reading is in itself an interesting fact. The author has a passion for almost every aspect of life. The portions about his stint in Afghanistan dragged a bit, but other than that, this was an amazing peek into the world of India, Bollywood, underworld dons, drugs, prostitution and redemption. Loved it!
0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor is one of those books that you will either get, or you will not get. Retired Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell and British author Patrick Robinson have given us a spellbinding account of a Navy Seal mission in the mountains of Afghanistan in which 3 of Marcus' team members lost their lives. The minute-by-heart pounding-minute account of their ordeal will either grab you in the gut and make you thank God for the United States of Amercia, or you'll come away scratching your head wondering what the fuss is all about.     Because I am an ex-serviceman, I understand the warrior ethos with which the SEALs, and other special-forces type soldiers like them operate by. Luttrell is not shy about sharing his views about how those in the media, academia, and in politics have so much to say about \\"human rights\\" and \\"rules of engagement,\\" without realizing what the stakes are on the battlefield.     Far from being \\"trigger happy Rambo-types,\\" the account Luttrell and Robinson portray the SEALs in Lone Survior is of a group of men who are, at the core, deeply moral, patriotic men driven by love of God and country, not blood-lust. Their deliberation on whether or not to execute the goatherders brought me to tears.     It is easy for those of us who have never experienced war, being shot at,having our lives threatened by hostile action, etc. to say what we would or would not do in certain situations. But the fact remains that the Navy SEALS are highly trained combat specialists, mentally and physically, and those brave men who stories are told in Lone Survivor are owed a debt of gratitude from a nation who remains free because of their sacrifice.
0451209338|4.0|In the murky world of Islamic terror, Tariq is one of the few people that Israel actually fears. This book is set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace talks and the possibility that Tariq needs to be stopped before he does something terrible to derail the process. I had thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" and this book was \\"un-put-downable\\". The contrast of the quiet art restorer's life in Cornwall with the action-packed lifestyle of the man chosen to put down Tariq is incredible. His character is given enough pain through the loss of a wife and child a decade earlier. All-in-all a terrific book!
1401300529|4.0|In my experience, most books can be divided into three broad categories:  those that seek to educate, those that seek to entertain and those that seek to do both.  When you can find books that fall into the third category, and succeed, you have most profitably invested your time.  In this category I place the works of Stephen Ambrose and David McCollough.  Also, works of historical fiction by such authors as James Michener and James Clavell would qualify.  However, the further in depth the education becomes, the more difficult it is to maintain the entertainment factor.  Ambrose and McCollough are masters in this regard.<br /><br /> David Halberstam is an outstanding historian and a meticulous one.  It is the depth of his analysis that makes this work extremely educational, but at the same time, dry at times and plodding at others.  This is definitely a worthwhile read for anyone seeking an education on matters involving the Korean War in general and the military and political landscape of East Asia during the period following the Second World War in particular.<br /><br /> Of particular interest, and outstanding focus are the relationship between President Truman and General Douglas MacArthur; the Chinese civil war and the dichotomy between the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist army of Mao Zedong; the domestic political struggle surrounding the fall of China and the leadup to the Korean conflict; and the relationship between Korean dictator Kim Il Sung and his Communist overlords in both Russia and China.<br /><br /> This is an outstanding piece of work from the standpoint of analysis and historical relevance, however it falls slightly short from the viewpoint of purely enjoyable reading, due in large part to the depth of the analysis and the detail used by the author.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.
0393330435|3.0|This book made me feel bad for Steve Wozniak. I realized, for the first time, that a lot of the actual work that we give Jobs credit for was actually the work carried out by poor little Wozniak. It's very evident that this is the story of an introvert genius who was both very lucky and very unlucky to have been friends with Jobs. Lucky because Apple could never have become Apple without Jobs, and unlucky because Jobs completely overshadowed Wozniak.    This book is interesting because it not only covers many of the little nuggets of corporate history that get forgotten, but also a peek into the freaky mind of a geek who created that cult product, the Mac.
1596590688|4.0|I recently listened to, \\"Blue Ocean Strategy - How to create uncontested market space and make the competition irrelevant\\" by Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne. The title really tells it all. The book talks about creating uncontested market space on the theory that contested market space is very difficult to make money on. It is now one of my favourite books.<br /><br />There is no such thing as riskless strategy. Strategy always has to involve both opportunity and risk but the present playing field is dramatically unbalanced in favour of tools and analytical frameworks exceeded in existing businesses. As long as this remains true, existing businesses will continue to dominate companiesâ(tm) strategic agenda even if it is a business imperative for creating new initiatives and takes on a new urgency.<br /><br />One thing that I like about the book is that it uses multiple examples of companies who have revolutionized the industry that they are in by creating brand new markets and brand new spaces. For example, they talk about the automobile business moving from the Model T to General Motors, to small fuel efficient Japanese cars to the Chrysler mini-van, etc.<br /><br />One of the most interesting stories was about the Japanese hair cut that used to cost $40 to $50 and included everything from a shoulder and scalp massage to shampoo, etc., but generally took an hour and subjected the customers to long waits. When a chain of barber shops went into Japan offering no appointments and traditional haircutting like we are accustomed to in North America, the chain thrived in a big way.<br /><br />This example explains part of what the book proposes. The key is to look at what is really being offered and look at what parts you can dramatically improve. Often you can end up with lower costs while at the same time adding more value to the customer. In the case of the barbershop, they were able to reduce the cost by not having to spend as long on each customer, not serving tea, etc. While at the same time, reducing the customers' waiting time which is an important commodity. The customers were not valuing the extras as much as they were valuing having their hair cut.<br /><br />Great thesis/theory.  Tougher implement though.  Good because it makes you think though.ng the customers' waiting time which is an important commodity. The customers were not valuing the extras as much as they were valuing having their hair cut.

0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is someone that I would not like to have a conversation with. His view on the world minus GOD is something that I would not like to come to terms with. I agree with him on many counts, chief among which is the fact that religion has caused most of the world's problems. Having said that, however, I make a definite distinction between religion and God. I do not know whether I would like to live in a world that consists of science, rationality, logic but nothing that I can look up to i.e. God. This book is brilliantly structured and I would have a hard time debating the author.. . the point that I am making is that this is not necessarily a matter of logic but a matter of faith.

They have been served to great reviews to everyone who's tried them--and some are very picky, \\"if it doesn't have eggs/milk/butter, it can't taste good\\" people.  Hah!  The recipes are easy to follow, and I really appreciate that they don't require too many unusual ingredients.  This'll definitely be my go-to book for any bake sale or gathering I go to!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I was more than a little frustrated. I made the mistake of expecting something big to happen; at least for the plot to start developing (which is really only fair; you do tend to expect that in movies). I loved the ending, but wasn't sure how I felt about the film as a whole.    Then I couldn't stop thinking about it. I bought it before I watched it a second time, somehow sure that I would watch it again and again.    And I was right. I can't describe it--this movie is like therapy for me. I put it on when I'm by myself, going to sleep, early in the morning, or whatever. Anyone with any depth should feel compelled by this movie, even if they don't fall in love with it like I did. Dream-like, subtle, funny, heart-breaking, beautiful, reassuring. Watch it by yourself and, strangely, you'll feel less alone.

It leaves you hanging in a \\"What the heck?\\" sort of way!!! REALLY BAD.  A CHEAP TRICK AND DEFINITELY NOT WORTH RENTING OR BUYING!!!
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|This early release of The Departed on the (discontinued) combo edition DVD/HD DVD disk is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen, pristine 1080p, VC1-encoded perfection and has a very noticeable visual upgrade over the traditional DVD's 480p, MPEG-2 encode. It also includes a Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 surround track, more perfection from Warner. The film is pure genius, well-written and performed with a healthy dose of hilarity, but you can check out film reviews from thousands of others elsewhere. Overall, I'm pretty happy and very impressed with this HD DVD release of The Departed. Insane visual and audio quality gets me every time, but I could do without the troublesome and expensive combo disc, which thankfully Warner has discontinued. A new release is imminent, but in the meantime this one is still a fine investment! Recommended.

That's all well and good but its not something I expect from Wilco. All those festival and tour kids who followed Phish... Here's your new band. Personally, I'm gonna file this stuff away for now. I'll break it out in ten years when I have kids and I need a soundtrack to wash the dishes.

1594489505|4.0|Had I not read the Kite Runner and absolutely adored it, and had I not read numerous recent books based on the lives of Pakistani or Iranian or Phillipino or African or Chinese or Japanese women who also face horrendous things, this book would've thrilled me more.  Those books are: Brick Lane, Reading Lolita, Elephant Dance, Left to Tell, Snowflower, Geisha.  Each of them was excellent and quite telling, but Splendid Suns sang the same song.     Hate to say it, but it sometimes feel like publishers get on a theme bandwagon and ride it like a gravy train to sell books.  There was a run on books where kids get victimized, people of color being victimized, now its women in third world countries.  This over-saturation ends up diluting the impact each of the individual stories make on us over time.  And that's a shame because these tales need to be told.

They could have included BOTH!!! What gives? Some kind of licensing issue?

Now I have to go and  find a bootleg CD to hear them.     VERY DISAPPOINTED!

0316067598|5.0|Was this story ever reported in the media? I remember the reports of the missing team, the one SEAL that managed to escape, and the downed rescue chopper. The bad news was well covered. For the life of me, I don't recall any media coverage of the rest of the story. Since the event doesn't reflect poorly on the military or reduce support for the war, it didn't get told by a liberal media that has reduced itself to an advocate of failure, an entertainment medium for selfish leftists, reporters who have become actors.    You have to buy the book because you won't find this story in the papers or as a special report on TV.     One thing I especially liked about the book is that the author gives due credit to others. True, he preens a little but he's entitled.    Special Forces are men who will put everything on the line because they believe in this country and want to protect it. Contrast that with the other side, the one that can't find anything about the country that is good or worth standing up for. It's ironic to me that in the process of defending their America, these men are also defending the other America, the one that works for their defeat.     This needs to be a movie. What's the likelihood?
0316067598|5.0|Luttrell takes you on a rollercoaser ride from his early life, through SEAL training, the battle on Murphy's Ridge and his return home.  The battle itself, and the courage displayed by the SEALs, is amazing.  Their mindset, you are never out of the fight, is worth remembering.  These guys literally fought until their last breath.       If you enjoyed \\"Bravo Two Zero\\", then you will probably enjoy this book.  Luttrell does toss a couple stones at the media in the beginning and end of the book, however, the vast majority of this story focuses on the battle and his rescue. He clearly loves his family, the State of Texas and the United States.  Since I live in Texas, and even went to college many years ago in his hometown, I can appreciate those comments.     Now...if Hollywood could produce a movie on this book, I suspect it would be an instant hit.  Our children are starved for role models and heroes. You would be hard pressed to find better men to emulate.
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah appeared at various Starbucks restaurants around the country last spring as part of his book tour. I was fortunate in being able to see Ishmael at one of the Starbucks.    It is an amazing experience to see an author in person and to hear them read from his or her book,  and to tell about what the experience was like for them.     As you probably know, Ishmael was a child soldier in Sierra Leone, from the time he was 13 until UNICEF rescued him when he was 16. UNICEF then placed Ishmael in a rehabilitation center and helped him immigrate to the U.S., where he finished high school. Ishmael graduated from Oberlin College in 2004; he is all of 26, but has already lived a lifetime of experience, much of which was horrendous, having been a child, trained to kill.    Ishmael described what happened when he first began talking about his experiences as a child soldier, when he first moved to New York and went to high school. He began speaking in public about his experiences; sometimes, people did not understand the scope of the problem, or did not understand, that as a child soldier trained to kill - that he was a victim of the war, too, not a perpetrator.    Ishmael lost his family, his town, and his childhood innocence.      The book, \\"A Long Way Gone, Memoirs of a Boy Soldier\\" is beautifully written, and you want to read it in one sitting, wanting to absorb everything,  anxious to know more about the boy whose childhood was reft from him.    Here is an excerpt from Chapter 2, which Ishmael read at the Starbucks.    \\"I am pushing a rusty wheelbarrow in a town where the air smells of blood and burnt flesh. The breeze brings the faint cries of those whose last breaths are leaving their mangled bodies. I walk past them. Their arms and legs are missing; their intestines spill out through the bullet holes in their stomachs; brain matter comes out of their noses and ears. The flies are so excited and intoxicated that they fall on the pools of blood and die. The eyes of the nearly dead are redder than the blood that comes out of them, and it seems that their bones will tear through the skin of their taut faces at any minute. I turn my face to the ground to look at my feet. My tattered crepes [sneakers] are soaked with blood, which seems to be running down my army shorts. I feel no physical pain, so I am not sure whether I've been wounded...\\"    I recommend this book to EVERYONE. We CANNOT stop these injustices if we do not KNOW about them.    Ishmael reminded listeners that the incidence of child soldiers is not unique to Sierra Leone, nor to Africa.  It is estimated that there are more than 50 violent conflicts worldwide, with more than 300,000 child soldiers, as Ishmael was. He is a member of the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Division Advisory Committee and has spoken before the United Nations, on several occasions.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|The voice I love is there.  The phrasing still moves me.  The material is tiresome.    Stephen King throws some stinkers between great works.  These are stories that must be told before we get to the good stuff.      Ms. Lennox does the same thing on this album.  Perhaps she works these through her system before delivering a gem.
B00005JMXX|1.0|The environmentalist whacko left, having condemned millions of Africans to malarial death via \\"Silent Spring\\", is now trying to reduce us all to pre-medieval peasant status by a general attack on Western industrial civilization.  Behold its latest ouevre, \\"The Day after Tomorrow\\".  \\"The Vomit after Diarrhea\\", in my humble opinion.    This movie is so bad, in so many ways.    First off, the acting is completely overwrought.  Regret and sadness practically ooooooooze from everyone's pores.  Scene after scene of people staring in glassy-eyed horror at some new disaster, big or small.  Gutenberg burned for warmth, as tears of regret flow.  Wolves hunting in cities.  Monster, city-destroying storms.  Americans fleeing to Mexico.    Then, the science is completely wrong.  That much climate change, that quickly?  Pah!  Completely unbelievable.    Finally, Americans feeing to Mexico?  Not a chance.  The Mexicans would gun down every American crossing the Rio Grande.    I hope MST3K comes back so they can feature this.  I wish Amazon had a \\"minus star\\" rating, for things like this that actively subtract from the joy of life through unmitigated dumbness.    UPDATE:  I'm watching this again on FX (11/17/2007 11:45 PM).  It doesn't get any better.  I cringe for these people, that they should have survived this.  We definitely are living in an age of mediocrity, and these actors are leading the way.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|the film and its soundtrack are utterly amazing.  there is no other way to describe it.  it's simply beautiful!  yea for the beattles.
B000R4SMCW|2.0|A wealthy engineer (Anthony Hopkins) murders his philandering wife (Embeth Davidtz), confessing the fact to the arresting officer (Billy Burke), who just happens to be the man with whom she was cheating.  Enter Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), an assistant district attorney who is about to sign on with a major law firm and has agreed to prosecute this slam-dunk case on his way out the door.  Obviously, things turn out to be less cut and dried than he thought.    This mystery holds interest for a while, but the resolution reveals how contrived it all is.  The success of the murder plot depends on something that couldn't be anticipated.  Gosling is annoying in this role, doing most of his acting with his hands.  Most of the attempts at humor fall flat.
B00080Z53O|5.0|This film is one of the rare films which really impressed me. I never cry at films but I did in this film, and I saw many movies, as I am a movie lover. A one in about 20 years film. Fantastic, sensitive, to the bottom.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|This is a really a change of style from previous albums. I would highly recommend the album, whether a die hard Wilco fan or a new listener. There are few bands doing something unique and seems Wilco always has a way to change, yet stay the same. I also recently got really into The Everybodyfields, which is another in the alt-country genre from East TN. If you like Wilco, give these guys a listen too.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Left in the jungle as a baby, raised by wolves, befriended by a panther and a bear, Mowgli's life is now threatened by the return of Shere Khan, the tiger, and king of the jungle. Don't worry; this movie has very little violence for it is a classic story based off of Rudyard Kipling's story about a boy who is raised by wolves.    Mowgli's animal family refers to him as the \\"man cub\\" and he is happy living in the jungles of India, but once the tiger Shere Khan finds out he is there, he will no longer be safe. Bagheera, the wise old panther, decides to take Mowgli to the nearest man village, even though the boy doesn't want to leave. Throughout their journey, they encounter Kaa, a hypnotic snake, and an army of elephants, and Baloo the bear, who is widely popular for his \\"Bare Necessities\\" song. Mowgli is tempted by Baloo's lovable, laid-back way of life, but when Mowgli decides he likes being a bear and the two ditch Bagheera, the pair run into trouble.  Some crazy orangutans kidnap Mowgli and take him to their king, Louis Prima, who then tempts him with an offer he can't refuse. Shere Khan finds out there is a \\"man cub\\" in his jungle and is hot on his trail. Somehow, Baloo and Bagheera find a way to team up to protect the boy.    Once the unlikely duo rescue Mowgli from the orangutans, Baloo angers him by mentioning they must take him to a man village and he runs off. He eventually encounters the barbershop singer group made up of vultures and they cheer him up. Danger strikes when Shere Khan appears and attempts to capture Mowgli. Baloo comes to his rescue by distracting the tiger so he can get away, but the tiger attacks Baloo and knocks him unconscious. Bagheera then ties a branch engulfed with fire to the tigers tail and he runs off.    Once Shere Khan is defeated in the film and Baloo recovers, the trio treks on and only by chance does Mowgli leave the jungle. At the bittersweet ending, Mowgli is lured by his human instincts when he sees a girl for the firsttime and follows her into the village.   The Jungle Book is filled with songs you can't help but sing along to and with jungle animals you can't help but fall in love with, even Shere Khan's voice is charming. Enjoyed by children and adults alike, this charming film is Disney's 17th animated feature and the last film Walt supervised before his death.    I enjoy this movie every time I watch it, especially now because it reminds me how much I loved it when I was a kid. Every character is appealing to viewers in some way because they are all so diverse and in it's own way, the film does teach children even though it wasn't necessarily created for educational purposes. Children can learn that even if someone may look or act differently from them, they can still get along. By the end of the movie, Bagheera manages to loosen up enough to give in to Baloo's care-free way of life. They can also learn about teamwork through Baloo and Bagheera and that it's not okay to kill someone even if you don't like them.     I would certainly recommend this film to children, parents and even teachers. Teachers may find the new edition very useful for educational purposes because it is interactive. Parents and children may also find the interactive aspect a plus because kids can then interact with their favorite characters through games. The 40th Anniversary Platinum Edition just came out this fall, with many special features such as music videos, deleted scenes and songs, long lost characters, backstage features, games, and more.
0385341067|5.0|This little book is filled with wonderful characters, whimsical, enchanting \\"picures\\" and sudden, unforgettable horror. A book that stays in your mind and begs to be reread, soon!
0761119752|5.0|This has been my favorite bedtime book to read to our baby over the past few months. It is fun with catchy rhymes and entertaining illustrations. I love this book!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I debated buying the boxed set. This was my favorite show in high school. After the series ended I made sure to catch the episodes in syndication (often on MTv). As an adult, I am enjoying watching the series again, and even have a new found respect and understanding for the artistry that surrounds Angela Chase. It's great having all of my favorite episodes in one place, especially the Christmas episode (\\"So-Called Angels\\") and the last episode of the series (\\"With Dreams Come Responsibilities\\"). It's such a shame that this series had to end so abruptly, but good to know that it's ingenuity is timeless.     The only thing that could be improved upon with the boxed set is including omitted scenes.
B000002O5L|5.0|I am so mad, so mad, so mad at myself, all these years of hearing Tom Petty on the radio and taking his artistry for granted. SO many completely exceptional songs, his heart and soul ripped bare for us to feel,and oh, Tom, I am so sorry it has taken me so long to feel the gift you have so generously given us. I just didn't know, but it is never too late to fall in love, and with all my appreciation to your wonderful wife Dana, I have to say I am enthralled and in love with Tom Petty!<br />After seeing the Peter Bogdanovich documentary ( HIGHLY recommended, I bought it at Best Buy good price) I have a newfound deep love and appreciation for this genius among us. Free Falling, so beautiful! The melodies, the harmonies.<br />Actually I am crazed and am in the midst of buying every single Tom Petty CD either with or with out the brilliant Heartbreakers.<br />Full Moon is a passionate beautifully recorded album, but as I said before I am in the midst of a  crazed frenzy of buying everything Tom has done.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is a classic and pertinent to this time. A must have in any format but especially vivid in HD.
B000M341QE|5.0|Excellent entertainment. Actors were in top form.The standout in the script was of course Jack Nicholson, he made the movie exceptional
B00003CX9E|5.0|What struck me most while finally seeing CITIZEN KANE (as the only person probably in filmdom who had not!) was that the story of Kane I could trace in the lives of so many other high-powered moneyed public figures even to this current day! Newspapers still can control what we think and how we perceive \\"reality\\";newspapers still intentionally slander and try to discredit in order to control public opinion (now, even certain television stations!);how rich folk attempt to  control the movements of the rest of us and make us think that they really identify with us;how public persona and private lives are often diametrically opposed;how careers can be made with the sure and certain influences of wealthy people;how political office is often something to which they aspire......but most importantly,just how much these people are scared little children in need of their mommies and daddies and their sled!!!!!!<br /><br />This film says it all.Yes this film is a marvel in cinematic technique etc,etc.etc,but for me it is the timeless message of the corruptibility of the average citizen resulting from the lack of early essential childhood needs being provided.That this story was based \\"loosely\\" on the life of mogul William Randolph Hearst almost seemed irrelevant to me as a million more \\"Hearsts\\" have come and gone and still are here in my own lifetime.<br /><br />With the upcoming elections within a year, I am glad to have CITIZEN KANE for my very first time.This film only continued to confirm what I have always believed:that ultimate power corrupts ultimately (someone else said that first!).If ever a film was made to expose people for what they are and to aid an already cynical nature, then I am glad to have made CITIZEN KANE that most agreeable choice!<br /><br />The extras on this DVD, a two hour film on how Hearst tried to destroy Wells and the film is priceless. ANY serious moviegoer needs this DVD in their collection.What you learn about the film process and corruption in the industry is worth every minute of your time.I will never view films quite the same way as I have thanks to this film.ALL REVIEWERS ON AMAZON-ATTENTION!!!!-GET THIS!!!!
B000MXPE7O|3.0|The film and the actors were very good. The exception was Angelina Jolie who seemed at times to be coasting through the film. The script tried to cover a long piece of history and did not carry it off. I am familiar with the era and was a bit disappointed.

1400064287|5.0|I highly recommend you read this if you do any marketing, blogging, podcasting, writing, and so on.  One of the hardest things about communications is that we so quickly forget what we hear, see, read, and even say. Which, for marketers, sales people, business owners and the rest is frustrating and might even lead to feelings of futility and cynicism! LOL--seriously, folks, this book can help you get your message/story/idea across in ways that \\"stick\\" with your audience.<br /><br />However, getting the concepts is no guarantee you'll be able to turn out provoking, stick-y stories and ideas, you will probably do better than you are doing now, and who knows, you just might create the next ice bath-with-kidneys-missing legend.
0385486804|3.0|I didn't know much about this book until a friend mentioned the story to me.  It sounded a lot like some of the idle dreams I've had for my own adventures. And when I heard that Sean Penn was making a movie about it, I was concerned that I'd have to re-evaluate my complete and utter lack of respect for him.    But after reading the book, it all fits together.  Within the first chapter it quickly became evident that this kid was an annoyingly spoiled, self-centered, self-righteous and idealistic brat.  I came away wholly unimpressed with the story, and it makes sense that Penn would make a movie about an idealist who ignorantly provided for his own undoing.    Regardless, as usual, Jon Krakauer's writing style makes the book enjoyable to read.  I found myself shaking my head at McCandless's pursuit and methods, but I think that is testament to Krakauer's ability to write a good story regardless of the subject.    In fact, the best part of the book was Krakauer's own memoir about a reckless trip of his own.  It seems pretty clear that his own experience in Alaska prompted him to write about McCandless.     If you're a pragmatist like me, you'll enjoy the writing but be annoyed by McCandless.  If you're a young, idealistic dreamer, you'll also enjoy the writing and it may serve as a cautionary tale.  It's a quick, easy book to get through; it's worth reading.
0312983867|5.0|Being from Jersey, I just love the Stephanie Plum series. It is a far better glimpse of Jersey life than you know!
0143038419|2.0|I breezed through this book hoping to find the intelligent and inspiring story everyone seems to rave about. I was sadly disappointed: the author is self-absorbed, impulsive, and whines about everything in her life. Her constant \\"God\\" talk became extremely annoying. I did enjoy the Italy section with the descriptions of the food and language, although I think Gilbert missed out on the art and culture aspect of Italy. Oh well....
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|So I like Britney.  But I like Britney more when she's at least TRYING!  I mean really TRYING!  When she's believing in what it is she's creating and putting out there for her fans.  That was part of her charm.  People would put her down for so many things but she would always try and succeed because she loved music and believed in her music.  She would go into the studio and work with her team and make great songs.  Now, I believe her name is listed under one writing credit on this album after years of her working to build on her music.  In this CD she's not there... maybe it's just me... but I can't put my finger on it.<br /><br />For the most part the album is a blur.  Now I know, I know, it's a dance album.  Great.  But I was expecting Britney to put out a CD that would take me \\"places\\".  Not just a CD to dance to on the dance floor or listen to while washing clothes or cleaning the house.  I expected some kind of story from this album but the material is like everything else out there.<br /><br />Girl in club.  Girl sees guy.  Girl dances on guy.  Girl takes guy home.  If not the message, the ideal.<br /><br />Is that all Britney?  I'm not saying air dirty clothes but she has a million things to sing about now than something so - I don't know what's the word.  I mean.  What happened to songs like \\"Breathe on Me\\" or \\"Shadow\\" or \\"Toxic\\" or something that had a little more creativity behind it (FROM HER) besides the heavy studio men showcasing their engineering skills in the studio.  She sung a beautiful song about her breakup with Justin.  She sung a beautiful song about her baby (which I was hoping was going to be on this one).  To me she proved that she actually has something to say and now... I don't know what this is...<br /><br />Dance CD or not, we've heard Britney sing before on her albums and I could actually hear her.  Now, I can't hear her.  Voice morphed or not.  It's a strain to get pass the noise to hear what she's saying.  I think that's my major problem with this CD is that I can't hear - HEAR her - if she's saying something important that's she's learned or not.<br /><br />And one thing that bugs me about this CD is the supposed \\"sexy\\" lyrics and crooning; the fact that she keeps holding on to this image she ONCE had.  Britney.  The fantasy has been ruined for us.  Please believe that.<br /><br />For those of us expecting a little more, I suggest to just take the CD as it is.  Listen to it or not.  As far as I'm concern I now see she's still in the eye of the storm in her personal life and the creativity isn't there.  Just take the album as it is.  A wild dance CD where you're just going along to the beat, not the message.  Hopefully after she gets whatever she needs in her life she'll have her eyes wide open and ready to grind out something heavy and inspirational.  I'll spin the CD a few more times, I did my part by paying for it blindly and I'm not regretting it.<br /><br />My opinion on BEST tracks...<br />-Heaven on Earth.  Kinda Madonnish.<br />-Get Naked is cool.  It's got that haunting voice that I like.<br />-Toy Soldier.  I might be mistaken but doesn't this sound like something M.I.A. done.  At least vocally.<br />-Perfect Lover is pretty good.  Timbaland did this right?<br />-Why Should I Be Sad.  The only song CLOSEST to what I expected from this CD.an't hear - HEAR her - if she's saying something important that's she's learned or not.

B000002UAU|3.0|\\"It was novel at the time, but now sounds pretentious.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sgt.

Now if strawberry fields and penny lane which were supposed to be on Sgt. Peppers it would have made it a bit better but it still wouldnt have compared with the Beatles other albums. With A Little Help From My Friends and Good Morning Good Morning are two very good songs, the rest of the albums tracks are songs I'll occassionally listen to, but they really aren't that good of songs.

B000OTUHNM|5.0|I was an adult when i read this book, and i really appreciated the lessons in life that Saint-Exupery shares through the Little Prince.     A great book, full of beautiful illustrations, easy to read, while fun and sad at the same time.     I personally read it as if Exupery is sharing with us the conversations he has with his own inner child, in the image of the Little Prince. That is why the Little Prince would ask many questions, but rarely answer the ones he was asked. Like all our inner children he's been hidden inside and kept silent for a long long time, and now that he was given his chance, he will speak. And we better listen, for he is an integral part of our psyche, who will take us through the most unbelievable adventures.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Well since Britneys VMA perfomance was less than great i figured the album wouldn't be too great either.  But i was actually surprised to find that almost all of the songs were great to listen to and they're are made for the clubs. This is what i have been waiting for. At leaset britney made a comeback in some aspect!    Heres my rating:    Gimme More 10/10-No doubt about it this song is hot and catchy!    Piece of me 8/10-Good song describing her current situation and media attention    Radar 10/10-Love this song! one of my favorites..good lyrics    Break the Ice 10/10- My fav song on the album.     Heaven on earth 6/10- has an 80s type feel. ok song but not the best    Get Naked 9/10- Love the beat but the lyrics could be better. Def a club joint though    Freakshow 5/10-not one of my favorites but its an ok song    Toy Solider-10/10 Hot Hot Hot! awesome song    Hot as Ice 7/10- pretty good..britneys lyrics are pretty catchy    Ooh Ooh Baby 8/10- Another one of my favorites. Love the melody its sooo catchy & the guitar is cool    Perfect Love 6/10- not really a fav    Why should i be sad 10/10- When you hear this you know exactly who its about.

B0001O3YC6|1.0|Every time the fashionable but pointless MTV type jerky editing really pulls it down. Mark of a rank armature editor trying to cover up their own incompetence. I hate this type of pointless fashion so much I decided to post a warning.    Too bad. \\"Looks\\" good otherwise. I'm sure others have mentioned it's derivative and clichéd.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Where \\"Inland Empire\\" starts is a signal pointing to where it's going.  It's an old lit crit cliche that I used to  use when teaching college classes in difficulty literature: forget about \\"meaning\\" for a while, and simply look at what you're looking at when you're looking at it.  In books, it's the words on the page; in movies, it's two things: (1) the image on the screen (whatever its connectd/disconnected relation to what came before and what follows). And (2) the verifiable \\"ground\\" of all the rest: what's actually happening as represented on the film that projectors project onto a white screen.      Looked at this way, \\"Inland Empire\\" has a lot more nudging-you-in-the-rib clues than such items as \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"  We got a movie, we got a script that was done--incompletely--once before but aborted when the actors started playing out the script's love afair for real.  So reality/movie reality is already in play before you even buy you ticket at the box office.   We know from this that it's probable that the current actors--Niki and Devon--are going to reduplicate the previous reduplication.      And then: we learn that there's a \\"Polish connection\\": a folk-tale about--judging by what actually happens in the film called \\"Inland Empire\\"--love affairs/vengeful husbands/beaten wives/confusion between what is desired and imagined and what isn't.      Once you begin with these in-you-face donnees, everything else that follows follows.  Niki is the vehicle here, and curiously the Devon character simply disappears.  So everything in the movie gets acted out in Niki's \\"real\\" life, and everything that happens in Nicki's real life is going to happen in the movie.  Which movie?  \\"Inland Empire\\" or \\"High on Blue Tomorrows\\" (got that title right?)?  Well, what did you expect: both, dummy.      Cutting to the chase, Lynch with the above possible combinations to play with, is going to do exactly what he does: move the \\"plot\\" in and out of all of the abovecombinations and parallels in any order that you like.  Why?  Because, at bottom they're all the same story, even to the point where Polish prols show up at the backyard barbecue in the southern town's wrong-side-of-the-track neighborhood where the souhern adultress \\"Sue\\" ends up.      The \\"moral\\"?  Never assume that you know what your own literal reality is on the basis of your belief in your capacity to spot the \\"merely\\" metaphorical or fictional or non-existent.  What we think is what we are and what we dream is what we think, and what we do turns our lives into metaphorical fiction.  We factually \\"are\\" by Lynch's very down-to-earth logic all our possibilities.  You think you can tell the difference between your \\"real\\" life and your \\"fictional\\" live(s)?  Lynch says it isn't even worth trying.

B000VBJEFK|3.0|Excellent movie and high-def transfer is fantastic. However, Disney just can't stop cramming more and more previews before the movie. BD disk has about 10. It took me good 5 minutes to skip through them. And all those 'coming soon' will look ridiculous in a year or two.
B00062J00S|5.0|The holiday season is not far off as I am writing this. I just received my copy of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". Several years ago about every t.v. station aired this classic. That is until NBC snatched up the exclusive rights to the Jimmy Stewart film about this hero down on his luck until his meeting with Clarence. Donna Reed did an excellent job in her role. I may sound prejudice but she is one of tbe best and she was from my home state of Iowa!!!!  It's A Wonderful Life..even though it was panned by the critics and was not one of the big box office hits of 1946,the movie has stood the test of time ever since for a new generation to enjoy. And always remember...every time a bell rings an angel earns his or her wings!!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It's a shame Britney's personal woes are overshadowing the release of of Blackout. THis cd is by far her BEST.  I can actually listen to it all the way through and not have to skip around to 3 or 4 hits like on her previous albums.  The producers did a great job making Brit sound as best as they possibly could, which is there job.  The same can be said for Madonna, Janet, Ashley Simpson, Ashanti all of whom are not the strongest vocalist. These songs actually make sense unlike \\"Oops I did it again\\" or \\"Slave for you.\\"  Anywho, I've been a Britney fan since \\"Baby on more time.\\"  Britney's a bonafide star, a true performer,(not counting the VMA's) and her album should be measured against her previous efforts and not her personal life.  If you do that, it can't be denied that Blackout is indeed her best album to date. IT JUST NEEDS TO BE PLAYED ON THE AIRWAVES!!
B0004Z33G4|5.0|I have always enjoyed the work of Sylvester Stallone with his character Rocky Balboa. I will admit his role of John Rambo is so true to life. The set in this trilogy is action packed and violent. I should remind you that John Rambo is coming back in a new movie come January so be sure and watch it at your favorite theatre. If you are looking for excitement,then don't miss the Rambo trilogy!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  Great action.  Great production. Great acting.  I would encourage people to watch the History channel's dvd regarding the actual historical battle of Thermopalae.  While it appears to me that the movie captures the fighting style of the ancient Greeks, there are many creative liscenses taken.  As long as the viewer remembers that this is entertainment and not history, these deviations should not subtract from the enjoyability of the film.
0785123490|5.0|As something of a comic book aficionado, I have to say this has always been and continues to be my favorite comic mini-series of all time. Well written, compelling and engrossing this is a must read. `nuff said!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|My husband and I are major Trekkies and used to have most of these episodes on VHS. Since I recorded them myself from tv broadcasts,the quality was not that good so we decided to purchase this set. I am so glad we did. I love watching these shows and recommend that every Star Trek fan put this collection on their Wish List.

0307341542|1.0|I received this book through BookMooch, it was highly recommended. So for me it was HUGE disappointment. Wanted to give up within the first 15 or 20 pages, made myself read until page 70 or so, then skipped to the back. I was completely bored. The ending wasn't even close to be surprising.

B000W1V44I|4.0|After the release of their comeback album \\"Never Gone\\" the Backstreet Boys seemed to go off the radar for a while. As a longtime fan of their soaring voices and catchy melodies, I was disappointed that they didn't radio play out of \\"Never Gone\\". With many excellent songs such as \\"Incomplete\\", \\"Just Want You To Know\\", \\"Crawling Back To You\\", \\"Weird World\\", and \\"Poster Girl\\", it was a little disheartening to learn that there were very few singles released. Back in the day, the Backstreet Boys would have numerous singles per album, and while their voices have remained strong and pure, their style has matured quite a bit to encompass a more modern rock/dance type of attitude as well as their usual boy-band pop fare.     With \\"Unbreakable\\", the boys (even without member Kevin) have once again scored an excellent album. It is an excellent companion album to \\"Never Gone\\", and shows even more range in style while also adhering to the soaring, memorable ballads they are known for (i.e. \\"Shape of My Heart\\", \\"Show Me The Meaning...\\", \\"Drowning\\", \\"More Than That\\", \\"Incomplete\\", etc.)     I was surprised by how consistently excellent this album was, as well as diverse in its range of styles. Almost all the songs on the album are top-notch in quality and performance, while varying from rock-oriented songs, more upbeat modern dance-type numbers, and several fantastic pop ballads (with the latter type being my favorite).     The boys nail several Maroon 5-esque upbeat funky dance songs such as the excellent \\"Any Other Way\\", \\"Panic\\", and \\"One In A Million\\". They also easily slip into a more mature, old-fashioned style with the wonderful \\"Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon\\" which recalls The Eagles and U2. And for those who (like me) love the pure pop ballad with catchy melodies and the boys' beautiful voices there are several fantastic songs: \\"Inconsolable\\" (their first single from the album), \\"Downpour\\", \\"In Pieces\\", and \\"Unmistakable\\".     My personal rating (out of 10) for the songs on this CD:     Intro (7/10)   Everything But Mine (6/10)   Inconsolable (10/10)   Something That I Already Know (6/10)   Helpless When She Smiles (8/10)   Any Other Way (9/10)   One In A Million (9/10)   Panic (8/10)   You Can Let Go (7/10)   Trouble Is (8/10)   Treat Me Right (6/10)   Love Will Keep You Up All Night (8/10)   Unmistakable (10/10)   Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon (9/10)   Downpour (10/10)   In Pieces (10/10)     All in all, the Backstreet Boys are still in excellent form, staying true to their pop roots while also expanding their style. If you enjoyed \\"Never Gone\\", you're sure to like \\"Unbreakable\\" as well. With so much talent and many different styles on display here, it's impossible not to find something to like on here. Hopefully the boys will get some more radio air-time and singles with this album!
B00008H2LB|5.0|When I first heard Linkin Park, I lived in Mexico and only saw their music videos. The music didn't make much sense to me at the time...years later, I find myself really enjoying hearing their music so I bought this album. It's awesome! I play it loud and it gets me moving...when I don't feel like working or doing housework, it's great to just GET IT DONE! Funny thing is that when my landlord hears it, he thinks I'm angry :-) HA! Leaves me alone!<br /><br />&lt;just kidding about my landlord, he's actually really cool>
B000VR824S|5.0|I was at this show. It was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. There were a few difficulties with the sound, but don't let that bother you- it was limited, and I don't think it will detract from the overall experience of watching this dvd. I've seen many shows over the years, but this was truly special. There were so many great artists, new and already established (icons, actually), that it created an electricity in the air that I believe will be apparent to all those that see this. There will be some people that single out things, and yes- it's a shame that Beck's performance of the Beatles' classic is missing; but trust me- this is a show that you'll want to own if you're a fan of even half of these artists. Truly special.
0385335989|4.0|Since I started reading this series, I have been compelled to continue even if I wasn't in the mood for Gabaldon's books.  This book was definitely different than the first three.  I enjoyed \\"The Outlander\\" but the next two books were quite a struggle for me to get through.  I consciously decided to take my time on Drums of Autumn to ensure that I didn't confuse characters and muddle up story lines.  In fact, it took me 6 months to read this book, and I really, really enjoyed it.  The smaller stories within the book were so riveting this time.  For the first time since starting this series, I am chomping at the bit to start the next book.    The only reason I gave this one four stars instead of five was the length of this book.  I would have felt satisfied finishing about 3/4 of the way through.  But otherwise, it was a great read.
B000002BQK|5.0|1997 saw the best work of a number of powerhouse divas: Madonna's Ray of Light, Janet's Velvet Rope, Shania Twain's Come On Over, Sarah McLachlan's Surfacing, and the best of them all Lauryn Hill's Miseducation. That year also saw the release of Butterfly, Mariah's best work and one that she obviously holds close to her heart.<br /><br />I am passionate about every song on the CD except for the unremakeable misfire \\"Beautiful Ones\\" (just downright awful). The best songs on the CD are:<br />\\"Honey\\", a sticky-sweet mid-tempo collaboration with Puffy...no, Puff Dad...wait...P. Did...whatever.<br /><br />\\"Butterfly\\", her personal theme with its lush layers in the chorus topped with Mariah's powerful pipes,<br /><br />\\"Breakdown\\", another nice mid-tempo cut with Bone, Thugs, N Harmony,<br /><br />\\"My All\\", a sexy acknowledgement of desparation with a nice Spanish guitar supporting her call, and<br /><br />\\"WHENEVER YOU CALL\\", perhaps the greatest ballad of all time. The delicacy and the control with which she sings this well-written song is amazing. It builds to this powerful climax and then she brings it back down to such a perfect ending. This is one of the very few ballads that I don't think I'll ever get tired of.<br /><br />Looking back to 1997, I can't help but wonder what's happened to music. I recall 1997 ushering in bubblegum pop that undeniably altered the musical landscape like a gigantic tractor. Now, today, the musical scene still seems barren with too few inspired artists from my generation.
B0001US8EO|2.0|I own the VHS two disc version of this, and was very excited when this came out. I purchased it thinking it was the extended edition, but it was just the normal version with deleted scenes that were in the VHS version. I ended up giving this away. BEWARE!!!! If you want the extended version, it is only available on VHS.

6303148352|5.0|This movie is great, however the book is a lot better. This movie seriously flawed by leaving out several important parts of the book. For example, the raft scene is not in the movie, nor is the water fall scene. Great movie, but please, read the book.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I really, really loved this CD once it hit store shelves back in May 2004. I still feel the same about it, really. It's kinda surprising.<br /><br />*** Take Me Away...is one of Her most angst-ridden recordings, but it's OK I guess. Just don't plan on putting it on repeat.<br />**1/2 Together...is very forgettable. Forgot it!<br />****1/2 Don't Tell Me...This is quite the kiss-off!<br />*** He Wasn't...Meh/10<br />***1/2 How Does It Feel...Kinda mellow, to be honest. It's not too bad. Quite listen-able, and the lyrics are decent. It's a keeper, I suppose. ^_^<br />***3/4 My Happy Ending...This is decent also.<br />****1/2 Nobody's Home...One of Avril's most insightful pop songs with a bit of meaning. Her best track here.<br />**** Forgotten...I really, REALLY like this song. It's kinda hard. And the lyrics are cool. Like the swagger on this one. And I'm no fan of Hers anymore.<br />***3/4 Who Knows...Pleasant pop tune.<br />***1/2 Fall to Pieces...Like this one too. Not as strong as Forgotten, or Nobody's Home, but solid nonetheless.<br />***1/2 Freak Out...Was cool and still is to just chill to.<br />***3/4 Slipped Away...Avril, if it does any good, I'm super sorry that You're grandpa died so suddenly.

0743486285|5.0|The book is a raw look into Nikki Sixx's life during the height of his drug use....the fact that he kept a diary during his insanity of drug use is priceless because he would never have remembered all those details without that diary. So many people are going to be able to relate to him, and have hope in getting clean and sober. If you buy the book, I highly suggest buying the music soundtrack that goes with it....it is unbelievable, I was totally amazed how well it goes with the book!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|How, a \\"welcome rebuke\\"?  Hmm, I wonder what the subtext of that statement is?    The reality, the fact, the forever burning truth is that in all ways except the presence of the lead, the Spanish version of Dracula is better.  It's better directed, better staged and better acted.  It's scarier, it's subtler, its better.    Yes, Bela Legosi is an epic and immortal figure as the lead in Dracula, and while the Spanish lead is very very good, he's not Bela.  No argument.    But overall, the Spanish version is THE version for honest film afficianados.
0425188809|5.0|Knootz does it again. \\"Watchers\\" really takes you in, and doesn't let go. Knootz describes graphically how the antagonist, \\"the monster,\\" destroys it's victims most vital organ. The book is basically about this thing that escaped from some type of testing facility, and is after a dog (for reasons I cannot say, it'd ruin he book for you). An unassociated man named Travis gets involved after the dog stops him from committing suicide in the woods. Now we get into the meat. Now, we have this sort-of love triangle, the monster after the dog and now the man, and eventually his girl friend as well.    This is a great book for anyone who loves Stephen King, as it takes the same approach. I would highly recommend you read Knootz's other master pieces as well.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I don't think there are many more relaxing, and soothing CDs, that truly inspire and uplift the soul. He's not bad looking, but His voice is where it's at. It's never flat, it's always uplifting, and somewhat melancholy. Somewhat powerful. Not as powerful as Clay Aiken's, but He's much easier on the eyes than Clay.<br /><br />And let's be honest, has Clay put out a listen-able CD, EVER???! I rest my freakin' case. This CD is so good, that I even enjoyed the Spanish songs for the most part. And I'm not a fan of music that I don't understand much...!<br /><br />Hymne A L'Amour is very a very sexy track. LOL Can't believe I just said that. =P<br /><br />Anyway, it's rather enjoyable throughout. I only could imagine skipping one track.<br /><br />Cover Art: B+<br />Songwriting: B<br />Vocals: B<br />Production: C+<br />Length: A+<br />Overall: B<br /><br />4 stars.

B000063COX|5.0|As an Iron Maiden fan from the very beginning, I can say Bruce worshippers are clueless. Maiden's first 3 albums (Iron Maiden, Killers, Maiden Japan) are their best, and I couldn't imagine anyone on vocals other than Di'Anno. Number of the Beast was solid, Bruce brought a different (not better) theatrical element, but they were never as good after NOTB.     FYI - Paul Di'Anno was not fired because of his singing, he was battling alcohol and drug problems (gee what a unique concept for a rock star).
0743298039|5.0|I joined a book club recently and this was the latest book for us to read. It was delightful, unexpected story twists, and following in a tradition to English writers, simply terrific. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting something just a little different.

B000RG1FMO|3.0|The highlights on this rap, soul and rock-inspired record are:<br /><br />Good Morning<br />Stronger<br />Everything I Am<br />Homecoming (Feat. Chris Martin)<br />Flashing Lights<br /><br />The lackluster tracks aren't too ample:<br /><br />Champion<br />Drunk & Hot Girls<br /><br />He's the one of the better Pop Rappers that I can think of. Three are better and come to mind when I think of Kanye Omari West: Jay-Z, Nas and Biggie. But that's it.<br /><br />To be *perfectly honest* thought this is Kanye's WEAKEST effort by far. Some of the songs are awesome such as Flashing Lights and Stronger but the crappy ones are *really* that - crappy. I've never been so disappointed in Him! I have already got a copy off of the internet and see next to no reason to cop this at all! Don't slip on Us anymore Kanye Omari!!!

B00006LPER|4.0|I was originally attracted to this film because I am/was a pianist and I was interested to see a French take on a movie involving a musician.<br /><br />Wow... upon first viewing, I was quite shocked.  There are some scenes in this movie that are downright disturbing.  If you've seen any French film, you may know what to expect.  If you haven't, this may not be the right film to start with.  Ultimately, it was very well acted and well directed.  The special features aren't enormous, but what is there is quite interesting, including an interview with Isabelle Huppert.<br /><br />It's hard to describe, really.  If you're used to American film, you probably won't like it right away.  Give it a chance.  If you don't like it, that's fine.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I bought the Longshot for use in a game called Humans vs. Zombies and although we haven't started playing yet, I HAVE been playing with the gun. It doesn't jam as much as other people might say it does (just make sure to load everything properly and with strength, if you don't load everything all the way it won't work right), and it's really fun. The little pistol thing on the front is pretty useless as far as nerf guns go, but as an accuracy increaser it's pretty good. The Longshot has a longer range than most other nerf guns I know, however it's not really accurate, and I would rather have one 12 round magazine than two 6's.    It's a fun gun, however. The scope is also useless and it's easier to aim using the scope rail and the front \\"sight\\". It also appears as if a strap can be mounted to the gun.    The darts are a special kind and are more expensive than the normal nerf dart, which won't work in the longshot.    Overall, though, It's a lot of fun. I've ran and then dove into the grass with the gun and it didn't get damaged.    Another upside to it is that it's easy to modify -- There's no glue or anything in the gun, just screws. To upgrade the strength all you need to do is remove the air limiter and put a new/another spring in there. Springs from AR-15 assault rifles work, or if I am not mistaken, the spring from a toilet paper roll holder might work too, in tandem with the normal spring.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I absolutely adore this CD. The songs have so much passion in them. My absolute favorite song is \\"So She Dances\\". It's such a beautiful song. I would highly recommend it.
B000000OAN|5.0|For anyone who appreciates flamboyance, extravagance, and richness in music, I would recommend an album from a band I feel is underrated: Queen's A Night at the Opera. The album perfectly balances satire with melody, humor with serious talent, and diversity with cohesiveness, all at once. This album embraces exaggeration and excessiveness, and it should, in addition, be embraced by a wider audience.    A Night at the Opera was released in 1975, and although I was not around to experience this, the album has nonetheless made a big impression on me a generation later. What first attracted me to Queen was, I hate to admit, the well-known song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" It was like nothing I had ever heard before, with several movements, repeating musical motifs, and overdubbed vocals. Later on I purchased A Night at the Opera on a whim, seeing that \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was included. But I soon learned that Queen was much more than \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" and that A Night at the Opera was a masterpiece.    The album begins with the scorcher \\"Death on Two Legs (Dedicated To...)\\" which is about the band's ex-manager who wronged them. Upon listening to this bash-fest, I would really pity anyone who ever crossed Queen. With blazing guitar from Brian May, and intensely angry lyrics delivered by the late, great Freddie Mercury (may he rest in peace) the song is sure to pump up even the biggest musical vegetable. The song gets contagious when Freddie and the boys sing \\"you're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride.\\" This up-tempo rock song is a fantastic opener because it brings the listener in immediately, mesmerizing with its driving, powerful feel.    \\"Death on Two Legs\\" then directly flows into a totally different song, \\"Lazing On a Sunday Afternoon,\\" which, although only a brief minute long, is still memorable with its over-the-top schmaltzy, theatrical style that few bands could pull off. Then a song written by the drummer Roger Taylor called \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" furtherproves that Queen does not take themselves too seriously, which I find to be refreshing. Another refreshing aspect of the album is that all four members contributed to the song-writing process. For example, bassist John Deacon wrote the pop tune \\"You're My Best Friend\\" which follows Taylor's hard rock song about car obsession. This feel-good pop song adds yet another diverse element to the album, but it still works on the whole because Queen worked together to finish songs. There are continuing similarities between all the tracks that tie it together and make A Night at the Opera cohesive.     So if I mentioned that Einstein's theory of relativity was also a part of this album, would that confuse you? But it nonetheless should be said that \\"'39\\" incorporates this theory. The song is about astronauts who go exploring in outer space for one year (in their perception), only to find that one hundred years have passed on Earth. It is a sort of science-fiction acoustic romp of a song, and is so unusual that I usually reference it to back up by opinion that Queen is much more than \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" \\"'39\\" might require being listened to a few times before its meaning is fully understood, but this would be time well-spent, because it is smart, intriguing, and a remarkable song topic.    \\"Sweet Lady\\" is next, which showcases Queen's metal roots, but includes hilarious lyrics (\\"you call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese\\") and is something you can still sing along to. And then in the same vein as \\"Lazing On a Sunday Afternoon\\" comes \\"Seaside Rendezvous.\\" In the middle of the song, May and Mercury sing an entire so-called \\"musical\\" break using only their voices. They simulate woodwind sounds, like clarinet, and even play kazoo. It's ridiculous, but wonderfully lovable and goofy. On a more serious note comes \\"The Prophet's Song,\\" which is actually a few minutes longer than the notoriously-lengthy \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" It is probably the darkest song on the album, and includes a long a cappella section in the middle with all of Queen's members singing. And for anyone who has noticed the lack of ballads so far in A Night at the Opera, \\"Love of My Life\\" is for you. The beautiful piano, played by Mercury, is balanced with the harp, which May undertook, along with guitar.    \\"Good Company\\" has Dixieland influences, but there are none of these jazz instruments, such as trombone, actually present. Instead, Brian May used special effects on his guitar that made it sound as if a big band was playing. When listening to it, it is hard to believe that all the sounds he produces are made by a guitar. (Of course, his guitar is legendary, so this helps. It's called Red Special, and he made it himself!) And then, finally, comes \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" one of Queen's trademark songs. Although no one can really say what the song is actually about, many people know all of the nearly six-minute song's lyrics. It is unusual in the respect that it was written entirely by Mercury. He even composed the guitar solos note for note on piano. I give \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" the credit for getting me into Queen, for it is a truly remarkable song, with several movements, sweeping vocal lines, and incredible melodies that make it extremely memorable. But I also urge anyone who only knows this song by Queen to pick up A Night at the Opera and enjoy all of the tracks.    The album ends with the short instrumental \\"God Save the Queen,\\" a tribute to England's national anthem. It is a good closer because it makes listeners feel super-charged, like the opener \\"Death on Two Legs,\\" but has a slower tempo, and sounds as if Queen is saying, \\"Farewell! We hope you enjoyed the album!\\" (I do. Every time.) It is an ending statement, the cherry on the sundae, that makes A Night at the Opera totally complete. Overall, this album is really worth having in any music collection, and deserves more attention. Long live (the) Queen!
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This movie is INFINITELY better than the TV show with the same title. They are so different in fact, the title \\"Miami Vice\\" disserves this work of art.<br /><br />First and foremost the cinematography is sensational. It uses all the tricks in the bag of filmmaking and then reconfigures them to show the filmmaker's mastery (i.e. director Michael Mann).<br /><br />Acting is superb. Jamie Foxx is somewhat restrained, almost as if to give way for Colin Farrell, who indeed delivers a tremendous performance--although not Oscar caliber; not this time. The most dramatic performance in this movie, and in fact Oscar worthy, goes to Li Gong. She has an amazing way to show power and vulnerability all at once.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat weaker than either the cinematography or the acting, but watchable nevertheless. Great action scenes, while not over the top to stretch the suspense of disbelief to the point of breakdown.<br /><br />Get the popcorn!
B00006DEFA|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever made.  Period.  Well directed, well acted, great music (obviously), and a story with characters that will wrench your heart.      No, it isn't historically accurate, for the most part.  The huge storyline isn't, but a lot of little details actually are.  Only musicologists care about things like that, though.  But the story that is presented is wonderfully evocative and enrapturing.  Any fan of film would love it.      This edition is the way to go, as well.  It has restored over a half hour of original footage, including Costanze's meeting with Salieri, and Mozart's endless quest to find regular employment.  The commentary is insightful and worthwhile, and all the other special features are well worth the time.  Buy this.  Now.
B000J3Q8U4|5.0|Sylvia Kristel is back in this second exquisite sequel to Emmanuelle Arsan novel, that is more sensual, more sensational and more beautiful then before! This is a more polished movie then the first Emmanuelle, with all those involved, gaining from previous experience. It is a very stylishly elegant and restlessly erotic film in the series that changed sexy cinema forever. One of the most delectable pleasures include the famous bathhouse masseuse sequence (featuring the legendary Laura Gemser)and Emmanuelle's daring seduction of a friend's shy young daughter into the delights of a menage-a-trois!  The over-all production was very well done. The locations were beautiful providing the viewer with escape from reality. The music provided a romantic background to an already delightfully delicious movie. I rated this movie 5 Stars. I found it most enjoyable.
0471702188|5.0|My only complaint is that I did not buy this book earlier.  I really found the content excellent and laid out in a helpful style, with plenty of illustrations so I could test my understanding of the words. Some of the more complex formulae (especially towards the end) lost me, but that was not a fault of the authors ~ more the reader.  For any but the most experienced, this seems to be the best book on Valuation I have read, let alone bought and I have been in this market for over 30 years.  Many of the concepts are well known, especially in the first part of the book ~ Fundamental principles ~ but even there, the wealth of detail and illustrations kept the text fresh and interesting.  The second part was a excellent drive through the practical aspects of valuing a business and was followed, in the third group of chapters, by a review of Value Creation Principles.  This is all good stuff and culminated in the last section with a number of more complex but practical examples and case studies.  The only chapter I thought did not advance my knowledge & add value, was that on \\"Investor Communications\\"; not up to the standard of the rest of the book, was it written by an associate?  Congratulations to Mr. Koller and his co-authors, they certainly offer value for money with this edition ~ its more than just a book on Valuation.  Buying the Valuation Model case study CD adds value, but I found the links not atall easy, but a phone call solved the problem.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I love the movie and the soundtrack.  I don't understand why I like Glen Hansard's singing.  I decided it must be because he loves making music since he imbues his music with a great love.  Marketa Irglova has a sweet voice and love of making music.  Besides she's beautiful and has a wonderful way about her.  But you have to see the movie to experience her personality.

B000WSL5Y0|5.0|Following in the bloody footsteps of \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"The Departed,\\" Ben Affleck's \\"Gone Baby Gone,\\" yet another gritty crime drama from the mean streets of South Boston, is as briliantly depressing a moral vision as has ever been put on screen. Of the three films mentioned here, \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" may be the most sobering, and also quite possibly the best (which is saying something in both cases). Co-writing a screenplay based on a novel by \\"Mystic River\\" author Dennis Lehane, Affleck directs his brother Casey in the role of Patrick Kenzie, a private eye born and bred in Southie who takes on the case of a four-year-old girl missing from the neighborhood. Working with his soft-hearted girlfriend-partner, Angie (Michelle Monaghan), Kenzie in his investigation encounters the girl's pathetic junkie mother (Amy Ryan), whose known criminal associates comprise a rogue's gallery of potential suspects; a detective (Ed Harris) transplanted from New Orleans who has definite opinions on a cop's moral imperatives; and the guilt-ridden chief of the missing children's bureau (Morgan Freeman). With a sharpness and confidence belying his status as a first-time director, Affleck leads us through some of the most harrowing sequences in recent cinematic memory to a final moral dilemma which you won't see coming until it smacks you right in the face. Only one of the choices is truly moral, the screenplay tells us, but choosing it means despair and heartbreak for everyone involved. \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is highly unusual for a mainstream movie in its emotional maturity and its dead-serious consideration of basic questions of morality and personal responsibility. Affleck keeps the audience on edge throughout the movie's running time, and the performances he gets from his cast could not be improved in any way. \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a film that is certain to be remembered at Oscar time, and in the years to come to make the short list of Everyone's Favorite Depressing Movies.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Best remix of any 60s music. It's obvious a lot of work went into this. The results are impressive. This is THE soundtrack of and for the '60s'. Just when I thought I couldn't bare to listen to another Beatles set, comes this, my favorite album of the last 40 years.

0151013047|2.0|I approached this short novel with a hopeful mind. I hoped for an examination of the psyche of the disenchanted. I wanted to be illuminated about the way humanity is at times negligent of other's stories and how that can lead to adaptations of philosophy that justify the behaviors of the true believer. Instead this book is informed by the limitations for the already known. As with all true believers, the central topic of pain and grief is treated with disdain and simplistic observations. When Changez's \\"friend\\" is grieving from the loss of her lifelong relationship, she is refered to as broken, damaged, having a psychosis, and ultimately suicidal. It strikes me that this inability to humanely imagine the world of grief is the prime motivator of religio-mania of all stripes. If the author had resisted the urge to create metaphors of a collapsing sick America, and focused instead on the global implications of our collective inability to meet each other and responsively attend to the way that we grieve, (which in my opinion is what post 9/11 is all about), he could have created something meaningful. Instead we have misdirection presented as inner journey.
B00003CXCD|5.0|What can be added about this delightfully romantic and funny film and Audrey Hepburn's luminescent performance? I fell in love with the film at the age of 18, and have never fallen out of love with it. The story of the princess who takes a Roman Holiday from duty and falls in love with a handsome journalist of the \\"Daily American\\" who begins by exploiting her for a hot story and then falls in love with her himself is one that the city of Rome--magical even in black and white--makes plausible. Rome is a city of promises where anything is possible.<br /><br />When I first saw \\"Roman Holiday\\" (and I believe I saw it a dozen times when it came out), I had no idea that my own road would eventually lead to Rome where I was to live nine years studying and writing ancient history, art history, and archaeology. I may not have found the handsome journalist, but I didn't need to. I found Rome, and it kept its promises!

Oh, and the rest of the album rates a solid four stars too.
B000UJ48VI|1.0|_Lolita_ (1962) is a great movie, with a lousy, non-anamorphic DVD transfer.    You would think that Warner would get it right by the time of the third DVD release.  Yet, _Lolita_ still plays with black bars all around when displayed on a widescreen TV.     The non-anamorphic treatment of the THIRD _Lolita_ DVD release is typical of Warner. It seems that even Academy Award winners get the non_anamorphic treatment: The original _Driving Miss Daisy_ and _Bonnie and Clyde_ DVDs were released in a non-anamorphic format. These two titles were later re-released -- at reduced prices -- in anamorphic versions.    Sometimes Warner puts its \\"Enhanced for widesreeen TVs\\" message on a DVD box, even though the enclosed DVD is non-anamorphic. The original, non-anamorphic versions of _Goodfellas_ and _JFK_ were given such false advertising, but subsequent re-releases were actually anamorphic. On the other hand, the original _Cabaret_ DVD was non-anamorphic. Now, the second DVD release of _Cabaret_ claims to be \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\", but alas, the \\"new\\" DVD is the same old non-anamorphic garbage in a new box.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|Fantasy is hard to find in the movies -- for every \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" there's only a handful of bad sword'n'sorcery tales for kids (\\"Eragon,\\" \\"The Seeker\\"). As for fairy tales, forget it.<br /><br />But one little fairy tale HAS made its way into theatres -- an enchanting little story loosely based on a Neil Gaiman novel. And \\"Stardust's\\" charm is its lack of pretension, and its willingness to be silly, romantic, fantastical, sparkling and most importantly, tongue-in-cheek. And it has pirates too.<br /><br />A wall separates our world from the world of magic -- and one night, Dunstan Thorn went over it, and had a brief tryst with a beautiful princess, who is imprisoned by a witch. Nine months later, baby Tristan is left on his doorstep.<br /><br />Nineteen years later, a dying king magically flings a ruby into the sky, and says that the prince who finds it will be the new king. The two remaining princes -- and the ghosts of their dead brothers -- et off to find it. But that ruby dislodged a star, and it plummets to the ground across the Wall -- attracting the attention of three ancient witches, who use the hearts of stars to restore their spent youth.<br /><br />Still with me?<br /><br />Tristan (Charlie Cox) also sees the star, and the snotty girl he adores (Sienna Miller) says that she will marry him if he gets her the star before her birthday. Tristan does manage to find and entrap the beautiful star, Yvaine (Claire Danes), and they start off on a magical adventure of air pirates, unicorns, evil witches, and true love.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" has pretty much all the requirements for a fantasy and/or fairy tale movie -- magic, love, an evil villain, and lots of odd characters to round out the cast, and flesh out the story. Not much is actually new. But like the original Gaiman tale, the movie winks affectionately at you as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In fact, the movie only really stumbles when it stops to ruminate on true love and how precious it is, etc. Cute, but boring -- especially since the romantic leanings of the leads are pretty clear. Director Matthew Vaughn really shines when he's focusing on airships, goat-men, and the occasional magical sword-fight with an dead man.<br /><br />Despite the scattered nature of the plot, Vaughn directs with a smooth, sure hand, and he sprinkles plenty of comic relief through it -- Captain Shakespeare dancing in drag, or the Greek chorus of murdered princes. And the dialogue avoids fantastical pomposity by being just as tongue-in-cheek (\\"Nothing says \\"romance\\" like a kidnapped injured woman!\\")<br /><br />Cox makes an excellent wide-eyed, slightly blinkered country boy, who turns from a bumbling suitor to a strong young hero. Danes isn't quite as ethereal as one would expect Yvain to be, but she gives a solid performance, and Miller is perfect as the snotty, shallow Victoria.<br /><br />But while the younger performers are solid, the veterans are absolutely brilliant. Pfeiffer is hilarious, chilling and pouty as the constantly frustrated witch, and De Niro steals the show as a cuddly, twinkly-eyed gay pirate who pretends to be brutal. And Peter O'Toole and David Kelly have brief but brilliant appearances.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is exactly what the title suggests -- sparkling, funny, wry, and just deep enough to be entertaining.

0307346609|2.0|I must admit that the high ratings of this book now make me hesitate to try the other highly-rated zombie books here on Amazon.  First, I am a huge zombie genre fan (I love the 28 Days Later movies), and I was excited to read this book.  It started off fairly promisingly, but it seems the author ran out of ideas about half way through, and every survivor's story turned into a miniature morality play where greed, pollution, or hubris was the cause of the people being eaten by zombies.  It got repetitive and boring, and I had to force myself to finish it.  I'm going to have to take \\"zombie ratings\\" with a larger grain of salt, methinks.  Try \\"I Am Legend\\" for a better zombie read.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|This is just a GREAT CD to have in my collection.  Stacey Kent is a blessing!  I do hope that anyone reading this review will order a copy of \\"Breakfast on the Morning Train.\\"  If for no other reason than to enjoy such fantastic renditiions of \\"Hard Hearted Hannah\\" and my personal favorite, \\"What a Wonderful World.\\"  What a WONDERFUL delight this CD is!
B00003CWPL|5.0|It's either a testament to this films' artistry and/or a very disturbing & possibly psychotic kink in my nature--but I find ERASERHEAD to be fascinatingly wonderful. The strange vision presented in the film is not so much anti-social as a-social.<br /><br />It's is unique, to say the least.<br /><br />ERASERHEAD defies a definitive description because it taps into the inner realm of the viewer--and no two inner realms can ever be the same.<br /><br />To me the high achievement of David Lynch in his film is that he works with unknown, possibly untrained actors (in some cases anyway) & guides them to produce outstanding performances based on extraordinarily nebulous characters in an even more nebulous & totally bizarre script. In this respect ERASERHEAD brings to mind John Waters' POLYESTER or PINK FLAMINGOS--the main difference being that Water's films have a more-or-less recognizable, if campy, scenario. Even Divine's 300-lbs. drag impersonation is accepted as \\"reality\\" within the context of the script & its comic format. ERASERHEAD, on the other hand, has no familiar landmarks, not even the illusion of reality, and no place to get your bearings.<br /><br />But then who needs bearings--for 89 minutes, at any rate?<br /><br />And those 89 minutes are important, because the film ends exactly at the right moment. Any longer & it might have been expecting too much suspension of belief from the audience.<br /><br />My favorite moment in the movie is the way bizarre cabaret scene performed by The Lady in The Radiator (picture left). Despite the grotesque setting, the actress turns in a truly mesmerizing & emotive performance. If there is a sort of illusive \\"meaning\\" in the film, then it is symbolized in this scene: if you can understand the scene, then just maybe you can understand the whole picture.<br /><br />I don't pretend to understand either, but I love trying.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that could be a once-a-year thing, having a little party, friends over & popcorn--or whatever.
B000WO251Q|5.0|At first I was upset reading how the story was going to end in the beginning of the book. I soon was hooked and wanted to see how it was going to end, if they weren't going to end up together.  When he met Savannah I didn't originally like her character because of the whole religious thing. I did think Savannah was unrealistic and originally did not like her character. I have to admit when the storyline changed in the end and Savannah ended up being different than she was originally, I liked it. It was good that we got to see how life changes you and all your best plans can be unrealistic when life comes along.     The ending was satisfying although heartbreaking. I loved this book. I think it speaks to a wide variety of audiences that love does not always go as planned and people change. Ideally I would want to be together, but I guess I am glad they are not for the purposes of this story.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Recently discovered JJ in the last year or so...now I have all his CD's with this one being the latest purchase.  His music and talent is great.  I was not disappointed at all.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|This cd is an alright cd but it didnt make me get up and take notice. Serj does have a great voice but he doesnt seem to know where to go with it. He starts off a melody then has a brief run in with System of a Down's early days before going back to singing. I listened to the whole cd and really didnt find it to as good as I hoped.     I really cant understand why singers for bands go solo. For years now singers have left bands to pursue solo careers or anther band; What they do it for- artistic freedom or money? Alot of singers in bands shouldnt go solo because it barely works out for them. The only singers I can think of that spilt from his band and made a great impact would be The Beatles minus Ringo Starr and Corey Taylor. Ha, can you believe I put Taylor in this list? Anyways, great cd but not alot different from System of a down.

I highly recommend picking up the Ultimate Edition rather then the \\"extreme\\" edition.

B00000IREA|4.0|Talk about campy sci-fi movies, this is probably number one!  This 1968 film stars Jane Fonda and is directed by her husband at the time, Roger Vadim.  It was taken from a popular French comic book.<br /><br />The movie begins as 41st century astronaut, Barbarella (Fonda) does a zero gravity strip-tease.  When she finishes (credits are blocking the good parts for the guys), the President of Earth comes on the screen and tells her she must look for lost astronaut, Dr. Durand Durand in the galaxy.  You could see where the 1980s pop-band, Duran Duran got it's name from (slightly spelled differently), they even had a song called \\"Electric Barbarella\\" to honor this movie.<br /><br />Barbarella lands on the planet Lythion and tries to locate the evil Dr. Durand Durand.  She encounters scary children that force their \\"Chucky\\" looking cannibalistic dolls on her that tear her fishnet stockings and draw blood.  She is told by the catchman (a person who catches bad children) that Durand Durand is probably in the city of Sogo.  She asks what she could do for the catchman since he gave her this bit of information, he told her he wanted to have sex with her the old fashion way, not by the way their psychocardiograms align, so she does and then off to Sogo.  She crashes her spaceship shortly after and then meets Pygor---a blind winged-angel that she also has sex with.  She convinces Pygor to fly her to Sogo, where she finds a new sin is invented every hour. Barbarella discovers a sex organ-like instrument called the Exessive Machine, where an accomplished person, in this case, Dr. Durand Durand himself, can drive a victim to death by pleasure.  She also encounters a lesbian queen (Anita Pallenberg) who, in her dream chamber, can make her fantasies take form. The weirdest encounter was a group of ladies smoking (just think of the 1960s) what appears to be a huge bong where a guy is in the glass globe part of the bong floating around. Barbarella asks what they are smoking and the ladies reply, Essence of Man. She nods and continues smoking.<br /><br />For its time the special effects might have been something, but to nowaday standards it is reminiscent of Plan 9 from Outer Space.  The plot was not the easiest to follow, I was lost a couple of times.<br /><br />This movie is definitely not one of my favorites, but I appreciated how this film was innovative for its time.  And for that it deserves you to watch it.  If you like sci-fi with a little bit of horror and sex thrown in, then this 1960s movie is for you.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is my favorite animated movie since the Lion King. Hopefully they will start making increasingly more movies with originality and great writing like this.
B000GT4H0Y|3.0|Outside the story, the movie looks well made with some clever effects.  Unfortunately the story was weak at best.  Might be better to watch this movie with the sound off.
B000OY8NII|5.0|My 13 year old techie son and 17 year old daughter loved watching this with me. There are a couple of bedroom scenes which caused my modest son to turn his head away but 95% is funny and clean as a whistle. We really enjoyed it. I can't understand how anyone could call the show \\"cheap looking\\" -- the scenery is lush and gorgeous, the town is idealized Americana, and I'd love to run away to Eureka if I could.
B000VZUWZW|1.0|After watching the preview, I find myself hoping the screen writers stay out on strike, permanently.  A painful reminder that writers are those folk who never willingly took a science class.<br /><br />Did not sit through the entire showing.  Awful stuff.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I watched to movie last night and it was great. Visually stunning, good story, great animation, and pretty fun all around. I was a bit surprising that gun fire was used a bit in the early parts of the movie, but it was like old Bugs Bunny-Elmer Fudd type guns stuff; not a big deal to me. I haven't looked at all of the Blu-ray extra features, but seeing as there is a lot on this disc it looks like this is an excellent release from Pixar/Disney. As far as the disc themselves go, it worked perfectly with my PlayStation 3 and came with a nice paper slip cover as most Disney Blu-ray disc are coming with now. It is easy to suggest this to people of all ages looking for a good animated movie.

B000ULLNDW|5.0|This disc is a real treat for Carole King fans as the mini-lp replica sleeve design (mlps)has been very well executed and is certainly one of the best mlps designs that I've seen.  The cardboard is of the thick and good quality and the gatefold design opens up to reveal a very faithful replica of the original vinyl sleeve.  Also included is a fold out poster of a tapestry that has all the lyrics on the flip side as well as another insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  There are two bonus tracks that are also very good and adds to the overall enjoyment of the disc which doesn't always happen when it comes to bonus tracks on other albums.  The remastering job done here is also very good as the sound quality overall is excellent too.<br /><br />After listening to music coming on close to 4 decades already, I'll have to say that there are very few albums that come under the \\"great\\" category and guys, this is definitely one of them. The heartfelt emotion that's delivered here can only be done by the great songwriter herself who clearly feels and identifies with what she has written. Every single track here is a masterpiece of composition and performance which makes me wonder why Carole King didn't just start out singing her own material. I guess the answer is that it's much easier to get passive income getting royalties while somebody else does all the hard work of practicing and touring but boy does Carole have a great voice though. Tracks that are so hearfelt that it's as if Carole is singing directly to your soul when you listen to this disc.<br /><br />Why this album is not regularly listed as among the top-5 albums of all-time truly escapes me. This is a definite must-have in any music hobbyist's library. Extremely highly recommended.
B00006GA4C|5.0|Bands today have studio technology that can make the players superfluous. GFR recorded without anything more than distortion and 1 or 2 overtracks. Three members playing and singing their hearts out, and choosing to be as minimalist (pure) as possible. Put(any Seatle grunge band of 80's-90's)  in a 30 year old studio, take away the fatalistic lyrics, kill the triple multi-layered distortion and snobbery of what constitutes a real musician, insert never say die Western optimism, and you get GFR-truly a working mans band if ever their was one. It took incedible cajones to even play the huge venues they did knowing they weren't \\"A\\" players, just guys goin for it. The message comes through.
B000T1800C|5.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of The Doors' last and most cohesive album and certainly my favourite is a treat for fans.  The mlps design is very good and is very well put together.  Included is a 20-page booklet with an essay by the original producer and this 40th Anniversary version remixer, Bruce Botnick, and all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Bruce describes how this mix is the best one and the one that was intended all those years ago if only they had had the right equipment as the do now.  So who am I to criticise a mix done by the original producer with the surviving members of the band itself!  Although volume levels are lower than on previous versions, after a few listens, I have to admit that this is indeed the better mix with many subtle sounds surfacing that were not evident on previous mixes.  The remastering is well done and so the sound quality is really very good.  There are also two bonus tracks: \\"Orange County Suite\\" and \\"(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further\\" which are very good tracks and hence do not detract from the main material which tends to happen with bonus tracks on albums in general.<br /><br />This is my favourite Doors album because overall you can hear the maturity in terms of the level of composition as well as in the musicianship and of course because it includes my favourite Doors track, \\"Riders On the Storm\\".  Few things in life compare with putting that track on the car stereo while driving at night.  While there are a couple of weaker tracks such as \\"L'America\\" and \\"Hyacinth House\\", the rest of the album is filled with brilliant work.  The album starts out with the brilliant \\"Changeling\\" followed by the equally brilliant \\"Love Her Madly\\".  The Doors' work strikes me as truly unique as although there have been and probably will always be admirers of their work, I cannot say that I've ever heard any imitators that come close to their sound.  They are so unique and good at what they did that you could almost put them into a sub-genre all by themselves.  Very few acts in the history of rock music can lay claim to that.  Bob Dylan, the later Beatles work and Steely Dan immediately come to mind but The Doors surely ranks among them as genre standard-bearers.<br /><br />Good sound and good packaging makes this version of the great album highly recommended.into a sub-genre all by themselves.

B0002IU988|5.0|Alright,  First of all I was some what of a Creed fan despite the inperfections.  So I was abit sad when I heard they broke up. But then I hear Alter Bridge. From the very first demo song I was hooked. Once I bought the CD I found how truly great an album it really is. Tne emotion and skill that was put into these songs are far better than creed had ever done.    Now, My brother who hated Creed with a passion heard the CD in my car one day and was blown away. He was even more shocked when he found out it was former members of Creed. So he too bought and loves this album.   SO you don't need to be a Creed fan to enjoy this. It's great clasic rock with in-depth songs.  I cannot wait to hear what they come up with next.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|The is a wonderful film and story.  I myself thought that her love for medicine and helping people in the end won over her desire to devote her life spiritually.  Her fathers death was the moment she received the grace and courage to live her truth.  Just a sweet, sweet story and she was indeed torn.  I loved in certain parts of the film she kept getting tested.  Just when she thought she was getting closer to her desires for the Congo there would be something pulling at her or in the way. The insane asylum in Belgium where she was first sent (and then sent to watch over the ward of the most dangerous and seriously ill) would test the will of God himself.  Even once she got to the Congo she was sent to the European hospital..not in the lepper colonies and with the village hospital as she longed for with her huge knowledge of tropical diseases etc...her scare with TB, recuperation process and replationship with the Dr. was touching and enlightening for her and the viewer...just great.  I agree this was one of her best films and cannot imagine it being made today.  She was such a true genuine talent. Glad it is on DVD and I appreciate the other reviews with the information on the cinema history. It is a little on the long side, so it needs a big bowl of popcorn! :)
B000WSL5Y0|5.0|As a native Bostonian, albeit one who moved out of the area 21 years ago, I watch all these Boston-based adaptations to see how well the filmmakers get the essence of the place.  Even in the best ones, there's always one thing to distract and annoy.  In the Damon/Affleck breakthrough 'Good Will Hunting,' there was Robin Williams' awful accent (to think he won a Oscar for that).  In the otherwise excellent 'Mystic River,' there was Laura Linney's beyond-bad (reaching into unintentional comedy) 'effort.'<br /><br />Well, you can rip up the record books, because Ben Affleck has conceived and directed what will forever be the unimpeachable standard of Boston-based films.  'Gone Baby Gone' is terrific in every imaginable way - twisty but tight storytelling, believable characters positively steeped in blue-collar Boston street culture, and an ending that will keep you talking and debating long after the lights come up.<br /><br />It's incredible that this is Affleck's first shot at directing.  I really thought this guy had completely lost his way.  It had to be getting to him, watching Matt Damon make these series of great career choices while he Gigli-ed and Bennifer-ed his way into something of a national punchline.  But marrying Jennifer Garner and 'Gone Baby Gone' count as back-to-back home runs.<br /><br />There's another great performance by Ed Harris (what's up with the hairpiece though - it wasn't required & really distracts).  Amy Ryan should get an Oscar nomination - hard to believe she's from Queens, not Dorchester. Casey Affleck will turn out to be a better actor than his brother - credit Ben for recognizing that and giving Casey the role.  This isn't nepotism.  Casey brings an understated, steely confidence to the role that becomes more believable as the film goes on.<br /><br />Okay, this review isn't complete without singling out the most amazing performance: Jill Quigg is a Boston resident who talked her way into a role (Ben Affleck had been looking for locals to inflect the movie with rich Boston character).  In a small role, she plays Helene's best friend, Dottie.  I can't do her performance justice here.  It's jawdroppingly good.<br /><br />Various professional reviews about the movie mention that Amy Ryan had a tape of Quigg on her iPod & played it over and over to get the essence of her character, Helene.  It worked.with rich Boston character).  In a small role, she plays Helene's best friend, Dottie.  I can't do her performance justice here.  It's jawdroppingly good.

B00000K0DV|4.0|The New York Ripper is probably the most brutal movie in Lucio Fulci's career; The New York Ripper doesn't feature the gore Fulci was known for at the time, but this is probably his most sadistic movie. The New York Ripper is gory at times, but that isn't what makes it brutal; the kill scenes are very disturbing at times. The scene when the killer slices the girl up with a razor is cringe worthy. The glass bottle to the crotch is deeply disturbing.<br /><br />Like I said the violence here is quite brutal in other Fulci flicks the gore is over the top, but in a good way it makes the movie even more fun. It's hard to take the violence too serious when the blood starts shooting out in what seems like gallons. But The New York Ripper on the other hand has a real sadistic maybe even mean spirited violence the gore is plenty, but nothing like movies like Zombi 2 or The Beyond.<br /><br />Horror films are often labeled misogynistic and it might be hard to argue against that with The New York Ripper. Do I think that is the case with the movie? No not at all, but the violence against the women in this movie is so raw it's hard to argue that the movie isn't.<br /><br />The New York Ripper is one of Fulci's movies that sparks great debates among his fans; some think it's one of his best others say it's one of his worst. As much as I enjoyed The New York Ripper it's not without its flaws. The biggest problem is the sexual content of the movie. Sex in movies does not bother me at all, but here it just seems it was thrown in there to help reach more of an audience. Honestly when all was said and done a lot of these scenes were not needed and could have been edited way down.<br /><br />None of the sex scenes really add to the plot and had they been cut down I think The New York Ripper would have moved at a much better pace, but hey it's in the movie and nothing can be done and at least the women are hot. I don't mind sex and nudity, but in my opinion it does sort of slow the pace down.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Gianfranco Clerici, Vincenzo Mannino, Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti. The screenplay is your basic Giallo nothing here really stands-out, overall the script isn't bad, but I don't think we watch Fulci flicks for their brilliant screenplays. All the writers here should be known to fans of Italian cinema. Clerici and Mannino were writers on House by the Edge of the Park and Clerici was a writer on the infamous Cannibal Holocaust. Lucio Fulci and Dardano Sacchetti have teamed up quite a few times and I have always been pleased with the outcome. The New York Ripper had a good writing team, some things work and others don't.<br /><br />As director Lucio Fulci, is able to craft some solid scenes and create some pretty good tension. Like I stated earlier in my review the sex scenes do slow the pace down, but Fulci does a pretty good job here and this one is mostly coherent. Often in 80s Fulci things sort of happen with little or no explanation. But, for the most part The New York Ripper makes sense. This really was Fulci in mean mode; the kill scenes are very brutal. Like I said the gore level is good, but nothing like some of his other flicks, but what they lack in gore they make up for in brutality.<br /><br />At the time this movie was made, New York wasn't the safest city. It was filled with crime and a lot of sleaze and Fulci is able to capture all that in this movie. What I think is the biggest problem with The New York Ripper is the killer talking in a duck voice and even quacking like one. Lucio Fulci manages to put together some great moments filled with tension, but than the quacking starts and well it's a tension killer. It's hard to take a killer talking in a duck voice too serious and when he starts quacking it can be difficult to keep a straight face. The reason for this is explained at the end and it does make sense, but it is a bit silly and does break up the tension.<br /><br />The New York Ripper is also kind of tragic; the finale is quite sad and despite some of the silliness The New York Ripper is a brutal movie and the final minutes are quite tragic, but very fitting.<br /><br />In closing, despite the flaws of The New York Ripper it is a solid Giallo; while not the best movie of Fulci's career it's an enjoyable one. If you are a fan of Lucio Fulci it's worth checking out. But those of you who don't like his work, I highly doubt this movie will change your opinion of him.silliness The New York Ripper is a brutal movie and the final minutes are quite tragic, but very fitting.

0375423877|3.0|Overall the book was a pretty good detective story and I really enjoyed all the many obstacles Mma. Ramotswe had encountered. The main weakness and the one reason why I gave this book only three stars is that there wasn't really a main point to the whole thing. Normally there is always a purpose the author tries to accomplish in the book, but there wasn't. As the book went along, the main charater had been hired for several different jobs, but the book didn't focus on a specific one. There was a couple of times when I thought that one might be important throughout the book, but ended up not being anything. If the author would've made a specific case end up being a huge part of the book, then I thought that the book would be a five star. Overall, I enjoyed it and it was a easy read if looking for something not so complicated.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|Sunshine was alright.  In many ways it was very good.  The production design was staggering, the story was genuinely original, the music was powerful, the script was intelligent, and the special and visual effects were simply gorgeous.  Almost elegant.  As a result, even though the acting left something to be desired, this movie had the potential for a substantial cult following, if not comparison to such films as Solaris.  Additionally, though the film did have a number of superficial similarities to other science-fiction films, that really shouldn't be that surprising since they're all set in the same universe.  Lets face it, there are but so many logical ways to build a spacecraft.     But then there's that darn third act and it all sort've goes sideways. Suffice it to say, the story becomes much less science-fiction oriented and more violent, which is unfortunate since the director had managed to sell me up to that point that it was in fact possible to make a tense science-fiction film without having to resort to using malevolent actors.     And yet, I still find myself wanting to like Sunshine.  Its script, attention to scientific detail and polished special effects are of a caliber that transcends the other more mediocre entries into the genre, such as Red Planet.  It's just too bad the story choked in the endgame.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Perfection was struck when they made this movie. Why they even bothered with the awful remakes is beyond the comprehension of even the wisest of people. I'm not going to go into a plot detail. One reviewer described Thomas Mara Jr. getting his oversized football helmut Christmas morning. I tried going to every site possible and can find no mention of that scene. Besides that scene doesn't sound all that monumental. Now if that beautiful, throat lumping, eyes welling up, I hope everyone in the room is watching the movie and not me scene with the little Dutch girl was cut, THAT would be a far better reason to boycott this dvd. But they haven't. It's all there. With all the bonus features this 2 disc version is a must have. If you have the previously released DVD the cute 5 minute trailer is known as (promotional spot) on this set. Disc 2. There's a nicety to having both the colorized and original Black & White versions. I'm comfortable watching either one. I am amazed and disgusted as I find a growing number of morons oops! (I mean people) who flat out refuse to watch anything that's in Black & White. No matter how good it is. I suffered through the 1997 remake with my then wife who totally refused to watch this version simply because it was in B&W. The color version looks a little drab. A little adjustment of the tint and color settings from your TV may be necessary for the best possible picture. I know alot of people are upset because a classic B&W movie has been tampered with. Chances are, maybe the filmakers wanted to film this in color, but Fox studio exec Darryl F Zanuck did not grant a large enough budget. After all this is a Christmas movie. Who wouldn't want to display all the wonderous colors of Christmas. If this dvd was offered as a colorized version only, I would still buy it. Why? Because I could always turn the color completely off on my TV and instantly have the classic B&W version. I dread the thought of movies being colorized just to draw in knuckleheads who didn't have the respect for the classic films in the first place. Yet I'm curious as to what would something like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein look like in color. Wow! Sorry about the tangent. This is a great movie colorized or not.

B00005JO5L|3.0|The colossal failure of \\"Cruising\\" in 1980 should have been easy to predict. When you make a story about extreme taboo topics (Gay SM murders) and couple it with a bizarre, disjointed script, then outright refuse to make a linear story out of it (I could never figure out why the killer always seemed to be a different person with the same creepy voice), then you arrive with a film that hardly anyone in 1980 would sit through.<br /><br />Ironically enough, one of the most controversial points to the movie now seems almost nostalgic. The seedy SM underground bars like The Cellblock or The Anvil that used to inhabit lower Manhattan's Meat Packing district are a memory now, replaced by nightclubs, condos, yuppies and the locations of a bunch of \\"Sex in the City\\" shoots. The notorious Lure Bar, the final and long gone holdout of this era, was even used as a \\"Sex in the City\\" backdrop - with little or no controversy attached. How things have changed.<br /><br />That makes the \\"shocking\\" hyper-sexuality of the bar scenes somewhat bemusing. Yes, in the \\"Boogie Nights\\" mania of the late 70's, prior to AIDS, skyrocketing property values and Rudy Giuliani, these playspaces and these activities did happen. It was underground, wild, crazy...and as William Friedkin saw it, a perfect backdrop for a crime mystery. Al Pacino (who has professed his distaste for the final cut of \\"Cruising\\" and is conspicuous in his absence from the DVD extras) was keen on taking a part that would be unconventional and nonconformist. So he donned a leather jacket and took the role of Steve Burns, a young undercover cop who fits a \\"common victim\\" profile.<br /><br />Thus begins a peculiar game of cat and mouse, with Pacino trying to pass as a gay leather daddy and showing all the signs of a conflict with his inner closet. Which, in the bizarre ending to this movie, is left a hanging question...especially with the little piece of business concerning Karen Allen. There are some bits of unintended humor, like when Powers Boothe attempts to explain the Hankie Code to Pacino and when an irritated bar patron snaps at Pacino about flagging the wrong color. But for the most part, the focus on seediness and the disconnected pacing of the script keep most of \\"Cruising\\" at a level where the suspense is at a minimum.<br /><br />In fact, the most revealing thing about this \\"deluxe\\" DVD (hard to define it as such, since there has never been a \\"basic\\" edition) is the pair of featurettes. In \\"The History of Cruising\\" and \\"Exorcising Cruising,\\" Friedkin and others dissect what they were trying to accomplish with \\"Cruising\\" and why they didn't look at it as a gay movie. They also partially explain the ambiguity with the killer's many faces/one voice trick (giving it an almost horror/supernatural bent, and considering [[ASIN:079073804X The Exorcist]], hardly a stretch). A former detective who was a consultant for the movie explains the presence of the musclebound cop in the jock-strap, among other plot points. The interviews with minor cast members almost 30 years later are interesting as well.<br /><br />The features (in particular, \\"Exorcizing Cruising\\") also address the controversy. While I can see the point that there was a dearth of gay characters in the movies and therefore a gay serial killer made lots of folks virulently uneasy, I was personally more insulted by [[ASIN:B000VTJRW2 The Boys in the Band]] than \\"Cruising.\\" Even with the backdrop a serial killer movie, the men in the bar scenes are looking like they are hitting the bars because they belong there and are enjoying themselves; as opposed to the bitter, regretful losers of TBITB cast of closet queens.<br /><br />What the commentaries don't address is why \\"Cruising,\\" which is a dynamite movie for atmosphere and grit, was ultimately such an incoherent mess. There's a great soundtrack featuring The Germs, Mink DeVille and John Hiatt when he was punky, a twist from the usual disco-drenched music of any movie tagged as \\"gay.\\" And finally, there is Pacino. Looking for all the world like a damaged and conflicted man, the ambiguity of the final third of \\"Cruising\\" (Is he gay or not? Is Burns maybe a killer, too? Who is that leatherman going into the bar at the end?) made for an unsatisfying finale. More a curiosity now than a controversy, \\"Cruising\\" is now a strange look into a time long passed.<br /><br />Incidentally, given the notorious bent to \\"Cruising's\\" history, it is interesting to think about some of the movies after that bear a resemblance. [[ASIN:B000MGBM2C Hard]], [[ASIN:B000BBOUW2 8MM]] and even modern horror movies like [[ASIN:B000UNYK3A Hostel]] or the [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] movies owe a debt to \\"Cruising.\\"ll the world like a damaged and conflicted man, the ambiguity of the final third of \\"Cruising\\" (Is he gay or not?

B00000425L|5.0|Ashkenazy is one of the most respected preformers of Rachmaninoff. Granted that he is somewhat of a reserved performer, and not as lyrical as Horowitz. He is a deliberate and straightfoward player that can handle pieces of weight and import. This has special value with the sonata included on this disc (granted that Horowitz actually helped write it, but I like this interpretation, too). Not every prelude interpretation is a tour de force (and EVERYONE has their own opinion on the c-sharp minor), but I count this recording as a must-have because of it's comprehensive nature and the fact that 80% of the preludes are beyond critique (if one lays personal preference aside). You will not find another recording of this nature to beat it.

B000Y179KO|3.0|First, the good news: There is enough good material here for a good Eagles single disc release. The bad news: The Eagles released a two-disc set. Sorry, but with only two or three exceptions, disc one sounds like an afterthought - cutting room floor material pieced together to fulfill a recording contract. Most of the songs on disc one would never have made it onto an Eagles album during their prime, not because the songs are poorly performed or produced, but because they are just not very good songs. For example, the guys of old would never have been caught dead including what sounds like a bad crossover mix with KC and the Sunshine Band, but they sure included Fast Company this time around. And I'm afraid Glenn's solo contributions to disc one, No More Cloudy Days and You are Not Alone, only illustrate how limited Glenn's musical palette is when he's left to his own devices. But there are highlights on disc one: How Long is an instant classic that would have been at home on the very best Eagles albums from their heyday. And they don't milk it, which makes it even better. It is a real toe-tapper that leaves you wanting more. Do Something is a really good song. But it could have been even better if the guys had shared lead vocal duties - I wish Tim and Don and/or Glenn had traded verses on this one. Busy Being Fabulous, which one could easily imagine being included on Hotel California, rounds out the gleaning from disc one. Disc two is much better overall, bearing in mind that this supposed to be an Eagles album. The title track is the kind of bitter, blow-hard diatribe that we have come to expect from Don - but it is also a pretty darn good Eagles song, and not too long despite its running time. I Dreamed There Was No War is filler and I have no idea why it was included unless it was just for the statement of the title itself. Although the rest of the songs on disc two are ok, the highlight in my view is Joe's Last Good Time in Town. It's catchy, it rocks, and it adds a bit of tongue in cheek humor to what is otherwise an album that takes itself way too seriously. It also seems to take a snide stab at answering the question: Where the hell have you guys been for 28 years? Last Good Time and How Long are my favorite songs on this release, followed a few lengths behind by Do Something. In my view, the guys would have been better off releasing a good 60-70 minute single disc instead of adding a second disc of less than Eagles quality material. But I absolutely applaud them for the unique distribution approach and for making this music very affordable for the masses.

1594489505|5.0|Like his first novel, \\"The Kite Runner,\\" Khaled Hosseini's \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" spans for the most part a period in Afghanistan's history marked by the demise of the monarchy in 1973 and ending some 30 years later.  There is a generational aspect to both novels, with the first centering on Amir and Hassan and ending with Amir taking in Hassan's son Sohrab as his own (after Hassan's death), and the second on Mariam and Laila and ending with Laila expecting a third child, hoping that it will be a girl, and planning to name her Mariam after her late friend.  With both novels, you get a slice of Afghan life.<br /><br />Because no characters repeat, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is not really a sequel to \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  However, it does complement the first in that it tells the story from a woman's perspective while \\"The Kite Runner\\" tells its from a man's.  For this reason, I feel that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is the more poignant of the two.  Both are moving, but \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is especially gripping and would make for a terrific film.<br /><br />Soon after the fall of the monarchy, life becomes increasingly difficult for Afghan women, and under the Taliban regime, it reaches its nadir.  No formal education, no freedom of movement or work outside the home, cruel penalties for the slightest offense, etc.  That both Mariam and Laila maintain their dignity despite overwhelming adversity is a testimony to hope and to the resilience of the human spirit.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" will evoke a full range of emotions and kindle a compassion for the Afghan people as they struggle to rebuild their war-torn nation.

B000WM725C|4.0|I was a skeptic when I saw this listed.  Neil's website and various fanatic fan sites didn't have any mention of this.  I decided to take a chance hoping I wouldn't get ripped off.  The cd label, Immortal, is somewhat suspect maybe because I never heard of it and I've been following news of Neil fairly closely ever since he made what seemed like  annual Archives comments which has been over a decade or more.      The 2 cd set sounds fantastic to my ears and the packaging is so lovingly put together.  It is the almost complete soundtrack of the Cow Palace  22nd of October 1978 show.  My rating of 4 out of 5 stars is mainly due to the exclusion of 1 song - Already One.    This puts Live Rust to shame with it's editing (more like butchering) to fit into one cd.  But a comparison between this and Live Rust may not be fair since Live Rust never claimed to be a complete show from one source.  Analysis on fanatic fan sites (hyperRust;humanhighway) show that Live Rust is a compilation of what - 6 or 7 different shows?  If Live Rust gets remastered and reissued on 2 cds and the missing music restored, I'll go for it but this will remain a very essential part of my collection.  When I have worn this 2 cd set out from numerous listens over the years, I hope it's still available on Amazon at it's present very reasonable price.

B000MRA5NS|1.0|I read all of Fleming's 007 books before they started to make movies of them.  When the novies started, they were not true to the books, but entertaining.  Of course, Sean Connery quickly became one of my favorite actors, and the best Bond.  Bond movies became more and more thrill packed, starting with Goldfinger, and Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan were good to very good at carrying on the vision of the great 007.  Casino Royale is NOT close to being a James Bond classic, and the new Bond is not 007.  The movie had no outstanding action scene(s), and Craig was not the suave, devil-may-care Bond of old.  He was a thug that was doing a poor imitation of the Borne movies.  While Die Another Day was not my favorite 007 flick, it beats this mess considerably.  My son, grandson, elderly neighbors and their grandaughter all saw this and had the same conclusion - the WORST Bond movie ever!!!  It needs to Die Today!

B000UAE7RW|5.0|This only gets better with repeated viewings and it looks great here.  There are nice documentary extras, but a commentary from Jack or Robert Towne would have been really sweet.  (A music only track for the great Jerry Goldsmith score wouldn't hurt either.)  The reason this film is so effective is that while it may pay homage to films past, nothing on screen references other pictures - certainly none of the performances.  People more familiar with Jack's more manic roles (which ones aren't?) may be surprised by how low-key yet dynamic he is here.  He's completely sensational, partly because his take on the 30s private detective is so original and distinctive.  And Faye Dunaway is the opposite of the femme fatale, hiding not her own dark character but her damaged, needy psyche.<br />The point of view is Jake's all the way through -- the camera's literally along for the ride.  But Polanski's gives two minute glimpses into Cross' and Evelyn's perspective when they're each at lunch with Gittes and the effect is startling.

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Awesome portrayal of battle tacticts that were invented and proven to be the best by the Spartan's. Zack Snyder is a great director proven through this movie. From the slow/still screen movements speed up to real time is a fantastic way of special effects for this movie.<br /><br />More battle's in movies should be shot like that. Great movie, highly recommend.
630460291X|5.0|I can't help but give this movie five stars. I've read some of the reviews about the building of a backstory making it dull. I'm definitely of a different view. I think building on the backstory of the main character, giving the villains and supporting characters their own interesting connections, twists, and intrigues, and the reflection on the crusades just gives the story that much more weight and, in my opinion, realism. Otherwise it would be just a classic everyday fairy tale, a la Disney's version of the legend.    And I agree with the editorial that Costner's lack of accent is a small distraction. Personally I think he fit the role just fine; I think that lightweight nonchalance about his acting serves well to keep the movie from bogging down and taking itself too seriously.    Mary Elizabeth Masterantonio was an excellent choice. She performs with a forceful confidence that really gives her character the strength to just light up the screen.    And if anything I would give the movie 5 stars for Alan Rickman's performance alone. He brings that wit and touch of goofiness to his role that creates a villain that's just a blast to watch.     In general, it was well-paced and well-balanced between fun and seriousness. And, unlike many Old World adventure-romance movies that Hollywood's been cranking out these days, it's relatively short.
B000I2J0W4|4.0|This movie is a classic, Stanley does it again. A must have for any Stanley K. collector. Perfect portrayal of the unconscious psycho mind waiting to be unleashed.<br /><br />Being trapped with nowhere to go, and being hunted is the worst nightmare to the human mind.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|Hi, I lost an election, and I just cannot seem to give up the attention of people, because I'm basically a tool who needs approval.  I know, let's tell everyone that the world is going to EXPLODE AND MELT AND DIE AND BAM BOOM HOT WEATER IN THE FEBRUARY AND NO WATER AND MELTING POLAR BEARS.<br /><br />Feeding off of fear must be a fantastically divine way to get your kicks.  Hey, America, buy this, but that, recycle this, recycle that.  To what end?

But hey, keep buying everything he tells you to, while he flies in an airplane and his son gets busted for whatever with whoever whenever.<br /><br />Basically, what it boils down to (no pun intended) is that humanity is not worth saving.  Don't think of the children, because, well, they're children and not worth thinking about.  Future generations won't care that you separated the paper from the plastics.<br /><br />Human beings are a cancer, an inexplicable, inexhaustible entity of consumption, excess, death and decay.  That's all, we're not even supposed to be here, we are a plague, from the lowliest bum, to the most well armed terrorist to the most noble kindergarten teacher.<br /><br />Don't stop global warming, don't recycle, don't bother differentiating between hybrid and SUV, because it's not going to matter.

All that said, I was never a Motley Crue fan, but having worked with many rock legends, I can say Nikki doesn't hide anything, he tells it like it is or in his case, as it was.  As a side note you will want to get the CD that was released to accompany the Book, well worth your investment. Plus as I understand it, all money made by Nikki is being donated to a charity in the L.A. area for runaway teens. This is an excellent book, only a shame the man had to die twice to get his story out.

B000VI6T6K|5.0|This is by far my favorite live Jimi performance--- far better than Woodstock. Every Hendrix fan deserves to own this one-- get it used if you must, and pay whatever you need to--just GET it!!!! It is simply THAT good!     Yes, this is the concert where he sacrificed his guitar by burning it. Everyone knows the famous picture with the flames rising from the guitar with Jimi sitting by (and you can hear the actual guitar buring on this CD.) Funny thing is, that is actually probably the LOWLIGHT of the this CD--- because the rest of the music is SO spectacular! Even though Jimi was not yet well-known in the States-- a few years from \\"legend\\" status (heck, Purple Haze hadn't even been released yet!) he is on the very tip-top of his game on every track-- and Noel and Mitch are tight, and show why they are one of the most undeservedly underappreciated rhythm sections in rock.     This is before his \\"psychedelic\\" phase-- what I call his \\"noise\\" phase--- and the songs here are actually well-crafted and executed SONGS. It is abolutely MUSIC, not screetching noise. It's sort of like Picasso, who had to learn to paint in the conventional way before inventing cubism. Here we see Hendrix playing spectacular rock/blues-- with a few signs of the psychedelic \\"Star-Spangled Banners\\" that were to come.     Jimi talks to the crowd between some of the songs, making jokes and telling stories about how The Experience came together. This is an added bonus, and you can tell by this little banter that Jimi was actually also a genuinely nice and funny guy-- besides being a guitar god.     But, when all is said and done, the music is what will stand the test of time. Take a listen--- then tell me I'm wrong!
B000URDEB0|5.0|Tuomas Holopainen is probably a musical genius. For certain, he's a gifted songwriter. It's refreshing that on \\"Dark Passion Play,\\" the first album with new singer Anette Olzon, elements of the \\"old\\" Nightwish are in evidence, as well as songs that take Nightwish in a different direction. It might be tempting for some to write off \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\" as not Nightwish, but the truth is that Nightwish is whatever Holopainen and the rest of the band want it to be. It should be remembered that Led Zeppelin effortlessly moved between heavy and light in their hey-day. No reason Nightwish can't do the same, especially with Olzon bringing a welcome rock sensibility to her vocals. She is simply brilliant on \\"Amaranth\\" and \\"Eva,\\" and her duets with Marco Hietala on \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and \\"The Islander\\" are effective because she never sounds like she's competing against Marco's voice. Perhaps the only misstep on DPP is \\"Master Passion Greed\\" with its overdosing guitars, but I'm sure even it brings headbanging joy to many fans. DPP emerges as the herald of a new era for Nightwish, one I am anxious to see evolve. Can't help but wonder where Tuomas Holopainen's imagination will lead him -- and Nightwish's fans -- next.
B0001XAPX8|3.0|THE HUMAN STAIN, from a novel by Philip Roth, is a handsomely produced independent film that strives hard to be a serious study of the effect racial prejudice has on an educated college professor (Anthony Hopkins) who retires when he is accused of using the word \\"spooks\\" to cover two of his students who have never showed up for class. In the course of the story, we learn that he himself is a black man passing for white and dealing with a secret he's kept in the dark for most of his life. It has an odd way of telling the story with frequent intervening and overlapping flashbacks that are sometimes hard to follow. Even odder is the casting of Anthony Hopkins as a black man who looks white.<br /><br />When he meets Nicole Kidman, we have two lost souls. She's running from her past, blaming herself for the accidental death of two children and running from a crazed ex-husband (Ed Harris) who threatens to break up her improbable relationship with the college professor. Kidman tackles a role beyond her scope as a trailer trash type who makes her living as a custodian cleaning up other people's messes. She is never convincing and makes the unappealing character both annoying and absurd, and has absolutely no chemistry with Hopkins. That he would be so attracted to her is highly improbable, given her sudden outbursts of insults and deep rooted anger.<br /><br />Ed Harris and Gary Sinise do well in underdeveloped roles and both have some very valid moments where they seem like real people instead of contrived characters. Too bad they don't play a greater part in the story.<br /><br />Production-wise, it's handsomely photographed in rugged winter settings but \\"the message\\" fails to get its points across with any subtlety. Wentworth Miller is appealing as the younger Hopkins, but it's hard to accept that the handsome dark-haired youth could turn into a man resembling the older Hopkins--and he's a bit of odd casting too.<br /><br />Kidman is forced to recite lines like: \\"Action is the enemy of thought,\\" which is about as meaningless as the priceless \\"love means never having to say you're sorry\\" (from LOVE STORY). She's a girl with no possessions who travels light, falls in love easily with an older man and later informs him that she has a crazed ex-husband. Both she and Hopkins have constructed their lives around a lie and it seems they deserve each other. Neither one becomes a sympathetic character we can really care about.<br /><br />An interesting failure, it tries to say serious things about race but too much of it is unbelievable and handicapped by unpleasant characterizations and implausible plot contrivances.is about as meaningless as the priceless \\"love means never having to say you're sorry\\" (from LOVE STORY).

B000OCXMAE|2.0|I wasn't a Linkin Park fan at all when One Step Closer was released as a single.  My roommate played Hybrid Theory so much, though, I started to really dig them.  When Meteora came out and I heard Faint on the radio, I went out and purchased the album the next day.  I listened to it for 6 months straight in my car.  I couldn't wait for Minutes to Midnight.  Over 4 years went by before it came out, so I expected something amazing.  Maybe that's why I hate it.  It doesn't hit with me on any level like the other two (especially Meteora) did.  It's just way too soft to be called Linkin Park.

B0009XT8YW|1.0|DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  This is incredible, it's the year 2007 and I bought a disc that I can't be ripped to my computer, and moreover, it can't even be PLAYED on my computer.  Yes, the sound is great, and much better than the regular CD, but if I can't get this onto my iPod, what's the point?  I had to spend MORE $ to get the sonically inferior regular CD.  This strikes me as being a deceptive practice, I'm surprised someone hasn't brought action against Columbia for issuing this unusable product.  If it were possible, I would have given this ZERO STARS.

The acting was fine, but it's totally dated in script and actions of characters. And it was a slow mover. Want to see it? Get the remake with Mark Wahlberg.

This film bordered on pretentiousness, like a blood sucking viper it drained the life out of me.  I'm not down with the whole \\"spidey\\" thing, and all the bouncing off buildings and loud thuds and bangs?  It's like does spider man drive a camaro? Wink, wink.  It's like, get a life and start on a new action hero like Green Lantern or anybody at this point.  When they make movies like Spider Man 3, they keep repeating the same actions and expecting different results at the end.  Both me and my roomate literally fell asleep through this, but at different times, me first and then him.  I don't need to see the rest of the film, you couln't PAY me.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|As with any band that hangs around for so long, I keep thinking, \\"How much longer can they possibly keep cranking out tunes that I want to listen to?\\" Well, apparently, at least for another release or two.    The entire album is really good!    A Different World: Classic Maiden, catchy.  These Colours Don't Run: Patriotic, fired up, what more do you need? Up The Irons!!  Brighter Than A Thousand Suns: Starts off slow and steady, builds into a crushing wave of sound that builds to a thundering cruncher of a heavy metal song. Can't play this one loud enough!  The Pilgrim: Another one with a classic sound to it.  The Longest Day: more good, classic stuff.  Out Of The Shadows: slow, powerful ballad.  The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg: it finally grew on me some, but it's my least favorite.  For The Greater Good of God: Powerful, epic ballad.  Lord Of Light: One that doesn't get much mention, but it's a great song.  The Legacy: Pretty good, a little long, but still enjoyable.
075640407X|5.0|After all the thousands of books i've read, its enchanting to find one that compels me, nay, flails me to finish in a single day.  While i am a fast reader, there are few books that keep me incapable of doing other necessary tasks such as working or eating or sleeping.  This is a must read.  The first 20 pages or so had me fumbling to keep track of names (which is my own fault as i can't remember a name given to me more than 10 seconds ago) but good god everyone should read this.  why?  because i'm a selfish bastid who wants to find out how this ends and if people don't buy enough copies i'll be left with no other options than to track mr rothfuss down to steal the unpublished works.  i might do that regardless.  wait till fall 08 for the next volume?!?

B000093BDX|5.0|This CD certainly brought me back to earlier days and truly fond memories of boyfriends past, dances long gone out of style and bikinis that now seem like full dress wear.  I had a chance to get together with my college dorm mates and as we traveled by car through the Smoky Moutains we sang to this CD.  Funny how we remembered the words, the hesitations and where we were when we heard \\"Good Vibrations\\" for the first time when we're now at a stage of life where memory isn't our best trait.  This is what you want to listen to on a long drive or with a group of friends to sing along with you.
B000W1V44I|1.0|Before I bought this album I read a Rolling Stone review of it in which the writer pretty much said it blew chunks.  I just figured they guy was being the typical anti-pop Rolling Stone reviewer but I quickly found out he's right.  I really want to like this album but can't. Beside the been there done that generic songs, thier voices are over synthisized. There are points at which I, a longtime BSB fan, can't tell who is singing any given line.  Over all i think this album is a totally pathetic attempt to make an album that sounds like Justin Timberlake's.  I Love the Backstreet Boys but I refuse to recommend an album that is so sub-par for them, just because they put it out.

B00005JPFH|3.0|Okay, let me start off saying there a waaaaaay too many villains in the film (by the way I'm reviewing the film not the DVD). Sandman, Goblin, AND Venom?! You gotta be kidding me! I think Venom is amazing (in the comics). But sadly, he barely had any screen time in the movie. Sandman was OKAY... Nothing special. The Goblin was pretty cool, and that's probably the best part of the movie. Another thing. There is too much drama. Come on!! This is a superhero movie not some romance movie. 3/4 of this movie is boring romance stuff between Mary Jane and Peter. That's about it with the bad stuff. The good things are the acting was good and the special effects were great. Overall about 3/5 to me.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I really like tool music a lot, i think it is one of the few bands that is worth listening, but this album is not that good, and i wonder, does this album took almost 5 years on the making?<br />When i first played it sounded like they made a pasticchio of previous albums songs and paste them on this one, then after 3 plays I just leave the album there and never almost played it since then, What happened tool?<br />The artwork is great, if if was not for that i would feel i just waste my money on this album. Lateralus was a masterpiece, this is... not that good. Still waiting for the live dvd, even if it comes in an envelope i will purchase it.

It plays like a wild frat party filtered through Andy Warhol.  Not that this is a bad thing.  But, you need to like weird, because this show just is not normal.  The songs are very addictive.  You will be singing Time Warp and Toucha Toucha Toucha Me long after the credits stop rolling.  Sit back, enjoy and laugh.  And if you feel like shouting comments at the screen like at the midnight showings, rock on.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|This is Dracula. I mean it. This is probably the best interpretation of the Count that's available. There are several reviewers that say that it's not accurate according to the novel, but it is....with some additions. You're always going to find changes in film. So those who get angry because so-and-so wore green instead of blue need to re-evaluate what they think it means to be a critic.<br />Yes, this version of Dracula gives the Count a backstory and it's an acceptable one at that. There is also a love story that relates. No it's not in the book, nor is it necessary, but as I've said in other reviews, when it comes to re-imagining a book for film, that's exactly what you need to do: RE-IMAGINE. Film should be an interpretation of the book. It's great to keep close to the story, but let's see some personal touches to it. If you want the ACCURATE version, see Louis Jourdan's version, but prepare for a snooze-fest.<br />Dracula is a beautiful film in all of the costuming, sets, and scenery. No complaints there. The make-up? Amazing. no complaints there either. The acting is great all around...almost. Unfortunately we are subjected to Keanu Reaves and Wynona Ryder, two of the worst actors in Hollywood. Neither can fake a British accent and they just don't ever really grow into their roles. Oldman and Hopkins steal the show with great acting all around.<br />The make-up for Dracula and for Lucy when she becomes a vampire, is amazing. It really makes the movie. Gore galore, almost perfect acting, great make-up and sets, and an original take on a classic horror story. Finally, this movie has been released with bonus features that it deserves. We get costume and set designs, commentary, making of, and interviews everywhere.<br />Aside from Reeves and Ryder's terrible acting, this is the best Dracula out their.

I have persuaded a few co-workers to go buy his CD, and of course thru [...].  Michael Buble just has a smooth and soulful voice reminiscent of Sinatra.  I throughly enjoyed this CD and look forward to a few more.  :o)

0451205146|4.0|With respect to the mission and those that served, any disparaging statements I might make about this book in the review are purely from a literary perspective.  The stories in this book exemplify such noble traits as bravery and loyalty.  Nothing could tarnish these evident characteristics in those that were there.    \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is much more than a tale of modern war.  It is a parable of leadership.  By the author's own writing, leadership failed to modify strategies and allowed an undisciplined militia to put American military in a precarious situation.  The most powerful military in the world failed to adapt.  It may be labeled as a matter of overconfidence.  This scenario exists in civilian life as well as military.  The lesson is almost certainly learned with lumps.    From a literary standpoint, I politely disagree with the idea that the book is written in a \\"fast-paced\\" style as other reviewers have stated.  I found the chapters to be too short to connect with members of the crisis.  This is unfortunate because these people are more than faces in the crowd.  At times, I even had to refer back in the book to remind myself about characters.  Obviously, this is not the type of book to read in one sitting.  The author did not accommodate this characteristic of his book.    Often times, books about modern war are difficult to read because the story gets lost in the details.  To a certain extent, I felt like Mark Bowden fell into this paradox.  This an important story, but I felt the storytelling could be improved.

1401300529|3.0|Having served two tours in the infantry in Korea during the War, and being a Korean War buff, I have a different view of the book than most of the reviewers. Unfortunately, the reviewers think that this book is about the Korean War. In part that is true but the real theme of the book is about how General Douglas MacArthur screwed it up.     The book is not a complete history of the Korean War as some reviewers have touted. It is anything but that. The book centers on the time period during which Gen. MacArthur was in command, both pre-war and until Pres. Truman relieved him of command. What little remains is more of an epilog very briefly describing the aftermath. That is why the book title is \\"The Coldest Winter\\" because it focuses on the disastrous defeat of the UN troops during the winter of 1950 as the result of MacArthur's bungling.     Because the book was billed as the most comprehensive history of the Korean War, I was lulled into reading it, only to be sorely disappointed. The first eight months of the War have been extensively covered in books and documentaries with the remaining 2 1/2 years given only cursory exposure, even though several major battles were fought during that period, so Halberstam doesn't expose any new ground. He just regurgitates material already written although he does it in an interesting fashion.     What I had hoped to read about was a thorough rendition of the history following MacArthur and the political decisions that colored the War and that was not there in the book for me. Not that I am not aware of them but a lot happened that is not generally known about and I hoped that Halberstam, with his reputation, would expose that material so that it become common knowledge to those studying or even interested in the War.      Some tout the book as telling the story of the historic escape of the First Marine Division from the Chosen Reservoir. It doesn't at all. The book tells how the Division Commander ignored MacArthur's orders innot racing to the Yalu and consequently the Marines were able make an orderly retreat, which the Army units were unable to do, but Halberstam provides almost no facts concerning the actual retreat, but when he does, the facts are not always correct. For example, the Chinese blew up the bridge between Koto-ri and Hungnam which crossed a narrow mountain gorge. Marine engineers then replaced it with a Bailey Bridge that was parachuted in. Halberstam says that it was the Air Force that dropped the bridge but I was on guard on the mountain above the gorge and I saw the bridge dropped from  Marine Corps Flying Boxcars.     The book is not even a complete history of the first eight months of the Korean War. Most of it is devoted to certain battles which illustrated the incompetence either of MacArthur or the officers under him. It is only a partial picture of that period of the War but what there is, is done in remarkable detail.     Halberstam doesn't not highlight some of MacArthur's bad decisions as much as they should have been. While he brings out that it would have been a better strategy if the Marines had by-passed Seoul after landing at Inchon and cut off the retreat of the North Koreans, he doesn't give that mistake the emphasis that it warrants because it was a decision that really prolonged the War. Those familiar with the War are very conscious of that but lay readers may not.      Nor does he allude to the fact that MacArthur violated a basic tenant of fighting a War and that is after winning a battle, it is a cardinal principle that you stop and consolidate before resuming the attack. His failure to adhere to that principle was one reason the UN troops were so vulnerable when the Chinese struck.      One lament I have about the book is that it falls well short of providing its readers of what happened after Gen. Ridgeway took command. The book describes how the Chinese were suffering horrendous losses but Halberstam fails to follow through. The UN counter offensive resulted in more heavy losses to the Chinese as they were pushed back into North Korea, particularly on the eastern flank. The entire Chinese front was in such danger or collapsing that the Chinese sought a truce and Pres. Truman's biggest mistake was to agree to the truce. Had the UN rejected the truce offer, the Chinese would have been forced to retreat deep into N. Korea and that would have been a propitious time for the UN to agree to an armistice. Instead, the war went on for over two more years ending on July 28, 1953. It ended then only because a major Chinese offensive designed to push the Marines back across the Imjin River failed and the Chinese again had run out of steam.      Despite its shortcomings , as a book about the blundering of Gen. MacArthur, it is superb. Unfortunately, it was written 50 years too late. MacArthur was a desk general from the start of WWII and remained so during the Korean War. He really botched up the defense of the Philippines but because the Americans needed a hero, he was made a hero instead of a goat. He should have been relieved of his command. He actually played a subordinate role in the Pacific War which was mainly run by the Navy but we all can be thankful for the atomic bomb, because if the Japanese had not surrendered, MacArthur would have been in charge of the invasion of Japan.

B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I've always bought Britney Spears new albums, even though the type of music she makes is usually not the type of music I listen to on a regular basis. I guess I just have an interest in her because we are both from Louisiana. Also her music is usually fun to listen to. Surprisingly, I think this album is one of her best even during the midst of the dramatic hoopla her life has become as of late. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are okay and somewhat gutsy, and the music is upbeat and great for playing in the club or etc. Still, I find some of the songs to be overly produced and lacking any actual music or singing. On a few it just sounds as if someone is making odd noises and Britney is grunting around (Example: \\"Get Naked\\"), so, yeah, not all that wonderful at all times. But the songs \\"Piece of Me,\\" \\"Radar,\\" \\"Freakshow,\\" \\"Hot as Ice\\" (my favorite), and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" are great and catchy songs.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I'm not going to spend a lot of time going over what people have already said - I'll keep this simple. For anyone who is considering purchasing this box set, and is a Lynch fan, my simple response would be: Buy it, and buy it now!! Yes, it took many years for fans to have the opportunity to own this amazing series on dvd, but it was well worth the wait. Every aspect of the box set has been handled the way it should have. From the amazing box that it comes in, to the amazing restored quality of each episode and all the fun little extras included. It was exciting to be able to rewatch this amazing series again in such great quality. As soon as you put the dvd in, you suddenly forget about all the time you waited for this series to be released in it's entirety in one amazing box set. Anyway, that's about all I'm going to say. I believe other reviewers have already supplied an ample amount of technical aspects concerning this release (which was well appreciated). So Lynch fans, and fans of this amazing series, take out your credit/debit cards, or go rob a bank, but get this set. Sit back with a great big cup of hot, black coffee, and a big slice of cherry pie and enjoy the series we've all been waiting for. Welcome back to Twin Peaks!

B000QQFKYE|3.0|Look, I love me some David Lynch. In my opinion, and the opinion of most of his fans, is that he is one of the few artists working in the medium of film. So, because of both this and the six year wait since his last film, the amazing \\"Mulholland Drive\\", I was more than hyped up to see his latest picture, \\"Inland Empire\\". And since it never got around to playing where I live, I had to wait around until it was released on DVD.  So anyways, what's my take on \\"Inland Empire\\"? Well...  \\"Inland Empire\\" is neither of of Lynch's best (it's not \\"Mulholland\\" or \\"Blue Velvet\\" or \\"Lost Highway\\") nor is it one of his worst (hey, anything is better than \\"Dune\\", right?), but the movie still feels a little like a placeholder, like Lynch is spinning his wheels a little bit, making what feels, at times, like someone trying to approximate a David Lynch film.  Now did get me wrong. If you are a David Lynch fan you will find plenty of stuff to like about \\"Inland Empire\\". The problem is is that because of it's three hour running time, you will also have to sit through a lot of sutff that doesn't work as well.  In fact, the biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it is far too long by about forty five minutes. The parts and scenes of this movie that work work as well as anything the man has done. But far too often scens just go nowhere and add to nothing.  Also, the film being shot on consumer digital video, peridocially the movie looks cheap, as if it was made by an upstart cable network.  But the film does work sometimes, and when it works it really works, and Laura Dern turns in what is by far her best performance to date. Add to that, the DVD is well put together with some cool extras (including over an hour of delted scenes, which should at least make fans happy that this movie isn't four hours long), and fans of David Lynch will need to add it to their collection.  Non-fans, however, should probably go and check out \\"Mulholland Drive\\" or \\"Blue Velvet\\" first.

B00003CXWV|2.0|As George Jung, Johnny Depp dons long blonde hair, a Boston accent and dark glasses. He portrays a man, who fearing poverty as a boy, makes all the wrong choices in obtaining wealth - first as a marijuana importer and finally as the kingpin in the rise of the cocaine empire.  Because he is a decent sort of fellow, not a monster, he is ousted by his Latin American contacts and winds up three times in prison, where he remains today, serving a sixty year sentence, until his planned release in 2015.    It isn't until 42 minutes into the two hour film that cocaine even enters the picture (suggested by his cell mate during his first stay in prison, once he learns of George's marijuana empire). Jordi Molla as the cell mate, Diego, delivers the best performance in the film. He is riveting in all of his guises as friend, confidante, opportunity provider, and ultimate betrayer.  Equally good in support are Rachel Griffiths as George's loud mouthed, bitter mother and Ray Liotta as his long loving and long suffering father - a poignant betrayal.    Unfortunately, the film has little value other than providing a history lesson in the rise of cocaine as an underworld marketing empire.  TRAFFIC is an interesting companion film to see.  Depp is most affecting in his last scenes, now sporting a paunch and dirty long hair, delusionally expecting his daughter's visit, an event which never occurs.    The problem with the film in my opinion is that it lacks tension - it is too matter of fact.  We never see George's ambition - he is always too calm about everything that happens to him, good and bad.  We care about him but we don't engage with his character.  It is a marketing lie to show Penelope Cruz as his co-star. She doesn't appear in the film until the second half and then only in a few scenes as his second wife, a foul-mouthed five letter word.    To sum up, it's a valuable history lesson but not great film.
0140120416|5.0|To supplement an introductory-level college Russian class I purchased this book along with a reputable dictionary and comprehensive book on the finer points of grammar. Truth be told, it has been one of the best investments I have ever made while studying foreign languages. I spent more than $100 for mandatory textbooks that were simply inferior to this one. In my opinion, this book should be the fixture of any Russian-language class.   The author presents a clear and concise view of the most important aspects; a self-motivated student or individual learner with this book would have a solid command of basic/intermediate Russian by the end. In conjunction with good professional instruction, this book makes a fine accompaniment for the student to hone their skills. However good it is, I would recommend investing in an audio CD or enrolling in a class to get the feel for pronunciation, tone, and speed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen, but I feel like too many people got on the boat too late.  Of course, FOX made a big mistake when it put Firefly on Friday nights and a worse mistake when it stopped airing the series.  I wish there was another season or two where they show the independence war or at least more about it.  Great show, great concept, and a great ship.

B000VSBX34|5.0|I just wanted to comment on a couple of points brought up in other reviews. Firstly, the original aspect ratio must have been FS because this 16:9 version often decapitates the band member at the top of the frame, as well as one of the opening credits. I guess \\"restored\\" means different things to different people. Secondly, the DTS sound is absolutely incredible. The music has never sounded this good. I'd repurchase the Beatles' catalog in DTS if it were available. As silly and juvenile as the movie is, the music makes it a worthwhile purchase.

Looking forward to being able to buy this on DVD - or just see it again somewhere.
0805079831|5.0|I thought I was well versed in public issues. Little did I know. This book and the detailed information presented startled me. In previous times I thought of the Milton Friedman school of economics (Univ. of Chicago)as primarily dedicated to a monetarist emphasis for economics. Now I know much better - my wife and I have been educated in areas of public policy we had been blind to. If there is a drawback to this book it is the overwhelming density of the material. Nevertheless it is essential reading if one is to understand the broad sweep of a fundamentally ideological and rigid approach to public economic systems. It eschews a mixed economy seeking to replace it with a totally market based system which essentially represents an economic law of the jungle - dog eat dog, having a few extraordinary winners and an overwhelmingly large number of losers. What is so frightening is that it has been and continues on the march.
0743270754|5.0|I am not the typical history buff, but you needn't be one to really find that reading this book is a truly enriching experience.  It goes into so much more depth than one would learn from a history textbook.    In particular, Doris Goodwin details the relationships between Lincoln and several Cabinet members - Chase, Bates, Seward, and Stanton.  Though it is a long book, I didn't find any significant portions of this book that seemed unnecessary.
B000E0LB7C|2.0|As a proud vinyl record collector, I find the Backhaus selection here on Amazon very lean indeed. I think it outrageous that his earlier UK Decca/London mono cycle is nowhere to be found. Some of the very first recording from 50-51 are a bit rough, but from 52 on the recordings are beautiful. PLEASE don't tell me that the mono/stereo debate is still going on in the 21st century! I, for one, have his complete stereo and mono cycles on vinyl and I think I'm the better for it. I've been hunting about for his LVB PCs with Krauss  in glorious mono........I'm not going to kind it am I????? It's a pity.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This movie is so cute and enjoyable.  It is hard to find fault with this film.  Sure there are a couple of parts that are kind of dumb, but it is a kids movie and it is positive, child appropriate and fun for adults too.  I remember watching this when it came out (long before I had kids - when I was in college).  I loved it then and now that I have kids, I still like it.  My memory of how good it was matched the current day experience.  Worth the money!!!

B000A28KDM|5.0|I was sitting with a friend the other day and we were talking about albums.  He brought up Revolver and, yeah, it was good for it's time.  But it wasn't until Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band that the Beatles began recording a series of albums that will remain a timeless entourage of genius hits. In fact, it was the first album of it's kind.  They not only achieved technical breakthroughs in how it was recorded, but the album was a concept approach to rock'n roll or should I say rock because with Sgt. Pepper that's what they started.  Little Richard and Elvis initiated rock'n roll, Bob Dylan innovated folk into mainstream society, and the Beatles incorporated the British invasion with their swingin' new sound until they captured something we take for granted today...a sophisticated approach to a style of music that not only makes you tap your feet uncontrollably it makes you reflect and think.  Don't get me wrong, love songs and party favorites will always be important in the world of rock but to tell stories and write poetry is what makes rock especially fresh and important.  The title track sets everything up as the Beatles give themselves a new identity from which to speak to their listeners.  With a Little Help from My Friends, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Getting Better...Lovely Rita, When I'm Sixty Four, A Day in the Life...you get the idea.  And those are just the classics you'll hear forever on FM radio.  She's Leaving Home, For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, and the other brilliant tunes remind the buyer that he or she has purchased something special. Even the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton were able to recreate a fantastic film version something else the Beatles managed to do well with their music (unlike Elvis who should have stayed away from that to remain relevant and possibly more creative, Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees probably should have stayed together after the Sgt. Pepper movie).  But I digress.  The simple fact is if you don't have Sgt. Pepper in your rock collection...you don't have a rock collection.  Buy it.
B000002J1Y|5.0|English prog rockers Yes released its sixth album Yessongs in May of 1973.<br />The Yessongs album was initially released as a TRIPLE LIVE ALBUM (3 vinyl discs) which was recorded on the band's Fragile and Close To The Edge tours of 1972.<br />The band consisted of lead singer Jon Anderson, bass player Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboard player Rick Wakeman and drummers Bill Bruford (who appears on two tracks) and Alan White (whom plays on the rest of the album).<br />Many critics complained that prog rockers were boring live but the concert stage was where bands like Yes, ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull prospered as this live album proves (I first heard the album in 1997 when I acquired this remastered CD).<br />We begin with the \\"Firebird Suite\\" Intro which then gives way into a killer version of \\"Siberian Khatru\\" which flies by at a speedy pace and explodes like a bomb. Killer start to the album. Next is a spirited rendition of the classic \\"Heart Of the Sunrise\\" which rivals the studio version and easily kicks the studio version's behind in a major way.<br />\\"Perpetual Change\\" is next and is better than The Yes album version and Bill Bruford does a stellar two minute drum solo showing why he is one of the world's greatest rock drummers. Next is \\"And You And I\\" which is arguably better than the studio version with Howe playing the acoustic parts on his double neck Gibson electric guitar.<br />Howe then shines on his acoustic solo \\"Mood For a Day\\" which is played on an acoustic guitar instead of the classical guitar which was used on the original. We then follow with Wakeman's stellar keyboard solo \\"The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth\\" which shows why Wakeman is one of rock's greatest keyboard players. Then we segue into a killer rendition of \\"Roundabout\\" which is arguably better than the studio version.<br />\\"I've Seen All Good People\\" is next with the Your Move section playing well before giving way into an almost spiritual feeling version of the All Good People section which rocks. Next is the medley of \\"Long Distance Runaround\\"/\\"The Fish (Schindlera Praematurus)\\" which has Bruford on drums. This track shows us why Chris Squire is the king of the Rickenbacker bass and one of rock's greatest bass players as he plays the bass guitar like it was his last gig.<br />Next is \\"Close to the Edge\\" which rivals its studio version. This performance has the band playing like this was their last concert. The I Get Up I Get Down section gets some drums added to the organ section (the pipe organ sounding section) and sounds like a religious experience here. Awesome version.<br />We then have a superb rendition of \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" which is five minutes longer than the studio version and White's drumming being more harder edged than Bruford's jazzier feel on the studio version. We close with a stellar version of \\"Starship Trooper\\" which is better than the studio version, especially the ending section.<br />Yessongs initially peaked at #11 on the Billboard album charts in 1973 and sold a million copies Stateside.<br />In 1994, the album was re-released as a digitally remastered CD and is miles ahead of the 1980s CD issue although an updated remaster is in high demand.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!on which rocks.

0375423877|4.0|Deep within Africa, the traditional figure of a proud Botswanan can be found, sitting behind her typewriter, sipping bush tea. Need a detective? She's the one you want. The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith is the story of Precious Ramotswe, the daughter of Obed Ramotswe. Although he died when she was still quite young, he left her a fair amount of money in order to start a business. A business of her choice. Without thought, Mma. Ramotswe quickly and successfully opened a detective agency. Despite the criticism she received about her gender, her firm rapidly became No.1.   Precious Ramotswe, born and raised in Botswana, was supported by her father's cousin for the first eight years of her life. Being a loving guardian, the cousin brought up Precious as if she was her own, and she turned out to be an honest, intelligent, somewhat perfect young girl. These traits stuck with Mma. Ramotswe and it appeared impossible for her to make a mistake.  Solving all of the cases brought to her with ease, she brings criminals to justice and gains the respect of many in the process.     This novel had many strong components. One factor that stood out would definitely be characterization. Through out The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, many characters are introduced and become an important part of the story. Instead of throwing them out in the open, Alexander McCall Smith does a fantastic job of developing them over time, in a way the reader can follow and understand them. Their feelings are foreshadowed then unfolded and their traits are beautifully described, until the reader feels as if they know them.  By the end of the story, it is impossible to dislike the thoughtful Mma. Ramotswe or loving Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Another strength found throughout the pages of this book would be imagery. All and everything is explained with great detail. This makes the novel even more enjoyable to read because the sentences flow beautifully together, putting vivid pictures inthe mind. The following sentence is an example of how the author goes about this. \\"Then there were the purple bougainvilleas which had been enthusiastically planted by the previous owners, and which had almost taken over by the time Mma Ramotswe had came\\" (McCall Smith 133). The only weakness that was visible to me would be the beginning of the book. It starts of with a series of flashbacks which were hard to follow and were a little slow to read. Also, the arrangement of the first few chapters was confusing because they were not in a chronological order.   The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency would most likely be a book that would appeal more to females. However, it was definitely appropriate for any age above ten. Anyone below that age would probably have a hard time grasping the words and find it hard to stick with. Overall, this novel makes a good read and is definitely worth the time.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Rush's 22nd album (not counting compilations) Rush In Rio was released in October of 2003 and was Rush's fifth live album.<br />First there was All The World's A Stage with a raw sound (1976), then Exit...Stage Left which was slightly polished (1981), followed by A Show Of Hands which was extremely polished (1989), and finally the excellent Different Stages (1998).<br />The thing all these aforementioned live albums had in common was that they were released at the end of the band's different phases, taking place at four albums apart each. Then comes Rush in Rio, many fans have whined and cried like babies and complained about another live album especially right after Different Stages was released.<br />Many griped that the live album was too raw for their own blood, if you want doctored live albums buy KISS' Alive discs and/or Duran Duran's Arena, Thin Lizzy's Live and Dangerous (all are studio albums with crowd noises).<br />Sound quality issues aside, Rush in Rio easily has the best setlist of all of the five Rush live albums without question. With the exception of Caress Of Steel (1975) and Hold Your Fire (1987), every album shows for at least one song somewhere in the performance.<br />The songs were well picked too. Of course you've got the band's big hits like \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Closer to the Heart\\" (which was not played on the whole tour save the shows in Brazil) and many others but I was glad to see songs like \\"New World Man\\", \\"The Pass\\", \\"Between Sun and Moon\\" and \\"Vital Signs\\" (these aforementioned tracks have not ever appeared on a live album until Rush in Rio). There's also songs from Vapor Trails (2002), many of which have added guitar solos and sound MUCH better live \\"Earthshine\\", \\"One Little Victory\\", \\"Ghost Rider\\" and \\"Secret Touch\\". The aformentioned \\"O Baterista\\" (a/k/a The Rhythm Method) is a classic Neil drum solo, comprising of parts of The Rhythm Method, and the drumming parts of Driven and Scars.<br />\\"2112\\" isn't the full version like on Different Stages, but it has the two key sections the Overture and Temples of Syrinx. \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" was awesome as well with Alex's humorous rant. I also love the \\"By-Tor\\"/\\"Cygnus\\"/\\"Working Man\\" medley that ends the Rio portion of the album (Between Sun and Moon and Vital Signs were from other shows on the US leg and are the bonuses not on the DVD whilst the DVD has bonus video features).<br />I forgot to buy this album on CD the day it came out as The Eagles' two CD Very Best of the Eagles and Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii The Director's Cut DVD was released the same day. It wasn't until my 28th birthday in January of 2004 that I got this album and was well worth the wait for me getting this album as it is Rush's best live album after Different Stages.<br />The album was Rush's first Gold album since Different Stages as the fans liked the live material moreso than the studio version of Vapor Trails.<br />Highly recommended!ferent Stages, but it has the two key sections the Overture and Temples of Syrinx. \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" was awesome as well with Alex's humorous rant.

B000002KET|5.0|English hard rock titans Black Sabbath released their fifth album Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in December of 1973 in the UK and January of 1974 here in the States.<br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was another great album by one of hard rock/heavy metal's two creators (the other being Led Zeppelin) and Sabbath started experimenting more with this album proving they were not just what became metal but a progressive hard rock band.<br />This was the band's first album on a small label which they would have issues with in England whilst the band were still with the major label Warner Bros here in the US (Warner Bros would be their home until 1987 for the US and Canada).<br />The album was recorded at Clearwell Castle in Wales and the songs were as eerie as where it was recorded. I first got this album on cassette in July of 1994 and was blown away by how great it was and the version of this album on the Black Box (8-CD/1-DVD set) buries the original Warner Bros CD and the 1996 Castle CD.<br />The opening title cut is one of the best pieces the band ever recorded with frontman Ozzy Osbourne wailing away like he was possessed by the devil on this song. \\"A National Acrobat\\" follows and is another great rocker. We slow things down a bit with guitarist Tony Iommi's acoustic instrumental \\"Fluff\\" (just like Laguna Sunrise on 1972's Volume IV proving Sabbath were not just all heavy metal and heavy songs). The first half closes with the killer proggish number \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\", which featured Yes keyboard player Rick Wakeman on keyboards on this track.<br />The second half beginner \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" is another great song. \\"Who Are You\\" sees Sabbath going into somewhat Floyd territory with this piece with the synthesizer use on this track. \\"Looking for Today\\" is another great song and the album's closer \\"Spiral Architect\\" is one of the band's best pieces ever and in fact the group performed this track on their 1997/98/99 reunion tours and the strings on this track still gives me a shiver to this day.<br />This album went Gold in no time flat here in the US and was another Top 20 hit for the band here in the US at a time when things like John Denver, James Taylor, The Carpenters and Carole King and so forth dominated music.<br />Highly recommended!day.

B0000027I6|4.0|Former Pink Floyd bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters released his third post-Pink Floyd solo effort Amused to Death in September of 1992.<br />Amused to Death was over five years in the making due to his feud with his ex-bandmates on the rights to the Pink Floyd name amongst other things. Roger's third solo album's sound was a return to the sound of his tenure with Pink Floyd unlike his two 1980s works (The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking from 1984 and its 1987 followup Radio K.A.O.S.).<br />There are plenty of superb moments here (the rocking \\"What God Wants (pt.1)\\", the opening \\"Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", \\"It's a Miracle\\") that recall the sound of later Floyd works like Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut. Like those works, this is a concept album--the concept (as ever with Waters) being the crappy nature of modern life as depicted on television with the Gulf War and the Tijanamen Square incidents as examples and also the rise of a corporate world. His satire is blunt as usual and the targets of his scorn are obvious.<br />Eagles singer/drummer Don Henley duets on \\"Watching TV\\" (which was about the Tijanamen Square incident and the collaboration of Henley and Waters triggered a friendship between the two which is still strong today), another highlight.<br />Legendary rock guitar legend Jeff Beck (who like Eric Clapton (who appeared on Pros and Cons) was a Yardbird) contributed taut, lyrical solos to a number of tracks (\\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", \\"What God Wants(pts. 1 and 3)\\", \\"Watching TV\\", \\"Three Wishes\\", \\"It's a Miracle\\" and the closing optimistic title cut). The late orchestrator/conductor Michael Kamen contributed some stirring orchestrations on this album as well (on \\"Late Home Tonight (parts 1 and 2)\\", \\"Too Much Rope\\" and \\"What God Wants (Part 3)\\".<br />The other tracks \\"Perfect Sense (Parts 1 and 2)\\" and \\"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\\" whilst good would become staples of Roger's live shows and be SUPERB LIVE!<br />The album's only few gripes I have were the unnecessary parts 2 and 3 of \\"What God Wants\\" (it got annoying after a few listens and now listening back to it 20 someodd years later found it kind of bland though the saving grace of Part 3 was Jeff Beck's guitar), the monotonous \\"Too Much Rope\\" (which had a thinly veiled swipe at Bob Ezrin on the line \\"each man has his price Bob\\" (who was supposed to produce KAOS but fell out with Roger and worked with Waters' ex-colleagues on their two post-Waters studio albums) and is just a boring tune) and the slugging of \\"Three Wishes\\" (though Jeff Beck's guitar solos here were incredible). Still, more great tunes than not.<br />Waters' voice was mainly reduced to a weary whisper, positively dripping with contempt due to the strain his vocal cords suffered from all the screaming he did on Animals, The Wall, The Final Cut and Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and their subsequent tours.<br />When Amused to Death hit record stores, it was modestly received peaking at #21 on the US album chart and had a huge rock radio hit with \\"What God Wants Part 1\\" but grunge rock ruled the music scene at the time and most people (sans Pink Floyd fans) didn't know who Roger Waters was and fell into obscurity quick.<br />This album was a return for Roger Waters after the somewhat ridiculous Radio KAOS.<br />Highly recommended!were the unnecessary parts 2 and 3 of \\"What God Wants\\" (it got annoying after a few listens and now listening back to it 20 someodd years later found it kind of bland though the saving grace of Part 3 was Jeff Beck's guitar), the monotonous \\"Too Much Rope\\" (which had a thinly veiled swipe at Bob Ezrin on the line \\"each man has his price Bob\\" (who was supposed to produce KAOS but fell out with Roger and worked with Waters' ex-colleagues on their two post-Waters studio albums) and is just a boring tune) and the slugging of \\"Three Wishes\\" (though Jeff Beck's guitar solos here were incredible).

B000002KFJ|5.0|Black Sabbath's sixth album Sabotage was released in August of 1975 on a small label in the UK and on Warner Bros here in the States in September of 1975.<br />Sabotage was seen by some as the band's last great masterpiece while some argue that either Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Technical Ecstasy were the band's last great album.<br />The Sabotage album was recorded in early 1975 in various studios in England and was seen by some as a rival to Queen's 1975 breakthrough A Night at the Opera for its multitracking and arrangements and what not (A Night at the opera was released in December of '75). Considering all the legal difficulties they were having at the time with the band's management and the independent label this album was issued on in the band's native UK (Sabotage was on a major label Warner Bros here in the US), the album proved that great art can come from great turmoil.<br />Sabotage picks up musically where the predecessor Sabbath Bloody Sabbath left off.<br />Ozzy Osbourne's impassioned screams (this was the peak of Ozzy's singing) and Tony Iommi's guitar playing plus Geezer Butler and Bill Ward's bass and drumming work respectively are at the top of their game as I found out when I bought the Warner Bros issue on cassette in May of 1995.<br />The stellar opening rocker \\"Hole in the Sky\\" is one of the best opening tracks ever. This song just rocks out with a killer riff. The song stops and goes into a brief acoustic interlude of \\"Don't Stop (Too Late)\\" goes straight into the superb rocker \\"Symptom of the Universe\\". Symptom is a kick*ss rocker which then ends on an acoustic note which sounds like something a 1960s American psychedelic band would record but it works. The nearly 10 minute epic \\"Megalomania\\" closed the first half on a grand note and bordered on ELP/Yes territory with its key and tempo changes and just is a great rocking track.<br />\\"The Thrill of it All\\" starts the second half and is a great rocking warmup for what the rest of the album would bring. \\"Supertzar\\" is a great instrumental combining metal with an operatic choir and was used as entrance music for many Sabbath tours to come. The weird \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" is next and was the single from the album and a great song. We then close the album with the awesome epic \\"The Writ\\" which is another classic progressive metal masterpiece with different movements (first has Ozzy screaming over a menacing riff before it goes into another riff then goes acoustic with Ozzy singing brilliantly) but not a boring track. When The Writ ended on the original Warner Bros LP/cassette issues and on the re-issue on the British remasters (and the US remaster on the now OUT OF PRINT Black Box box set), there was a 30 second silly ditty called Blow on a Jug which is a silly way to end the album.<br />Sabotage was the band's last US Top 30 album until 1980's Heaven and Hell and was another Gold seller for the band though many people by this time were more into laid back music but Sabotage has aged better than the Captain and Tenille, John Denver and Olivia Newton John tripe out at the time.<br />This album is HUGELY recommended!\\" is a great instrumental combining metal with an operatic choir and was used as entrance music for many Sabbath tours to come.

B000002B35|5.0|Pink Floyd's twenty first overall and second double live album PULSE was released in June of 1995.<br />This double live album was recorded on the European leg of Pink Floyd's 1994 world tour to support their chart-topping album entitled The Division Bell (which is now officially their final studio album as of September, 2008 following the death of keyboard player Rick Wright).<br />The reason for the double live PULSE album and its off-shoot video (later released on DVD) was at the end of the North American and Canadian leg of the tour (I had the priviledge of seeing them in Foxboro, MA in May of 1994 with 55,000 fans embracing them on one of their three nights sold out nights at Foxboro Stadium in Mass), they decided to resurrect something they had not done since their 1975 US Tour, their 1973 classic Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety.<br />The PULSE album was superbly produced by singer and guitarist David Gilmour and longtime engineer James Guthrie whom also engineered and mixed the album. Some songs had solos dubbed in from other shows because either the playing was awful (by the band's standards) or the solo came in a bar late or a vocal was flubbed. Hence, the album was not re-recorded in the studio unlike many live albums but edited from other shows as technology today allows fixings to come from a click of a mouse.<br />The first disc is a potpourri of material of classic Floyd tracks like the Syd Barrett era classic \\"Astronomy Domine\\", plus The Wall classic \\"Hey You\\", the masterpiece \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond (pts. 1-5 and 7)\\" and a stellar \\"Another Brick in the Wall(pt.2)\\" (with teasers of part 1 and Happiest Days thrown in for good measure) and post-Roger Waters material which were stellar readings of the Momentary Lapse tracks \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" (better on PULSE than on Delicate Sound of Thunder) and the tracks from The Division Bell starting with \\"What Do You Want From Me\\", \\"Keep Talking\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\", \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\" and a spirited \\"High Hopes\\".<br />The second disc is the complete Dark Side of the Moon album in its entirety plus encores of \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\". Except for the jam in the middle of \\"Money\\" and a modern sounding version of \\"On the Run\\", the whole of Dark Side of the Moon sounds just like the studio LP, but almost better in some cases like \\"Time\\" (with Gilmour playing stellar leads here), \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" (I apologize but Sam Brown did the first part way better than Clare Torry IMHO and Durga McBroom and Claudia Fontaine were impressive) and \\"Us and Them\\". The rest is superb as well (\\"Speak to Me\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Any Colour You Like\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\"/\\"Eclipse\\").<br />On the cassette version of the album . Of note, on the original LP and cassette versions was a superb live version of \\"One of These Days\\" and a 22 minute ambient piece which wasn't on the CD due to time constraints.<br />The PULSE album, when first released, originally came packaged with a blinking light on the spine of the CD artwork. Also, the album was an instant smash hitting #1 in both the US and UK in its first week and selling over three million copies here in the US alone immediately.<br />Sadly, this album is now a document of Pink Floyd's final tour in wake of Rick Wright's September, 2008 passing but the album is a living teatament to not only Wright but also Pink Floyd's incredible legacy.<br />RECOMMENDED!irited \\"High Hopes\\".

Bicycling Science is nerd heaven, full of physics, engineering, molecular biology, aerodynamics and all kinds of other scientific manna. If you have an appetite for charts, graphs, and research studies, then this book will delight you with its explanations of why bikes work so well with the human body.    It's not casual reading by any means. I'd prefer the same information presented in slightly less academic tones, but that doesn't mean it isn't accurate or interesting. So I dip into my copy for short bursts. For me, it's not a cover-to-cover read, but it's been on my bedside table for months because I pick it up regularly.     Bicycling Science may well be more technical info than a casual fan can absorb. However, it's a great reference that will demystify your bike -- if that's the sort of thing you like.
B00007KWHP|5.0|English rockers Yes' fourth album entitled Fragile (pronounced the British way of fragIle (the I is said normal)) was released in January of 1972 in the US and two months earlier in the UK.<br />Fragile was Yes' fourth album but their first with keyboard whiz Rick Wakeman who joined forces with original Yes members lead singer Jon Anderson, bass player Chris Squire and drummer Bill Bruford and this was guitarist Steve Howe's second album with the band.<br />After the breakthrough of The Yes Album, the band broke open in America and after the tour in support of the album, original keyboard player Tony Kaye quit the band which paved the way for the larger-than-life Wakeman(known for his grand stage presence of wearing large robes and playing stacks of keyboards which made fellow prog keyboardist Keith Emerson's set up look small) whose first album with Yes was a masterpiece (as I found out when I first heard this album in the summer of 1995 when I bought the CD on a whim).<br />Fragile consisted of four band pieces and solo pieces (kind of mirroring Pink Floyd's Ummagumma album but with better results)<br />We open Fragile with Yes' first big hit \\"Roundabout\\" which went onto become one of the most popular songs Yes ever recorded and their first US Top 20 hit. This eight-and-a-half mintue epic is a masterpiece with Anderson's lyrics and Howe's riffs just blending as one. The song rocks and has lots of different elements to it which makes it great. Next is Wakeman's solo contribution \\"Cans And Brahms\\" which is his take on a classical piece by the legendary composer Johannes Brahms by using different keyboards (synthesizers, organ, pianos, etc) to recreate an orchestra (this was in the days before digital synthesizers could do this no problem. Next is Anderson's solo piece \\"We Have Heaven\\" which is all Anderson's voices singing over a classic piece of music played by the band. The epic \\"South Side Of The Skyv follows and is possibly the album's best track. The intro and outro to this song rock hard, with minor keyboards accompanying until Wakeman's classic piano section comes in (which he did write but due to contract reasons wasn't credited) before ending like it began. This song has held up well over the years.<br />The album's second half starts with Bruford's \\"Five Per Cent Of Nothing\\" which is the shortest piece of the solo pieces but cool. Next was the album radio favorite \\"Long Distance Runaround\\". It's another one of the all-time classic Yes songs. This piece is a great song and the shortest of the band pieces before we segue into \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" which is Squire's showcase. It only features Squire playing the bass guitar like it is a lead instrument, proving he is one of rock's greatest bass players, and his voice singing the Schindleria Praematurus phrase. Bill Bruford's drums keep the pace going here. Lastly is Howe's classical guitar solo \\"Mood For A Day\\" which shows why Steve Howe is one of the greatest guitarists EVER in the annals of rock. We end the album with the album's longest track, the ten minute plus \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" which is one Hell of an epic. The first few minutes is a hard-rocking instrumental sequence that hits you in the heart before Anderson's vocals come in and slows it down a hare. Throughout the track, the band keeps throwing style changes. There's hard rock, melodic classical stuff, heavily progressive keyboard sounds and pretty much everything in between. After the regular track ends, Yes throw a hidden bonus track (like on original vinyl) which was a reprise of We Have Heaven.<br />The Fragile album broke Yes into the US Top 10 for the first time peaking at #4 on the Billboard chart and for years was the band's biggest selling album (until 1983's 90125).<br />Two remasters were issued over the years. The first remaster was in 1995 which sounded great. Then Rhino outdid those by reissuing the album with TWO BONUS TRACKS. The first was a TEN minute reading of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"America\\" (which was issued on an Atlantic promo album in 1972 and as a B-side later in 1972 in edited form and on the Yesterdays compilation) which should have first appeared on either Fragile or Close to the Edge but didn't. Then we end with a first take of Roundabout which was different from the finished product.<br />RECOMMENDED IMMENSELY!hich was issued on an Atlantic promo album in 1972 and as a B-side later in 1972 in edited form and on the Yesterdays compilation) which should have first appeared on either Fragile or Close to the Edge but didn't.

B0007PLLQ0|4.0|When I was younger... a fair bit younger... I saw a movie on TV called Legend.  I LOVED it!    I was never sure which version of the film I had seen, so when I found the Ultimate Edition which had both the original US theatrical version and the director's cut version, I was excited and didn't hesitate to buy it.  Then I found that neither version is the version I saw back in the day on TV.    Now, I know that sometimes TV stations are given certain short-term proprietary rights to make changes to the cut of a film, largely so they can insert commercials, but what a difference it can make.    I can honestly say that while I still love the movie on the whole, I don't particularly care for either of the versions presented in the Ultimate Edition.    The original US theatrical cut comes across as choppy, as though it's missing something.  The director's cut also is choppy from time to time, but that stems mostly from poor scene transitions rather than a lack of material.  In some cases I prefer the score by Tangerine Dream, and in other cases I prefer the Goldsmith score.  In some scenes I like the additional singing with Mia Sara, and in others I would prefer it not to be there.  And on the whole I agree with many of the other reviewers that Tim Curry didn't get enough screen time considering how extraordinarily well he played the role of Darkness.    Beyond this, I felt that the acting was pretty decent over all, though I have to say that I feel like it is quite possibly one of Tom Cruise's worst performances of his career (though admittedly I haven't seen many of his more recent films).  Tim Curry did an excellent job, as did Mia Sara (Princess Lily) and David Bennet (Honeythorn Gump).  Billy Barty (Screwball), Cork Hubbert (Brown Tom), and Annabelle Lanyon (Oona) all did very well too in my opinion.    This general mixed bag of opinions and emotions regarding this film leaves me with a desire to see and own the version I first saw, which, if my memory is accurate, combined both cuts into a third version.  This brings me to where I am now... looking to learn to use DVD editing and authoring software to remix the entire film for my own personal cut.  The only thing I might end up missing is the narration at the very beginning when the text prologue is scrolling by (the director's cut doesn't have the prologue, and the theatrical version doesn't have it narrated, but the version I first saw was narrated by a man with a beautiful voice, I don't know who), and perhaps some less-than-smooth chapter transitions.    Anyway, if you're looking for a great epic fantasy along the lines of Lord of the Rings, then you'll not likely enjoy this movie as much as many of the rest of us have, so I would suggest seeing it first (borrow it or rent it) before you buy it.  But if you're interested in something that is visually glamorous, a bit cliche, and has a happy ending, then you very well may be looking at your new favorite fantasy film.
B000002I8D|5.0|Genesis singer and drummer Phil Collins' first proper solo album Face Value was released in February of 1981.<br />Phil was the last member of Genesis to do a proper solo album (the Brand X albums were not real solo albums but an outside project for Phil when Genesis was not recording). When Face Value hit the streets, people were in awe over the excellent production, Phil co-produced with Hugh Padgham, and engineering of Hugh Padgham and listeners were immediately aware that this album was a collection of letters to his first wife whom left him during Genesis' And Then There Were Three Tour in 1978 and would divorce in 1979.<br />Also, the Face Value album has a collage of musical styles (running the gamut from Genesis' atmospheric music to Motown to jazz to funk to soft rock to regular rock to art rock).<br />The opening US Top 20 hit (which was the second single here in the States from the album) \\"In the Air Tonight\\" was a classic that used the metaphor of a drowning man as the demise of the divorce of his first marriage. The track, like all the others features Phil's superb vocals and drumming but also showed he could play keyboards and write great songs. He wrote ten of the album's twelve tracks himself. Also, Genesis touring guitarist/bass player Daryl Steurmer's guitar here is phenomenal. \\"I Missed Again\\" was the album's other US Top 20 hit (and was the first US single) and is another highlight featuring the Earth Wind and Fire horn section and famed British sax player Ronnie Scott giving this track a Motown feel. \\"This Must Be Love\\" is an optimistic song about Phil rebounding from the demise of his first marriage to find peace with a new love in his life (whom would be his second wife Jill). \\"The Roof is Leaking\\" is a great country blues number with some killer slide guitar from Joe Partridge (interesting that Eric Clapton did play on an earlier take with the dobro but was scrapped) and banjo from Daryl.<br />The two instrumentals \\"Droned\\" and \\"Hand in Hand\\" are superb as well (the latter is his most well known instrumental). My favorite track on the album is the ballad \\"If Leaving Me is Easy\\" which is a very sad song and will bring a tear to your eye after listening to the lyrics and the melody and orchestrations on the track. If this doesn't do the trick then you either are insensitive or a robot.<br />The Genesis track \\"Behind the Lines\\" was re-done as a disco/funk tune after Phil played the original recording back at double speed during the Duke sessions in 1979 and a new version was born complete with horns.

Then, in late August of 1997 I bought the CD and played this album constantly and was the soundtrack to the fall semester of college for me that year.<br />Highly recommended!as well (the latter is his most well known instrumental). My favorite track on the album is the ballad \\"If Leaving Me is Easy\\" which is a very sad song and will bring a tear to your eye after listening to the lyrics and the melody and orchestrations on the track. If this doesn't do the trick then you either are insensitive or a robot.   The Genesis track \\"Behind the Lines\\" was re-done as a disco/funk tune after Phil played the original recording back at double speed during the Duke sessions in 1979 and a new version was born complete with horns.

B000002KIK|5.0|Black Sabbath's eighth album Never Say Die was released in October of 1978.<br />The album was self-produced by the band and recorded in Toronto, Canada to escape England's awful tax law.<br />Before the album was made, lead singer Ozzy Osbourne briefly left the band and was replaced by Dave Walker of Savoy Brown. Bass player Geezer Butler also quit as well but was back in no time with Ozzy to join guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward to record the original lineup's farewell album Never Say Die.<br />The cover had another classic Hipgnosis cover and is surprisingly a great album. I first got this CD in May of 1995 and loved it immediately.<br />The album kicks off with the hit single which was the album's title cut which was one of Sabbath's best songs. The next track \\"Johnny Blade\\" is a cool song with wild synths from Don Airey and a great metal rocker. Junior's Eyes follows and is one of my favorite songs on the album and was about the death of Ozzy's father. The first half closed with the anthemic \\"A Hard Road\\" which was another great song on the album. The first half is a great half.<br />The second half kicked off with \\"Shock Wave\\" which had one of the coolest guitar intros I've ever heard and is a great song as well. The weird but killer \\"Air Dance\\" follows. \\"Over To You\\" follows and was Ozzy's final vocal on a Sabbath track until 1998's Reunion studio track Psycho Man. The instrumental \\"Breakout\\" is a great jazzy tune with some weird sax. The closing track \\"Swinging the Chain\\" had drummer Bill Ward singing on this song and doing a great job and had killer harmonica work by Ozzy.<br />Unfortunately, when Never Say Die was released, the album was the second Sabbath album in a row to flop here in the States reaching a deplorable #69, it would eventually go Gold in later years. Also, the band was upstaged by an up and coming hard rock act named Van Halen on the accompanying tour.<br />As everyone knows, Ozzy got canned in January of 1979 after the tour in support of this album was finished.<br />This album is highly recommended!was finished.   This album is highly recommended!

B000003TA4|1.0|When Nirvana released their second album Nevermind in September of 1991, thankfully it was ignored in its first few months as heavy metal bands like Guns and Roses and Metallica ruled the rock and roll mainstream with their Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 and Black Albums respectively plus Anthrax, Judas Priest and Megadeth released great albums amidst the hair metal trash.<br />Then, around either December of 1991 or January of 1992, MTV started playing the video for Nirvana (or as I called them NERDVANA)'s \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and I said to myself, exact words and this was not a made up story and I quote \\"I see the lead singer (Kurt Cobain) is a left handed guitarist like Jimi Hendrix and I predict he will die in three years\\" end quote. In 1994 (almost three years after this album was released), my prophecy came true as he offed himself like a yellow dog.<br />Cobain, unlike Hendrix, was a deplorable guitarist and un-revolutionary IMHO!<br />Nirvana were not revolutionary despite what those fools at Rolling Stone and Spin magazine claim, Nirvana were basically a safe version of The Sex Pistols and The Clash (despite the fact that Dave Grohl was the only true talent in Nirvana as he is a great drummer, singer and rhythm guitarist). It irks me to see people compare this album to real classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Sticky Fingers, Hotel California and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Nevermind is overrated.<br />Aside Teen Spirit, other lousy songs were \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Come As You Are\\" (should have been titled \\"Don't Have a Gun\\") and \\"Lithium\\" (who would write a song about a sedative to combat hyperactivity). \\"Territorial P*ssings\\" sounds like he was writing about a pack of wolves marking their territory. \\"Endless Nameless\\" was annoying. \\"Drain You\\" was silly.<br />Whom in the blue Hell came up with naming a generation \\"X\\", last time I checked Generation X was a punk band that Billy Idol was in back in the late 1970s. I get down on my knees and seriously thank God I dove heavily into Queen's music when Nirvana were at their peak. Also, people comparing a real rock legend like John Lennon to, what \\"The Motor City Madman\\" Ted Nugent aptly called a \\"weenie\\", Kurt Cobain was like comparing solid gold to tin foil. Lennon was about happiness and wanting peace in the face of all negativity and horror in the world we live in whilst Cobain just whined, complained, p*ssed and moaned and cried about how bad his life was and wanting to die and sounded like a three year old who had his toy taken from him.<br />Avoid this and any Nirvana album!od I dove heavily into Queen's music when Nirvana were at their peak.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|The Winchester brothers roam the less frequented parts of the American countryside, searching for clues to their mother's bizarre and fiery death, their father's disappearance, and brother Sam's \\"abilities.\\"  Along the way, they help all of those in need of saving from any sort of horrific situation, be it just grotesque or indeed, supernatural.    Despite the claims that the plots are derived from \\"American folklore,\\" it seems more likely that they are derived from about every horror movie that has been produced during the last 30 years.  \\"Bloody Mary\\" from \\"Candy Man\\"; \\"Scarecrow\\" from \\"Night of the Scarecrow\\"; \\"Dead in the Water\\" perhaps from \\"Boggy Creek\\"; \\"The Benders\\" from \\"Texas ChainSaw Massacre\\"; \\"Phantom Traveler\\" from \\"Twilight Zone's\\" \\"Death at 20,000 Feet\\" or even \\"Final Destination\\"; \\"Route 666\\" from \\"Christine\\"; \\"Nightmare\\" from \\"Carrie\\"; the comparisons are nearly endless.  It's almost as though someone with an encyclopedic knowledge of horror films adapted the most favorable plots to the show's premise from the last three decades -- minus the gratuitous voilence.  Perhaps that's what their father's all knowing \\"book\\" represents.    The production values are slick and stylish.  The colours are cold, and lend an atmosphere of melancholy to the show that was absent from more campy shows like \\"Angel\\" and \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\"  The backdrops of small towns and dark, lonesome highways, and secluded regions of the United States help to realize the folkloric aspect of the show's premise.  Comparisons to the \\"X-Files\\" are not correct, as it was a science fiction show, and this is definitely horror.      It is a darker show, much less corny than other shows that fall into this genre (see especially \\"American Gothic\\"), using as much gore as The CW will allow; and it's very obvious that it's appealing more to a male audience than a female audience, (\\"Buffy,\\" \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Charmed\\" were directed more towards female audiences) -- except for the usage of unquestionably handsome male leads.  Jensen Ackles, who looked too plastic when he modeled in his twenties, is much more handsome now that he is older; and Jared Padalecki I'm sure will appeal to a great number of swooning teenage females (I personally prefer the former to the latter).  They have very good chemistry together: Ackles being somewhat hard headed and stubborn, and Padalecki being more intuitive.    After the writers have plundered the coffers of horror plots from movies from the last 30 years or so (though intelligently adapted), I'm curious to see where the show will go during its second season.  It would be very hard to top.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd's video document of their 1994 successful Division Bell tour entitled Pulse was released in June of 1995, the same day as the album. Its release on DVD was in July of 2006.<br />Whereas the off-shoot album was recorded from 20 shows in Europe, this DVD was from Earls Court Arena in London on 20 October, 1994.<br />I first saw Pink Floyd's Pulse in November of 1994 when it aired as a pay-per-view. The show had a five minute pre-show interview with David Gilmour and Nick Mason on performing live on broadcast TV.<br />Then, there are some differences between the PPV version and the official version in the camera angles and some songs were fixed. The song \\"High Hopes\\" had a section of its ending lap steel guitar solo overdubbed from another show because if you have the PPV on video, David Gilmour hit different notes than the released version (this wasn't corrected on the DVD, you still get that pesky studio overdub). \\"Time\\" on the PPV version just had Gilmour and Wright singing \\"Thought I'd something more to say\\" but on the official VHS second keyboardist Jon Carin's voice was magically added in as it was on \\"Breathe Reprise\\" which was buried on the original PPV mix (could have been added in from another show as the microphone was either not on or the in-house mixer forgot to fade him in). Also, David Gilmour thanked Roger in a slightly lower tone on the PPV as opposed to the official video and DVD. Lastly, \\"Comfortably Numb\\" was edited from 11 minutes from the PPV to over 9 minutes on the DVD (this was not fixed as well for the DVD).<br />There are some positives about the DVD.<br />Some of the versions of the songs from this video here appeared on the album (\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", parts of \\"One of These Days\\", \\"Speak to Me\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"On the Run\\", \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", part of \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\") whilst \\"Learning to Fly\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\", \\"Sorrow\\", \\"Keep Talking\\", \\"Another Brick II\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Any Colour You Like\\", \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are fantastic and different to the live versions that appear on the album version of PULSE.<br />Also, the song \\"Take it Back\\" which was left off of the PULSE album is included on the PULSE film.<br />The DVD has a boatload of bonus features like promo videos, all of the backdrop films on their own, a documentary and some fan-shot footage of \\"Marooned\\", \\"Poles Apart\\", \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\" (the \\"Bootlegging the Bootleggers\\" section and extras are worth the DVD alone).<br />This DVD is rounded off to 5 stars as there is no 4.5 stars.<br />Recommended!age\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are fantastic and different to the live versions that appear on the album version of PULSE.

0192833669|4.0|Most editions of Mary Shelley's landmark book available today follow the heavily revised 1831 version. The impulse behind this trend is an honorable one (to present what is seemingly an author's \\"final revision\\"),but the 1818 version is preferable for many reasons. Looking back on her creation in later life, Shelley felt obliged to alter the book's focus in significant ways, adding what critic Marilyn Butler accurately describes as \\"long passages in which her main narrator, [Victor] Frankenstein, expresses religious remorse for making a creature...\\"  The author sought to make the 1831 edition less controversial and thereby more palatable to the tastes of the reading public. The 1818 version is closer to Mary Shelley's original intentions, though it too, unfortunately, was filtered through the sensibilities of her husband, the poet Percy Shelley, who took many of his wife's rather straightforward passages and rendered them into his own more ornate and Ciceronian style. Still, the 1818 version remains more vital, more original, and less constrained by what the author believed would be acceptable to readers in 1830s England.
6305064490|5.0|I have watched this movie many times, and each time it makes me cry and feel overwhelmed with emotion.  This amazes me, because it is so sentimental and in many ways contrived, at least as we see it through our jaded modern eyes.  Sure, it was made for a simpler time, but there is no doubt that it taps into universal human truths and hopes.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as a good and talented man who allows his sense of responsibility to guide his life, which costs him hugely in his sense of frustration and thwarted ambition.  You see it in him as a child, particularly the scene in the drug store, where he saves more than one life.  (That scene chokes me up every time I see it.  There is such struggle and caring in it, such courage as he sticks to his decision.  It is one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in the cinema.)  Of course, he has a terrible crisis that is resolved, with a renewed sense of life.<br /><br />Donna Reed is also wonderful as his wife, a simple woman who loves him in the way we would all hope to be loved in marriage.  Indeed, she embodies an ideal and yet is so believable that it makes me introspect on my own marriage.  And Barrymore!  The perfect capitalist ogre.<br /><br />Like many, I watch this every Christmas season and feel awe at the power of a perfectly crafted hollywood story.  While we get down on hollywood formulas, there are times when it works as well as one could hope.  That is this film, one of the finest ever made.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

0316166685|3.0|I really struggled with the 3 or 4 star.  Three and a half fits.  I loved the premise of the dead watching the lives left behind in the wake of her rape/murder.

At the end I was left wondering \\"Is that all there is . . . \\"
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I think this serie is one of the most beautiful things I have ever had the chance to watch. I bought and saw it with willing eyes, I couldn't stop seeing it althoug I had already red the book and I knew the end of it.  However the story is a little different from the book, the things happen very fast but it couldn't be otherwise because you need to put almost 600 pages in just 4 hours.The first impression you get when you see Mr. Thornton is weird because you don't understand what he's doing, he's very tough with one of his workers but then you realize why and you can give him the reason of his behavior.  The character of Miss Hale is much more strong in the serie than in the book, she doesn't cry that much and you see her harder, capable to face the world in the moments of deepest sorrow she goes through.  Her father and Mr Bell's relationship is better in the book they are very good friends and you miss that in the serie. The character of Mrs Thornton is faithfully performed by Sinead Cusack she is great!  Dixon and Mrs Hale relationship is stronger in the serie I love that,finally Mr Higgings doesn't get drunk as in the book but he has other difficulties with his daughter and the people of the union to overcome his hard situation.  I was completely swallow by the sweed way the story follows and the good acting of the people in it.The roll of John Thornton was perfectly performed by Richard Armitage and the character of Miss Hale doesn't need to ask for more, Daniela Denby-Ashe was just the one to do it. I highly recomend this incredible serie to be seen with all the people you care for because it is a perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon together and see the love story developed by two people as different as north and south can be.

B000WMFZNS|5.0|It has been a very long wait indeed for a proper, high resolution 2 disc anamorphic DVD of this epic medieval tale of passion and chivalry. The final results are breathtaking. The transfer is stunning and the sound is rich and full. This is rousing entertainment on the grandest scale.<br /><br />It's hard to understand why this film took so long to arrive on DVD. Perhaps, as some have suggested, the subject matter has been an issue in our over-sensitive, shrinking world of religious violence. Or our discomfort with nebulous concepts of love, forgiveness and peace. But most likely a matter of rights and licensing issues.<br /><br />The relevance of this extraordinary film remains current and is a monumental artistic achievements of world cinema. On a personal level, this terrific film provoked me into thinking about how belief systems -- especially about the nature of God (or Allah) -- benefit or harm our world.<br /><br />The essence of the conflict between warring Castilians and Moors and an invading Muslim threat is unflinching in the opening scene as the North African holy warrior Ben Yussuf quotes \\"the Prophet\\" as promising to conquer the world in the name of Allah.<br /><br />But the real conflict is the idea that there can be peace -- and perhaps even love -- between those who hate. This is exemplified in the troubled and intimate story of Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) and Ximena (Sophia Loren). It begins simply enough with a knight on his way to meet his bride when destiny forces a detour.<br /><br />El Cid, the legendary hero of Spain was a real person named Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar. He lived around 1035 A.D. Although he spent much of his time fighting on the side of the Moors, he became identified as the best incarnation of the true Castilian Christian spirit. His name came from the Arabic \\"sayyid\\" meaning \\"lord\\" or \\"chief.\\"<br /><br />Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are perfectly cast as larger than life figures of flesh and blood. Their reported confllcts on-set probably added a degree of on-screen realism. They are wonderful together.

The movie has a fine sense of composition that the terrific on-location cinematography only enhances. Numerous action-filled vistas fill the screen, richly detailed and beautifully photographed.

B000SNUMC0|4.0|Awesome CD!!!  The only thing that I found wrong with it is something that might not even be a problem.  I hate listening to just one song.  The only way that I've found to seriously enjoy it is by listening to several songs (in order) at the same sitting.  The whole CD just flows.  I can't wait for the next installment!  I'm a late comer to IE.  I just started listening when Glorious Burden came out, which I also loved.  Great stuff here.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I loved this album.  Fave tracks were \\"Champion\\" & \\"Homecoming\\".  Minus a star for kissin' Jay-Z's tail in \\"Big Brother\\".    I'm not a \\"rap fan\\" or \\"hip hop fan\\" per se.  I like good music no matter what.  I've been a Kanye fan since \\"Through the Wire\\" and \\"Slow Jamz\\".  This album was totally different than his first two.  This is what totally won me about Graduation.  A press release mentioned (before the album dropped) that Kanye would be using a lot of synthesizers, and this is true, but the sound is amazing!  Although my two tracks are listed as my faves, the other tracks that include the synthesizer work are also on top...like FLASHING LIGHTS!!!!    As to the kissing up to Jay-Z..as stated before, minus a star.  Kanye's \\"hook\\" is telling it like it is no matter whose feelings are hurt.  He's honest, and a bit big-headed, but harmless.  Why does Jay-Z need a freakin' track tribute to him?  In response, Kanye got to yell \\"We in the house\\" in the background like a lil' kid on Jay's new album.  Talk about returning the favor.  I'm a huge fan of both, but you won't catch me on my knees for either...thanks.
B00005JPLW|5.0|First and foremost, to anyone reading this review as a means to decide whether or not they'd like to buy/see this movie, let me say this:     This film is not historical. Though some historical elements are present, it is based off of a comic book that is a fictional rendition of the Battle of Thermopylae. If you go into watching it with that in mind, it will be much more enjoyable.    Ultimately, this movie was about hope and glory against all odds. The story itself was wonderful and beautifully done as well. I have to admit that before seeing this film I was quite skeptical of it. Worrying that it would be \\"just another action flick\\" but I was so amazed and happy with it afterwards.    This is one of the most artistically wonderful movies I have seen in a long time. It is, indeed, based off off the Battle of Thermopylae, which is marvelous. But I loved the fictional elements very much. The movie was almost dream-like in appearance and the addition of various creatures and deformed humans just added to that quality. This movie was absolutely beautiful and stylistic. Some people have called it a horror film due to the blood.... Yes, it's a bit gory... but not in the \\"scare the crap out of you so that you'll have nightmares\\" kind of way that real horror films do. It's about a battle, so of course there is bloodshed and death. I do think it was quite smart though that, in some places, the visual style of the film actually hid some gruesome stuff in the shadows so that you couldn't see it.    I heartily recommend this film to anyone looking for something original and visually amazing.
0446577391|5.0|Stone Cold is David Baldacci's best writing to date. The third in the Camel Club series, Baldacci does an amazing job of tying the loose ends, answering those lingering questions and delighting the reader with a fast-paced intriguing book. This series started  with The Camel Club, followed by The Collectors and now Stone Cold.    Rarely is a reader allowed to fulfill their reading quotient with pure enjoyment cover to cover. Usually, the reader is tempted to skip a paragraph (or two), become irritated with the progress, or, worst, stop reading because another activity sounds more interesting. You will NOT find that condition on any page - in any paragraph of Stone Cold. Sleeping is a secondary action to turning the page.    This fan of Baldacci, having read all of his books except Absolute Power, (I got started late) each series or individual book is meritous and lasting. You do not forget his books. This one however, rates five stars for all the obvious reasons.
0151013837|5.0|I would have to say that this is one of the greatest books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Yann Martel pulls you in from the beginning with his curious and cogitative way of examining human (and animal) nature in a tale you won't soon forget.

032147404X|4.0|If you are new to photography you probably would like to have access to a professional photographer who could tell you things like, \\"No, don't do that. Do it this way.\\" It would be great to be able to ask questions about the things that you really want to understand about photography without having to wade through pages of information about depth of field and stops and exposure.    Of course, you have to know something about these concepts if you want to excel in photography, but if you are anything like me you learn best when you are shown the basics by example and then are able to explore and expand from there.     That is why I like this book. Scott says that this book is designed as if the two of you were out on a photo shoot together and you needed to know how to do something. He wouldn't go into a discourse on the history of the camera and Matthew Brady and Ansel Adams, he would simply give you a few pointers on some settings and tell you the expected consequences of using them.     That is exactly what this book does.     Through simple, half-page tips, topped by helpful photographs, he moves you through the concepts that puzzle those of us that are getting started in the often mystical and mysterious world of digital photography, though you could use this book whether you are shooting digital or not.    What equipment should you really have with you? What is the best equipment? What if you don't have a lot of money to buy this stuff?    How can you get sharp pictures? What camera settings can you use? Are there certain poses, techniques or tricks that can help eliminate camera shake? What are some good ideas for shooting weddings? Portraits?     If you don't have a lot of time this is your book. Take it with you on a flight or browse through it while you are waiting for the doctor, etc. You can digest one of the tips and put it to use within 5 or 10 minutes easily.     Now, if there is one thing I would say about this book as a warning. Scott thinks he is funny. Most of this ummm... `humor' is at the front of the book but if the Dummies books and their corny humor bothers you Scott's attempts at humor will as well. However, I think his editors (and maybe he knows it too) have caught on to the fact that he can be annoying sometimes and so they have limited his antics to the book and chapter intros. If you just read the tips you will find lots of info without being annoyed to the point you want to rip the book up.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Eh, what can I say?  It's Star Wars! I can watch the original (1977) version in the comfort of my home on the ol' DVD player and use the modified (2004) version as a coaster.    Life is good and I'm a happy camper...
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Catchy little dittys of love & loss. The best part of the movie are these songs so basically this soundtrack is all the concentrated goodness from the movie.  Not to say the movie isn't good too, but  y'know...Glen Hansard is a musician before he's an actor right?

034544678X|5.0|This was the first book I read when my family began considering getting a dog, and I'm so glad it was. The main focus is on how dogs and humans communicate (and mis-communicate) with each other. But it also contains useful suggestions on dog training, a clear explanation of how positive reinforcement works, and a whole lot of charming and moving dog stories. The author clearly loves and respects dogs, and I get the sense that she likes people pretty well too. She's someone I'd like to have lunch with (maybe a picnic on the farm with the dogs playing around us!). Since that's not likely anytime soon, I'll have to settle for reading her extremely well-written, enjoyable, and informative books instead.
1594489505|5.0|I was TERRIFIED to read A Thousand Splendid Suns after I read Kiterunner.  I have read several books by many different authors and the seconds always spoiled the firsts for me.  Although not an easy book to get through, Kiterunner was powerful and very thought-provoking.  Suns, in contrast, was an enjoyable read, no where near as graphic as it's predecessor.    Where some readers complained of a hard to follow writing style, and that the \\"main\\" character vanishes after 14 chapters, I had no problems keeping in step with the book.  YOU JUST HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ.    I believe that Suns more vividly tells the plight of not only the Afghan woman, but of the history of the people and the country as well.  The hardships they have been through, the lack of stability, the inability to govern themselves.  It shows BOTH the positive and the negative opinions of the people when it comes to all forms of \\"invasions\\" of Afghanistan by the Russians to the Americans.    If you're into learning about foreign cultures and wonderful stories, A Thousand Splendid Suns is worth a read and so much more.  I can honestly say that it changed my view of the Afghan culture!

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I've always been a Britney fan...and have to say that I love this album. Like a previous review mentioned...\\"it's not a perfect 10\\"...but it still gets my body bumpin!!  \\"Piece of Me\\" is a great track...considering the lyrics and her current relationship with the papparazzi.  I also enjoy \\"Soldier Boy\\", \\"Radar\\", \\"Get Naked\\", \\"Hot as Ice\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\".    I was crossing my fingers that her next album would be a hit, and am glad it is.  I can't wait for her next video...hopefully she snaps out of it and blows everyone out of the water!
B0001M0A4I|5.0|Tony Banks is a master of prog rock orchestration and on this lovely CD proves that his mastery of composition extends to the symphonic form. While he had help with the orchestration, it is very clear that his ideas are extremely well thought out. Each of the seven pieces are complete and  polished. Whether you are a classical music fan or a fan of Mr. Banks' previous work, this is very well thought out. Several interviews that are available on line detail some of the composers that the Banks' music calls to mind. In my view, while there are some slight echoes of other composers, Banks' ideas are fresh and lovely. The words lush and pastoral come to mind. This CD is a sleeper but just well may become one of your favorites. The recording quality is excellent.Turn it up, get a cup of tea, close your eyes and enjoy!
0375847227|1.0|The maturity of the writting is on a par with Aragon - that of a writers first book.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for children.  The author's hatred of \\"the church\\" is such a great part of the plot, that it doesn't allow any other theme to shine through.<br /><br />In my opinion a children's book should either entertain, at their level, or help them find themselves in the larger world.<br />  For a child to enjoy this book, they would need to read it as an adventure with no attempt to understand why the adventure is happening.<br /><br />As an adult reading the material, I found it an interesting twist on string threory.  The author's hatred of \\"the church\\" and miss quoting of the Bible was a little off putting, but then I didnt' read the books for a religious education.<br /><br />Because the level of writting left me flat - the characters emotions never came to life - I don't think I will bother reading any other works by this author.  (I would recommend he read some of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books -- now those character's come to life!.)
031286504X|4.0|I bought this book just based on reader's reviews and found it to be a good read.  It has more than just I am Legend within it and found it to be a lot more than I had bargained for!
B000W1V44I|5.0|This album is amazing. I wasnt expecting it! Its worth buying, best songs are downpour, when she smiles and panic.
B00008S2VG|2.0|When I listened to this album, I really wanted to like it.  I really did.  While it's not quite as weak as Erotica, it comes pretty close.  This album focuses heavily on the theme of the excesses of modern life; however, the album has too strong of an emphasis on this theme, making Madonna almost as guilty of excess as those she criticizes.<br /><br />American Life suffers from a lack of diveristy in the music.  Also, many of the songs seem to get stuck in a groove and never really progress anywhere musically.  The song \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" felt a lot like a re-hash of \\"Impressive Instant\\" (from Madonna's previous album, Music).<br /><br />It just felt like Madonna and Mirwais didn't put forth as much effort as they could have when producing this album.  When I listened to the disc, I kept having this \\"been there, done that\\" feeling.  When Confessions on a Dance Floor came out, I was very relieved to see Madonna move on from heavily relying on Mirwais as a producer.
B0001I55SS|1.0|I am not sure why I had such high hopes for this film, but I was sorely disappointed by Disney's 'The Black Hole.' The film is horrible beyond compare. Its premise is basically a retelling of '20,0000 Leagues Under the Sea' without any of the grandeur of the 1950s classic.<br /><br />This films should have succeeded yet in my book it is an utter failure. The costumes, the incredible cast and the music all should have insured a great movie. Instead it is an overly dark, brooding film with huge lapses in logic and incredibly bad science that undermines any chance of enjoying the film. The characters act with no discernable or believable motiviations. The actors had to put up with scenes that are comparable to Irwin Allen's 'Lost in Space.' Go buy '20,000 Leagues' or 'Tron' instead!<br /><br />I found the movie so badly put together that I just cannot recommend it, not even if I found the film in the $5.00 bin would I buy it. What a disappointment!
B000063S6Z|3.0|18 was the follow-up to Moby's successful album, Play.  Sonically, 18 took Play to \\"the next level.\\"  However, I think the 18 album could have been a bit stronger.  Changing the sequencing of the album would have helped it tremendously (the second half of the album has a \\"sameness\\" to it, which makes it hard to listen to that part of the album after a while).<br /><br />For me, 18 is definitely a \\"mood album\\"; I have to be in a particular mood in order to listen to it in its entirety.  Those fans who enjoy Moby's more upbeat and danceable material probably won't like 18 as much.  While this is a decent album, it's definitely not the one I would use to introduce someone to Moby's material (for that purpose, I would use either Everything is Wrong or Play).
0525950079|3.0|Pillars of the Earth is one of my all time favorites books. I was delighted to see the sequel when it came out. However, after trudging my way to the end, I was somewhat disappointed. Although I would still recommend it as an adjunct to Pillars, this book  just never grabbed me the way Pillars did. It seemed to have almost a \\"soap opera\\" quality to it.  The richness of his descriptions of life in this era are excellent; very detailed, gritty, and with  keen perception of religious and political intrigues. To me, the character development wasn't as realistic as in the previous book. I found some of them to be rather unbelievable.  Nevertheless, it amazes me that Ken Follett writes so eloquently in this genre since his previous themes have been so outstanding in the suspense, wartime, and spy-dom genre.
B000I0QK74|5.0|What a perfect, melow voice to sing Christmas music.  Adds his genious artistic interpretation and style to the spirit of the joyous season.  Add this one to your collection and you won't be sorry.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|OK, so I gotta say...the only other Britney Spears cd I own is In The Zone b/c of the song she did with Madonna.  I've never considered myself a fan of her music in anyway, as her production teams and management teams seem to have had a much bigger decision on the sound of her music than she did.  It all sounded exactly the same with the Swedish Pop sound that Backstreet Boys and NSync had as well during the time when boy bands and teenage girls were on top in the late 90's early 2000's.  It was pure cheezy pop and was only decent to me when it was remixed by club DJ's.     So when i heard heard Gimme More I thought the beat was great, but lyrically weak, but it intrigued me enough to give this CD a try.  My first thought about the CD was that this is her first CD in which it sounds like she's taken control over how she wants her music to sound.  Granted, the girl can not sing, but it's a great time.  I can listen to every song from the beginning to the end of the CD and the songs are beyond catchy.  It's right up there with Madonna's Confession on the Dancefloor.  If you love dance music and don't really care about the lyrics and aren't looking for a powerhouse vocal diva, then i totally recommend this CD.

0440241030|5.0|Millionaire/mercenary Edward Lane hires Jack Reacher to find his wife, Kate, and stepdaughter, Jade. Both were kidnapped on a shopping trip and Lane is willing to pay whatever it takes to get them back. Patti Joseph has been surveilling Lane and his group of killers since the kidnapping and subsequent death of her sister, Anne, several years earlier. Anne was Lane's former wife and Patti suspects he used her kidnapping as a cover-up for her murder. She puts Reacher in touch with former FBI agent, now private investigator Lauren Pauling. Like Patti, Lauren is haunted by the death of Anne Lane, and she and Reacher team up to try to find out what really happened then and now.<br /><br />Their investigation leads them to a civil war in Africa, where Lane abandoned two of his men, both of whom Patti suspects actually killed her sister at Lane's behest. From there, it turns to England, where Reacher uncovers a brutal truth that places his and Lauren's lives in mortal danger.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is one of the coolest characters written. A former Army MP and loner by nature, he travels the world with only the clothes on his back and a toothbrush tucked in his pocket. He seems to drift in and out of people's lives like a fine mist, leaving behind mayhem at the very least and murder at most, but always justice. Child's style is gritty and bare-bones and compelling. He finely attunes this thrilling read with action-packed suspense, a workable mix of amiable and malevolent characters, and the ultimate draw: good versus evil. One of the best books yet in the Reacher series. This reader looks forward to many more.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Live albums usually aren't my thing, however I must disagree because I love every live Rush album and the Rage Against the Machine Live At the grand Olympic Auditorium, but now moving on to this cd it rocks.  The orchestra gives these songs new life and it sounds great.  I saw Metallica quite awhile ago and they were terrible so I always use to avoid this cd but a couple weeks ago I decide to give it another chance since this is there only live album and I don't see any sign of a greatest hits cd coming along any time soon so this as close as your gonna get to a greatest hits album.  IF your a die hard fan of Metallica and don't care that they're sell outs and there still a great band pick this one up.  My favorites are Battery, MOP, Nothing Else Matters and Enter Sandman(Enter Sandman is my least favorite tallica song).  If you have the disc give it another listen because you might be surprised of how good an album it really is.
1400034205|4.0|This classic novel about the search for meaning and authenticity could well have become stale and clichéd in the 60+ years since it was written, but it's testament to Maugham's fine writing that it hasn't done so. \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is the story of Larry Darrell, an unassuming young man in post-WWI America, who inexplicably decides not to follow the lead of his smart Chicago friends, and instead embarks on a search for self. Post-1960's, this doesn't sound all that radical or unusual, but one can imagine how this must have struck Maugham's audience at the time. Darrell strikes out for France to study, naively believing he's still going to marry the beautiful Isabel back in Chicago, just as Isabel naively assumes Larry will \\"grow out of it\\" in a year. Instead Larry wanders, working in a coal mine, doing a stint as a farm laborer, learning from the sages in India.     Maugham himself is the unnamed narrator, puzzling over what Larry is doing but seeing the resulting calm and peace he achieves. Maugham creates some wonderful characters. There's the gorgeous Isabel, thoughtlessly well-meaning, but in reality self-centered and deluded, believing she can somehow win Larry back someday. And there's the dilettante, bon vivant Uncle Elliot, a caricature of society at the time, but with a huge streak of generosity in his heart. The details of post-WWI life were fascinating, especially the sense of overwhelming optimism as America was coming into its own. This novel, considered Maugham's best, is simply a wonderful read.    In 1946, the movie version was released with Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney in the leads. [[ASIN:B0007PALVQ The Razor's Edge]] It's a wonderful period piece, despite the far less nuanced characters. Bill Murray also made the film much later [[ASIN:B000069HYF The Razor's Edge]]. I can't imagine it and wasn't tempted to take a look. Read the book first--you won't regret it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I've long heard about this British television series and finally ordered it for myself.  What followed was one of the finest times I've spent watching the TV.  This is a wonderful adaptation.   It tells the story of two people, John Thornton and Margaret Hale, who overcome prejudices and learn the world is more than they thought.  John Thornton is a mill owner from the northern town of Milton.  Margaret Hale is a parsons daughter from the southern town of Helston.  When Margaret and her family first move to Milton, she is horrified by what she sees.  She is appalled by the rough ways of John Thornton.  But over time, she comes to see he is an honorable man who truly cares about the people he has working for him.  John Thornton is a man who has risen out of the ashes of what his father did to the family and is a man of integrity and honour.  He is immediately drawn to Margaret though he feels he is not worthy of her affections.  The casting in this series is brilliant; the barely contained passion portrayed by the oh so handsome Richard Armitage and the ethereal innocent beauty of Margaret played by Daniela Denby-Ashe.  Sinead Cusak as John's very protective mother and Brendan Coyle as the admirable union leader Higgins - each brings a richness to this production.  Also of note is the fascinating clashes between rich and poor; between the mill owners and the people who work for them.  The scenery itself, from the hauntingly beautiful but deadly mill, to the idyllic countryside of Helston becomes an important backdrop to this romantic tale of two people who fall in love.  I can not recommend this series highly enough and I've already watched it numerous times myself.  Each time has been a treat and I've grown to love it even more with each viewing of this incredibly romantic tale.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|If you like watching two of the coolest guys in the Western world running around having a good time for a couple of hours, this movie is for you! The daring duo of George Clooney and Brad Pitt team up for a third time to destroy the business of a bad guy who bilked their friend out of his half interest in the glitziest hotel on the Strip.  Ocean's 13 has more movie magic than ever--my term for impossible feats that seem absurdly easy to pull off or plot points that don't make sense--but no one should care. Somehow these wildly successful movies work their charm without sex, abusive language or violence. One can quibble with whether it's better or worse than 12--but who really cares? These movies are just good fun--period.
B000URDEB0|2.0|I just came back from a \\"Nightwish\\" concert in Dallas. I had listened to this album previously and I already seriously disliked the new singer, but things got a lot worst after watching them live. First of all, musically, this album contains probably some of the most ambitious music Tuomas Huolopainen has ever written. The orchestration and concept of the album is just HUGE and could have been catalogued as an achievement if not for the horribly weak main vocals and the horrid screaming Marco Hietala does throughout the album.    Now coming back to my Dallas experience, I gotta say that I hated the way Marco Hietala sang \\"Bye bye beautiful\\" with all that anger against Tarja. Who the hell does he think he is to spew like that against the person WHO MADE FAMOUS THE BAND HE PLAYS IN!!! Tarja was if not the soul (being Tuomas the soul and creator of the band), one of the main factors for Nightwish success and credibility. They were not a mainstream band, they were a musical band, a very ambitious one.    Later after recovering from the bad feeling of \\"Bye bye beautiful\\", came the moment when Anette sang \\"Come cover me\\" (my favorite all time Nightwish tune). Then the feeling was horrible. Something was terribly going wrong. I just have to say that I didn't recognize the song until the chorus. I felt something like what Maria Callas fans should feel when they hear Filippa Giordano sing Casta Diva. Then something started to grow over me. I hated this band. This was not the Nightwish I used to love. When they sang Wishmaster as an encore I thought, \\"What a joke! Why don't they change their name and leave our memories alone! How do I regret coming to this concert!\\"    When I went back to the hotel I started to read all about Tarja's dismissal, and I couldn't but line by her side. How can they kick her out with a letter after a concert and then publish it in their website! That was just horrible, enough to break anyone's heart. What a bunch of cowards! Now, all of those excuses of Tarja \\"not being interested in the band as before\\" I think are just arguments to hide the main reason for Tarja's dismissal. THEY WANTED TO GO MAINSTREAM. I think they probably hated that bands like Evanescence got a lot more attention than they did. Now, what a horrible way to do it. Not only not thanking Tarja's years of being the trademark sound of Nightwish, but also hiring a joke for a singer. I'm sorry Anette, nothing personal but your voice sucks. You should sing pop or do backing vocals for Filippa Giordano. You got nothing to do singing Tarja's songs. About Marco, I hate him for the reason that Nightwish started to change from his arrival. He definitively started changing the band. Sharing vocals with Tarja (what did they want to sound like, Therion???) already made albums from Century Child weaker, and Tuomas also showed his attempts of going poppier, just listen to Tarja's voice on Once, in tracks like Nemo, nothing personal against this one, but just listed how Tarja's voice is more mellow and poppy than ever. They already wanted to sell out, but needed to cut one head to do it completely. That was Tarja's. What a shame.    I am waiting for Tarja's offering coming in November 19. Whatever it is, I'm sure it will be thousand times better than this piece of crap. I'm sorry Tuomas, I still respect you, but do yourself a favor and change the name to this joke that \\"Nightwish\\" has become.

B000002LVB|4.0|The Velvet Underground's fourth album (and final studio recording with de facto leader Lou Reed) is a far cry from the wigged-out scumbucket art rock of their first two records, and almost as far removed from the spooky introspective pop of their third. In fact, Loaded sounds like nothing more or less than a bona fide pop album, with most of the usual trappings- there are plenty of catchy melodies, playful lyrics, and singalong vocals. The guitars are clean and punchy, without any of the feedback-mashing death dirges of old, while drummers Billy Yule, Doug Yule, Adrian Barber, and Tommy Castanero (who all took turns sitting in for the then-pregnant Maureen Tucker) replace the group's unsettlingly primal rhythms with a more standard, straight-ahead rock `n' roll sound. Meanwhile, Lou Reed's lyrics shift their focus away from detached urban nightmares and drug-addled apocalypse poetry. Instead, he sings about broken hearts, solitary rodeo performers, and aging actresses.    Seems like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it? I mean, wouldn't this kind of thing just completely strip the band of its essence? Well, here's the thing- no matter how far they ventured into the world of sonic art, the Velvets were always a rock `n' roll band at heart. Even their most unearthly sound explorations (think \\"Heroin,\\" \\"Sister Ray,\\" and \\"The Murder Mystery\\") had their feet firmly planted in three chords and a charging rhythm. The group's art wouldn't have meant jack squat if it wasn't backed by great songwriting, and that's exactly what made their sound work. Loaded simply strips Lou's songs and the band's performance to its very essence.    On the album's best moments, the listener is brought face to face with Lou Reed's unique genius. \\"Sweet Jane\\" is one of the great three (well, to be fair, four) chord rockers, an instantly memorable pop masterpiece with lyrics that reveal Reed's fondness for affectionate, offbeat character studies. \\"Rock `n' Roll\\" is a fitting tribute to the upliftingpower of... well, rock `n' roll. \\"Who Loves The Sun\\" is slice of sweet melancholy with dreamy vocals and poetically bitter lyrics, while \\"Train Round The Bend\\" is a rollicking R&b-tinged pounder. \\"Cool It Down\\" is slinky and superbly strange, while \\"New Age\\" is a subtly rocking ballad with some truly poetic lyrics. The album closes out with the epic, beautiful \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin',\\" whose gospelly refrain oughtta reverberate in your head for the rest of time.    But this still does have its weaker moments. \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" is, as others have noted, more annoying than anything else. Its lyrics are gratingly childish, while its (admittedly exuberant) melody wears thin pretty quickly. \\"I Found A Reason\\" is an overly stylized doo-wop throwback, complete with a spoken bridge and wordless backup vocals. It could have been a good song, but it simply sounds clichéd and underwritten. Finally, \\"Head Held High\\" is little more than an excuse for Reed to shout his head of in a most irritating manner.    Aside from these unfortunate missteps, Loaded is a wonderful album- it's a shame that Reed left the band in disgust soon after this was recorded. The Velvet Underground released one more album after Reed's departure (1973's Squeeze, which really was a VU album in name only, and is now out of print) before quietly disappearing. The rest is history.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|If you haven't seen the show, you will find it very worthwhile when you do. Dexter is an incredible,bad/good guy.  I watched it on Showtime, and had to own it. I have shared it with a few people that didn't see it on tv, and they all agree. Worth every penny to own, because once is not enough.
0192853619|5.0|This book is a great overview of higher level mathematics.  It uses examples that anyone with basic high school math skills can understand.  The language is not overly simplistic, nor is it hard to follow.  A great value and a great book.

0440238609|1.0|This is a book that is being marketed to 8-12 year olds. While it is well written it is inappropriate for anyone under 16. Would you let your 9 year old read Stephen King's Salem Lot? If the answer is no, then don't let them read this. The book is about a girl investigating the disappearance of some friends. She discovers that her parents are involved in the kidnap, torture and murder of school age children.

1400079179|5.0|As the author of, [[ASIN:1419671502 The Second Virgin Birth]], I have to say that this book by Dan Brown is very believable, with well developed-characters and amazing dialogue that surrounds an action-packed story that will keep you guessing the entire time.  I read it while sitting beside a computer so that I could look up every reference to paintings, etc. Made the book more enjoyable and added just a bit of believability.
1416523359|5.0|Though a very different kind of book than you would expect from King, this story stays with you. Or it did with me, just as the Talisman did. You know how you would be driving over a bridge after reading The Talisman and think \\" what if i flip ? \\" ? I got the same types of feelings and thoughts that were wrapped up in the webs of Lisey's Story. Thinking about the other places and bools. The relationship between them makes you think he is describing his and Tabitha's relationship ,but it struck home as well. It is well worth the read ! I loved it and will read it again.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's life story is a chilling account of life under Islamic rule, how hatred of the U.S. and western culture is the direct result of Islamic teaching, and how she was able to escape and enjoy freedom in the western world. The frightening part is how she continued to have a reasonable fear of retribution from muslims for telling her story and speaking her mind - a right we take for granted. I think this book would change the minds of people who believe that accommodating Islamic radicalism will make us safe.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Amazingly original (I never read the book) and VERY funny! We saw it several times in the theatre just to catch all the little things going on in the background. For instance: Check out what happens with all 7 brothers at the end--one brother ends up going a \\"different direction.\\" Michelle Pfeiffer--the best witch EVER! Robert De Niro--fantastic! The two lead characters--believable romance. Hilariously entertaining movie!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Nice product, but it's not even dubbed in spanish, and it doesn't even have subtitles in spanish.
B000069KGM|5.0|Terry Kath's guitar playing on this album is incredible.  In fact, if it had not been for Kath's awesome guitar solos, the band may have never gotten a record deal.  Many people who know Chicago from their 80's and 90's ballads don't even realize this is the same band when they hear this record.  Since Kath died in 1978 they are partially right.  But, this album rocks with a raw energey that Chicago never duplicated on later albums.  This is a must own for any rock and roll fan or jazz rock fan!
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is a film that every generation should see.  My 11-year-old had not seen it and we made sure he watched with us.  We had to explain some references, of course (like the \\"flouride\\" debate) but that was part of the experience.  Unfortunately, the film is all too much like \\"the real world.\\"
B000UJBYD8|4.0|As a loyal Cult follower since the 80s, I enjoy hearing anything they create. I'd rate this 2 CD set as the better deal than the \\"regular\\" CD. It may not be as memorable as their last release, but nevertheless, it's still Cult. There are more similarities to the \\"Love\\" sound, and some of Ian Astbury's fondness of Jim Morrison are evident also. Overall, this is good listening.
0761145613|5.0|This is the 5th year I have owned this calendar.  The illustrations are whimsical but the best part is that you don't have to try to squeeze in everyone's plans into a litle tiny box as you would on a standard calendar.  With my family of four, we have a space for each member and  the last column is labeled 'family'.  Every morning my son will look at the day and tell me who is doing what and when.  My kids also enjoy putting the stickers on special days (or not special at all, you get TONS of stickers).  I highly recommend this calendar for any busy family.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I heard Loreena McKennitt on NPR a couple weekends ago, waking up to her beautiful singing. I ordered the 2CD + DVD set immediately and got it yesterday. I listened to both CDs immediately and can't wait to put in the DVD. What a treat to relax to Ms. McKennitt's beautiful singing. I highly recommend this package to anyone who enjoys Celtic music.
B000W07EKW|5.0|I am a fan of serious literate movies and also a fan of action flicks (a mystery writer and also a writer of serious literary fiction as you can see from my web site [...]) and the Bourne series is a canny, sometimes brilliant hybrid of genres.  Yes, there's exciting, breathtaking action all the way through, but there's a great deal more.  The movies start with a man who's lost his identity, and the loss goes much deeper than he realizes.  He seeks both knowledge and revenge once the depth of his damage becomes clearer, and learning who he really is and what he's done, and what the cost has been to others, is a terrible but thrilling burden (for us, anyway).  What the reviewer below completely missed is the subtle, touching performance by Matt Damon who does a great deal with not a lot of dialogue--though the reviewer below exaggerates about the script.  Damon is remarkable.  The other cast members along the way, like the wonderful Franka Potente from \\"Run Lola Run\\" and of course the inimitable Joan Allen add depth, humor, passion, darkness.  At a time when government policies are so controversial, the trilogy is a powerful condemnation of victory at any cost thanks to Matt Damon's layered, sophisticated performance.  Yes, there is bravura camera work that some people don't like, and utterly original long sequences that are close to astonishing, but there's also real heart to this movie, thanks to Damon, who by the way has a superb ear for languages.  He listens.  Watch him watch the world around him and listen to it, scanning for threats and clues--you won't be disappointed if you're open minded.
0451209338|5.0|Silva writes a past-paced, ferocious opening to his Gabriel Allon series of books with this excellent thriller.  He goes a step beyond other thriller writers -- including Le Carre -- with compelling action and authentic characters.  He paints his assassins as humans with \\"issues\\" stemming from their bloody occupation.  Silva is not reluctant to get into issues of morality, especially the endless bitterness between Jew and Palestinian.  And always, his plots spin and turn and what you think is real isn't always...but sometimes it is.  Once you start this book, you'll not set it down easily (I'm writing this at 4:30 a.m., if that gives you a clue...)  All in all, a very good read.
0316010669|4.0|I like Malcolm Gladwell.  He's criticized by some for a lack of academic rigor.  While I agree that his work tends to focus more on witticisms, I consider that fact to be mostly positive.  Even though I enjoy intellectual people, I have a distaste for some aspects of academia.  Academics argue that information is lost when technical ideas are distilled into common language.  But even if that's partially true, I think it's more important for an idea to be widely understood by the general populous--because that's when an idea really takes on power.    For an idea to really take on that power, you have to feel it.  There's a possibility for danger in that sentiment, because it's possible to feel something that's not true.  But if something's true, AND you can feel it--that's a powerful idea with ability to spread.    Malcolm Gladwell does an excellent job of spreading ideas.  Most of them are great.  Those that aren't great aren't a big deal, because they can be refined and corrected in the robust discussion that his books promote.

0586091718|4.0|I've been floating around the quantum physics/holographic paradigm schools of thought for a while and have lots of books on the subjects.  I finally got around to this book after being inspired to look it up after reading about it in a few internet articles. After looking at dozens of excerpts, I got really excited about buying it and I can honestly say I was initially very satisfied with it- but only for so long.<br /><br />In the first two or three chapters Talbot draws heavily from scientific fields like physics or psychology to set the grounds for how we have the ability to affect reality. Then \\"I Sing the Body Holographic\\"  To me this is the best part of the book.  About halfway through, in the chapter \\"a pocketful of miracles\\", I felt that Talbot's own bias started to blur the lines between truth and questionable claims just a tad.  Although Talbot does give endless sourced examples of mind over matter event - so many it can gets a little monotonous, there are literally hundreds of sources. Later in the book I felt that some of the information he supports is fairly dubious. But don't let that taint your attitude towards this book; a lot of the crazy stuff actually checks out (one of the events dealing with Jack Schwarz was given a negative review in another post claiming it never happened, but after meticulous research on my part I found out it did).<br /><br />After finishing this book, I feel like it was worth my time, but mainly the first half rather than the end. The book is more credible than many of the new-age works I've read. Sadly, books like [[ASIN:1583940677 Nothing in This Book Is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are]] get more attention and give the genre a bad name. I'd definitely recommend Holographic Universe if you have some cash to spare and an insatiable thirst for the wacky and weird.  However, if you want a more professional point of view on these types of things, I recommend the following: [[ASIN:0415289793 Wholeness and the Implicate Order (Routledge Classics)]], [[ASIN:0452288592 Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View]], [[ASIN:0874777984 The Self-Aware Universe]], [[ASIN:0060858834 The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul]], or something by Karl H.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Everything about this DVD is a triumph!  The concert is fantastic!  David Bowie's rendition of Comfortably Numb must be heard to be believed.  For long time Floyd fans the performance of Echoes on here will send shivers down your spine!  The chemistry between Richard Wright and Gilmour is spot on.  The making of documentary is great!  I loved finding out how David learned to play saxaphone and I never knew until seeing this concert that it was him on the On an Island CD playing it.  The tour documentary is well done and very entertaining!  Roger Waters fans take note he's in there, hanging out and talking on the phone with Dave.  Footage I never expected to see!  Very cool indeed!  Audio and video quality are top notch.  If I could complain about anything it would be the lack of a DTS audio track. Otherwise this is one of the best concert DVD's I've ever seen and I own many.
B000VI70X6|5.0|I was at both of the concerts at Madison Square Garden. No one compares to Shakira. My favorite singer of all time in all the world. I can't wait to get this dvd in my hands. I love when she sings Whenever Wherever and goes into the audience. It is madness!! She also blew me a kiss when she sang Underneath Your Clothes. Though she is an international star she remains humble and down to earth and has dedicated much of her time and effort to helping others. Que viva Shakira!
B000Y179KO|3.0|Wow, a very long wait for a new Eagles studio album. I really wanted to like it, but the finished product is mighty sleepy. Very VERY slow album for me. When \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" came out, it seemed like the band was itching to give the world a really great Eagles album. The playing on that album was amazing and the new songs had \\"that thing\\" that makes Eagles songs great, memorable Eagles songs.    With this album, I don't hear much of that, and when I do (as expected) they are in Henley's tracks. But they seem better suited to a Henley solo album than an Eagles album. I suppose the argument could be made that they should've just made a kick a$$ single album. However, if you're an Eagles fan (which I am, but by no means a die-hard)a double album would be a great gift for such a long wait. However, it seems that the band doesn't have the fire that it once did. The lush Eagle harmonies are there in spades, but some of the songs are pretty mediocre. Especially Frey's which, unfortunately, has always been the case for me. Timothy B. Schmidt's songs stand up, but Frey's and even Walsh's just don't. One thing about Henley, the guy's lyrically got it together. He might gripe a lot, but I so prefer his lyrics to Frey's.    Not a horrible album, but if you're expecting \\"Hotel California\\" maybe next time.

B000PKG6TE|5.0|If [[ASIN:B0007QJ1MK Lullabies to Paralyze]] had a fault, it was its heavy-handed attempt at sophistication.  The album attempted to be something that Queens of the Stone Age are not, and that is elegant.  Era Vulgaris, on the other hand, from its title down to its pounding bass, seeks no elegance, and instead proves to be a more sophisticated work as a result.  What seems cobbled-together at first reveals itself to be a well balanced and well rounded piece of music.<br /><br />I don't believe that Era Vulgaris is the best album to arrive in this year.  I would deem both the Arcade Fire's [[ASIN:B000MGUZMU Neon Bible]] and Nine Inch Nail's [[ASIN:B000O178BY Year Zero]] to be \\"better\\" albums, in terms of their craft and innovation.  But I enjoy Era Vulgaris more, if only because it manages to contain a wider diversity of noise.  It manages to strike a delicate balance between variety and cohesiveness, and pack-in unthinkable numbers of moments that surprise, intrigue, and even amuse.  Is Era Vulgaris going to win a Grammy?  I doubt it.  Will it be in my CD player a decade from now?  I'm sure it will be.
0439882826|5.0|I saw this book a week or two ago at the bookstore. I told everyone I knew this is what I want for Christmas. Imagine my surprise when I came home today and found that my girlfriend had bought it for me for our anniversary! Way to go Lacee! The book is incredible. I am very impressed with it and highly recommend it to all true Star Wars fans and casual viewers alike. The lightsaber battle on the last page is awesome, and best of all this book does not contain any prequel crap at all.
B000XPOB0M|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I thought it was pretty creepy and the actress and actors did a good job!  It kept my nerves on edge the whole time.
0743298039|3.0|As my title states, this was a decent book and it kept my attention. However, some of the stuff in the book was unnecessary and at times, I felt like I was reading a script from \\"Days of Our Lives\\". Just got sort of soap opera-ish.     Margaret and her whole 'twin story' in my opinion was a waste of time. I guess that the author picked Margaret based on some vibes she picked up in Margaret's written words that made her think she might be a twin (??). Um, okay, but this adds nothing to the story in my opinion.    Hester's disappearance and reappearance- This should've been more fleshed out and a different outcome for her story would've been more satisfying. The way it turned out, again, like a soap opera...    Kind of a predictable ending, especially when all the sudden the more rough of the twins suddenly becomes the head of the household without much as a sentence to explain it (at first).    Was anybody else aware of the misuse of the word \\"Regime\\" in the book? I believe the author was looking for the word 'regimen' but used 'regime' in spots where it shouldn't have been used. The editor should've caught that. Peeve...    Having said all that, the book was okay. I enjoyed it better than some others that received higher praise this year (\\"the road\\"- blech!).   It definitely is NOT a ghost story and I was sort of pulled into buying it thinking that's what it was.     Still, a good work of fiction to pass a few days.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This film is an excellent exposure of the fraud being perpetrated by the insurance industry, HMO's, drug companies, the AMA and all of our bought and paid for politicians. A higher quality of healthcare at no cost exists in many modern industrial countries like Canada, France and the UK yet we in the USA continue to sell healthcare so that CEO's of HMO's become multi-millionaires while our political representatives are well paid to look the other way. Michael Moore tells the whole story with humor and compassion in this entertaining and informative film. I'm sure the healthcare criminals would like to supress this film.
0380789035|3.0|I enjoyed American Gods.  However my mistake was reading Stardust and Neverwhere first.  I didn't feel any kind of connection with the central character Shadow.  I felt the characters and settings in this book did not live up to Stardust or Neverwhere.
B000SZLSB2|1.0|This CD could be a tiny bit worse, seeing as I kinda like ONE song on it: Give Me Some Love. The rest is slow, monotonous and has tired and annoying vocals. The Stars, or the Heavens above gave Him decent lyrical content but gave His overall vibe a boring one. IMO, this is an absolute snooze-fest. Sure, My brother gets into this for some reason (Coincidentally, they're both Capricorns. But maybe that's no coincidence at all...).<br /><br />Anyway, like I've voiced time and time again, this CD isn't worth the time and energy that they put into recording this at the studio. I wouldn't purchase this CD unless...<br /><br />Someone wanted it for their birthday/Christmas<br />It was 2 bucks somewhere<br />My Life depended on it<br /><br />Since My brother probably owns it already, I will pass on it...<br /><br />TWICE!!<br /><br />1.2 stars.

It's a beautiful movie, and teh uncompressed PCM sounds fantastic on my Onkyo 605. Although you may have seen it B4, you have not seen it like this. Great job Disney you actually make my PS3 worth something...
0061547832|5.0|Each chapter of this book has two parts. One \\"written\\" by Donald Trump and the other by Bill Zanker. Bill's contribution is short and precise. Frankly, I learned more reading Bill's part than Donald's.   I think this is not a book for everyone. The book is really for those who want to quantum leap their business and thoughts. I didn't like the chapter about revenge. I also didn't appreciate Donald citing well known name like Lee Iacocca, Angela Jolie, Mark Cuban, and many other saying negative things about them. What is the point of doing that in a book that is supposed to last? Therefore, I gave the book 4 stars. I'm still recommending it.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This movie is interesting, has wonderful acting, and has places that are funny, as well as touching.  It's the story of a boy who decides to follow his own dream, and not the dream of his father.  The characters evolve through the movie in very endearing ways.    The language is not good.  They swear a lot, but it is almost understandable in the context of the film due to the place in which they live, and the hardships they are facing.    I highly recommend this movie.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
0380804557|5.0|What can I say about Stardust?  Best book I've EVER read.  My best friend recommended this book to my sister as the best book he had ever read, who in turn recommended it to me as the best book she had ever read, and now I pass this review to anyone else as the best book I've ever read.<br /><br />After finishing Stardust, I went out and bought Neverwhere, Good Omens, and American Gods.  I usually don't like fantasy, or reading even, but Neil Gaiman has me hooked!

0143034545|4.0|David Allen through this series of 'essays' broadens the GTD concept. One major advantage of this book over his previous one is that the GTD framework is extended past the 'operational' aspects of getting things done. For followers of GTD or those wanting a fresh look at managing today's ever conflicting demands, it's well worth a read.

0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult's books are always entertaining, thought-provoking, and highly emotional.  My Sister's Keeper is easily one of my favorite's, and inspired me to write a law review note on the topic.  This is a fascinating issue on many levels.  Should we allow parents to have the right to create another child for the purpose of saving an existing one?  How does that effect not only the so-called \\"savior sibling\\" but the existing child?  What about the other family dynamics?  Picoult deals with all of these issues and more.     Picoult's novels always excellently portray different points of views, and this book is no exception.  I found especially interesting the times the father and the brother were narrating - not the people you automatically think will be affected, but they provide fascinating insights into the family.     I recommend all of Picoult's books, but my other favorites are: Salem Falls, Mercy, and The Pact.

0345347951|4.0|This book represents Mr. Clarke's early (1950s) attempt to explore humanity's role in the cosmos.  Are there other intelligent civilizations in the Universe?  What are they like?  How does Man fit into the grand scheme?  The story starts as a large number of ultra-powerful space ships approach Earth.  It is clear that mankind has no weapon that can resist them, but instead of conquering Earth and enslaving or destroying the inhabitants, the Overlords usher in a Golden Age for mankind.  They give fabulous technologies and medicines to humankind that greatly increase their lifespan and reduce the amount of menial work that must be done.  Questions remain though, who are the Overlords, what do they want and what is their ultimate goal, and are they the only other intelligent species in the Universe?<br /><br />Even though written in the 50s, this novel is as compelling and relevant today as when it was first released.  There are several interesting plot twists along the way, and in typical Clarke fashion the story ends with more questions than answers.  The book is divided into three sections each separated in time by decades.  In the first, the Overlords arrive and dominate the Earth.  In the second section, set several generations later, the Overlords have transformed Earth into a paradise.  In the final section, the state of paradise is about to end, but why?  The story in each major section follows a protagonist who wants to devine the true intentions of the Overloads and their leader Karellan.  The only negative comment that I have about this story is that `paranormal forces' play a key element in the plot line.  A weak plot device, particularly for someone as scientifically oriented as Clarke.  This may have been compelling fifty years ago, but Clarke himself has publicly admitted that he would change this part of the story now if he could.<br /><br />Not Clarke's best, but a quick, easy read that you won't be able to put down.  Definitely recommended.

B000UO338W|4.0|This is the album that probably should have come after 'Psalm 69'.  The album is unrelenting from beginning to end and what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in raw aggression.  If you liked what Al has done since Psalm 69  and don't have a problem with Bush bashing then you will like this record.  If you like his more synth based earlier records better then you know that Ministry left that sound behind a long time ago and its time to get over it.<br />  That being said this is not Ministry's best album but it is certainly not their worst either. While I too still hope that it will not be his last, if it is then it is a fitting end for one of industrial musics most enigmatic artists.  This album is pure mayhem and rage and a blast in the face to the president and his followers.  Good luck Al, see you on tour!
0767827791|5.0|Got this DVD specifically for the song \\"Moonglow\\". I saw the movie \\"Picnic\\" when it first came out in the fifties. The scene where Kim Novak and William Holden dance on the dock to \\"Moonglow\\" I'll never forget. It was so romantic. I guess the song/movie made a definite impact on me and when I hear it...it reminds me of when I was a kid.  (before movies were rated)

He's 19 months old and plays with his sister with the attached toys. It's a must have for any new baby! It is well built and even stands up to my son's not so gentle touch. It stores easy when not in use, and is easy to clean. This is definately worth the money you pay for it. I just can't help but sing the praises of this wonderful toy!!!!
1580176941|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the authors demonstrate this book's cookie decorating techniques at a store in Brooklyn on Sunday, and I bought two copies--one for me and one for a friend who always does a holiday cookie swap. I read it the same night, and immediately bid on three lots of cookie cutters on Ebay! I'm hooked, and I can't wait to try all their tips for cookie decorating. One of the smartest makes your cookies come out evenly, which has been a problem in the past. You just use two thin pieces of wood and roll your rolling pin along them to produce a perfectly even dough for cutting. The book is full of resources and fun ideas, but what captured my imagination was all the gorgeous color photographs! I think this is an amazing gift for any baker on your list, and you could make it extra special by topping your package with a fun cookie cutter. This isn't just a holiday book, either--reading it makes you think of all kinds of cookie \\"occasions\\". I'm planning to make cookies with my niece over Thanksgiving, and I can't wait!
B000W4KT64|5.0|I am a middle-aged woman who had a crush on John Travolta when I was a youngster.  Having enjoyed the original Hairspray movie on dvd with my daughters the 3 of us decided to go to this movie together.  My girls (11 and 13) enjoyed the movie and the music.  Me, I couldn't stop laughing at John Travolta. Everytime I laughed I think I heard every other middle-aged woman in the theater laugh too. He was just too funny.  From the hunk of a guy I remember in Saturday Night Fever and Grease, to a shy and overweight mother afraid to leave the house - this movie is a must see for any woman who even remotely liked John Travolta as a teen.  It is also a great movie for any individual who enjoys musicals and dancing.

0345409671|2.0|I think it's almost inevitable in many writers careers when they become repetitive, and boring, relying more on their 'big name' to sell their books than actual solid writing.  I think a writer able to crank off 500 pages of extremely mediocore stuff that gets publish just based on the past instead of good writing...extremely disappointing! If a never published writer had submitted this, an editor would have chucked it in the bin even if after trying to valiantly read it. Even someone submitting a 2nd or 3rd book would have been forced to do many revisions and 'cuts' if they wanted it published. She broke so many of the \\"cardinal\\" rules of good writing (but in a bad way!) like not describing your own descriptions with more descriptions just to name one, but because of her name, the publishing house printed up this drivel for the public to consume. Well, I spit mine back out distastefully.<br /><br />Compared to her earlier works the \\"Victim\\" characters in this novel are flat and uninteresting, nothing to really grab one about them, yet we have 200 pages of boring stuff about an \\"Uncle\\" they used to love that we have to read about! The idea of Lestat being asked to be the Devil's lieutenant was a good idea, no doubt of that. But Rice's descriptions of heaven and hell that Lestat is allowed to see is too often filled with stereotypical garbage: \\"singing voices, laughter, golden lights\\", and \\"God\\" who is so agonized with his sinners, begging with big brown puppy dog eyes for them all to be good!<br /><br />Even Lestat, one of my favourite characters who is \\"self-admittedly\\" vain of his beauty and intelligence, often impulsive and petulant, yet charming just the same, has lost his edge in this novel. Anne Rice lost it for him. Yes, at the end, readers were given a couple of mild eyebrow raising surprises, but after being forced to read 400 previous pages of infuriatingly pathetic writing, it just doesn't make your literary orgasm very intense, a couple of squeezes and back to life.<br /><br />I recently bought this book, along with Blackwood Farms, to round out my vampire chronicles collection, and I won't get rid of them, but I have absolutely no desire to read them again. They will stay on the shelves to make me appreciate more the older ones in the series, Queen of the Damned, and my favourite, The Tale of the Body Thief, when Rice was sharp and edgy, and not taken over by the Christ and God themes she is pushing these days. One last comment: Extremely tired of a nearly an entire book written as someone telling a story in their past, with no current action. That was interesting at first, but now it's just annoying.<br /><br />Everyone has their opinion, and hardcore fans of Anne Rice, ones who just because it's her praise anything she does, will be mad at my review, but this is honest opinion from a published writer, and often editor, and a book store owner who actually asks and listens to the public and what they have to stay about this author.I recently bought this book, along with Blackwood Farms, to round out my vampire chronicles collection, and I won't get rid of them, but I have absolutely no desire to read them again.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Showtime's creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.    It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel. Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.    But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.    And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!
B0002STNQ2|5.0|Michael Crichton, author of such bestsellers as Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain, has proven himself repeatedly to be one of the foremost science-fiction writers and storytellers of our time. One of his more recent novels, Prey, resoundingly confirms this fact, continuing in the Crichton tradition of terrifying monsters, frightening technology, and addictive plotlines. The novel is delivered with relentlessly polished suspense and contains very relevant, even disturbing discussions of a technology that is almost upon us. Impeccable pacing, effective characterization, and fascinating scientific asides make the novel both thrilling and instructive. The book will captivate not only literary thrill-seekers but also anyone with an interest in or concern for the dangers of an increasingly technological world.    Pacing    Crichton has shown himself to be a master of suspense, and this novel is further proof of his story-telling prowess. The disaster unfolds in such a way that the plot becomes neither wearisome nor stale, and the reader is continually eager to read on. The pacing of the novel over the three main sections creates suspense and a feeling of progressive urgency that culminates in a gripping climax.    The fist third of the novel is characterized by intrigue and mystery, with subtle hints of impending calamity. The narrator and protagonist Jack, an out-of-work computer programmer and married father of three young kids, begins to notice strange things happening around his home. His son's Gameboy inexplicably stops working. He discovers a strange plastic cube hidden in his bedroom. More disturbingly, his infant daughter suddenly turns purple, evidence of uniform bruising all over her body. These bizarre occurrences baffle Jack and the reader alike, and both search uneasily for the connection between these disconcerting incidents. A further element of intrigue is introduced with Jack's wife, a high-level executive at a nanotechnology design and manufacturingfirm. Jack notices that lately she has been acting strange: coming home late and lying about where she has been, displaying drastic mood swings, and evasive about what she is doing at her work. Jack suspects that she may be on drugs or having an affair. The strange events and mysterious behavior of Jack's wife create an atmosphere of uneasy anticipation, and the reader is propelled forward by a need to discover the truth.    In the middle third of the novel the overt threat is revealed, and the pace of the story picks up to match the rising terror. Jack finally decides to take action when his wife gets in a serious car crash and he learns that her company is somehow involved in the accident. He arrives at the company manufacturing plant and soon finds that things have gone terribly wrong: the plant has lost control of a swarm of nanoparticles that it created, and the rogue swarm--able to reproduce, evolve, and kill--has entrapped Jack and the company scientists in the facility. Over a series of high-intensity episodes in which Jack ventures outside of the plant and confronts the swarm, the reader observes the terrifying rapidity at which the swarm is able to evolve and advance into a more dangerous entity. Throughout the action-packed middle section the reader is frightened but enthralled, swept irresistibly on by the accelerating pace.    Crichton pulls out all the stops in the final section of the book, and the reader is sucked into the suspense and action of the riveting finale. As Jack embarks on his final confrontation with the swarm, Crichton tantalizes the reader by slowing the pace down and giving vivid descriptions, a technique that produces palpable tension and an almost cinematic experience. When the moment of action comes, chaos erupts in true Crichton fashion, and the reader fully departs this world and enters the whirlwind exhilaration of the story. The plot is further motivated by the shocking twists and revelations that come as Jack finally discovers the truth about his wife and the company. Crichton's masterful command of pacing keeps the pages turning and the excitement level high. Any reader looking for a thrilling experience that virtually reads itself will not be let down.    Characterization    For all of Crichton's skill in creating suspense, no reader would maintain interest for long if the characters weren't realistic. Fortunately, the author's ability at crafting an exciting plot is matched by his talent for creating believable and engaging characters, especially with respect to the Jack and the monstrous swarm. The effective characterization of Jack and the swarm allows the readers to connect on a more personal level to the story.    Jack's believability as a character makes the reader care about his ordeal and become involved in the story. As the first-person narrator, the character of Jack has considerable influence on how the story comes across, and his behavior, thoughts, and voice--always in the forefront--are subject to constant scrutiny. The reader has no problem believing Jack to be a realistic person, however, and his internal and external reactions to the events of the plot seem not forced or artificial but perfectly plausible. Illustrative of this are his emotional responses to evidence he finds that seems to prove his wife is having an affair: he goes through stages of denial, anger, and depression that feel all too real. Further, the voice in which Jack tells the story is very readable, neither too colloquial nor too stiff. As a result, the reader can connect readily with Jack and relate to the challenges he is facing. Due to effective characterization, Jack's experiences come alive to the reader.     The antagonist of the novel, a swarm of microscopic nano-particles, might, in the hands of a lesser writer, come off as an unimpressive, even laughable threat; yet, Crichton is able to characterize the swarm in such a way as to make it a truly terrifying entity. Although comprised of millions of tiny, molecular-sized particles, the swarm is able to learn and evolve, and does so alarmingly quickly, progressing from a modest bio-hazard that needs to be contained into a unified force possessing real malice and intent on hunting down human life. The evolution of the swarm is made into a terrifying process: each time Jack confronts it he is up against something smarter, stronger, and more determined to destroy him. While perhaps the swarm doesn't capture the imagination quite like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park, its human-like malevolence and alien capabilities make it as fearsome as any prehistoric predator. Circhton's admirable characterization makes the reader care about the plot, the fate of Jack, and the menace of the swarm.    Scientific Discussions    While the novel succeeds as a science-fiction thriller even without them, the frequent scientific discussions in the text enhance the plot by providing a level of intellectual interest and contemporary relevance not often found in the myriad other works of the genre. Although these scientific inserts deal with such sophisticated concepts as, in Crichton's words, the \\"convergence of genetics, nano-technology, and distributed intelligence,\\" they are suited for a lay audience. Far from just supplemental material, the scientific discussions are an integral part of the novel and lend plausibility to the story, provide effective and needed breaks in the narrative, and leave the reader both enlightened and warned.    The discussions, which appear as thought-asides by Jack, give a scientific foundation to the entire premise of the plot--nano-technology gone terribly wrong--which might otherwise seem far-fetched and implausible. Crichton, using documented facts, convincingly demonstrates that it is entirely possible to create the tiny nano-machines in the novel, and it is not much of a stretch to imagine losing control of such technology, which can only be seen using a powerful microscope. The credibilityestablished by the science allows the reader to accept the situation without too skepticism and, as such, freely enjoy the story. The scientific discussions also do much to explain how the swarm is able to reproduce, learn, and evolve, thus quelling distracting questions and giving the monster frightening realism. The plausibility provided by the scientific inserts makes the story all the more gripping as the reader realizes the plot may well become a reality.     The scientific asides also function to break up long sections of narrative that otherwise might lose excitement and become tiring. This is especially effective in the middle section of the plot. Without the scientific discussions, the reader would soon tire of reading about the seemingly repetitious episodes of Jack facing off against the swarm. However, the scientific discussions interspersed in this section break up the narrative into more appropriately sized chunks. Further, the science becomes a tool of suspense by hinting at what the swarm is capable of doing and becoming. Thus, each new episode is fresh and exciting, and the middle section becomes one of rising suspense rather than monotonous delay.     The chief purposes of the scientific discussions are to inform the reader and forewarn of the disastrous consequences of irresponsible use of science and technology. The science is neither too academic nor too facile, accessible yet sophisticated enough that the reader really does gain an understanding and knowledge of the topics discussed. Furthermore, the discussions warn against of the dangers of greed-blinded science and the reckless use of technology. Ultimately, the scientific inserts cause the reader to ponder these real-world issues, and the novel is transformed from a simple science-fiction thriller into a commentary on contemporary issues that will soon have to be dealt with. Without them, the plot becomes considerably less plausible, relevant, or significant. Rather than writing just another entertaining but forgettable sci-fi thriller, Crichton has created a story worth remembering.    Is It Worth It?     This book gives the reader a face-paced, exhilarating experience. While not, perhaps, a \\"must read\\", Crichton's Prey is nevertheless highly recommended for anyone looking for a quality science-fiction suspense novel. So, if you want an exciting ride, have a schedule that permits getting hooked on reading for a few days, and don't mind learning a thing or two, this book is for you.
B00030590I|4.0|Zhang Yimou has been the darling of the arthouse crowd outside of China (\\"Raise High the Red Lantern\\", \\"Not One Less\\", \\"To Live\\", \\"Red Sorghum\\"), but his relationships with the Chinese government censors have not always been easy.  In this movie he tries to please everyone and to the extent that many people found \\"Hero\\" to be compelling cinema, he has succeeded.    Indeed one might say that with this movie Mr. Zhang has finally removed any doubt that he is the ultimate symbol of modern Chinese popular culture:  Aesthetically exciting, full of energy and movement, both engaging and appalling in his treatment of individual lives, and in the last analysis, more concerned with success and with keeping himself in good grace with the government than in making a stand for any kind of progressive politics.    \\"Hero\\" as has been said by many others, is a visually stunning peice of film-making and quite possibly the most beautiful film of  2004, and perhaps the five years before that as well.  The acting particularly by the dramatic leads (Tony Leung, and Maggie Cheung) is spectacular and supporting performances by Jet Li, Donny Yen and Chen Daoming are excellent.  Zhang Ziyi does her usual histrionic eye-candy routine.  Personally I am not a great fan, but she does her job and doesn't get in the way too much.  Why Tony Leung would have chosen her over the infinitely-sexier Maggie Cheung is way beyond me, but I digress.    The story is typically Chinese in that character is not nearly as important as plot.  The job of the actor is to suggest character depth based on the parameters of the character given.  In some cases e.g. Donnie Yen's aristocratic Sky, this can be done even with minimal lines.  In other cases, most obviously Jet Li's performance as Nameless, the character serves to drive the plot and is not meant to be psychologically complex or emotionally compelling.    My personal view of \\"Hero\\" is that it is Zhang Yimou's answer to the philosophical issues raised by AngLee's \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", in which duty and happiness are juxtaposed against one another, with the moral victory going to the latter.      For Zhang, the answer is not nearly as clear.  \\"Hero\\" ends with the defeat of the forces of beauty, skill and integrity, and the triumph of totalitarianism and unflinching vision.  QIn Shihuang is a monster, Zhang posits, but he is the only man who can unite the country and usher in 3000 years (or however many it currently is) of Chinese greatness.      As someone who had friends who were in Tiananmen Square the night the tanks rolled in, I can't say I have a lot of sympathy for this view.  As a successful movie maker and, at the time, the romantic partner of the aforementioned Miss Zhang, Zhang Yimou may have the luxury of being resigned to the course of Chinese history, but if China is to take it's rightful place among the great nations of the world, there'd better be a more robust moral compass in effect than the one that he seems to be backing in this movie.  Not everyone agrees with this view of course.  For a very well-thought-through argument against this position see Jenny Kwok Wah Lau's discussion of \\"Hero\\" in Jumpcut vol. 49.
B000WS4M36|5.0|F#A# was recorded at the Hotel2Tango in spring 1997 on a rented 16-track tape deck and supplemented with various field recordings. In the preceding year, the band had taken shape as a quasi-orchestral outfit involving most of the current players and had mounted a number of live performances combining multiple film projections with sense-rattling sonics., This is the first recorded document of godspeed as a large band and is soaring, fragile, awkward, heartbreaking stuff. Constellation released a vinyl-only pressing of 500 copies in August 1997, with LP jackets hand made by the label, the band, and various local artisans. It has since gone through many re-presses, with virtually all of the original packaging elements preserved. The opening monologue on side one (Dead Flag Blues) is taken from Incomplete Movie About Jail, an unfinished film by guitarist Efrim.
B00000IQW3|5.0|A campy classic from the 80's.  Lots of fun for folks from that generation.  I don't think many of today's kids will appreciate the \\"old\\" CG animation.  It's very dated, and doesn't go at the pace of an MTV video, so I don't think many from this generation will be able to sit through it without getting ants in thier pants.  But for anyone from my generation, you know, the 80's.  When were wore more clothing than we needed too, and actually feared pissing off our parents.  You'll enjoy it, as long as you're a SCI FI fan, and just enjoy what it is.
0765316889|4.0|As a sequel to \\"The Final Empire\\", \\"The Well of Ascension\\" answers the question that arises very often: what happens after the revolution? The good guys won, the tyrant is dead... what happens in \\"happily ever after\\"?  I don't want to give any spoilers, so I'll say only that I did like the way Sanderson answered this question - he is as realistic, as possible in fantasy genre, his heroes have their ups and downs, not all of them get what they deserve, so there is no Hollywood happy ending for the world of the mists.  I gave the book only four stars, because sometimes I missed the energy of the \\"Final Empire\\". Also, the allomantic fights, with their \\"pushing\\" and \\"pulling\\", became too boring for me; I began to skip these scenes altogether, knowing that the only difference between this one and the previous one would be in the number of enemies Vin fights. (It's ever increasing number, as you may guess!)  Some of the reviewers say that part of the romance between Vin and Elend lacks the passion. That didn't bother me too much, as I am tired reading again and again about passionate nights sandwiched between the battles on the pages of many other fantasy books. What disturbed me, though, it's the fact that Elend (as a king, probably) gets all the attention and character development, while Vin stuck with her conflict of insecurity versus power ... and this conflict simply escalates to the different levels toward the end of the book.    All in all, it's a good reading; the book has enough surprising plot twists to compensate the reader for the shortcomings, and I really like some of the new characters, like Zane and Alrianne. For me, though, the ending seems too much in Terry Goodkind style... not that it's necessary bad, but I expected something more original from Sanderson.

B00008BXJ6|5.0|I did not grow up in Australia so this is the only version/arrangement of High Voltage that I have ever known.  Frankly, griping about this record being a hacked up version of TNT and the original Australian release of High Voltage seems silly at this late date but maybe I'm missing something.  My first exposure to this record was seeing it in a friends bedroom that he shared with his older brother.  It was fairly captivating - grown man in a school boy outfit holding and electric guitar with what look like devil horns in front of a lightning bolt - how could a 12 year old look away!  What's inside is captivating as well.  The first track is particularly interesting and while the Pogues get most of the credit for the celtic punk genre a great debt is also certainly owed to AC/DC.  A great idea is a great idea - Rock and Roll with bagpipe accompaniment was a great idea!  Rock and Roll Singer and Little Lover are classic examples of the wry and juvenile sense of humor of Bon Scott and are two of the best on this record.   The only real let down persent is She's Got Balls and the short track list.  For me this is one of those records that has a distinct foot print in a time in my life.  Even as the years go by I can still hear my buddy Mike chuckling at the question, \\"was it Coca Cola?\\"  If you love AC/DC this is a must have and if you suspect you might like them you should start here.

0679746323|5.0|I usually don't take the time to write reviews. However, with so many negative reviews I felt I needed to. First, let me state I have been living and teaching English in China for over a year now. To talk with high school students and see the brainwashing that goes on is scary. As evidence I will point to Taiwan. Forget the argument of whether Taiwan is a part of China or not. Out of hundreds of students, I have not yet met one who looks at the issue from the Taiwanese person's view. To those in China there is none. They can not understand why those living in Taiwan would not want to be re-united other than the Taiwan government being against it. Second, yes. I have been to Taiwan and spoken to people over there. It's absolutely amazing how wrong the mainland Chinese students have it. But then all they hear is what the communists government tells them. What does this have to do about Ms. Chang's book? Plenty.  Has anyone who criticizes the facts in this book even bothered to read the notes section in the back?! I was constantly stopping and going back to the notes to see if she had documented her claims. Yes, Ms. Chang has made some assumptions on facts that were not always clear. However, all historians (and scientists) do this. Hers just goes against what has always been taken for the so called \\"truth\\". And that is where my Taiwan point comes in. Most of the truths we know about Mao, came from Mao himself. And if not from Mao, a government in no hurry to give up the power is has enjoyed for too long. Yes, it can be hard to accept a complete 180 degree history of a person and a country. However, I believe Ms. Chang more than presents enough evidence. The list of people interviewed alone gives us a side of Mao no researcher I believe has done up to this point. But what is the most damning of all the evidence and re-writes most of what we think is the truth of communists China's history, is the opening up of the long sealed and unresearched Soviet files. I have yet to read all the negative reviews. But I have yet to read one that mentions this body of work that is the main basis for Ms. Chang's revisionism of communists China's history.   Many of the reviews state how Ms. Chang says Mao accomplished so much by just luck and uses this argument to discredit her book. My answer to that is; have you read the whole book? Yes, there was some luck involved. All leaders of a nation need it to get where they are. However, Re-read the book again. Like a good poker player, Mao made his own luck many times. Like in poker where the losers say the game is all luck and no skill, how come you see the same players winning all the time? The reason is Mao knew how to use his skill to increase his odds of his plans working. He was a master manipulator who was able to put aside conscience to get what he wanted. It also can be summarized that Mao may have had attachment disorder. This would help explain how he could have had so little regard for family or human life.  My final remark to those who do not like Ms. Chang's re-writing of history is you may not know it or like it, but so much of what we all think of Mao and communist China's version of history comes from those two stated parties. Look at how Ms. Change uses solid evidence to debunk much of what was written about Mao by Americans visiting China. Without Nixon being hoodwinked, would China be on the U.N. Security Council today? (Though it can be easily argued if not Mao, surely by Den Xiaoping when he opened China to the outside world) The Chinese have always been masters at manipulating truth, events and even people to get what they want. And please do not start calling me racist. There is a book given out by the government to anyone working with foreigners. Especially Americans. This book tells those working with foreigners how to act and treat the foreigners and make them feel comfortable by telling then what they want to hear. There is a billboard on the highway to Beijing from the airport. When important foreign businessmen come to Beijing, whatever company the foreigner businessmen work for, the billboard advertises to make it seem their company has a presence for all those traveling into Beijing from the airport to see. The trick is it changes for what ever company the government wants to impress.   Unlike those students who absolutely believe the people of Taiwan want to be re-united, don't accept the truth you have been told by a government that has no reason to change its version of history anytime soon. You should all be thankful there is a writer like Ms. Chang who spent 10 years of her life to expose what need to be exposed.   One final note. PLEASE DO NOT start lecturing about the U.S. and how our history needs to be re-written. Those arguments have NOTHING to do with this book and are left for other researchers to write books about.
0765357151|5.0|If you are not, as I was/am, a lover of this Vampire genre you should be pleasantly surprised with this book as it is really nothing like you'd imagine a vampire book to be.  In fact, the \\"bad guys\\" could be any bad guys, for example I could see this as the end of \\"The Road\\" or any other apocaplyse book.  I was not one to be drawn to the Vampire stories, other than the old Ann Rice \\"Lestat.\\"  I actually notice that some of the 'tags' are for zombies.<br /><br />For all the reasons others have given and the ringing endorsement by Stephen King I finally read the book.  It had been sitting in my library for years and I was very satisfied with the story except that it ended quickly and without warning - maybe that was even better because you didn't have the expectation that the end was near.<br /><br />It's quite obvious that those readers who, to put it mildly, express their disappointment in the length of the I Am Legend story are doing so because of the price they paid for the book.  Otherwise, the story is the story and that's what they paid to read.  These short story books are all priced as if a one story full novel. I too was disappointed in the length because only because the story ended. Actually, I shy away from these little novellas.  I really shouldn't as the \\"I am Legend\\" experience proves. Just think of it as the price you pay to read the story.  Would you rather pay full price and get a different book with a crap story? I think not. In fact, at least the publisher gave us the other stories; it didn't have to.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|I'm ashamed of the health care system in this country; I'm ashamed that we can't do better for our people. I honestly think it's one of the most immoral things about the U.S.--that we fail to make sure that every citizen of this country can go to the doctor, take their child to the doctor, if they're sick. I'm ashamed that we have a system where doctors do endless and often unnecessary testing and even operations on insured people, just to make sure they don't get sued, while other people can't even afford basic care.<br /><br />That said, I wish Michael Moore had made a better movie. It's OK. As usual, he comes up with some moving stories, and makes some really excellent points. But, also as usual, he's a bit lazy. Honestly, no-one could swallow his picture of health care in France and the UK. It's by no means as bad as some critics paint it, but it also isn't as good as Moore makes it out to be, and it's part of a larger picture.<br /><br />And he doesn't add in some of the statistics that frankly make me throw up, like the one about how administrative costs in the US are almost double the costs of other systems simply because insurance companies spend so much money on sitting around thinking up reasons to avoid paying up.<br /><br />I would have liked to see him take a look at the German system. From what I hear almost everyone is covered, almost everyone is very happy and satisfied with the system, and it avoids the government bloating and lack of personal responsibility that some people think is inevitable with any universal system. If anyone out there is familiar with healthcare in Germany, I'd love to hear about it.
B000TGJ8AS|3.0|as said above, I'm not sure wether I like this season as much as the other three seasons. It starts quite slow and it took me a while to get reacquainted with the characters. There are some really good humorous moments during the whole season but some of the plots have become foreseeable. There are also at least two episodes where the plot very strongly resembles episodes of other forensic series. Who covered from whom is not for me to say.

B000I5X81K|4.0|Awake, Josh Groban's third studio album, retains most of the elements that made his first two CDs such wild successes and introduced his voice to the world, bringing worldwide fame and critical acclaim. However there are plenty of missteps. The first single, \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up,\\" is just a few short steps away from elevator music. Maybe that's a little harsh (but then again maybe not). Anyway, it definitely strives for the world/classical pop sound that's been perfected by artists like Sarah Brightman -- but where it crashes are the lyrics. Vocally Groban sounds terrific. But singing banal, frankly stupid, generic lyrics are a great disservice to his considerable talent and stalls his artistic potential. He sounds fine, but he's capable and deserving of MUCH BETTER material. Enough about the first single -- there are some real redeeming gems on the album, in particular the tracks produced by David Foster. This time around Foster only produced four of the album's thirteen tracks, and the difference between his oversight and that of the other producers on the CD is glaringly apparent IMO. Quite simply Foster seems to know how to showcase Josh's beautiful voice and make it shine -- just listen to the absolutely stunning \\"Un Giorno Per Noi (Romeo e Giulietta),\\" an adaptation of \\"A Time For Us\\" from Franco Zeferelli's Romeo and Juliet film. The arrangement, the vocal, the entire track is absolutely exquisite. However there are solid tracks from other collaborators, among them \\"Solo Por Ti\\" (Mark Hammond reprises his producer's role -- he contributed to the gorgeous \\"When You Say You Love Me\\" from Groban's 2nd CD), and \\"February Song\\" which Josh co-wrote. Unfortunately the CD closes with one of the worst songs I've ever heard -- \\"Machine\\" with guest Herbie Hancock. Groban co-wrote this craptacular disaster with Eric Mouqet of Deep Forest. This is the third collaboration with Mouquet that Groban's recorded (two songs appeared on his Closer CD -- \\"Remember When It Rained,\\" which I really liked, and \\"Never Let Go,\\" which I liked not so much...). I don't even know what to compare this song to -- really, really bad eighties pop? Irregardless, it's horribly out of step with the rest of the album and stylistically simply doesn't suit Groban's operatic vocals. It's a shame that one has to dig through some truly mediocre songs to find the jewels on this CD...it's a decent effort but I truly hope for a more cohesive album next time around, with consistently BETTER song selection.Rained,\\" which I really liked, and \\"Never Let Go,\\" which I liked not so much...).

B000VBJEEG|4.0|Pixar can do no wrong with me.  They always have great stories, great casting, and a timeless quality that rival studio Dreamworks has never been able to duplicate.  Ratatouille is fantastic.  Who would have thought that a story about a rat that wants to become a great chef could be so action packed?  I have to wonder about anyone who claims they were bored by this movie.  There's a good mix of action, comedy and drama here and the relationship between Remy the rat and Linguini is perfectly executed.    The added touch of Remy having his idol Chef Gusteau pop up and talk to him as a figment of his imagination was also an stellar idea.  The villains in here are great as well, with Ian Holme and Peter O'Toole filling in as an overbearing head chef and a hard to please food critic.  The rest of the voice talent is also well cast with no weak links or annoying celebrities doing their own voices.    My only complaint is not directed at the movie itself but at the DVD set for having virtually no features.  There are two shorts, Lifted, which played before Ratatouille in theaters, and another starring Remy and his brother Emile about the history of Rats.  There's one feature that takes a look at a chef who was an inspiration to them as well as Brad Bird recapping how he got started in animation, but other than that, there's only one disc and that doesn't leave a lot of room for some in depth behind the scenes, plus no commentary track!  Why has Pixar all of a sudden stopped giving us the 2 disc treatment?  Other than that, a fantastic movie all around and another success for Pixar.    (Reviewer's Edit: I did a little research and as it turns out, When Bluray bought the rights to distribute Disney movies exclusively, part of the deal was to put the features only on Bluray discs, so in order to get features that we've previously enjoyed on DVD, they are forcing you to make the switch to Bluray in order to get them.  Very unfortunate, but I guess that's how they got people toswitch over to DVD from VHS 10 years ago.)
B00007LTIA|3.0|Big and messy and grandiose and sprawling and grandiose and messy and big. Kicks off with a great twenty-minute epic track that's a beautiful, haunting, airy mix of rock, jazz, classical, and ambient (\\"The Revealing Science of God: Dance of the Dawn\\"). Wakeman's keyboards are insane on that track. All Wakeman fans (like me!) should have themselves a recording of that one. Definitely. It's also tied for the shortest song on this record, clocking in at a mere 20:25. Next is a song that sounds like a lullabye or music-box music or something like that. It's called \\"The Remembering: High the Memory\\". I don't like it much. It's really boring, and it never really goes anywhere - unlike \\"Revealing Science of God\\", which goes everywhere. Oh yeah, there's a \\"rockin'\\" part somewhere along the line, but when that comes in I'm so bored with the track, my attention has been focused elsewhere, like on the killer instrumental section that begins \\"The Ancient: Giants Under the Sun\\". Steve Howe's riffs on that song are just forking spectacular, and I love the keyboard-flute part, too. I could do without Jon Anderson's vocals, though. But hey, that song has a great guitar part! And not just electric, he also pulls his signature classical guitar tricks, and I love it when he does that. I think that's the best track on the record, in fact. The one song that's really bad, then, is \\"Ritual: Nous Sommes du Soleil\\". For one, it's way too long. For another, there's not a single good moment in its twenty-one (!) minutes. For a third, it nothing but actively annoy me for those twenty-one minutes: the stupid chant part and dumb arena-rock riffs during the beginning especially irk me. If you hate Yes already, this won't change your mind about them at all - to some, even Yes fans, it's too ambitious and boring. I used to fall into that camp too, and if you ask me, half of it overreaches. And the other half is fantastic. Oh yeah, this is the one that really killed prog-rock's reputation with the critics. The lyrics are, for the record, inspired by Autobiography of a Yogi Or at least that's what I'm told, because as usual I can't make sense of Yes' lyrics at all. Sweet cover art, though.ritics.

0345494997|5.0|I picked it up at the library because of my interest in Frank Lloyd Wright, but the real story here is about Mamah Borthwick.  She is a fascinating and conflicted woman, and you can understand her love for the brilliant and difficult Frank.  It is beautifully told even though, as fiction, we do not know the true details of the relationship between them.  She is a unique and complex individual for her time, and her story will resonate with you for a long time.  We should all thank Nancy Horan for powerfully bringing this story to life for us.

0767821769|4.0|I had to do a paper of this movie for college, so I bought it with reasonably low expectations.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  This movie is put together really well, and kept my interest throughout.  The characters are deep and dynamic and the acting is top notch, as is the writing and directing.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone - but make sure you keep a box of tissues handy!

B00005JO5L|5.0|I've seen this movie long long time ago (when I was just a young teenager) and since then it has haunted me fiercely (a good haunt though...). This movie, as well as \\"The Boys in the Band\\" (ten years earlier and also by Friedkin), has always been on the back of my mind, and I've been since then on the prowl for them (lol). This year it finally came out (lol again) in DVD and I immediately bought it. And wow! What a movie it (still) is. A dark thriller where an undercover agent (Pacino) tries do find out who is killing and chopping off several of the New York S&M gay clubs clientele.  Pacino at his Actor's Studio peak is marvellous, Paul Sorvino is great as always, and you get to see a lot of guys from the police force itself playing some parts (since the movie is based on true killings and got the advise of some cops involved in its solvings) as well as a lot of gay guys from the clubs (no extras here, the clubs are real and the guys in it also...). Lots of shadows, lots of eye linner (lol), a fabulous dance scene with a spaced out Pacino. The extras are also good. I really recommend the Audio Commentary by Friedkin. A must see movie! Gay or straight, that's not definitely the issue here.

0143038419|5.0|This book is like sitting down to a cup of coffee with the author, Elizabeth Gilbert.  She writes in a very familiar, comfortable style.  You can just imagine what she is seeing and going through.  Her time in Italy makes me want to jump on an airplane and travel (and I hate airplanes).  The time she spent in the Ashram really describes meditation and how difficult it is to \\"calm\\" the mind.  I am very interested in meditation and have not (in my opinion) been successful, so it was very surprising to me to read that Elizabeth was having the same difficulties ... made it very believable to me.  Great read!
0143036424|5.0|[[ASIN:1432708155 The Margin]]<br />Johnson's prose fits Sheriff Longmire to a 'T'. The rural pace, dialogue and Walt's methodical, but culturally attuned method of crime solving is superbly presented in The Cold Dish.<br />Although Walt Longmire has had his share troubles, and still does, for that matter, he's maintained a dry wit and somewhat cynical sense of humor. The mix of characters, that essentially are Longmire's supporting cast, are marvelously interwoven throughout the book. If it weren't for Deputy Moretti, and his friend Henry Standing Bear life after the murders for Longmire would have continued it's downward spiral. Then there is Vonnie.<br />Marvin Wiebener, Author of The Margin
B000005JA8|5.0|This record is absolutley...thought provoking. Alot of reviewers love it, and alot hate it. I (don't laugh!) think it is beautiful. The lyrical content is poetry at it's most surreal and bizzare. The music is relentless and unstructured. The art is almost as out there as the music itself, the guys in the band are sloppy looking hippies, and at that it was produced by the great Frank Zappa. I'm one of those people who has been collecting avant garde and experimental recordings for years, and unlike most people, the first time I heard this I listened to it in it's entirety. Since then it is possibly one of the most listened to records. On first listen, I loved it, and a couple 55 times of listening to it's entirety, I love it even more. It's one of those albums that gets better with each listen. there are so many new things to hear every time you give this baby a spin. So, give it a chance! Sure, the disc is 79 minutes and 8 seconds of bizzare noise, but hey, it's Beefheart! It's to be consumed differently by everyone. This record, is like a wart. It grows on you, but this one you can't burn off. It stays and manifests your entire being.

B000Y179KO|5.0|What other band than the Eagles would make a lot of people to drive out of their ways to a Wal Mart store just to pick a CD which is being exclusively sold there, making it goes all the way to the Billboard's No. 1 in the first week of sales? Honestly, I can't imagine one.<br /><br />It seems that no other retailer, like Amazon for instance, will be able to sell this album anytime soon, except for those sellers who advertise the product (either used or for reselling) in the Marketplace here. Fortunately, if you can't go to a Wal Mart store, there are also the options of purchasing the CD or the digital download directly from Wal Mart or the Eagles website (in the band's page, there is a Hi-Fi download option available for those MP3 haters). Despite all that, I still prefer [...] to post my reviews and, apparently, a lot of other people feel the same way...<br /><br />All songs are pretty much the Eagles way. One or another track has a more modern arrangement. After all those years, their voices sound almost the same thing as in the 70s. Twenty songs at once were made to compensate all these years without great new tunes (although 1994's Hell Freezes Over and 2003's The Very Best Of compilation had new songs - Get Over It, Learn to Be Still, Love Will Keep Us Alive, The Girl from Yesterday and Hole in the World).<br /><br />My picks for this new album are:  \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\", \\"I Don't Want to Hear Any More\\", \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" and \\"Center of The Universe\\", all beautiful songs. \\"It's Your World Now\\" has an interesting Mexican appeal. Hear it and judge for yourself.

0307341542|4.0|Recommended by my niece, I finally got around to reading Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn.  This is an extremely dark crime novel that spends far more time in the psychological realm than the criminal world, but it works OK if you're in the right mindset.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is a reporter for a second-tier newspaper in Chicago.  Her editor decides to send her back to her home town of Wind Gap to write a story on the murder of two young girls.  The murders have all the signs of a serial killer, as the bodies are both missing all their teeth.  It's his hope that this story will scoop the larger papers and earn the paper some respect.  But there's far more at stake for Preaker than just the story...<br /><br />Camille grew up in a severely dysfunctional home that left her with emotional and physical scars.  One of her sisters died of a mysterious illness when she was growing up.  She also has a 13 year old sister that is heavily into drugs, sex, and manipulation.  When Preaker arrives in Wind Gap to write the story, plenty of old wounds are opened up, and her whole warped relationship with her mother starts to play out all over.  The town has their ideas as to who killed the girls, but Preaker is coming to some uncomfortable realizations as to who might be responsible for it all.  And if those realizations are accurate, she has to face some difficult questions about her own personality.<br /><br />While there is a crime that's being investigated here, the main plot-line revolves around Preaker and her emotional issues.  You learn pretty quickly that she is a cutter, hence the name of the book.  It's bizarrely compelling to see how those compulsions play out in her life during periods of stress, which is pretty much all the time.  And since it's written in first-person form from Preaker's perspective, you quickly become immersed in her own private hell.<br /><br />For a debut novel, Flynn has done a very good job.  If you're looking for a pure crime novel, the heavy psychological slant will probably make you a bit uncomfortable.  But if you're open to a dark blend of crime and warped minds, this will be a book you'll have a hard time putting down.bably make you a bit uncomfortable.

1594481717|4.0|This book will give you some interesting insights into how the mind works. But on one reading I don't expect it will change your life.  Perhaps there is more to this book than meets the eye at first glance if it is applied to daily life like a work book or a bible. To get the \\"wow\\" effect it may require more work than I'm willing to put into this book. But will most people really care, as they strive to bring their dreams to reality, if it is the left or right brain or a combination of both doing the job for them?

0374105235|5.0|We have a book club at my church that focuses on the Millennium Development Goals.  This is definitely the book that has had the most impact on us so far.  As a group, we were all astonished and amazed at Ishmael's journey.  This book is moving and disturbing at the same time.  It's disturbing in the fact 12 year olds have AK47's in their hands and that this is not a one time thing.  This continues today in Darfur, Sudan and other countries.  What is amazing is that Ishmael was able to pull himself out of this world and become this incredible young man who is compassionate and giving.  We all came to the conclusion that God was with him through every step of his journey.  This book is a lesson in Faith, Hope and Love.  In our opinion, only because of God is Ishmael here to tell his story.  Everyone needs to hear this story of survival and see those along  the path that risked their own lives to help these children.  We can change the world.  We must never give up.  Ishmael teaches that eloquently and brutally.  All should read this book.
B000P12LWY|1.0|When The Tudors series was aired on TV I first thought that, the re-telling of a story that has been exhausted by play writers and movie makers from Shakespeare up to Charles Jarrott, was going to have an original twist.  Something in the same style of HBO`s Rome, another exhausted story (also from Shakespeare on) cleverly narrated from the point of view of two soldiers and friends from the Roman legions during the times of Julius Cesar and Mark Anthony.  However the Tudors is a boring, badly produced series that tries to be lavish and clever but falls quite short. They are not only the silly and useless historical inacuraccies what bother me (in Rome there are also inaccuracies but cleverly managed so you can always think that they could be perfectly true) but also the production itself.  Costumes are badly done, they look like cheap disguises for a masked ball.  Acting is pretty bad as well (with some exceptions).  I wonder why Catherine of Aragon, King Charles V of Spain and the spanish embassadors speak such a terrible and almost unanderstandable spanish among them (subtitles in real spanish for spanish speaking audiences please!!!!).  Overall terrible waste of money and time

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This outstanding work highlights the weaknesses in healthcare provision in the U.S., using vivid real-life examples of the suffering wrought by profit-oriented insurance companies and their government supporters.  It also takes us to Canada, Britain, France, and Cuba for up-close looks at how their national healthcare systems work.  I was somewhat familiar with the abysmal state of our health system versus numerous other countries, but this work personalizes the issue by showing the human cost and basic injustice done to specific human beings.  The foreign studies also focus on individuals, with the contrast posing a real challenge to defenders of our current set-up.  It isn't enough to bluster against \\"socialized medicine\\" or Moore personally; if he and his colleagues are wrong, their specific points should be effectively refuted.  Since this isn't being done, however, the case for national health insurance stands as a vital and immediate issue for our time.

B000ASATZ8|4.0|Having watched all four films this weekend, I can say that I like the original the best, but that the third film (Return to Perfection) is a very close second (and would be my favorite if the CGI were more sophisticated). I didn't care much for the second and fourth films (so I deducted one star). Return to Perfection (actually, I don't think the original location, Lone Pine, CA, was used) has great characters. Shawn Christian does a great Brad Pitt impression and is really fun to watch. Susan Chuang steals some scenes with some really humorous lines. In fact, Return to Perfection made me laugh on several occasions; it has a very witty script. Also, I thought Michael Gross, who was too over the top in Aftershocks, really nailed his Burt Gummer character in Return to Perfection. In the future, I will watch Tremors and Tremors: Return to Perfection as worthy companion pieces, and forget about the other two.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|Not sure I wanted to see this, after #2 was so focused on violence and little more, but had to give Marvel Comics - and this movie - a chance. And it offers a good turn around, a much more positive theme, even a good one about finding the good in all of us.<br /><br />Note to Marvel: you don't always have to kill the good people off, though. You seem to do that too much when many could come back in other episodes and work `with' spidey in other roles. Don't fear they'll steal scenes, but instead, grasp the potential for a more well-rounded theme of friendship and personal growth. It doesn't all have to be Peter Parker vs violence. Remember: these are comics!
044661758X|3.0|The Concrete Blonde is the third in the Harry Bosch series, which is up to thirteen books and counting.  Harry is a homicide detective and we learn that he has shot and killed a suspect believed to be a serial killer known as the Dollmaker.  Unfortunately for Harry, he shot the man because he was reaching under a pillow but instead of a weapon there was only a toupee.  Now, Harry is being sued for excessive force and a note is sent to him that indicates maybe the Dollmaker is still around after all... that maybe Harry killed the wrong man.  Without revealing any more plot specifics, Harry has to defend himself in court while trying to catch this possibly new Dollmaker before he can kill again.    This was my first Michael Connelly book and it began with promise.  The pace of the first 100 pages or so is very good and the characters were reasonably interesting.  Bosch is stuck between a rock and a hard place with an apparent copycat killer who could also be the original while a star lawyer rakes him over the coals in court.  The last 100 pages were also excellent as the story built momentum to the climax and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The problem is the roughly 300 pages in the middle where the pace drags and the book suffers badly for it.  This section seems to be a lot of running in place with nothing of note happening to move the story forward again.    Another weak point is the trial.  One example, the attorney accuses Harry of planting the toupee under the pillow to justify the shooting.  This is patently absurd since he would obviously want to plant a knife or gun if he were going to do any such thing.  The toupee made Harry look like a fool and laid him wide open to the lawsuit.  Yet no one during the entire book ever points out this obvious stupidity.      This is not a bad book and the Harry Bosch series has a strong following of loyal fans.  I didn't find enough here to bring me back for a second helping but fans of police procedurals should probablygive either this book or one of the others in the series a chance.  I've certainly seen worse writing than Connelly's and he probably has more appeal to hard-core fans of the genre.

B000MXPE7Y|3.0|THE GOOD SHEPHERD depicts the decades long growth of the CIA from its inception as seen through the eyes of a youthful rookie agent Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon, whose screen character requires him to keep bottled up within him all emotion.  It is his inability to articulate his feelings that form an unexpected subtext.  From the time that we first meet a preteen Edward, who has witnessed the suicide of his father to the close of the film, we see the growth of an agent whose needed silences mark him as a superior operative but ironically require him to pay a personal price that alienates him from his wife and son.  Angelina Jolie is his wife Margaret, who is attracted to Edward from the start and she makes it clear that she wants him as a husband.  Her tragedy is that despite her character's smarts she does not foresee that the wife of an operative must be willing to share him with his job.  She can overlook a fling with a woman but demands what Edward cannot provide, which is meaningful daily contact with a man who is aware of her private needs. What becomes evident soon enough is that even had Edward chosen another profession, his self-imposed silences probably would have led to conflict.<br /><br />THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a film that smacks of a quasi-documentary that depicts a pre-war America that has no effective intelligence department and must develop one to keep pace first with Nazism, then with Soviet communism.  Damon's low-key performance is effective more because of than despite his interpretation of a man who is constantly told to trust no one.  There is a gripping subplot that suggests that someone in his section is a Soviet mole, a premise that reinforces this theme that a lack of trust is the inevitable result of a life that suggests that secrets must be locked up either in one's heart or in one's lockbox safe.  The ending is deliberately lacking in an upbeat closure. The power of THE GOOD SHEPHERD lies in its ability to recreate an era that demanded that those who chose to play the game of intelligence often found that they were not the only ones who had to pay that price.t those who chose to play the game of intelligence often found that they were not the only ones who had to pay that price.

B00000J7SS|5.0|... Miles was not a nice person.  He was notoriously difficult to work for and work with during his career - yet produced some of Jazz music's most influential albums, hired the most talented and promising musicians in Jazz, and forced record companies to change the way they did business with Jazz artists.  \\"Bitches Brew\\" is the album that truly typifies the kind of musician he was and the brilliant artists he demanded to have with him.  Personally, I prefer the be-bop Miles Davis, but this is the album that contradicts itself, an argument back and forth between convention and avant-garde, with improvisation from start to finish.  If \\"Kind of Blue\\" changed the structure of Jazz in it's time, then \\"Bitches Brew\\" changed the tone of Jazz music ... forever.  It may not have enough melody for some, but it's got more color than anything he's ever produced.  And frankly, he needed to record this album to release his electronic demons and eventually follow up with \\"Jack Johnson\\" (1970), \\"Live-Evil\\" (1970), \\"Agharta\\" (Live, 1975), and \\"Tutu\\" (1986) ... just to name a few.    Buy this album.  You may not like it's raw sound, but you have to listen to it in order to really understand the great revolution of Jazz and why we have acid rock/jazz, progressive rock, and eventually new wave music.  Buy it, listen to it, and then share it with someone who is new to modern Jazz.  It's hard ... it's fringe ... it's amazing ... it's cool.  It's Miles.

1400063515|5.0|Bush publicly stated that The Black Swan made an impression on him (while addressing a large gathering of decision makers, engineers and defense representatives in a recent conference).   I, instead, simply enjoyed reading this irreverent, if not iconoclastic, account of probabilistic aspects of social, economic, and political systems;  they are all afflicted with Black Swans which are events with low probability but extreme impact.     Contrary to the the conventional wisdom which has wholeheartedly adopted Gaussian models (the famous bell curve) in harnessing uncertainties inherent in economics, stock markets, social dynamics, and political (in)stability, Taleb makes an erudite and entertaining case for the extremes in real life.    Stochastic processes displaying large variances (occasionally referred to as with heavy tails, self similarity, or chaotic behavior) are commonly utilized in technical fields such as communications packet networking.   In (so called) sciences such as economics it appears that the academia is still trapped in the normal probability distribution stronghold which Taleb describes as dealing merely with mediocristan.   This ignorance is dangerous as it can underestimate extreme variations and risks.  Just re look at the 1987 wall street debacle, 1997 money crisis, spectacular hedge fund implosions, and more recently the sub-prime mortgage meltdown which is still playing itself out.  No one predicted it!  Taleb would rather take shelter in empirical bottom-up approach instead of depending on elegant and respected academic models built with false premises.     Taleb is a witty writer with exotic background (born and raised in middle east as a minority with training and professional stints in US and Europe).  He takes a direct and convincing shot at some well established names especially in the field of economics, some even bestowed upon with Nobel prizes.   According to Taleb (and it is difficult to disagree) almost all of them are sufferingfrom this shortsightedness in platonic-ally simplifying the true random nature of these human institutions and disciplines with simplistic bell curves.  For example, human height is normally distributed as most people are centered around the average height.   However, such normal models cannot describe individual wealth which has extreme distributions with large variations!  Taleb eloquently analyzes such inadequacies in Gaussian economic theories, models, and publications displaying professional dishonesty, ludic fallacy and epistemological opacity (the last two terms seem to be Taleb's gift to the English language).   Despite these blatant insults to economics, you have to really read this book even if you are or aspiring to be an economist.  For the former it will help you bring closer to reality and for the latter you may be motivated to rethink your career options.    Unlikes many other non fiction bestsellers, this book does not provide a recipe for making more money for the practitioner or getting a Nobel for the academics.   It is one of those increasingly rare writings that deal with a complex topic with an unconventional style, but are thoroughly unique and a sheer joy to read.    P.S.  It is not Bush but one of his brothers who had read this book and talked about it in a public forum.

B000N3ST7K|5.0|This soundtrack captures the movie perfectly!  I've definitely wore it out listening to it over and over and over...it has all the hits from the movie to include Chick Habit, Baby its You, Jeepster, Down in Mexico, Staggolee, Hold Tight and many more!  If you liked the movie, you'll love the soundtrack and it'll be like listneing to the movie anywhere you want.
B000002OZY|3.0|Although Tommy made the Who successful and Roger Daltrey into a \\"rock god\\"  I was never drawn to it. In my opinion it is better if you listen to the album from beginning to end instead of certain tracks with the exception of \\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"I'm Free\\", and \\"Amazing Journey.\\"    One reason why I was never drawn to Tommy is that I find it rather dull and tedious.  Another reason is that I always thought \\"Fiddle About\\" was rather sick.  However, Tommy is an important milestone not only in the history of the Who, but also in the history of rock.
0975991477|2.0|This was like soaking up some of the most interesting ideas and findings I ever read all the while being occasionally clubbed over the head with the Evolution \\"bat\\".  The constant Neo-Darwinist dogma was not even necessary for the discussion, but it seems the author was extremely brain washed and felt impelled to dish it out in large portions to make the story more palatable to his colleagues. Darwinism certainly is a well entrenched theology. Almost as a preamble to every point he makes is preceeded with the word \\"Evolved\\". Evolution...this evolved...that evolved...evolved, evolved, evolved. Unbeknownst to him, probably, he has presented an excellent case for intelligent design! For fun, I sat and read with a black Sharpie and if there was too much of the offending Neo-Darwinism propaganda to cross out, I just ripped the whole page out. But if people like me can get past that, these new findings can change the way one thinks about life in a profound way. In the end, I tossed it in the trash anyway as there were just too many pages torn out.
B000024D4R|2.0|Animals is perhads the worst Pink Floyd album I ever heard. The songs seem to go on forever, the lyrics are bad, and Roger Waters' singing is not much better. So who Knows what they were thinking when they made this album.     I hate to say it but the only reason I didn't give this album a one star rating was the two part song \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" which unlike the rest of Animals is actually a half decent song.
B00062RCBW|5.0|Thsi transaction was perfect in every way: fast shipment, arrived in perfect order, well packed.  I recommend this dealer.
B000002U82|5.0|This is still my favorite Pink Floyd album followed by Wish You Were Here and The Wall. However I never cared for Clare Torry's \\"Vocals\\" on \\"The Great Gig In the Sky\\" and \\"Us and Them\\" is little too slow.     One of the reasons I love this album is because unlike many other Pink Floyd albums there are no songs over ten minutes.  Another is the use of sound effects such as chiming clocks, cash registers, maniacal laughter, and heartbeats.  Added to this is their brilliant use of synthesizers. The Dark Side of the Moon also features great lyrics all written by Roger Waters.     This is truly the first (and arguably the last) of Pink Floyd's great albums. After Dark Side they had other good albums such as Wish You Were Here,the Wall, and the Divison Bell, but I think they don't come close to Dark Side of the Moon.
B00004SAAX|5.0|My familiarity with Walcha's Bach recordings goes back to my student days when I acquired several of the popular works on Archiv LPs (with the plain gray fold-out covers). I own this set in its's 1990s mid-price compilation on Archiv CDs. Walcha's interpretations of the organ works have been my gold standard since those early hearings. The style of playing, which incorporates varied registrations in the course of the pieces for structural and interpretive impact, is somewhat at odds with current \\"historically informed\\" use of the plenum through the big pieces. Also absent is the bending of tempo and ornamentation that figure in a number of more recent accounts of this music. Walcha employs ornamentation of the line but also allows the music to speak for itself without a lot of intervention. The grandeur of these masterpieces is always in evidence. Listen, for example, to the brooding intensity of the F minor Prelude and Fugue in which Walcha employs a somewhat more deliberate tempo than current norms to stunning effect.<br /><br />My only complaint is the omission of the 1961 recording of the great E flat Major Prelude and Fugue in favor of the 1970s version. While the interpretaions are consistent, I prefer the sound of the Franz Casper Schnitger organ at Alkmaar to the Johann Andreas Silbermann at Strassburg. As others have pointed out, Walcha did not record the complete works, but what we do have is one of the great recorded legacies. We are fortunate indeed to have it.
B000002C1X|3.0|When I bought my copy of the Wall in 1997 (the year I graduated from high school) I was enthralled with it. I thought it was a great album, perhaps one of the greatest albums of all time.  However over the years I began to lose interest. I used to be able to listen to the whole thing in one sitting, but not any more. I still think Disc One is generaly good. As for Disc Two the only songs I still listen to are \\"Hey You\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\", and sometimes \\"Waiting for the Worms\\".     I finally came to realize how overdone, over produced, and over hyped this album is. However, \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is still one of my favorite Songs. David Gilmour's solo alone deserves five stars. Unfortunatly it is the unnecessary fillers that made me give the Wall a three star rating.
0802755240|4.0|This is the quintessential vampire book.  I first read this ten years ago when I was looking for something 'classic' about vampires.  It was either Matheson or Ann Rice.  Ann Rice has NOTHING on Matheson.  Matheson is to vampires what Asimov is to robots.<br /><br />Anyway - what drew me in is that the story itself is relatively short (aproximately 150 pages) but deeply engaging.  Matheson seeks to explain the vampire scientifically.  I am, however, disappointed in the ending - it just didnt do it for me, hence I give it only four stars.<br /><br />As an added bonus this book contains roughly 10 more short stories of Matheson's which are all very entertaining. Matheson was a writer for the Twilight Zone (remember William Shatner exclaiming 'there's something on the wing!' yeah Matheson wrote that story) - he does not disappoint!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I was never a Britney fan.  Years ago, I purchased her debut CD out of hype, and I only liked one or two songs on the disk.  As such, I assumed that most of her CDs must have some catchy, pop tunes and a lot of \\"hit the forward button\\" songs.      However, I listened to her entire Blackout CD on AOL and I was thoroughly impressed.  All of the songs are listenable and I didn't find myself pressing that dreaded fast foward button.    This CD is for those who like dance music genre.  Britney gets a lot of criticism for not singing like an American Idol or Christina Aguilera, Celine Dion, etc... but her voice is really good with all these songs.  In fact, it's an appropriate genre for her and I can't envision a soulful diva sing any of these songs.  Her mellow voice goes with the bass beats. I can't explain how it works but it does.    I guess these songs are good for a performer/entertainer like Britney.  I'd say if she danced like she did a few years ago coupled with these tracks, she could make a decent comeback performance.    So how would I rate this CD?  I give it 4.5 with track 5 (Heaven on Earth) being my favorite out of the bunch because it sounds like a throwback to the 80s, but in a refreshing way.  I have to knock a half point because the beats almost goes towards monotony but fortunately, it's still ear-friendly.    Hey, I actually bought the CD in the end, despite the bad press and all the taboo with Britney.  That must mean something.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|This is a truly beautiful addition to my Christmas music collection.  Can't wait to listen to it every day with the holidays approaching.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|All the Lost Souls is James Blunt's second recorded release and does not fail to deliver.  I saw Mr. Blunt when he toured Seattle with Jason Mraz.  I had not heard of him prior to the show and was quite taken with his voice and lyrics.  All the Lost Souls is a compilation of melodic memories, especially 1973 and I Really Want You.  I listen to Mr. Blunt at the office and I am transported to thoughts of moments spent with my beloved boyfriend when I hear, I Really Want You.  Powerful vocals, words,melodies and carefully arranged piano strokes, allows one to always carry with them, long after the disc has stopped.  All the Lost Souls is a must have for your musical library.  May you have many melodic memories and travels when you own this fantastic album.
B00005JPRD|1.0|I very much enjoyed the films Mulin Rouge and HairSpray, so I was open minded when going to see this one as well. I was seriously disapointed.  I was bored throughout 95% of this movie.  I thought the music was boring and also very annoying, as the movie dragged out to the point where I wished they would just shut up!!! Don't expect to see some lavish performance with spectuacular special effects; you just won't see it here.  The plot, actors, and writing were all extremely boring to me. For me, a waste of time and money.
0446693804|4.0|For those who say the book wasn't written well, I disagree. It was just short, probably not even longer than a Harlequin romance, even though it was presented in a hardcover edition with large type. I wasn't fooled. Though the story is reminiscent of \\"Love Story\\" (without all the use of the Lord's name in vain) and \\"Charly\\" (minus the Mormon doctrine), and others, it's still a sweet story.     Perhaps, compared to all the other books out there, this doesn't deserve four stars, but when I rate items, I rate them for their enjoyability factor, not for their literary qualifications. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" may be considered a great book, but I wanted to hang myself with boredom, so is it really that great, or am I just a simpleton?     Probably both.     Anyway, this edition (with the New England autumn) is one I wouldn't be ashamed to have in my collection. I hate it when they re-release a book with the movie version's actors on it. It makes a book look cheap and tacky. Though a film may be based on a book (however close it may be to the text), it's still a completely different work of art (and I use the term art loosely). My imagination sure did a much better job conjuring up Landon and Jamie than the casting director did. Shane West was ugly, and though Mandy Moore is pretty, and did a good job, she wasn't right as Jamie, not to mention it completely lost something by setting it in the present day (just like they did with the \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" film).     I think, sadly, anymore, it's hard to write a sweet story set in modern times, because it comes across as false. There's just something innocent about the 1950's, or maybe that's just our perception. Hollywood had a lot to do with fostering it, creating family shows like \\"Father Knows Best\\" and \\"Leave it to Beaver\\". Pollyanna set in today's world would be laughed off the screen.     That this book has received many five star reviews isn't a bad thing (hey, if Sparks could write something as simple as this and not only it become a bestseller, but also a movie, I can do it), because this isn't a book for cynics. It's a book for those who still believe in true, lasting love, and that teenagers really can and do love as much, or more, as adults do. I was surprised that Landon never married again, but it's not unheard of (if you don't believe me, read the story of 1960's starlet, Dolores Hart).     Though Jamie was sort of too good to be true, she was also a minister's daughter in the 1950's, so I took that into consideration, and Landon wasn't a bad person like he was in the movie, he was just an immature teenage boy who grew up a lot in love.     I could read this story at least once a year (probably on Christmas), but I've watched the movie twice and don't care to ever watch it again, though I will say it was refreshing compared to most of the teen movies out there.
B00005JPS5|3.0|Kids will like the movie, but if you're just an adult anxious for a piece of Seinfeld, wait for the DVD. The concept is ok, but the adult friendly children's movie concept doesn't compare to the likes of Shrek or Finding Nemo.
0316010669|5.0|We've all had the experience of knowing something we haven't really meshed through cerebrally YET ... where does this come from? Malcolm Gladwell has put it into works for us! If you are the type who likes to muse over the roots of your thoughts and their interaction with other thoughts, and well ... thinking in general, you will love this book. Not only is it informative but has offered me a greater confidence in my \\"initial responses.\\" So many times I've said to myself, geez I knew that why didn't I act on it?! Because my sociatal-thinking told me the data hadn't been chewed on enough. Don't you think there are some thinking processes that do not require in-depth analyzation? That they are strong enought to stand on there own! Well ... read the book!
B000LC4CVA|1.0|I just had the misfortune of watching/listening to this version of \\"Celtic Women\\" on PBS. What do these vapid, lip-syncing, saccharin elevator-Muzak Stepford Wives have to do with Celtic anything? It's like the Brady Bunch morphed with Laurence Welk on St. Patrick's Day in Disney World. Very scary and artificial; having absolutely nothing to do with the spirit of good Celtic music that I love. Run away as fast as you can and find some real Celtic music elsewhere if you have a micron of good taste. You'll not find it here. Yikes!
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|To give you an idea of the diversity of people who buy this CD, I will tell you a few things. I am a Physicist, love to read and my friends think I am a good, reliable person. Pop is not my favorite genre of music, but there are a few people I enjoy. One of those is Britney.  Why?    Because I enjoy the rhythms, the effects, and the sense of playfulness in her songs. I love dancing, and I love dancing to them. Moreover, I really enjoy artists that are able to re-invent themselves. And I appreciate the fact that I can have an idea where the material for this work originates.    Some critics wonder why people would buy a Britney CD given all the unfortunate episodes that she has participated in lately. My humble answer is a superposition of things. Life isn't easy for everyone. Not all people have nice, very well set-up lives. Some people's lives are more complicated. And there are periods in life when things just don't go the way one would wish. Most of us go through all that in private, though.     Deciding what is worth in life and how to find it -how best to be oneself- is hard, and for those who care about finding the answers, or without the support to find them, it can be a long process.  I identify with her limitations, and though I may not share her more infamous weaknesses, it is possible that I share her fears and her struggles to find which things in life matter to me, who am I, what is important, and what to do in life that means something to me.    Perhaps it's strange, but I don't laugh when people are in trouble. I identify with them, and I feel empathy towards their struggles. I like Britney for those reasons. Because she's human, and her position in the eye of the media showcases this humanity, this imperfection. Far from scaring me away, or from making me feel better than her, it reminds me of how cruel human beings can be in the face of suffering and, hopefully, how human beings can fall and bounce right back. That's my perspective.    If her CD wasbad, I acknowledge I probably would still buy some of the singles, to show some support.      However, it's cool I don't have to. This CD -Blackout- is ACTUALLY  very, very good.
B00006RCOB|5.0|I'm partial to certain Eastwood films, especially the early spaghetti westerns which made him famous. This film is sort of a Cold War CAVIAR EASTERN.<br /><br />Here, a long-retired, Vietnam-mentally-damaged Eastwood is tapped on the shoulder by the CIA to steal a new Soviet fighter-jet that is invisible on radar, the Firefox. (Clearly, the film preceded the unveiling of our own top-technology in that realm, which the Soviets never ever achieved). Eastwood, whose mother was Russian and so he speaks Russian like a native, grudgingly acceeds to the arm-twisting proposal and goes undercover behind the Iron Curtain. There, the CIA network ultimately gets him through a morass of close calls and to the Firefox, which he steals but at great cost of life to all the folks who helped him.<br /><br />The final third of the film is totally focused upon his attempt to escape The Soviet Union with a second Firefox aircraft and a very ticked off Russian pilot (Eastwood had kicked his butt back at the Russian base), hot on his tail.<br /><br />Of course, none of this could actually have been pulled off but it's nice to think that it COULD have happened, so, it's the purest form of silly fiction. But still, the film is well-conveyed, not hokey in any way.<br /><br />Like John Wayne, Eastwood is the worst sort of actor, coming off as contrived and isolated from his supporting actors, but that is actually why most of us love him (and John Wayne too). Also, the special effects are very realistic in this film, well-done.<br /><br />In the end, if you love Eastwood, you'll find this movie much to your liking, very macho and all. The stereotyped Russians (Soviets at the time), fully meet our western expectations of arrogance, bad temper, and ineptness.<br /><br />If you're not a big Eastwood fan, I'd pass this one by as there are better choices in his film repertoire for the casual viewer. Don't look for anything deep and/or philosophical in this one -- it's a very straightforward flick, typical Eastwood really.
0920668364|5.0|This is a beautiful little book. I gave it to my daughter who is 29 with a young son. She cried! I have also purchased one for my son who is 27 and plan on giving to him when him and his wife have their first child.
0743486285|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I was so wrapped up in it I didn't put it down until I was done with it.  The story of this man is so engrossing and yet evoked such a huge range of emotional reactions from me, that even if you don't like him, you respond to this story.    This is good solid reading - especially for an 80' metal music lover!
0812975219|2.0|If you want a great book on misconceptions in statistics that lead to flaws in decision making, [[ASIN:0470110120 How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of \\"Intangibles\\" in Business]] by Doug Hubbard would be a much better read.  If you want to read someone rambling on about how much they truly loath what he considers lesser intellects (MBA's as far as Taleb is concerned), then Taleb's book is for you.        Granted, Taleb picks on that certain class of business perons - educated by prestigious schools, well paid, and very likely highly over-confident in their own skills.  It is hard to feel much pity for that group.  Still, his revulsion with such persons, for me, undermines any effort he makes to seem like a sophisticated intellectual.  For example, he has several pages early on in the book dedicated to berating a \\"an overpaid hick\\" and he actually makes fun of the guy's accent (a \\"noo-joyzy\\" accent, as Taleb put it).  He even thought it was important to point out that this sap wasn't \\"well bred\\".  Well bred? What century is Taleb living in? In another tirade he makes a sweeping characterization of \\"business oriented\\" people as being \\"generally devoid of any introspection, flat as a pancake\\".  Apparently, if your intellect is not up to Taleb's standards, you will make him sick to his stomach.  God forbid he ever meets someone who didn't even go to college.  He would probably want to kick them to death.        Taleb attempts to present this as merely poking fun at those who take their knowledge too seriously, which is always a worthy pursuit.  But that is not the impression the reader is left with.  I think its clear that he truly despises these people even if he is not fully aware of it.  At one point he states that his argument is often seen offensive by these people he targets (and he targets them right to the end of the book).  This might actually be what he tells himself but I think its more likely that they more offended by the direct insults, not theargument.      Taleb's observations about business people might say more about where he got his MBA (Wharton, a fairly \\"prestigious\\" business school) or about the types of MBA's that are drawn to trading.  Regardless, I would think that someone who is quantitatively oriented, like Taleb is supposed to be, might be a little less convinced by the non-random anecdotes he has chosen to form (and then describe) his impressions of others.       On the other hand, if you can get past Taleb's own demons, then you will see him make some good points.  Whatever the real source of all this contempt for a large group of fellow human beings, the idea that luck can be confused with some special skill (or bad luck with the lack of it) is perfectly valid.  Many readers, no doubt, will think of specific individuals they know where aptitude is clearly not the reason for any success.        An important element of the book is how Taleb uses the concept of \\"possible worlds\\" as a basis for evaluating true performace as opposed to merely looking at outcomes.  An outcome could simply be luck.  A possible worlds analysis looks at what could have happened otherwise.  For example, a person who wins a $10 million prize by \\"winning\\" a game of Russian roullete should not be considered a wise, accomplished person.        Taleb is also perfectly right when he discusses common errors in dealing with probabilities.  Like Taleb, I realize that journalists and other influential people are capable of some pretty profound misconceptions.  On the whole, whenever Taleb sticks to specific errors that people make and stays clear of general personality judgements, then his arguments are dead on.       But, again, I would argue that there are better sources for these arguments.  Even though Fortune magazine called it \\"one of the smartest books of all time\\", Taleb's repeated low-brow name calling doesn't exactly impress me. This book leaves me feeling that the author is just another one of the \\"hicks\\" he despises.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|... FOX cancelled it, while never giving it a chance to get off the ground in the first place....    Other than telling my story, there really isn't much to add to all the positive 5-star reviews concerning this short-lived series.  I mean, if I'm not careful, I could go on until this review became a novella.  There's a treasure-trove to talk about, including the characters, the old beat-up ship named Serenity, the difference of the highly advanced inner worlds and technically challenged outer worlds.  But I'll only make a few comments (knowing full-well that I can be long-winded).    First, I never heard of FIREFLY and had no idea this ever came on the little screen (and obviously neither did millions of other people).  I don't remember seeing any promotional material, but there probably was ... to some very limited extent.  I wasn't really watching much TV in those days (I watch a bit more today) and generally don't like the standard, run-of-the-mill science fiction filling the airwaves (even though it's one of my favorite genres).  And since I also like the Western genre, I would  have sought out a series that meshed the two, just to see how they could possibly pull it off.  More surprising still, they did a bang-up job (when one thinks of settlers moving to the outer colonies, it makes sense).  I think one has to go back to the movie OUTLAND (a remake of HIGH NOON) to see this done successfully.    So how and why did I ever go out and purchase this set?  Well, I was searching for new movies to purchase (I prefer movies over TV fare) and there was one here that stuck out because of all the positive reviews.  So I took a chance and hoped the reviewers got it right.  That movie was SERENITY, and yeah, the reviewers got it right.  Very right.  I was quite amazed.  Oh, not the special effects, although they were fine.  No, what amazed me were the writing and the characters (as well as its unusual theme).  The characters were alive and fresh and filled with very wittydialogue (even a few LOL moments).  Once I saw that movie, I was curious about this little, unknown and unseen series, but not quite enough to make the plunge (remember, I didn't like too many TV series then, or now).  Luckily, my son had the FIREFLY set, told me how terrific it was, and lent it to me (I, in exchange, lent him SERENITY, so we both came away happy).    As I stated, I won't comment too much on FIREFLY itself (there are excellent comments throughout the 3.000 plus reviews ... wow! ... over 3,000!!), other than I thought it was a terrific series (and yes, I purchased my own copy).  There was solid writing throughout the series and it deserved a far, far better fate.  And that really frustrates me today.  With all the bland shows on TV, and the laughable science fiction proliferating the abysmal Sci-Fi Channel, how in the world was this jewel (owned by FOX) not promoted to the heavens?  I think it could have blown the competition away if highly promoted and given a chance to find its audience.  It's obvious to me that FOX never really believed in the project.      Between 1 and 10 I give this series a marginal 9 (I first gave it an 8, but after much consideration, upped it to where I feel it rightfully belongs.  Why not a 10?  Well, some episodes were not quite up to the excellence of most of the series, although even those few were still highly entertaining and witty.    For those still reading, and who haven't seen this \\"Western in Space\\", do yourself a favor and try it out (meaning rent first -- there is no guarantee you'll like it as much as I since it's unusual enough that many may be put off for various reasons).  If you are still unsure, then rent the movie, SERENITY (it's the culmination of this series -- taking it to where Whedon intended to take the series if FOX executives had more than a dozen brain cells floating listlessly in their collective skulls).  And yeah, watching the movie first is kinda like watching the cart pull the horse, and Idon't fully recommend that you do it this way, but I really want people to take a look at a very promising series that died way too prematurely.  After all, misery loves company and I can 'almost' guarantee that once you see FIREFLY you'll be just as upset at FOX as I and several thousand other people here on AMAZON, as well as millions around the country.

B000XKZQ74|5.0|This movie was never very big in the US because it has subtitles.  The plot gives you a view into Eastern Germany during the Cold War that is both touching and real.  At times it is hard to tell if this is based on 1984 or actual history.  The scary one being the later.  Any educated person with decent understanding of the time period should surely put this movie on their list to watch.

Every cookie is beautifully pictured, with an accompanying caption on how it was made.  It has great ideas for virtually every holiday/occasion.  The authors include great tips on storage, shipping, tools, etc., as well as a few simple cookie recipes to use in your baking.      I'm buying one for every relative this christmas. I would recommend for anyone who loves to bake!
0684135051|3.0|I checked this out of the library after hearing so much about it.  I think it is a book that I will add to my knitting library, but more for then enjoyment of Elizabeth Zimmerman's writing style and common sense, than for a knitting reference.    This is definitely not a learn to knit book.  I found the chapters on sweaters and other knitted items a bit vague.  But, to be honest, I will probably never knit a sweater anyway; I'm more of an accessory, small item knitter.    But, I'd buy the book for the first chapter alone.  There are a lot of good tips and ideas in this chapter.  And, I love her style of writing.  You feel like she is sitting there talking to you, and she has so much common sense.  She makes you realize that knitting is fun, that you don't have to do it just like the book says (not even hers), so just relax and create.

B000T9QF8S|4.0|Of Sir Georg Solti's two Beethoven cycles with the CSO, I generally prefer the first, reissued here in a newly remastered edition commemorating the tenth anniversary of Solti's death.  By the early 1970's, when these recordings were made, Solti had moderated his volatile temperament sufficiently to be able to project the lofty qualities in Beethoven's music.  The slow movements are far more reflective than one might have expected from this conductor.  The one in the Ninth Symphony, for instance, conveys a sense of rapt solemnity that recalls Furtw&auml;ngler at his best (though with superior sound, of course, and more alert playing than the latter achieved in his famous live Bayreuth performance, reissued on EMI).  In general Solti combines Furtw&auml;nglerian weight with Toscaninian dynamism--an approach to Beethoven which will strike some listeners as \\"the best of both worlds\\" and others as an uneasy compromise.  I vacillate between these two opinions, sometimes within the compass of a single symphony.  For example, I found the first movement of the *Eroica* far too slow and ponderous, while the Funeral March struck me as one of the most gripping I have ever heard.  The best performances in the set are  2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.  The Seventh, in particular, is quite thrilling--the combination of weight and dynamism works especially well in this symphony; the dancelike aspects of the music are not compromised by the fundamental seriousness of Solti's conception. The Ninth, too, is splendid, with (as indicated above) a sublime traversal of the slow movement and a stirring, beautifully sung finale. The Second must rank with Bernstein/DG as one of the most vibrant accounts ever recorded. The \\"Pastoral\\" is more genial than one would have expected from Solti, but one misses the authentic Austrian lilt of B&ouml;hm, or the rich lyricism of Walter.  On the other hand, I appreciate the rhythmic vitality Solti brings to a work which, in lesser performances, can seem too languid by half. I also enjoyed the spectacular horn playing in the Peasant's Merrymaking and subsequent Storm episode. The First receives some admirably crisp playing, at snappy tempos, though in the end I find Solti's approach too portentous for a work which clearly harks back to Haydn.  The Eighth could use an infusion of Beethovenian \\"unbuttoned\\" humor, but is otherwise appropriately incisive and well played.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these performances more than I expected to, and in the case of the Second, Seventh and Ninth thought that Solti achieved something like greatness.  His later, digital cycle seems altogether at lower voltage, while his earliest versions of 3, 5 and 7 with the VPO (recently reissued by Decca) are too frenetic.  The first CSO Beethoven cycle is the one to have, then, if you're interested in hearing Solti's distinctive *via media* in Beethoven.  The playing of the CSO is glorious throughout and though the sonics are more variable than we would expect from Decca/London (largely due to the vicissitudes of the recording venues, especially the notoriously difficult acoustic of the Medinah Temple in Chicago), the sound is never less than acceptable and frequently excellent.<br /><br />Though I would not rank this set alongside Karajan's justly famous 1963 cycle, or the recently reissued Bernstein/Vienna (DG), I can imagine listeners who want to hear a great American orchestra in this repertoire finding Solti/CSO more than satisfactory.<br /><br />NOTE:  While I still endorse my estimation of this set, I have been recently re-assessing Solti's later, digital, Beethoven cycle, whose merits I tended to overlook when I wrote the review of his earlier Chicago cycle a few years ago.  After some careful comparative listening, I have recently come to a favorable view of the later cycle, which now strikes me as, overall, more thoughtful, nuanced and affectionate than  the older recordings.  The sound also superior--less clinical, warmer, though not necessarily better focused.  Though my opinions are still in flux, given that these two sets are now virtually in the same price range (consult sellers on this Website), I might tilt toward the later one (if it's just a question of comparing Solti with Solti--for a general recommendation I would still favor Karajan/1962 or 1977, Bernstein/Vienna (DG)  or possibly Szell/Cleveland).  The earlier Ninth has greater cogency than the later, while the later Seventh is considerably more refined in conception and execution.  Neither Eroica is particularly outstanding (Solti and the CSO sound too portentous here), though the earlier one is better played, and the later one marginally better shaped. Neither is as exciting or volatile as the conductor's 1958 account with the VPO (nla, but once available in a two-CD bargain issue from Decca).  When it comes to the First, Second and Eighth, I definitely prefer the digital accounts, which, though less viscerally exciting, are altogether more elegant and carefully crafted.  Both eighths are rather too serious for such a light-hearted score, but the digital one sings more lyrically where it needs to.  Right now I incline toward the later Fifth as well; it conveys greater majesty, if rather less urgency. Concerning the fourth and sixth I currently incline toward the later versions, again because of a greater warmth and elegance, though the earlier Sixth was arguably fresher.  I hope this addendum doesn't confuse the issue for prospective listeners, but I thought I had to weigh in with my most recent thoughts on Solti's Beethoven.pinions are still in flux, given that these two sets are now virtually in the same price range (consult sellers on this Website), I might tilt toward the later one (if it's just a question of comparing Solti with Solti--for a general recommendation I would still favor Karajan/1962 or 1977, Bernstein/Vienna (DG)  or possibly Szell/Cleveland).

0593055063|1.0|I enjoyed Dan Brown's previous books, but Digital Fortress was a complete waste of time.  The basic story could have been good, but the majority of the plot twists and turns were sophomoric, at best.  It read like a love-struck high school kid was writing a novel for a composition class.  Don't waste your time.  Enjoy Angels and Demons, along with The DaVinci Code, and let it go at that.

The writing and storylines are suberp but as an avid \\"listener\\" much of the enjoyment came from Roy Dotrice's narrating. What a huge disappointment this time. I do not know what prompted the change but John Lee is just wrong for this series. I realise when a new voice comes along they have to make it their own but he has just made it dreary. He has managed to make the characters flat and one dimensional.Whereas Roy Dotrice made them come alive he has killed them.

B000J103PC|5.0|There are times where you just want to bash Miranda's face in during this movie.  Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestley so convincingly, it makes you hate her character to the core.  I hope Meryl isn't like Miranda in real life, if so that would be sad.  I personally would not put up with anything Andie went through with Miranda and her crappy attitude.  I would have spat in her face and walked out on the job.  If that's really how the fashion industry operates, I think it's pathetic and they need to get over themselves because everything they design goes out of style anyways.  This film captures the attitude of the fashion industry and the acting is fantastic by Meryl Streep, I wish she would have won the oscar.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|I loved \\"Babel\\".  Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett always seem to pick top notch movies to work in.  Ironically the two best performances are with the supporting roles by the Japanese woman and the mexican actress.  (forgive me for not knowing their names!!).  My favourite scene is where the japanese woman stand naked before her potential trick and he rejects her, leaving her in tears and near suicide.  Who hasn't faced rejection sometime in our lives?  \\"Babel\\" is a humanitarian film that focuses on the human heart on how fragile we all are.  When stripped of everything, worldly possessions and false bravado, we are left with nothing but ourselves.
006054094X|1.0|This book was originally called '1421: The Year China Discovered the World.' It has been renamed, lest the market audience it is catering to be put off by that final, menacing word. This, in and of itself, should be enough to put you off. So should the map you'll find within the first few pages. On it, Admiral Zheng He's alleged voyages have been plotted. According to author Gavin Menzies, the Chinese/Muslim/eunich seafarer travelled along roughly 80% of the world's coastlines in two years, establishing 20 settlements as he went. In fact, one of the only places Zheng He seems to have missed was Europe. How convenient.<br /><br />After the known history runs its course (it is recorded that Zheng He and his treasure boats sailed to no less than 37 nations in two continents) Menzies simply invents history. Each time the trail runs cold, he becomes creative. The first few times you allow him to, but after the fifth or sixth 'I'm sure what happened is...' you realize you've been had; this book is a hoax. Take, for example, a structure that existed in Rhode Island. Experts say it was Danish (probably a grain tower), but Menzies insists it was Chinese, despite the fact that it was made of brick and features arched doorways. Anyone with even the faintest understanding of Chinese or European architecture could tell you which part of the world it must have come from. One of the book's biggest gaps (and there are quite a few) has to do with the return voyage. On the map, it is shown that the Chinese returned home by sailing over Russia, yet in the text this section of the journey is omitted.<br /><br />And here's something about Menzies that you might not know. He is currently helping a Canadian writer pen a book about a supposed Chinese settlement on Canada's eastern seaboard. Local historians dismiss the business as absurd and say the site the Canadian writer is referring to is an abandoned Loyalist farm. Menzies is reported to have shown up, taken a look around, and declared the place to be a Ming dynasty encampment. Honest. I'm from that part of Canada. When I was a kid, I discovered a peculiar stack of stones in the forest one day. I shall have to try to find them again. There could be money to be made.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt, author of Why China Will Never Rule the Worlda Ming dynasty encampment. Honest. I'm from that part of Canada.

B000VI70WM|4.0|This album has so much more depth.  It has a fresh, energized feeling to it that was lacking in the previous album.  It has funky moments where JT actually gets to play that freaking bass (the middle of The Valley and Skin Divers).  It has a wild sax solo at the end of Dirty Great Monster (anyone remember Rio?).  So for those of you who were skeptical about the whole Timbaland/Justin collaboration - never fear, the real D2 is still there. Simon's catchy lyrics are still there.  The song melodies and harmonies are still there. Yes, several new elements are introduced, but it WORKS.  Album highlights are the title track, Falling Down, Box Full o' Honey, Skin Divers, Dirty Great Monster. Play it loud, pump up the bass and apply your lipstick.
B00005JNS0|2.0|Cars was the first Pixar production to disappoint me. For a family with no interest in automobiles or racing or Nascar, the film had little to offer.    The characters weren't anything new. An arrogant lead (who never grew on me), a hick, a fiesty businesswoman type...these are all characters that have been done before. Where were the totally new ideas, like Dory the forgetful fish and Flik the inventor ant?    The plot was a transparent recycling of \\"Doc Hollywood\\", completely devoid of surprises. The audience knew from the moment Lightning McQueen arrived in town, that he would eventually come to love Radiator Springs. And personally, since I didn't care about the characters, the race held no suspense for me at all. It simply didn't matter who won or lost.    Aside from a couple of isolated moments of humor, I didn't even laugh until the John Ratzenberger scenes during the credits.    I'm sure the film was a lot of fun for John Lasseter to make, but it wasn't as fun for those of us who don't share Lasseter's love of cars.

B0007KTAU4|5.0|Really, now.  Who'd have thunk a super model could sing?<br /><br />But shockingly this is a super album.  Have you seen Casablanca?  The scenes in Rick's where the French chanteuse (Corinna Mura) sits on the high stool in the spot light with only a guitar and laconically lays it on the crowd?  And then passionately belts La Marseillaise out for the delectation of the SS?  That's who Mlle. Bruni reminds me of.  Not because Corinne & Carla sound particularly alike, mais parce qu'elles sont toutes deux filles francaises avec guitares, rien d'autre, each laying it down atmospheric.  No flipping of the proverbial bird at goose stepping fascists, here, tant pis.. but Miss Bruni would if she could.. I feel it in my marrow, flowing flush..<br /><br />Ahem.. ah, Well, I cannot of course gainsay those here who dislike this album, or who else damn it with faint praise.. De gustibus non disputandem est, afterall.  Some complain some of her songs sound too alike.  Mais apres on boit quelques verres.. mixed with some (say) Keren Ann (who is just as fantastique as all the others here say,) Trenet, Gainsbourg, Piath, Comme d'habitude, and as Frank would likely say, it all just swings, baby.<br /><br />As for the songs: the title &#34;Quelqu'un M'a Dit&#34; is exquisite.  But &#34;Le Toi Du Moi&#34; is as fantastic.  I was driving lost for several hours on service roads in Pike National Forest in the Colorado Rockies the other day, fording streams, inhaling clouds of red dust, all the while grooving to her repeatedly.  Nigh perfect ironic symbiosis of song and setting.  Check these lyrics: &#34;Tu es l'envie et moi le geste.. Toi le citron et moi le zeste.. Je suis le the, tu es la tasse.. Toi la guitare et moi la basse.. Tu es la Belle et moi la Bete.. Tu es le corps et moi la tete.. Tu es le corps.. Yumm!&#34;<br /><br />Just very good stuff.  Stands up (plug your inquisitorial ears: heresy floweth here freely) to Edith's lyrics any day.. Okay, okay.. well, maybe, not.. (I recant.. I recant.. le vin doth confuseth..)<br /><br />Any which way, let me conclude suggesting you check out another super-model songstress, Milla Jovovich, whose album &#34;The Divine Comedy&#34; is also well worth your time.Any which way, let me conclude suggesting you check out another super-model songstress, Milla Jovovich, whose album &#34;The Divine Comedy&#34; is also well worth your time.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|It's rare that a Dylan cover is better then the real Dylan. That's the case here; none of the songs are better then the orignal.    I would buy the album for one reason: Dylan singing \\"I'm Not There.\\" It's a mystery why it's taken so long for this song to make it on a record! I would pay 20 bucks for this song alone. It's that good. It's classic Dylan, and it now ranks in my Top 20 of best Dylan songs.
B000683VI4|3.0|James Garner (calling himself Duke?) is in this nursing home and he is going to read to one of the depressed lady guests out of this romance book that he just happens to have with him. The book story is about a little rich teenage girl summering in South Carolina.  There she meets and eventually falls big-time for a local sandy-haired Lothario (not called Duke)who works in a sawmill.  Her mama just won't have that so the girl is packed up and moved back to the city.  He writes to here every day for an entire year (Every Single Day!) 'n of course the mother has intercepted every single letter.....  the girl never fetched the mail for herself even one time for the entire year.  The war comes and goes. The girl gets engaged to a dark-haired (that's important) captain.      BUT-  OOooooooops    Now she finds the first love again.    Who to choose?  The handsome new fellow or the former flame?    During all this there are occasional flashbacks to James Garner reading this novelette to the depressed lady.  You have to guess a LOT about the exact details of who's who doing what to whom and where.  Only by viewing the extra features' deleted scenes does the thing become clear.......   but the characters as represented in their twenties just do not match James Garner and the lady.      Okay, so who's the author of theis tome from which James is reading?  It seems to be bound so maybe it is a published novel about the pair.  Okay, it is defintely about the two of them.  There is an inscription on the flyleaf calling for our hero to read this book to the heroine in her dementia to help her remember. Duke, the reader is reading about Noah, the boy/young man.    How did a youngster with tousled sandy hair in his mid 20's standing about 5-10 (as seen next to the fireplace and regular doors grow almost another 6 inches taller and get a full head of DARK hair?       You know....  if they had just left out the single ten second scene where the girl has made her choice (about ten seconds) THAT would have made this a real winner. Put back all the stuff that was cut to make the story clear and leave out the part about the final choice.  THEN we would be seeing a dementia patient with her beloved standing by her to the very end.  BUT...........  you'd never know just which one it was.   8-?    This one will make it to the sniffle & blow crowd but hardly to the awards.    Noah  (yeah, I know.  My name really is Noah, though)    8-?
0525950079|2.0|The only reason I finished this book was that the time period facinates me and I was curious to see if I could figure out why everything in Follett's novel was so uninspiring.  Here are the major problems:    1.  Follett has obviously done his research on the period, other than the language, but he lets it take center stage, to the detriment of his characters.  It feels like he created a list of stock items from the middle ages and checked them off as he went along -- horny bishop: check; power-hungry priest: check; lesbian nun: check; lord of the manor who thinks his serfs don't matter as humans: check; black death: check; etc., etc., etc.  He even brings in the flagellants, for no apparent reason, even though they really didn't exist to any significant degree in England.  Most of it doesn't advance or have anything to do with the story -- it's just there so that he can get in everything having to do with the 14th century.    2.  The characters don't feel like real people.  It is possible to set a book in this time period and put characters in it that seem to live and breathe and make you care about them.  Connie Willis' The Doomsday Book does this really well.  When her characters die, you cry.  Follett's main characters all miraculously survive the horrors of the century, and it's only the peripheral characters who die.  Yet you don't feel their pain or their triumphs or anything much.  They just don't seem real.    3.  Follett attributes a 21st century sensibility to the characters that is out of keeping for even the most progressive people in the 14th century.  I love the idea of a woman who wants to break out of the servitude and inferiority of women in the middle ages, but Caris, the lead female character, is an outright feminist.  And when Merthin, the main male character, discovers that one of the monks in the town has been stealing things, he wonders if maybe it's a sickness.  Give me a break!  The notion that something that was considered a sin might havebeen caused by mental illness just didn't exist in the 14th century.  The book is riddled with anachronistic attitudes such as these.    4.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the book is filled with words and phrases that didn't exist in the 14th century.  I appreciate that Follet has tried to make the language sound natural, rather than using the syntax of the period, which would have sounded natural to people in the middle ages but wouldn't to us.  But using words like \\"senility\\" (which the Oxford English Dictionary records as not having appeared in pring until 1791), phrases like \\"gone missing\\" (a 20th century creation), etc., doesn't sound natural, it just takes you even further out of the time period.  Particularly noticeable is that the characters call the plague \\"the plague.\\"  \\"Plague\\" wasn't used for any illness until much later.  The people who lived through the Black Death (another term from much later) called it the \\"pestilence\\" or the \\"Great Mortality.\\"  They definitely did not use the term plague.  If you don't know this, it might not make much difference to your enjoyment of the book, but if you're a history buff, things like this just take you further out of the action.  Given how much research Follett obviously did on the period, the inattention to language just seems sloppy.    5.  Some people have been offended by the amount of sex in the book.  It's not the amount that's a problem.  Let's face it -- there was no t.v., few people had books, and the main form of entertainment you could have after dark was sex.  So it's not surprising to find alot of it.  The problem is that it's gratuitous and written from a real male fantasy perspective.  A sample from one of Follet's less graphic passages:  \\"Caris had never seen Mair undressed, and she could not resist a peek.  Her companion's naked body took her breath away.  Mair's skin seemed to glow like a pink pearl.  Her breasts were generous, with pale girlish nipples, and she had a luxuriant bush of fair public hair.\\"  And seriously -- how many times does Merthin have to look at a pillar and remember the time he \\"felt up\\" Caris there?    6.  The mystery at the core of the book, having to do with the death of Edward II, is lame and implausible and there's really not much of a payoff.  It feels tacked on in order to give the sense of a story, when the book is really not much more than a survey of the middle ages (albeit with the tacked on attitudes of modern times for the main characters).    I was so excited about reading this book, but it was a major disappointment, neither moving, nor particularly entertaining or informative.  If you want to learn about the 14th century, I'd recommend Barbara Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century\\", Thomas Costain's series on the Plantagenets, particularly \\"The Three Edwards\\" (which covers the 14th century), Jonathan Sumption's books on the Hundred Years War, Paul B. Newman's \\"Daily Life in the Middle Ages,\\" or for fiction, the aforementioned \\"The Doomsday Book.\\"  All would be better choices than this long (over 900 pages) and unengaging volume.

0876852630|5.0|World War II, America and Henry Chinaski. This is Factotum. Charles Bukowski brings his alter ego, Henry Chinaski, back to life in this phenomenal work and with it, he puts himself and society on trial.<br />A lot, perhaps too much, has been said about Bukowski and his work. While I truly enjoy his short stories the most, Factotum, along with post Office, are among my favorite books written by American authors. Bukowski's writing is simple and straight-to-the-point, and Factotum is no exception. Filled with short, sometimes paragraph-like chapters, the writing flows smoothly, gently sneaking under your skin, and before you know it you start to care and you start to see the world through Chinaski's eyes. A world, which, for the most part, has not improved over the past sixty years. Perhaps his truths are universal. One thing hit me in particular: Chinaski goes to the American Cancer Society, only to be given an appointment three weeks later. He mentions that all his life he has been told to catch cancer early, but when it comes to it, he is told to wait three weeks. Last year I went through pretty much the same thing, only to have to wait for an appointment for over four months. Fortunately, it was not cancer, but if it was...what is the point.<br />Anyway, back to Factotum. Chinaski, being a \\"4-F\\" as he states, was exempt from the draft which left him behind, free to look for a job and settle down. Only the restless soul is incapable of settling down. A struggling writer, (writing several short stories by hand each week, which shows great inspiration and capability) he does not have much else to live for. Submerged in booze, smoking, and having sex, he kills time between odd jobs, while waiting to be discovered. However, this is not the point of the story. The story itself is the loose journal of a man struggling with himself and the changes our society was undergoing at that time. Chinaski was not a man who knew what he wanted. As long as his basic needs were met, (Booze, cigarettes, sex, and the occasional meal) he was happy -- relatively happy, or rather unconcerned with the world. He mentions the war in the terms of there being less people applying for the jobs, yet it does not make the jobs easier to get. He chooses jobs which require minimum effort, be it physical (when possible) or mental (always), because he cannot be bothered. Considering his arrest record, he knows he cannot get a \\"good\\" job, for they require a background check, so he settles for the other jobs -- shipping clerk, janitor, warehouseman, factotum.... He drinks during the day, he writes at night, he fights at bars, and he drinks more. When he has money, he buys a good whiskey; when he doesn't, he settles for a rotgut wine. He treats women the same way he treats his bottle -- as long as he can get it, it's good. His women, with the exception of a few random \\"quickies\\", are not much different than him, only less inspired. Chinaski lives this way because he chooses to, because he cannot be bothered. And why should he.<br />How many of us wasted years and perhaps decades chasing after something that seemed important to us, yet it really wasn't? How many of us do something we hate or dislike only for the sake of \\"appearances\\"? We are all guilty of that. As a society, we look down on the bum standing at a corner, holding a fifth wrapped in a paper bag; we look down on the men who move from place to place, unable to hold jobs, unable to start a family, the men who do inferior work. How many of us ever stopped to think why...to see if they maybe chose to do that, if they have a reason. Chinaski had two years of college, yet he worked as a janitor. It was not from laziness, it was a conscious choice. He did not have faith in the system, he did not want to be part of the system; he simply wanted means of making some money to fulfill his needs. Factotum is a portrait of a broken society, of an era of broken dreams. Factotum is not the \\"great American novel\\", but it is a novel full of timeless truth, full of humanity. Chinaski may be dirty and drunk, but he does what he wants, he pursues his dream. He is not trying to change the world, and he does not want the world to change him. Where Kerouac goes on and on for pages about \\"beauty\\", Bukowski delivers a short sentence, but always hitting the nail straight on its head, keeping it simple, raw and gritty -- sometimes poetic, sometimes disgusting -- but that is what life is after all.l full of timeless truth, full of humanity.

B000UNYJXQ|1.0|How DARE Michael Moore expose the deaths caused by HMOs that rip off their policyholders so that they can accumulate greater profit? We're not supposed to know about this stuff - we're just to pay the bills and not complain! USA healthcare is the envy of the world - we pay more and we get less. Let the uninsured eat cake!    Despite the negativity of Moore, the fact is that by killing or maiming us many loyal HMO employees have won promotions and better lives for them and their families. United Health (NYSE:UNH) CEO Dr. William McGuire alone got 1.6 BILLION in options (plus salary, of course). If America were to go the way of the rest of the industrialized nations with universal coverage(as Moore seems to advocate), then that money would go into healthcare instead of the portfolio of CEOs and others more worthy than us.     Think of the misery and pain that their Humvee dealer, stock broker, and real estate investment agent will suffer if that easy cash can't be extracted from our premiums and invested in personal wealth! Plus - we'd lessen the chances of getting Tuberculosis from the uninsured guy on the bus next to us. Fat guys like Moore have no concern for the people he hurts with the perspectives he presents in his movies.    Michael Moore isn't skinny and is known to have an independent point of view (aka \\"liberal\\"), so obviously there's nothing to learn from this movie. Let's ignore this \\"SICKO\\" and go back to watching the \\"Fair and Balanced\\" team on FOX NEWS - an organization that would never compromise honesty and integrity to make a buck like \\"moneybags\\" Michael Moore.
0552999652|4.0|Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden is an intense book about a U.S. military mission that started out as a seemingly easy assignment, but went terribly wrong.  This story concerns events that actually happened during two days in October 1993 in the sandy desert city of Mogadishu, Somalia.  The main mission for the members of the Rangers and Delta Squad was to capture two important Habr Gidr clan members, and possibly the warlord, Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  Instead, the troops found themselves involved in a bloody battle with Somalis determined to eliminate the soldiers.<br />  Black Hawk Down is a very engrossing book.  Mark Bowden does a great job making the reader feel as if they were right in the action.  The book is occasionally gory, especially with the descriptions of gunshot wounds, but shouldn't be too bad for most readers at and above high school age.  There wasn't a moment in the book when I wasn't rooting for the soldiers to survive against the odds.  The book follows many individuals.  The differences in each character's point of view on the action gives the reader a better look into modern warfare.<br />  I recommend this book, since it is one that will keep anyone on the edge of his or her seat.  It opens a portal into the horrors of war and doesn't go soft for a single sentence.
0671015206|5.0|Wow, what a great book! Very eye-opening and interesting. At times a little hard to follow for me, but in general this book makes so much sense and is packed with valuable life lessons. I don't think it is ever wise to go to the extreme of being a self centered tight wad, but our society IS indeed a high consumption based one with many pitfalls to watch out for. There are many proverbs in the Bible which point to the common sense in this book.
B00009V7T2|5.0|If you haven't heard the Volta, this is a great place to start. The catchiest songs, but still experimental, this is some kinda ultimate prog-rock for the 00's. Sorta reminds me of Pink Floyd meets King Crimson with a little Santana thrown in, but the angular muscularity of At the drive-in.
B000WSL5Y0|4.0|I loved this one.  Its not China Town but its a damned fine piece of work with some nice twists and great background.    I do wish I knew a bit more about Casey Afflecks character, especially given who some of his friends are and how for such a skinny guy he kicks a$$ and commands some respect from locals.  Other than that quibble this is a great R rated film to recommend to others. I would rank it right up there with Mystic River.

B00004STUL|2.0|This movie depends heavily on the interactions between Martin Lawrence (amazingly thin!) and Will Smith.  To my mind, their banter seems strained and not very funny.  Will Smith is always worth watching, but Martin Lawrence is obviously trying to put his lines over by sheer force. To make a rather strange comparison, it kind of reminded me of some of the dialog in the later Marx Brothers movies:  Delivered with gusto, but not, unfortunately, very funny.  The plot is completely unbelievable and seems pretty much an afterthought.  One bright spot:  Tea Leoni proves that she has the best legs in Hollywood.  Wearing some super-short skirts, she is definitely the best thing in the picture.  Add two stars to my rating if you are a Tea fan.  Add three stars if you have a big league crush on her.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This is a great movie. The characters are a little bit one-dimensional, but that is Rand's way. In spite of that, however, the actors do a great job of breathing life into these characters. The story does a good job of showing how the mob mentality can work to undercut genius. You see it today all over the world, which is why this movie tends to have a very timely message within its story. Overall, a good movie. Get it and enjoy.
0805079831|5.0|Using shock treatment as a metaphor, Klein analyzes the importance of economic dislocations and disasters in creating the demoralization necessary for the success of Milton Friedman's free market philosophy. This is a very important book, and shows why the apparent stupidities of the Bush administration in Iraq and Katrina are actually deliberate measures designed to daze and demoralize people into accepting a radical free-market agenda.
B000000HTL|5.0|Although starting out as a psychedelic band, Van der Graaf Generator were soon firmly placed in the Euro-prog camp but they were really quite unlike and much better than most bands from that era.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on overblown guitars, Van der Graaf Generator relied largely on passionate drumming and organ work that reaches an intensity quite unlike most music ever could. The production may be as \\"clean\\" as most progressive rock, but the music is just blistering with passion and feeling.<br /><br />\\"H to He Who Am The Only One\\" was where Van der Graaf really came into their own. Their previous album [[ASIN:B000000HZW The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other]] had shown some remarkable moments like \\"White Hammer\\", but here they manage to weave volume and beauty in a way that was never matched for over twenty years afterwards. \\"House With No Door\\" might seem like an ordinary ballad, but unlike almost all progressive rock it had genuine, touching intimacy that really makes a listener truly feel for what Peter Hamill is saying. The flutes in the middle of the song really are beautiful and then the song turn visceral in a quite unique way.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Killer\\" shows the band's harder, louder side to the fore. Some of the most passionate sax work you will hear from David Jackson intertwines with Guy Evans' dense drumming and Peter Hamill's unqiue voice. The result is explosive, even aggressive yet as touching and dramatic as Laura Nyro on [[ASIN:B000068QZP Tendaberry]]. Together with Hamill's wonderful lyrics about being attacked by a fish, this makes for one of the best songs of its era.<br /><br />The remaining three tracks move towards even heavier organ-led work, and \\"The Emperor in His War-Room\\" is perhaps the definitive Van der Graaf track with Hamill alternating between quiet singing and dramatic shouts that still have melody. It is hard to believe rock bands could get so loud with hardly any guitar or bass - yet Van der Graaf were a band who at their best could seemingly break almost any rule. \\"Lost\\" is even more intense and moving, yet faster in tempo. At times, though, it is a truly reflective piece. The closer \\"Pioneers Over C\\", with its space-travel theme, is the culmination of Hamill's remarkable lyrical vision.<br /><br />For all its labelling, \\"H to He, Who Am the Only One\\" is one of the most unique albums you will find. Fiery, yet beautiful, heavy without guitars, thickly produced yet emotional, there is very little like this. Fans of bands like [[ASIN:B0000019HU Slint]], [[ASIN:B000001FZK later Talk Talk]] and [[ASIN:B00004ZD69 Godspeed You Black Emperor]] really should hear Van der Graaf Generator. In many ways their passionate, touching, intense, despairing sound was that of the first-ever post-rock band, and Hamill's dramatic voice and cerebral lyrics make this album a true masterpiece.emingly break almost any rule. \\"Lost\\" is even more intense and moving, yet faster in tempo.

B000TEUSJU|4.0|The reign of Caligula was interesting from the point of a madman having his way with the Roman Empire.  I did not find the additional information on the additional discs to be of much interest from a layman's point of view (perhaps a historian would be more interested).  If I had it to do over, I would have just purchasd a one disc DVD.  However, the costumes and scenery were great!  And unfortunately one still shot in an advertizement did not appear in the DVD itself.      Perhaps packaging was better done for other customers, but the box I received the DVD in was oversized without any padding allowing the DVD to shift from one end to the other in shipment with some resulting damage to one of the discs.
B00000JGHL|4.0|Roughly based on real events in the 1980s when Ed Koch was mayor. A solid film and a step up from another John Cusack political drama, the decent but yuppie-themed \\"True Colors.\\" Cusack's character is the deputy mayor of NYC, aka the ambitious mayor's,(Al Pacino) right hand man. A shooting in Brooklyn leaves three people dead which culminates into a Willie Horton type legal & media crisis for the mayor's office. Cusack teams up with Bridget Fonda, a lawyer for the detectives endowment fund to perform due diligence only to find their digging ends up too close to home. Danny Aiello does a good job as a complicated yet sympathetic Brooklyn councilman; Martin Landau as a bent new york supreme court judge and former law partner of the mayor; Richard Schiff as a probation supervisor; and David Paymer as a top city hall advisor. Snappy intelligent dialogue, Pacino is rarely better.    \\"The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know.\\" ~ Harry Truman
0810993139|5.0|My son loved this book so much he actually turned off the TV to read all on his own.  He was literally laughing out loud through the whole book.  He says that anyone will like it but probably boys more than girls.  He can't wait until the next one comes out!
B000SUKPKM|4.0|The others who have reviewed this CD obviously don't know the purpose behind this CD.  The CD is called \\"Goo Goo Dolls Greatest Hits VOLUME 1: THE SINGLES.  This is a compilation of the 12 hits that cracked the Billboard Top 10 list, along with the song from the Transformers Soundtrack (Before It's Too Late) and a remix of \\"Feel The Silence\\" off their newest album, Let Love In.  The band has made it very clear that the purpose of this CD was to release the most famous/newest material they have, then to release another greatest hits with all the other great songs.  This way, if casual fans buy this CD and like what they hear, they will buy Volume 2, which will be full of more underground stuff.      For those of you who are casual fans (i.e those of you who immediately think \\"Iris\\" when u hear the band's name) this is the perfect compilation to start out with.  For those of you who are hardcore fans, such as myself (i.e those of you know who George Tutuska is), I would simply recommend buying this CD for two reasons:  1. The remastered audio sounds great   2. Simply for the new version of \\"Name\\"    I myself think the Superstar Car Wash - A Boy Named Goo era was the greatest, but either way, this is a good compilation.  If you want a great Goo Goo Dolls compilation thats a little less commercial, buy \\"What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art, and Commerce\\"
0307001466|1.0|I was disappointed when this book arrived.  When I was young I had an edition from the 1960's - this is not it!  Text from the 1960's version is referenced in the editorial review which does not appear in this book (both the goat and the crab do not appear, among others).    Don't assume that the same title and publisher means it's the same book. And, unlike I did, read all the reviews before you buy (some else has already made this discovery).
B000VKW7AK|5.0|Amazing boxset!! Rare trax + live CD + live DVD!!! 5 discs in less than $45<br /><br />The fourth disc is no doubt best megadeth live sounding ever!!! Megadeth at their peak !! Rattlehead, Black friday, Take no prisoners and The skull beneath the skin were all there! I got the bootleg of his show but the sound here is 10.000 times better. The fifth disc is another awesome stuff, a live DVD with the classic line-up... picture and sound quality are top notch. Nothing better than seeing Marty's nailed Tornado of souls and Lucretia solos from various angle! :D<br /><br />The first 3 disc are combination of studio album (remastered) and rare stuff (live, demo, unreleased, Japan bonus track, session take, interview etc)what else?<br /><br />Off course some people will say why this or that  stuff arent there,etc but again, band & label can never please anyone but the overall value of this release is perfect! Booklet and packeging includes various Band photos, stories, discography, great artwork etc.

B000VI70X6|3.0|Shakira has come to become one of the biggest artists in the music industry. With large sales on her first English debut album and hits like \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"Hips Don't Lie\\", she is sure expected to deliver a good, if not excellent, concert.    It seems though that fame and money have come in Shakira's way to a point where is not good. Having attended two of her concert in Miami (September 15th, 06 and December 9th, 06), I have to say that the biggest disappointment came from the concert itself, not her music, not her energy, but everything else, and by that I mean the production.    As good as Shakira may be, she gives a concert that, while is has great energy, fails to deliver to what Shakira should have given us: a mesmerizing show full of lights, stage changes, and a little more visuals to play with (the tickets where not cheap). All there was-- a giant wall, full of light installation that would sometimes spell words like \\"No\\" and \\"Siego, Sordo, Muda\\" or would follow Shakira's music.    The flow of the concert somehow felt weird, it didn't feel like a concert, somehow the transitions from song to song did not seem right and it was more than obvious that time was taken to adjust the stage and make any changes last minute for the DVD release.    The Special Features include two documentaries: \\"Around the World in 367 Days\\" and \\"Barefoot\\"-- an eye opening truth of today's Colombia, and Shakira's organization \\"Pies Descalzos\\".    It also includes the video for \\"Las de la Intuicion\\" and the live versions of \\"Obtener Un Si\\", which was cut from the concert, and \\"La Pared\\".    The Bonus CD includes six songs from the concert: \\"Intro/Estoy Aqui\\" \\"Don't Bother\\" \\"Inevitable\\", \\"La Pared\\" and \\"Hips Don't Lie\\".
1594200823|5.0|This book is a detailed, thoughtful discussion of where our food comes from.  There is much that I didn't know, or hadn't thought about.    To start, it turns out that most of our food comes from corn, in ways that I had hardly imagined.  Aside from tracing corn through the foodchain, one can scientifically prove that most of the carbon in our bodies originally came from corn, by measuring the proportion in our bodies of carbon-13, which happens to appear in a higher proportion in corn than in other plants.  Producing most of our food from corn might not sound so bad by itself, but it turns out that this is an ecological disaster, for a number of reasons.  The most distressing for me is that vast amounts of fossil fuel are consumed to grow corn, to process corn into the food we eat, and to transport the food to us.  It is estimated that 10 calories of fossil fuel energy go into 1 calorie of food.    It follows, by my back-of-the-envelope calculations, that walking might use more oil than driving the same distance (because of the extra calories burned by walking).  However, riding a bicycle still wins.    The first part of the book devastatingly skewers our industrial food system, which has created this and many other unnecessary problems.  For example, in the past cows and corn would grow on the same farm, and cow manure would fertilize the corn.  Now cows are rasied far away from where the corn is grown;  oil has to be consumed to make fertilizer for the corn, and the cow manure presents a waste disposal problem.  There are so many other stupid things that you will just have to read the book to find out.  After the buzzword \\"sustainable\\" is starting to lose its meaning from overuse, the author reminds us: \\"Unsustainable\\" means that SOONER OR LATER, IT MUST COLLAPSE.    Now I can't walk into a supermarket without being racked with guilt that I am destroying the world, and overcome with despair that most people don't even have a clue about the global consequences oftheir shopping decisions.  Fortunately, there are alternatives.  The second part of the book gives a detailed portrait of a model farm in Virginia, which grows different plants and animals which mutually support each other and require hardly any outside resources.  This kind of \\"management intensive\\" farming is much more difficult than the usual kind, but we are going to have to learn to do this if we don't want to starve in the future.  If you want to make a difference, you can start by buying locally grown, minimally processed food as much as possible.    The second part of the book also discusses the usual kind of \\"organic\\" food, which the author calls \\"industrial organic\\".  Summary: organic food uses less nasty chemicals than non-organic food, but otherwise has many of the same problems, including heavy use of fossil fuel.  Organic food comes with a lot of marketing and story-telling;  for example, \\"free range\\" chicken is a joke.  (The chickens theoretically could go outside into a yard, but everything possible is done to discourage this, so that in practice it never happens.)    In the third part of the book, the author discusses his own experience producing a meal more or less entirely from hunting and gathering.  Included is an extensive meditation on the ethics of eating animals.  In a brilliant piece of rhetoric, the author first presents a compelling case that one should not eat meat, and then subtly demolishes it.  Hunting and gathering is not presented as a viable alternative to feeding us (our population is far too large), but rather as an enlightening alternate perspective on our relation to what we eat.    In conclusion, given that you eat three or more times a day, you really should read this book (if you are not already familiar with this material) to become more aware of what this eating actually entails.  The writing is a bit long-winded and repetetive at times, and the book could probably be edited to about 80 percent of its length without losingmuch.  However it reads quickly.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|First of all anyone who bashes anything that Zeppelin releases is not worthy of listening to the music. Sure this almost duplicates Early Days and Latter days, so what? It's Zeppelin for crying out loud. This is the only band in history that has no filler material, every song on every album is a hit. You would have to actually have a 10 CD best of to include everything. Enjoy this for what it is, a collection of great Zeppelin tracks and stop complaining about what it should or could have been, or why it was released! Sheesh! And by the way, buy the Song Remains the Same (expanded and remastered) next week. This expanded edition is the complete show with all of the tracks in the movie. That quite possibly could be the best Live album ever released.

0451205766|4.0|Having already seen the movie, I hadn't ever thought of reading the book until my father recommended it to me.  And since he rarely reads fictional novels I decided to read Mario Puzo's book.  Very quickly I noticed that the book includes elements from both Godfather I and II movies, e.g. the story of how ordinary Vito Corleone became a top mafia boss, the horse's head, etc.    What I like about the book:  The main characters (the Don, Michael, Sonny, Tom Hagen, the other mobsters) and their personal histories, the action, and the detailed descriptions of how they arrange security as part of their everyday lives.  The way these people live is really fascinating.    What I dislike about the book:  The numerous side stories re: minor characters, e.g. the undertaker, the doctor, Corleone's daughter in Vegas, Fontane's family life, etc., that have little to do with the core storyline.  I wish Puzo had concentrated more on the principal story.  I didn't start reading the Godfather to learn the details of their rather mundane lives.    All in all, a good - but not a great book - at least in my opinion.  A factual history of the real Sicilian mafia can be found in Cosa Nostra by John Dickie.

The only reason I bought it was to hear just how good the new remastering job sounded. - I am not in the least bit disappointed. I'm listening to it right now (comparing it to the \\"Complete Studio Album\\" box set from '93. - There's NO comparison! Jones' bass leaps right out at you, now. Bonham's drums attack mercilessly. I'm hearing subtlties from Plant and Page that I've never heard before. I will definitely (and gladly) buy the whole Zeppelin catalogue, yet again, when they are reissued with this new mastering.

0937381888|5.0|My wife told me to get a hobby so I bought this book...  I am having a blast and it was the worst mistake she ever made.    This book is amazing.  It starts with a \\"crash course in brewing\\".  Truth be told, you could brew good beer after chapter 1 by just following a couple pages of steps and looking at the pictures.      The book then goes onto explain every piece of hardware and ingredient needed to brew excellent beer.      It also detailed information on the process behind the scenes.  How does yeast react with sugar?  Why do you need to cool wort quickly?  What factors determine beer color, gravity, off flavors?    If you are a new brewer looking for everything you need to know about making beer, buy this book.  If you are an intermediate craft brewer looking for some helpful tips, buy this book.  Heck, if you are just curious about the process of making beer, buy this book.    I am your average Joe.  I don't drink all that much, I just like good beer.  I thought brewing beer would be difficult.  I had a thousand questions before reading this book.  This book answered all of them.  I was amazed how easy it was to learn how to brew excellent beer.  This book makes learning the process fun and easy.

To mix is up just a little bit, \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\", \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Ten Years Gone\\" were dropped from \\"Early Days and Latter Days\\", and these 4 songs were added instead: \\"Ramble On\\", Heartbreaker\\", \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"D'Yer Mak'er\\". Too me those are minor changes on the fringes. It all sounds terrific, of course, due to yet more remastering from Jimmy Page.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you are new to Led Zeppelin, or if you are one of the remaining 13 people on this planet who after all this time do not have either the Led Zeppelin albums proper or the 2002 \\"Early Days and Later Days\\" compilation, by all means drop everything, and order this terrific and value-priced set immediately.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Absolutely love the first Series, however the second series is better than the first. If you are into supernatural themes but without the major horror factor, then you will love Supernatural. It is about two brother who hunt evil things that are killing people.  Some of the things that they hunt are ghosts, vampires, and werewolves.  My favorite episode is when they are in Hollywood on holiday and they come across a spirit killing people on a horror movie set.  However, the best thing about series two of Supernatural is that it has not been shown on New Zealand TV yet. So I have seen the series before other New Zealanders have.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|This is not the first Goo Goo Dolls complilation (more on that later), but this is the first compilation of the Goo Goo Dolls' greatest hits and best known songs. How does it stack up?<br /><br />\\"Greatest Hits, Volume 1: The Singles\\" (14 tracks, 53 min.) rightfully focuses on 1998's Dizzy Up The Girl, the band's most successful album, and is represented here by 5 tracks: \\"Dizzy\\", \\"Slide\\", \\"Broadway\\", \\"Black Balloon\\", and probably the band's signature song \\"Iris\\". 2002's Gutterflower get 3 tracks here: \\"Here Is Gone\\", \\"Big Machine\\" and \\"Sympathy\\". Last year's disappointing \\"Let Love In\\" nevetherless gets 4 tracks here: the title track, \\"Stay With You\\", \\"Feel the Silence\\" (which comes in a new mix), and \\"Better Days\\". Strangely, only one track from the band's comemrcial breakout album. 1995's \\"A Boy Named Good\\" is: \\"Name\\",  and it's not even the original, no, it's a newly recorded version (and inferior to the original). Why Rzeznik felt the need to do that, who knows. This compilation is rounded out by \\"Before It's Too Late\\", the Goo Goo's contribution to the \\"Transformers\\" soundtrack earlier this year.<br /><br />In all, there is a lot of good music here. But this should be called the \\"So Far Incomplete Greatest Hits\\". Conspicuously missing here are \\"Long Way Down\\" from the \\"Boy Named Goo\\" album, which was a genuine radio hit (and later also appeared on the \\"Twister\\" soundtrack); \\"January Friend\\" from the \\"Dizzy\\" album; \\"We Are the Normal\\" (from the excellent \\"Superstar Car Wash\\" album, and the predecessor of \\"Name\\"); and most of all \\"Give a Little Bit\\", the Supertramp cover that eventually appeared on \\"Let Love In\\" and the band's biggest radio hit in the last 3 years. At 53 min. there clearly was room to add at least those 4 songs here as well.<br /><br />In 2001, the band released a terrific but under-the-radar compilation called \\"What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art and Commerce\\", a hard charging and rocking collection of the band's first 6 albums up to that point (minus the hits like \\"Name\\", \\"Slide\\", \\"Black Balloon\\" etc.). It was a terrific way of showcasing the band's bar-punk-rock origins. I have no problem with the band evolving into a (mostly) power-ballad band but let's not forget the other facet of the band's sound either. In all, \\"Greatest Hits: Volume 1\\" is not bad, but could have been better. \\"Volume 2\\" is supposedly on the way for Spring 2008, focusing on the band's B-sides, one-offs and other oddities and rarities.ike \\"Name\\", \\"Slide\\", \\"Black Balloon\\" etc.).

B000Y179KO|5.0|Thanks for the music. As a member of the 'new' 60's generation (never thought I'd get this far), I enjoy the sound of this music, and thinking about the words and their meaning will help us all fight off the Alt Bug. I read a lot of comments on this album about 'nothing new to say here' - please help us keep saying the things we said in the 60/70's until somebody gets it. Life is a long road, and in the words of Warren Zevon, \\"Enjoy Every Sandwich\\" - this is a very tasty one.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Picked up my set today and I am submitting my review for those of you wondering about the extras and such. First off the packaging: As you can see in the pictures, the packaging is something you would expect to find in a Barbie Doll box. All of the seasons come in their own respective folders with pictures of the cast and different designs on each. All of the discs are numbered 1-42. The discs come in cardboard sleeves which worried me at first because I was expecting to find a lot of scratched or damaged discs(Like in the Stargate-SG1 set). But upon inspection of all the discs, they all came in perfect shape with no scratches at all. There is also the \\"Gilmore-isms\\" book with all of the references arranged alphabetically with the episodes they appear, and a short description of each. The other book is the episode guide which has all of the same descriptions for each episode as the season sets. The discs, while having different cover art than the seperate season sets are all the EXACT SAME DISCS! All have the same featurettes, deleted scenes, etc. etc. There is nothing new. So anyone thinking about selling your season sets in favor of the complete series, keep in mind that you are getting nothing new except for the dorky cover art and \\"Gilmore-isms\\" book. I don't really care about the cover art myself, I'm just glad to have all the episodes in one box. The only season set I owned prior to this is the first season. I'd been planning on picking up the other ones but now I'm glad I didn't. I borrowed the other sets from a friend so I could compare the discs. Bottom line: it really is a good set, but in my humble opinion, it is not worth the money if you own the individual season sets. If I had the other six, I'd buy the seventh and be done with it.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|As seems to be a common thread in reviews of Spiderman 3, I have to say that there is way too much going on in this movie.  Spiderman just fights off one bad guy after another.  There are so many different plots happening at once that we aren't given a chance to care about any of them.<br /><br />I'm not going to pretend that the villains in the first two movies were realistic (this is a comic after all), but at least there was a good story surrounding the creation of those villains, here we just have the bad guys falling from the sky, literally.<br /><br />Plenty of good mindless action though, if that's your pleasure.  It's really not a bad movie, it just feels like they spent too much time adding characters and not enough time writing stories about them.
0439882826|5.0|This is a great book for Star Wars fans of any age. The pop-ups are plentiful, and surprising visually and in the intricacy of their constructions. Just be careful when closing pages ;-).    Surprise I haven't seen mentioned before -- the light saber is battery-powered. Nice!
0440242576|3.0|This book is very light.  If you take it too seriously, you will not enjoy it.  The main character makes his attempts to avoid Christmas hassles much more difficult than they need be and the ending stretches into the unbelievable.  You might also be offended that very few characters show any moments of Christian spirit.  This is a very secular view of Christmas and feels like it was written just to sell the movie rights.<br /><br />But there are some highlights.  You will laugh at the nosy neighbors and the characters are vividly brought to life.  If you are in the right place to enjoy some frivolous Christmas fare (and feel a little better about all the things still on your to-do list) this will be a good choice.

B00000DS3Z|5.0|I purchased the Sketches LP long ago when I was a teenager and it was then the best Miles I had ever heard.  The only difficulty with the work as a whole was that I often felt that the entire expression of the world around me should always be in music.  My high school teachers and parents, of course, disagreed.  Fast forward to recently when I had the chance to purchase the CD to replace the lost or borrowed LP from many years ago.  While expecting a nostalgic reunion, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Miles' playing had lost none of its verve, edge or inventiveness.  Knowing what I do now about people, his life must have been traumatic, to say the very least.  Great music always reaches beyond what is commonplace into areas not yet perceived, much less understood. This is great music.  I have the advantage of some 40 years of reading and knowing how limited Miles was in his range, tone, his turbulent life and his incessant racism.  How then is it possible that the moment he begins to play I should find such a common plaint of all humanity in his trumpet?  I cannot understand it, but if one fails to be moved by this recording, there is something terribly wrong with his being.  Gil Evans, someone for whom I had great respect, reaches perhaps the pinnacle of his success; for anyone else, this might have come off as hokey or gimmicky.  Evans was clearly masterful at the arrangements.  What I have never understood is how tight the arrangements really are, all the while preserving a kind of natural constraint, regimented in one way, but reaching towards the infinite in the other.  It is difficult to understate the value of this album and I have never heard anything at all like it. I doubt if one could create such magic again.  Lastly, a word for the poor studio musicians.  As a player, one can appreciate the strain of the music.  One hears a trumpet crack a note in the repetitive march and the bassoon sounds like he is going to fall over if he holds that background note one second longer.  These, far from being faults with the pieces,oddly enough work to sustain the feeling of authenticity.  When Miles is the cry of a woman in agony over the loss over her husband, the mourners are right there with her, dutifully and respecfully waiting for her to complete her mourning wail.  These were studio musicians at their very best, stretched to the limit by Evans, egged on by Miles' mystical interpretation.
B00005JPS5|3.0|Like many folks, I'm sure, I had high expectations for this movie. I enjoyed it in the theater but the buzz (bet you didn't see THAT coming, did you?) wore off soon after I pitched the popcorn container in the garbage. Jerry Seinfeld does a fair job in the unappreciated world of cartoon voiceover (just ask Nicolas Cage and/or Julia Roberts whose Ant Bully performances were horribly dull) and John Goodman is outstanding in his small but entertaining role. But the plot takes a bit long to get to the obvious point and the frighteningly real crisis in our world involving a demise in the bee population and the consequences therein is something that shouldn't be so easily remedied as it is here.<br />There are plenty of funny moments and the thankful change from ants to bees was quite welcome, but I expected a bit more. I am still hoping for the Incredibles sequel or at least a return to that level of output from this crowded genre.
B000I5X80G|1.0|Both this CD and Massey Hall come in a cheap cardboard folded sleeve like an old vinyl album. Except that vinyl albums had inner sleeves to protect the album when you slid it in and out of the cardboard. The slightest grit or dirt in the sleeve will scratch the disc as you side it in and out. I put the disc in a separate box. But the cardboard sleeve won't fit into a jewel box so the two wind up separated in my collection. I've seen cardboard foldouts that still provide a push-on holder for the CD. This is the cheapest junk CD packaging I have ever seen. CD should cost no more than $5 packaged this way, and is designed to ruin the CD quickly. Totally unacceptable and no excuse for it.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" is a fantastic private eye mystery thriller, filmed in 1974 and directed by Roman Polanski.  It is classic film nor in color.  It has dark and deep disturbing psychological drama with actors who are top notch - Jack Nicholson, John Huston, Faye Dunaway.  \\"Chinatown\\" has become a classic movie now, and is still spellbinding.  The setting is in the 1930's West and the illegal purchasing of water rights.  Many parts of the movie still ring true on the water wars and riches of the West.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes - a former cop, and now a run of the mill detective.  The movie starts with a standard request of a suspicious wife hiring a detective to follow her husband to see if he is having an affair.  He starts uncovering layers and layers of secrets  - like peeling an onion - layer after layer is there.  He reveals corruption, conspiracy, destructions, incest, murder and much, much more.  Jake has to constantly change his theories as each deception unfolds.  The hard facts are faced, and he continues on, even though he knows the dangers increase.  The movie amazed me as each disturbing part led to another.  I noticed Roman Polanski, who directed this movie, also played a bit part as a bad guy, and everyone Jake meets seems to be a bad guy in the end.<br /><br />This movie deserves to be in the best top ten movies ever made.
B000VI70WM|4.0|The album has potential to be ranked up there with DD's other albums.  I say     this only where tracks 8-11 seem to be rushed and could've used some more tweaking.  It might of been better to have a shorter album but with groups trying to give more bang for the buck they add songs at best should be B-sides.  As for the first seven songs it's encouraging to hear Nick and John starting to do what they do best and not be washed out due to over-producing and loud guitars.  A down note would be, all though Roger is getting older and i see why drummers slow down with age, I miss the fast drum beats of DD's early beginnings.  To the older fans who may see the group as selling out, I encourage you to listen a few times before tearing them down.  Where at first I felt disenchanted with Nite Runner, after listening a few times I feel that it fits in with Notorious .  My personal favorites are Skin Divers and Box Full O' Honey.  Nick and the group should contemplate doing a \\"themed\\" album where all the songs tell a story and connect to each other much like Pink Floyds \\"The Wall\\" or Planet P Projects \\"Pink World\\".  It would give them a chance to stretch out their performances without fitting their songs into 3-4 minute sound bites.  For the newer fans......Welcome!
B000VWYJ86|3.0|This was mainly a \\"chase\\" movie - many good chases, but too many in all made it tedious toward the end - and another unresolved ending to boot!  The plot was thin, though the director did well with a very weak script.<br /><br />The Bourne movies need an end - no more sequels.

B000CNESU8|5.0|1976 was a year to remember in pictures.Five now classics,ROCKY,BOUND FOR GLORY,ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN,TAXI DRIVER and Sidney Lumet's NETWORK all vied for the top honor.ROCKY won, but NETWORK garnered the most awards for acting and screenplay.Watch it, and you will be amazed at how stinging and revelatory this film has prophetically remained, as it indicts the television networks for its shameless attempt to capture viewer share no matter what the cost.With the Saudi's \\"buying up America\\",the Simbianese Liberation Army kidnapping Patty Hearst and Gerald Ford pardoning Richard Nixon as he now enters the White House,failing 4th place television network UBS must find a way to capture the lion's share of viewers in America in order to survive in a world of corporate takeover.This was new in 1976.....and sadly this film,which prognosticated the current trends, now stands in 2007 as almost Biblically prophetic fulfillment.Sensation was the order for the day, and UBS uses anchorman Howard Beale,a newscaster who has suffered an on-the-air nervous breakdown,to be reincarnated as the \\"mad prophet of the airways.\\" UBS callously milks Beale for all it is worth,as their ratings sore to the top, and the American public starts turning into to exploitative programming that is more sensational than it is informing.The network no longer is a place for individuality,but now a place where everyone is swept up in corporate greed.Lives become obsessed and ruined as the network begins to churn out this type of programming.The bottom line is all that matters.Quality is not what matters.It is strictly competition and market share.     Paddy Chayefsky's bombastic,in your face,riveting dialogued screenplay is only made all the more vital and bristling by the A-List acting of William Holden, Peter Finch,Faye Dunaway,Robert Duvall,Ned Beatty and others.Apart from 12 ANGRY MEN, NETWORK is director Lumet's finest moment.(Some may opt for THE VERDICT).These actors are allowed to explode on screen.There is nothing tame or restrained about NETWORK.It is a true actor's \\"tour-de-force\\",and Lumet trusts each performer to inhabit to the fullest their perspective characters.The fact that this film has no soundtrack only serves to highlight the immense quality of Chayefsky's writing which is high brow and biting and fills every frame with bitter,cannibalistic rhetoric.    Yes,1976 was an amazing year for films.Put away ROCKY and change the channel to NETWORK.

B00008GKEG|5.0|As a fan of Beatles music for some 20 years now, I naturally found this collection pretty enjoyable, as my appetite for \\"behind-the-scenes\\" footage always exceeded what was commercially available. While it is true that much of what is on this 5-disc DVD series has been seen before (the often-seen Ed Sullivan show appearances, for example, and the first US tour landing at JFK airport), it does, however, include some footage that I hadn't seen before, such as some extended scenes at the Maharishi complex in India, for example, and a few live performances from the Rubber Soul/Revolver period filmed in color. Perhaps more importantly, there are some pretty good interviews with the surviving members, that were done specifically for the release of this series back in 1995.<br /><br />The interviews at George Harrison's estate in 1994 include conversations with Paul, George, and Ringo reminiscing about some of the band's early experiences, and include a brief jam session by the three of them, complete with amplifiers and instruments inside George's home; as well as a lovely outdoor scene on the lawn, where they sit casually on the grass and converse, and even sing a song or two with ukelele's while Ringo pats out a beat on his knees.<br /><br />The 1995 get-together with George Martin at the sound mixer in the Abbey Road studios is also quite memorable, and includes discussions with the four of them (Paul, George, Ringo, and George Martin) about how some of the songs came together in the studio, including A Day in the Life and Tomorrow Never Knows, to name a couple.<br /><br />Since it is not my intent to provide much further in the way of content review, I will add only one minor technical point, which might or might not be helpful to other purchasers of this product. Each of the 1st four discs contains two episodes (the 5th disc is bonus material...the making of, etc.). I mistakenly assumed that both episodes of each disc would play all the way through automatically. However, I realized much to my chagrin after watching 2 of the 5 discs that I had missed the second episode of each disc. This was because (in the case of my particular DVD player model, at least) it was necessary to return to the top menu after the first episode, in order to access the second episode of each disc. Needless to say, my failure to discover this sooner resulted in a rather out-of-sequence viewing experience for me. I don't really fault the producers of the discs for this, so much as myself for not having realized it sooner.to my chagrin after watching 2 of the 5 discs that I had missed the second episode of each disc.

B00003CXPD|5.0|I saw this again for the second time. I had enjoyed it the first time, but this time I loved it. Actually, it affected me powerfully. This is rather hard to account for. The boy is fantastic, rightfully praised for a superb performance. Actually, as far as that goes, the entire cast is great. There are numerous small but crucial roles. The entire family, of course, is crucial, but each actor makes the most of some very brief but moving scenes. Grandma's goodbye is powerful, for example, as is the brother's hard hitting performance as the committed striker. The father is magnificent, really perfect. The teacher gives a rather restrained performance. She is very good, though, especially with the cigarette ever dangling, which she makes a critical prop in the development of her character. (It is nice to see a real smoker again.) Her daughter, too, is rather good, although she disappears more or less, and is replaced by the gay neighborhood boy who comes many years later to see Billy dance in \\"Swan Lake\\". The teacher and Billy make a valiant effort to disassociate dance from gayness, but the last scene of the film, with the gays spotlighted in the audience, seems to suggest that the father and his friends were right after all. Was this intended as the film's message?

B000VNMMR0|5.0|Let's be honest... the first Die Hard is the best. The second and third movies left a lot to be desired, but this movie brings itself right behind the first!     Willis' character has the same sarcastic crap talking as the first and is accompanied by Justin Long's quirky surprised/sarcastic comedy... an excellent balance. The action was great... maybe just a tiny bit overboard with the whole 18 wheeler/bridge scene, but none-the-less, still an excellent movie!

B000784WMW|5.0|I watched the recent 2006 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Jane Eyre, with a nagging certainty, this wasn't the dark, complex tale I remembered from childhood.  So I revisited the book, which confirmed my suspicions.  Over the next few months people started buzzing about a 1983 adaptation which, among other things, was more faithful to the novel.<br /><br />I obtained a copy and as promised, it was more faithful to the novel . . . among other things.<br /><br />- For the pervasive dark tone, only the 1944 adaptation with George Barnes' exquisite black and white photography and lighting captures the mood VISUALLY, at least to me.  The necessary rewrites (this one's only 97 min.) are well crafted and tonally consistent. But the story is woefully incomplete and the acting may at times, seem a mite self conscious to the modern ear.<br />- The 2006 (228 min) is visually lovely, but maybe TOO lovely, even sumptuous in places where understatement or stark ugliness would better serve. And Rochester has been so neutered, he's unrecognizable, if not out-and-out awkward.  The rewrites here range from prosaic to shamefully expository.  And the Gateshead-Lowood segment is so truncated, her grim childhood context barely registers.  To her credit, Ruth Wilson (Jane) makes the most of what she is given...but sorry, no cigar.<br /><br />One of the most defining elements in Charlotte Brontë's story telling, is her language.  Her words not only tell us of feelings and events, but through sharp, deliberate dialog, also keenly shape her characters and by corollary, their relationships.  For this, only two adaptations are notable. Both by the BBC, done in '73, and '83.<br /><br />- 1973  (275 min) The plot and language here is faithful to the novel. But personally, I found the performances, too intellectualized to capture the passion and subtleties in the story. It's also rather wordy.  Like the '83, the '73  has comparatively low production values -- video interiors, film exteriors, bad lighting, unimaginative camera work. I realize for some folks, that's the deal breaker.  But if it's not, read on, because the similarities end there.<br /><br />- 1983  The more emotionally charged '83 adaptation (which clocks in at 5 hrs.18 min.), staring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton, not only beats out '73, but in my opinion, trumps all the others by deftly balancing all the story's components the best. Here Jane's bleak childhood is given it's weight. From her marginalized upbringing with her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, to her perilous life at Lowood Institution -- where beatings, humiliation, unfounded accusations and a relentless barrage of damning judgment, were administered on the regular.  Sean Pattenden as young Jane plays the more feisty, rebellious side of Jane's nature, than the sympathetic one, but she does a fine job.  Robert James as the sadistic Mr. Brocklehust is sensational.  And this may be the first time, Helen Burns is portrayed as more than just a abused, saintly martyr.  This Burns is also distant and alarmingly passive, which casts shadows on her rabid dogmatism.  Fully fleshing both these characters, allows the controversial \\"Evangelism\\" thread, enough presence, to smoothly carry over to her year at Moorhouse.  A thread that's usually obscured at best.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke as adult Jane is restrained, curious, appropriately guarded and willful.  Each time I view her performance I'm struck by how profoundly she listens.  And how subtly responsive she is.  Watch her look of shock and disgust as Rochester nearly hurls the portfolio of art work at her, then blames her for keeping Adele up too late. Initially some of this might be missed due to the shock of her costar's thunder.<br /><br />What can I say about Timothy Dalton that hasn't already been said? How about this...<br />He is the Tony Soprano of Edward Rochesters.  Most times you can't tell if he's going to kill her, f*ck her, or shake her hand.  Which works spectacularly well.  Rochester is after all, about attraction/repulsion. He's the ultimate forbidden fruit.  Sure close ups reveal an unfairly handsome man,  but that's okay, because Dalton manages to capture Rochester's conflicting nature, with energy to spare...  balancing his magnetism, desperation, warmth, wit, playfulness, against his imposing stature, manipulation, sarcasm, brazen sexuality, ethical elasticity, and of course his taste for outrageous debauchery -- like a master juggler.  And apologizes for none of it.<br /><br />And he's sometimes flat out bratty.<br />When *his* Rochester explains to Mrs Fairfax (Jean Harvey),  that Jane bewitched his horse, HE MEANS IT!  Which gives Harvey, (who's terrific), a wonderful fall-off-your-chair-in-disbelief moment, when she stammers out, \\"s-sirrr!?.\\"<br /><br />Clarke and Dalton are never better than during the first crucial interviews.  When Rochester explains to Jane that, \\"[he's] a trite, commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the petty dissipations of the rich and worthless.\\"... we don't doubt it.  His transitions are flawless.  Watch him turn away -- as he conceals from Jane, he's been studying her -- then slip into a trance, fixed on some distant point imperceptible to us, uttering what sounds like nonsense.  Lines that might easily land with a thud, move unselfconsciously over the man's tongue.  Here Edward also plays the corrective teacher, when he tells her, with certainty, \\"[repentance] is not the cure...\\"  for what ails him.  This is probably the first time Jane's heard anyone say those words and it's a VERY IMPORTANT LINE. Through it all, Clarke 's Jane grapples intensely, turning her enigmatic boss's words over in her head. Opining only when asked, in a balance of poised candor, and soft, deep-seeded concern. And from here this relationship is off to a running start, developing from the point from which Brontë intended. It is also here, we first appreciate the power of the author's language and an artist's ability to translate it.<br /><br />OTHER NOTABLE SCENES<br />- About Adele (Jane's Smack-Down)  Jane verbally flogs her boss for his abhorrent behavior toward Adele, without breaking a sweat, while exuding moral superiority in the process. You go girl! This is also the first Rochester who actually seems to do something. I mean like work.  He even seems good at it. Dalton establishes this in one decisively delivered line at the end.<br />- After The Fire:  Edward holds Jane's hand with an expression of profound warmth and gratitude, while pulling his panicked but entranced employee closer to him.  He needs her to stay with him tonight. He cannot justify overpowering her, but he enjoys knowing he can.  This scene superbly captures the duality in this character.  I think more artful camera work might have helped amplify Jane's POV.<br />- The Gypsy Scene (Dalton In Drag)  He's mostly hilarious and solidly on the mark as he uses Brontë's words to soothe, shock and ultimately manipulate Jane.  The scene shifts and Clarke is mesmorizing as she moves from impatience with the feeble fortune teller to near hypnotic fascination by her faint recognition of the words and their oddly insightful messenger.<br />- After Richard's Departure: The louder he gets, the softer she becomes.  Rochester raptures on sardonically, about the virtues of Blanche.  In response, Jane softly says \\"yes sir\\" three times, hitting the line three different ways.  The third time, is in pained resignation and is barely audible.  They're both phenomenal here.<br />-  Mrs. Reed's Deathbed: Clarke's spin on Jane's forgiveness of her aunt (Judy Cornwell)is a sharp departure from every other actress I've seen play this scene. Here there is a bite in Eyre's tone. Whatever forgiveness means to *this* Jane, it may not be so generous as to permit forgetting, nor rendering Mrs. Reed free from Eyre's own judgment and disgust. What's important is she's now free of any damage Mrs Reed may have inflicted. To me, this interpretation is closest to the Jane in the novel. And Cornwell is superb, as she hisses out her last words of condemnation at her \\"tormenter.\\"<br />- The Proposal: Notable mainly because, Dalton is the only Rochester who really seems to know how to kiss his girl. And his rambling justification about atonement is chilling and exquisite. Otherwise the scene clearly needed reworking and is one of the few instances where you can see the effects of a tight budget and scheduling intrude.<br />-  The Tell-Tale-Torn-Veil: In this explosive scene, Dalton and Clarke lock horns over Grace's continued presence at Thornfield. This helps make the absurd Grace Poole story line a touch more palatable (Carol Gillies as Grace delivers some rare moments).<br />- Aftermath Of The-Wedding-That-Wasn't: Perhaps the most sensual scene EVER.  Jane leaves her room, stumbles, Edward catches her, securing her on his lap, and starts talking softly into her neck in a deep, throaty voice.  Jane is palpably exhausted, disheartened, depleted.  Sexy and poignant, what more can you ask for.<br />Unfortunately some of the scene that follows tips into melodrama, even after a good start, (which is rare here). I think this is likely due  to time constraints and/or directorial assy-ness.  Still there are some great moments to be had. Clarke, who's nearly despondent, fully captures a woman brutally injured, by a mighty blow to the heart.<br />- Moorhouse: Andrew Bicknell hits a home run as St. John Rivers.  He embodies the icy, remote man, whose kind acts are more motivated by securing his box seat in the kingdom of heaven, than his full capacity to feel on earth.  \\"You are ... forgive the word . . . impassioned,\\"  he warns Jane, with the hesitancy of telling someone they have a boil on their chin.<br />- Return To Thornfield: Many great moments here, from his tearful discovery that his wayward faery has returned, to Janes teasing him into a fury.<br /><br />I could quibble that this or that, might have been tweaked (The occasional scoring is bad and it runs in half hour segments which is annoying. A few scenes needed to be reworked, but only a few). But with 90% plus of remarkable drama, at likely the lowest budget per hour... \\"quibble\\" don't amount to a hill of beans. And you know the director Julien Aymes deserves a lot of the credit for that.

B000002L3P|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I was suprised how intense that it is. I would really recommend this to serious music listeners
0316067598|1.0|As other reviews point out, Luttrell spends much of the book railing against \\"liberals.\\"  In Luttrell's world, opposing war crimes makes a person a liberal.  He blames liberal, which include all civilian lawyers, the media and any one who supports the Geneva Convention, for the death of his three seal teammates.  If not for these liberals, Luttrell and his team would have executed three unarmed goat herders that happened upon the seal team during an operation.  Instead, fearing the wrath of liberals, the seal team let the goat herders go and at some point later the team was attacked by the Taliban.  Luttrell assumes that the goat herders told the Taliban of the team's location.  Therefore, liberals are responsible for the deaths of the seals.    Aside from Luttrell's misplaced blame for the deaths of his teammates, the book is poorly written.  Although Luttrell recounts some experiences during BUD/S seal training, he does not adequately nor fully explain the training.  That section of the book feels as if he was just trying to fill additional pages.    The final third of the book, describing the events that transpired in Afghanistan, is interesting, but not interesting enough to make up for the book's numerous flaws.

Scout, Jem, Dill, Boo Radley and the world of Maycomb Country come alive in her telling and add a richness to the story I could not get from just reading it. I will revisit this CD.

B000092T6M|5.0|You've gotta feel really bad for Kevin Costner in this movie because his performance is completely overshadowed by Alan Rickman's portrayal of the Nasty Sheriff of Nottingham!  I've never been a huge fan of any of the \\"Robin Hood\\" renditions but it's hard not to like this version.  I think this is one of Mr. Rickman's finest performances and it's a good thing because I don't think the movie could stand without him.  You almost find yourself rooting for the bad guy here!    Some of \\"Robin's\\" scenes I felt were a little drawn out but over-all a very funny, very entertaining movie!  Well worth owning!
B00006V9A0|5.0|Looking at the tracklist on the back of the CD, it gives the impression that all that is on the disc is the \\"new\\" song, \\"You Know You're Right,\\" and remastered tracks taken from the band's various albums.  It turns out that, in this case, appearances are deceiving.<br /><br />The first track on the disc is \\"You Know You're Right,\\" the last song Nirvana recorded together before Kurt Cobain's suicide in April 1994.  I really like this song, and it shows that Kurt still had some mileage left in him as a songwriter, but that he cut himself off.  Whenever I hear it, it makes me think about \\"what could have been.\\"<br /><br />The verison of \\"About a Girl\\" that appears on this disc is the original version from the band's fist album, Bleach (rather than the version from MTV Unplugged in New York).<br /><br />When I saw that \\"Been a Son\\" was on the disc, I assumed it would be the version that appeared on Incesticide.  It turns out it's actually the version from the Blew EP (which is a different recording of the song and is a version that was hard to come by before the release of this CD).<br /><br />Another surprise was \\"Pennyroyal Tea.\\"  Instead of using the In Utero version, a previously unreleased single mix of the song is included.  According to the liner notes, Scott Litt did this mix for a 1994 release, but the release of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" was scrapped after Kurt's suicide, because Geffen decided to cease promoting In Utero.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that Geffen didn't play up the fact that the versions of \\"Been a Son\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" were alternate versions.  I would definitely recommend this CD to a Nirvana collector who wants these alternate versions and don't want to track down obscure releases in order to get them.  I would also recommend this disc to someone who isn't as familiar with Nirvana, because I feel this album would make a good starting point for someone to become familiar with the band's material.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a wonderful series. We have watched some of them more than once and still enjoyed them tremendously.
B00000G3PA|3.0|Armageddon is a movie that focuses too much on the over-dramatization of characters rather than on the plot.  For example, the scene between Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis where Affleck is supposed to detonate the bomb (thus sacrificing his life) and \\"hero\\" Willis decides to do the job is so over-dramatized that it almost becomes unbearable to watch.  Add to that, one of the beginning scenes has Willis shooting at Affleck because he found his daughter in bed with him and at the scene mentioned earlier, Willis is calling Affleck's character, \\"my son\\" and something to the effect of I have always seen you like my son?!!!!  That is just one example of the sort of over-dramatized scenes and over the top acting and characters.    I would recommend \\"Deep Impact\\" over this movie anytime because in my opinion, it is a more intelligent show and the focus is well-balanced between the plot and the actors.      One of the saving graces of this show would be Billy Bob Thornton.  Other than that, it is a show that one would watch and enjoy somewhat but to not expect anything too solid or intelligent to come out of it.

Sicko is very emotional to watch it takes you from tears to anger!  It's a most see for people who have a conscience left.
B0009S2T0M|1.0|For the largest part of the movie the viewers are left wondering  why the main charachter got imprisoned. This question is hammered  exuberantly upon us. If this is all the movie is about, is that  question at all interesting? Throughout the movie there are boring  meaningless unoriginal scenes of violence. And after all this  we are presented with an explanation why it all happened. I think at this point the makers of the movie wants us to think \\"oh, i could never have guessed that... completely brilliant\\". Well, there are myriads of endings  we would never have guessed. That doesnt make them interesting.  This is just an ad-hoc excuse for the prior scenes of violence.  \\"Now we have shoved meaningless scenes in your faces for one and a half hour, so we owe you an explanation.\\"  This is actally a very common model for making a poor movie for the masses: First leave the viewers in confusion for no reason. Then in the  end reveal everything so it becomes completely obvious. The ones who havent already forseen the ending might be fooled that the movie is  very coherent and original. \\"oh it was like that all along... wow... who would have guessed\\". Really, it is incoherent because the first (and majority) part of the movie has  really nothing to do with anything... it is empty. To insert  such an textual (as opposed to cinematographic) message near the end of the movie is like telling a joke and then immediately explain it.  It destroys the joke, insults the audience and is a proof of failing to tell the joke.   A deep movie will take the risk of losing some viewers, just by being  deep and not by being obvious.

B000W1V44I|4.0|4 out of 5 star isn't because Kevin left.    I like the CD, I listened to the whole CD 2-3X during my long drive to Palm Spring...great vocal and all...BUT there isn't any song that I can honestly say that really stick in my head nor make that big impression like some of their older songs (Incomplete, Get another boyfriend, etc.).     Though I would honestly say that their vocal sync is just as good as before, if not better; I did notice they try a few new vocal method, kind of mix it up a bit so it won't sound like the way they always sound like on every album.     It's worth buying, certainly if you are a BSB fan. This CD is much more mature than before.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|Wilco hasn't had a bad album and this one certainly does not dissappoint.  The great thing about Jeff Tweedy is his ability to continue to evolve and yet maintain the intelligence and creativity of his exceptional poetry and musical genius (unlike Ryan Adams).  To truly appreciate \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" in its fullest, seek out their recent live performance on Austin City Limits.  Each of the band members are masterful musicians in their own right and extremely creative and versitile.  Great set of tunes.  Love these guys.....the best out their in my humble oppinion.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Kelly Clarkson has definitely come a long way, from winning on the first American Idol to forgetting to thank the show when she got a Grammy award. And now she comes at us with her third album, My December.<br /><br />If people are confused by the album's title considering the album was released in June, it's like this: the album actually WAS supposed to come out last December, but J Records head Clive Davis refused to release it because he didn't think it was good enough (but isn't this the same guy that released Tyrese's Alter Ego???). So after Kelly left J Records (although she's still with J's parent company, RCA), she finally got the album released. Sadly, though, I'm really going to have to agree with Clive on this one because the album is pretty cold.<br /><br />I didn't really care for Breakaway that much not because it was bad, but because almost every song on there was about heartbreak, and as you know, I don't like monotony because it shows a lack of creativity. And it's pretty much the same story here -- no, wait; here it's worse: not only are most of the songs once again about heartbreak or bad relationships, but the lyrics aren't that great either (see especially \\"Maybe\\" or \\"Hole\\"). And \\"Never Again\\" was an okay choice for the lead single, but now that I think about it, it sounds like she was really trying to recapture the magic of \\"Since U Been Gone\\".<br /><br />There are other problems as well: \\"Yeah\\" has a very off-key chorus, and \\"One Minute\\" feels like it took just that long to write it (seriously, what do people like about that song???). In fact, the only songs that really stand out are \\"Be Still\\" and \\"Sober\\". Also, given the fact that Kelly's voice isn't quite as good as it used to be, My December is her least exciting album, so in the words of track 5, don't waste your time.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000005J56|5.0|If you haven't listened to Buena Social Club, you have to. Classic songs, ranging from traditional slow Salsa to old Cuban songs played by magnificent musicians. The documental is good too, but you don't need to watch it if you close your eyes and listed to the CD.

1594481938|2.0|Four people from extremely different walks of life meet at a notorious suicide spot, and through each other find the will to live... kind of. They try to rebuild their lives... such as they are.<br /><br />Hornby has some insight into the fragility of meaning in life, but it's a little too much on the nihilistic side. And it's not as profound as some of his more original and pointed observations in \\"How to Be Good.\\"<br /><br />Also, none of the characters are too appealing, which is intentional, but it still has a negative effect. I especially disliked the American musician JJ, who kept saying \\"man\\" and citing cool bands he liked -- Hornby can't resist citing cool bands.
B000VI70WM|3.0|Several months on I find I need to update my opinions of this album.<br /><br />1. The Valley - Seeing this song performed live has given it a whole new dimension for me. I wish the CD track was more noisy, like the song is played live. Rating: 4.<br /><br />2. Red Carpet Massacre - Grind-heavy rocker. Great chorus, snarky lyrics about paparazzi. \\"We're so busted... done and dusted...\\"  This tune rocks. Rating - 4.<br /><br />3. Nite-Runner - Very dark-funky track with an undeniably catchy hook. Great synth my Nick. Timbaland and Justin Timberlake show up on the backing vocals. Nice bridge featuring TBL on vocals. This one just screams \\"single!\\". Rating - 4.<br /><br />4. Falling Down - Meloncholy mid-tempo ballad. Maybe the best song they've ever done; right up there with \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Ordinary World\\". Terrific lyrics and vocals. Co-written with JTL. Can't stop singing the chorus. Sing-song like guitar work and backing vocals by JTL really stand out. Rating - 5.<br /><br />5. Box Full of Honey - Acoustic spanish-guitar influenced ballad with a great lyric and hooks. Virtuoso vocal and melody by Simon. Nick's flute-like synth is reminiscent of the Arcadia track \\"El Diablo\\". Excellent.  Rating - 5.<br /><br />6. Skin Divers - Another of the Timbaland/Timberlake produced tracks.  Basically just a groove number with Timbaland rapping over the chorus. Sounds a bit like \\"Drowning Man' from the Wedding Album. I have a better opinion now after hearing it live. Rumor is it's being remixed for release as a single.  Rating - 3.<br /><br />7. Tempted - Another synth-heavy track. Great melody and very catchy on repeated listenings. Rating - 4.<br /><br />8. Tricked Out - Unecessary instrumental. Seems like it's just there to take up album space. Rating - 2.<br /><br />9. Zoom In - Last of the TBL/JTL tracks. Mid-tempo track that seems designed to promote the band's \\"Second Life\\" venture. Dissapointing collaboration. Rating - 1.<br /><br />10. She's Too Much - Slow melodic track with a nice low beat and heavy intonations in the lyrics.  Much better than my first impression Rating - 3.<br /><br />11.  Dirty Great Monster - Slow rock track. Lyric sounds like it's about abuse. Surprisingly, gets more interesting as it goes, but the lyric is very dark. Some saxophone. Big letdown at the end. Rating - 2.5.<br /><br />12. Last Man Standing - Expecting an up-tempo finish? Forget it! Mid-tempo track with an odd vocal. Just an OK track. At least it's short.  Rating 2.5.<br /><br />13. Cry Baby Cry [Bonus Track] Availabale as an iTunes dowload. I like it better than many of the tracks on the albumt. Up-tempo funky track with a Simon falsetto vocal and some cool lyrics about fame. Where's this on the album? Rating - 3.5.<br /><br />Overall - Wow, really fades at the end. For all the hype by reviewers and industry types it's an fairly tame and tepid album. Doesn't have half the energy of \\"Astronaut\\". I can't imagine what it would be like without \\"Falling Down\\", the last track recorded on the spur-of-the-moment with JTL. The best music is in the first 7 tracks. After that they may as well have phoned it in (wait, they did!). Looks to me like they better dig out that \\"Reportage\\" project they did with Andy and beg him to come back.n my first impression Rating - 3.    11.  Dirty Great Monster - Slow rock track. Lyric sounds like it's about abuse. Surprisingly, gets more interesting as it goes, but the lyric is very dark. Some saxophone. Big letdown at the end. Rating - 2.5.    12. Last Man Standing - Expecting an up-tempo finish? Forget it! Mid-tempo track with an odd vocal. Just an OK track. At least it's short.  Rating 2.5.    13. Cry Baby Cry [Bonus Track] Availabale as an iTunes dowload. I like it better than many of the tracks on the albumt. Up-tempo funky track with a Simon falsetto vocal and some cool lyrics about fame. Where's this on the album? Rating - 3.5.    Overall - Wow, really fades at the end. For all the hype by reviewers and industry types it's an fairly tame and tepid album. Doesn't have half the energy of \\"Astronaut\\". I can't imagine what it would be like without \\"Falling Down\\", the last track recorded on the spur-of-the-moment with JTL. The best music is in the first 7 tracks. After that they may as well have phoned it in (wait, they did!).

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had so much fun watching Wicked on Broadway and I have just as much fun listening to the CD every day.  A must have!
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I can understand the ire of those reviewers who purchased the Star Trek DVD boxed sets, only to have a \\"better\\" (and I guess this depends on whether you prefer the original or the enhanced) version arrive just a year or two later. I felt the same way when I had to toss out all my expensive 8-tracks and replace them with cassette tapes, and again when those were gradually nudged out in favor of CD's. Audio and video technologies are advancing almost too quickly for studios and fans to keep up, and already my vast collection of video tapes are collecting dust in the basement and DVD's line my bookshelf instead. If I were to dwell on the hundreds of dollars I invested in those video tapes, not to mention the numerous VCR's (and tape rewinders!) I purchased as they went from 2-head to 4-head versions and are now becoming hard to find at all, I could feel as though I had been ripped off somehow. But, in all honesty, I like DVD's better. They take up far less space, don't get devoured by the machine, allow me to skip instantly around the movie and, well, the movies look astonishingly beautiful compared to the tapes. And, just like their CD counterparts, the cost of purchasing DVD's and the equipment to play them on has dropped significantly since their inception. Eventually, these, too, will be replaced with something new and amazing and my DVD collection will end up in the basement, too. I suppose I could be stubborn and resist these changes, but they're going to happen anyway. So, to shamelessly borrow a phrase, \\"Resistance is futile.\\"<br /><br />Regarding TOS, I have no shame at all...I love it. Always have, always will. I'll always get a kick out of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest of the crew. I know all the episodes by rote. They're melodramatic, cheesy, sometimes downright silly, but if it's on, I watch, even the bad episodes. Just like \\"I Love Lucy\\" reruns, it's just one of those shows I can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time. And even though I feelthat the low-grade special effects and cheap props are part of its charm, I've seen some of the enhanced episodes and feel that they were judiciously applied, respectful of the original vision and take nothing away from the experience. So, yes, I will eventually purchase this set, and just as I waited a long time to purchase my first DVD player I'll wait a while for the price to come down.<br /><br />For those accusing the studio of ripping off the public, I see no great conspiracy at work here. Like any other company, Paramount is a business and a business' primary objective is to make a profit. I don't fault them for that, because it is up to the consumer to decide if the product is worth the price. Don't like the enhancements? Think the price is too high? Don't buy the set. For my part, I'll be moving my TOS video tapes to the basement...eventually.

B000VI70WM|3.0|\\"Red carpet massacre\\" is the follow up to Duran Duran's \\"Astronaut\\" and features production from Timbaland and some of his little helpers, Danja, and Justin Timberlake. It's not as immediately catchy as its predecessor, but gets better with repeated listening.<br /><br />Here and there, Timbaland's beats show up (opening cut \\"The valley\\", \\"Nite runner\\" \\"Tempted\\", and \\"Skin divers\\" - the latter even featuring intermittent rapping from the man himself) but have no fear the CD has some vintage Duran Duran; synthesizers, guitars, catchy hooks, and those harmonies. They have no desire to get their \\"Sexyback\\".<br /><br />The guitar driven title track \\"Red carpet massacre\\" is almost punk rock. \\"Falling down\\" is a lovely guitar ballad, \\"Boxful of honey\\" is a bouncy guitar number with subtle electronic effects, and \\"Tricked out\\" is an effects laden instrumental.<br /><br />My favourites are the incredibly catchy \\"She's too much\\" (awesome song), and the ballads \\"Dirty great monster\\", and \\"Last man standing\\" (the latter with Timbaland's trademark haunting synth strings). All feature that alternative bent Duran Duran are known for.<br /><br />Roll out the red carpet folks, here come Duran Duran! 3 and a half stars.
B000059HB7|5.0|This is what the Duke was all about. It's one of my top 100 movies of all time, an essential, a must see & own. John Wayne, as always, portrays himself; Dean Martin is Dude, a drunk trying to recover; Ricky Nelson is Colorado, a young gunslinger; &, finally, Walter Brennan is Stumpy, an over the hill cripple. Angie Dickinson is the female lead who's sexy with a past that borders on outlaw. With the exception of Ricky Nelson the acting is great. Ricky was cast in this movie because he was  a hot item in rock & roll, casting simply took advantage of his then current status. Mr. Nelson wasn't an actor & his portrayal of Colorado is one of the most wooden in Hollywood history.  Walter Brennan all but steals the film as Stumpy. He's cantankerous, ornery & resentful; those are his good qualities. Dean Martin as Dude plays a not so unusual role as a drunk who has seen better days; a role he had played before in other movies.  A great supporting cast includes John Russell (\\"The Lawman\\" TV series), Gonzalez Gonzalez & Ward Bond (\\"Wagon Train\\" TV series). The film is directed by the great Howard Hawks, who had many outstanding movies to his credit.  GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!

B000LAZDQA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Indy films.  This is by far the best independant film I have ever seen.  That may sound a bit over the top but it is written from the heart, which is where this film comes from.  I knew nothing about this film before I saw it, in fact I had heard about it and shunned it as a perceived \\"stupid movie\\" based solely on the title.  Yes, big lesson there somewhere.    I will admit that the sex was what caught my attention right off the bat.  I had never seen images like this outside of porn and it took some getting used to (my friend literally had to close my gaping mouth at one point (a very patriotic moment)).  But once I got past the graphic sexual images, I was enveloped by the utterly raw, real, and often painfull emotions, characters, and situations.  All I can say beyond this (without boring you and wasting both of our times) is......SEE THIS MOVIE.  You will not be sorry that you did. (even if you just like looking at pretty people having sex)

It takes place over a forty year period and revolves around the lives of two Afghan women, giving the reader a first hand view of the lives of women in Afghanistan - their struggles, the comfort they derive from the anonymity provided by the burqa. The plot is fast moving with many poignant scenes. Yet throughout this sad story, the author tries to paint a picture of Afghanistan that was once magnificent - with a thousand splendid suns hiding behind her walls.

0688145078|5.0|I purchased this book for my 21 month old son before our daughter was born.  She's now 5 1/2 months old, and he LOVES hearing me read this book.  I insert his name and my daughter's name, and he just smiles and points to the pictures and gives his own input as well.  This book is very easy for him to understand, and he loves looking at the illustrations.  We read this book at least once a day, especially before his afternoon nap.  I recommend this book to any parent with a young son who is expecting another child.
B0001US8EO|4.0|Having won the battle of the Robin Hoods, Costner wasn't so lucky with Wyatt Earp: forget Waterworld, this is still the biggest box-office disaster of Costner's career, a $63m epic Western that struggled to make $25m at the US box-office yet somehow managed to avoid being nicknamed 'Kevin's Gate' (although it did earn Michael Madsen's unending animosity when the lengthy shoot prevented him from playing Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction). Originally intended as a mini-series and tracing the famed lawman's life from farm boy, freight driver, law student, drunk, horse thief, buffalo hunter to the aftermath of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, it's an ambitious attempt at an American epic with an increasingly unlikeable main character, but it's more of an occasionally ambitious failure than a genuine success.<br /><br />Not nearly as much fun as the rival Tombstone, it's often at its best in the early scenes detailing the side of Earp that the movies previously overlooked as he goes from idealism to bitterness and misogyny following the death of his first wife. Taking its lead from Nicholas Earp's credo that family comes first and \\"Blood counts the most,\\" Costner's determination not to play likable is admirable, but it casts a dour shadow over a film with increasingly little lightness or humour to break up its bleak view of an embittered man whose only real talent is for violence and make it more palatable. America tends to like its heroes cut and dried, but Costner's Earp is not so much flawed as downright unsympathetic at times - more of a 70s anti-hero than one who would find favour in the 90s, leaving a cruelly overlooked at Oscar time Dennis Quaid (stunningly good) as Doc Holliday to carry the audience sympathy.<br /><br />Once the film enters more familiar territory with Earp's years as a lawman, the flaws start to become more significant. Even in the extended laser disc directors cut many of the huge supporting cast tend to get lost and forgotten and at times it feelslike its treading water, never really going into much detail about the reasons for the feud between the Earps and the Clantons and the McLaurys, while the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral itself is badly staged - even the 'walk thing' makes Wyatt, Doc and the brothers just look like a bunch of angry Mennonites - and the film loses momentum afterwards, which is surprising considering the aftermath is in many ways far more interesting than the gunfight itself. On a visual level, Kasdan's direction is somewhat disappointing: despite having huge resources at his disposal, there's a striking lack of long shots to take advantage of them that becomes much more noticeable on the small screen than the big, while despite the length there are increasingly few memorable or significant scenes en route to the contentious epilogue. One of the most misconceived endings of the 90s (at least until Costner's The Postman came along), a clumsy flashback-led variation on 'Print the legend' that seems to be arguing that the legend is indeed true, it does the film no favours and probably did much to leave audiences unimpressed.<br /><br />It's a shame, because for all its faults there's much in the film to admire, from some fine supporting performances among the huge cast - the aforementioned Quaid, horribly gaunt and convincingly tubercular, Gene Hackman, Bill Pullman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Annabeth Gish - and a superb score from James Newton Howard. Perhaps for once a little less ambition and a little more light rather than constant shade would have yielded a more successful result.<br /><br />The film is annoyingly spread over two sides of a single disc, although boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer. Along with the full theatrical trailer (but not the teaser, which included somedeleted scenes) it also includes the deleted scenes from the Director's Cut as well as two featurettes on the making of the film culled from interviews shot at the time.
B00022M518|5.0|Brian Eno has quietly been one of the most influential pop stars of the century.. The brains behind some of the biggest movements in 70's, 80's,90's and current popular music - Eno does not get half the credit he deserves and is kind of in the shadow of glam stars such as David Bowie..<br /><br />Here come the Warm Jets was his first solo attempt after leaving the popular 70's group roxy music.. It is one of his best albums and shows a very experimental and yet highly accessible stage in his career..<br />Laced with bizzare lyrics and even stranger electronic instrumental moments, Here come the warm Jets is one of the most original experiences of 70's glam.. with songs like baby's on fire and needles in the camels eye - eno proved there was life after roxy music..<br /><br />I would highly recommend this album along with the first 2 roxy albums as a fine introduction to the early stages of his career.. After that you might want to check out his work with David Bowie and the classic talking heads albums he helped to produce.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|A hard-hitting, naturalistic \\"social drama\\" reminiscent of the work of Ken Loach and British \\"angry young man\\" films of the early 60s (with a slight whiff of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") \\"This is England\\" is set against the backdrop of the Thatcher era, circa 1983. The story (reported to be loosely auto-biographical, based on the director's Midlands upbringing) centers around a glum, alienated 12 year-old named Shaun (first-time film actor Thomas Turgoose, in an extraordinary performance) who can't seem to fit in with any of the cliques at his school. Shaun presents a real handful to his loving but somewhat exasperated mother (Jo Hartley),a working-class Falklands War widow who does her best to support herself and her son. After a particularly bad day of being bullied about by teachers and schoolmates, happenstance leads Shaun into the midst of a skinhead gang.    Shaun's initial apprehension is quickly washed away when the sympathetic and good-natured gang leader Woody (Joe Gilgun) takes him under his wing and offers him an unconditional entrée into their little club. Shaun's weary working mum is initially not so crazy about his new pals, but after sizing them up decides essentially to leave her son in their care. Some may feel that this development strains credibility, but I think it's a pragmatic decision. Her son has no siblings, no close friends,and is suffering from the loss of his father; perhaps this surrogate family will give him what she cannot provide.    The idyll is soon shattered, however, when the gang's original leader, Combo (Stephen Graham) is released from prison. Combo's return causes a rift that divides the gang; his jailhouse conversion to racist National Front ideals doesn't settle well with Woody and his supporters, and they break off on their own. Shaun decides to stay on after forming an instant bond with the thuggish Combo, who easily parlays the impressionable Shaun's grief over his father into a blame-shifting hatred of immigrants, with tragic results.    The film works successfully on several levels; as a cautionary tale, a history lesson and a riveting drama. As cautionary tale, it demonstrates how easily the neglected and disenfranchised can be recruited and indoctrinated into the politics of hate. As a history lesson, it's a fascinating glimpse at a not-so-long ago era of complex politics and social upheaval in Great Britain. As a riveting drama, it features some very believable and astounding performances, particularly from the aforementioned young Turgoose and Graham, who positively owns the screen with his charismatic intensity. Not to be missed.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is actually the second part in an intended trilogy that will now probably never be completed in the wake of the dismal box-office for the bloated Gods and Generals. Thankfully it gains more by having a smaller canvas, focussing on one single battle and largely on three actions - Buford's inspired initial defense on the first day, Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge - and by seeing the action from the viewpoint of both sides throughout. The characters are better drawn, the dialogue feels more natural and you get much more of a sense of what a human tragedy the war was. As a British observer on the Confederate side points out, it all boils down to \\"same people, different dreams.\\"     The problem with most epics devoted to single battles or campaigns (Waterloo, Zulu Dawn, The Battle of Neretva etc) is that without a single dominating personality they often get so bogged down with history or strategy that the human element gets lost, with a succession of stars acting almost like anonymous interchangeable sports commentators only there to explain what's going on for the layman. Gettysburg has its share of characters primarily there for exposition, but by narrowing its focus to a few of them and drawing on their own letters and memoirs it's able to give them a little more depth and personality. Martin Sheen's Lee's increasingly wrong-headed strategy as he consigns more and more men to pointless deaths with a homespun rationale that leads to horrifying casualties contrasts well with Tom Berenger's more cautious Longstreet gradually realising that the tide has turned against them while Jeff Daniels' awkward but sincere Lawrence Chamberlain gives a humane and decent voice to the Union's case. Richard Jordan is genuinely affecting in his last role - his final scene is even more moving with the knowledge that he really was dying at the time - and even George Lazenby even turns up briefly. As a result, there's more involvement in what's happening and more understanding of what's at stake on a personal level to both sides during the battle. Although shot as a TV miniseries before being released theatrically, it actually looks like a feature film, and one that manages to hold the interest over its four hour running time. It's such an impressive piece of work that you can't help but wonder why so many of the same people got it so wrong so often on Gods and Generals.     Excellent extras on the double-sided DVD, but sadly none of the deleted scenes from the 270-minute laserdisc director's cut.
B00008EY65|3.0|Hellboy could have been one of the classic comic book adaptations, but sadly the film-makers lost their bottle and went for an all out CGI monster showdown.<br /><br />The opening is pretty good. During WW2 a portal is opened by the Nazis and Hellboy escapes through it to be found and raised by the allies. 60 years later the time has come for Hellboy to serve the other side for the purpose for which he was designed. Quite what that purpose was I never really understood as the plot was somewhat confusing (not that it really mattered).<br /><br />Sadly although some of the CGI is very good, and there are a number of memorable sequences, there is just too much of it. Once you seen one CGI tentacled monster, another one just becomes a bit of a yawn. Its not without merit though. Ron perlman is a fine actor and delivers his lines with some style and when neccessary with a fine sense of comic timimg.<br /><br />Its certainly worth watching once, but I would be wary of buying it, as I don't think it will hold up to repeated viewings.

I've been a Who fan since 1979 (the Chicago show on disc 3 was my first ever concert) and I know the band's history as well as anyone.  So disc 1, aside from snippets of concert footage that only made me want more, was kind of useless.  Disc 2 gets a star for the Railway Hotel footage and for the Moon story as told by Bill Curbishley, although his voice can put you to sleep.  What I would have liked to have seen is an interview with Zak Starkey for the Keith Moon segment.  Disc 3 gets 2 stars 'cause I was at the show.  But I'm taking one star away for what's missing.

B000Y44LBG|4.0|\\"American Gangster\\", the new film from director Ridley Scott, writer Steve Zaillian and stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, is an exceptionally well-made film. But it lacks the fireworks (literally) to make it a truly memorable film.<br /><br />Frank Lucas (Washington) is the driver, bodyguard, collector, man of all trades for a notorious gangster (Clarence Williams III) who rules the drug trade in Harlem in the late 60s. As much harm as he does, Lucas' boss also does good, handing out turkeys on Thanksgiving, for instance. When his boss dies, Lucas takes over and expands the empire. He immediately tries to figure out a way to import his drugs, taking out the middleman and increasing the potency, making his empire grow all the faster. As word of his brand \\"Blue Magic\\" spreads, he brings the rest of his family from North Carolina and enlists his brothers and cousins (played by among others Chiwetel Ejiolfor and Common) to become his lieutenants. Detective Richie Roberts (Crowe) and his partner find a stash of cash totaling almost a million dollars. Richie can't do anything but turn it in to the evidence room but his partner worries they will be ostracized. Sure enough, his partner's prediction comes true. When the opportunity to head the newly formed Drug Enforcement Agency's branch in New Jersey comes up, Richie jumps at the chance and forms his new unit. He knows they need to make the big scores, they need to make headlines or they will not last long. He trails a possible lead to the Joe Louis fight and watches Lucas and his wife walk to the best seats in the house. Frank has also let his wife's choice of a chinchilla coat get the better of him and he stands out like a sore thumb. Richie takes his picture, because he has better seats than the head of the local Mafia (Armand Assante), and tells his crew Frank Lucas is their new goal. As Frank seeks out ways to continue expanding his empire and influence, Richie and his crew try to build a case against the drug kingpin.<br /><br />\\"American Gangster\\" is a very well made film. From the moment the first frame of film rolls through the projector, you get a feel for the time and place. This story takes place in New York in the early 70s. Director Scott gives the film a brownish tinge, painting the images in a gritty, worn tone, emulating the films made during this period. I almost expected Al Pacino to walk onscreen as Serpico. As with any of Ridley Scott's films, the production values are excellent, costume and production design further cement our feeling of the time and place.<br /><br />Washington and Crowe have each created some very memorable characters and each is almost always, at the least, good. The two haven't appeared together in a feature film for a long time, and the mere idea of their appearance together has generated a lot of buzz and is driving big box office. But \\"Gangster\\" tells two parallel stories through most of the film's running time. The two actors don't appear on screen together, facing off, until late in the film. This isn't really a criticism, because each actor does such an excellent job of establishing and running with their character. But the fact they don't appear together on screen for such a long period of time contributes to the lack of fireworks.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, a determined man, with a definite sense of what he wants and how to get it. When his boss dies, he sits at the memorial service and watches all of the other people in the room, noting how they talk about his deceased boss and how they treat him. He witnesses more than a little disrespect and makes a mental note to correct the problems later.<br /><br />As he steps into his boss's shoes, he tries to figure out ways to increase profits and his power, leading him to come up with a plan to import the drugs directly. That means he has to travel to Thailand and Cambodia, at the height of the Vietnam War and meet with the drug lords who manufacture the heroin. Using a cousin who is serving in the Army, he arranges to have the drugs shipped back in the coffins of deceased servicemen. With this part of the plan in place, Frank set up a distribution network and the money starts to roll in. But Frank is a smart guy and he knows the best way to stay under the radar is to drive an old car and wear natty suits. He admonishes his brother (Ejiofor) for wearing a flashy outfit and goes against his better judgment when he wears the expensive, and flashy, chinchilla coat his wife gives him to the Louis fight. Naturally, this is what causes Richie to set his eyes on Lucas.<br /><br />Washington does a great job of making Lucas seem real. Yes, he is a killer and a drug dealer, but he seems more of a businessman. Everything he does is the result of trying to expand his empire. He brings his family north and sets them up in the boroughs of New York because he knows he can trust them. If he is going to have other people handling his money and his product, he wants them to be family. He can trust family. When a rival boss (Idris Elba, HBO's \\"The Wire\\", \\"28 Weeks Later\\") demands an unreasonable payment for `rent', Frank tries to reason with him. When that doesn't work, he takes matters into his own hands.<br /><br />As you watch Washington portray all of the different facets of this character you realize the performance is all the more convincing because he could easily be mistaken for an ambitious businessman. Part of this can be attributed to Lucas' desire to remain under the radar by trying to blend in. On the few occasions he lets his better judgment lapse, he doesn't seem comfortable, or entirely convincing for that matter. In a way, this helps Washington's portrayal, because we realize how uncomfortable he is wearing a chinchilla coat and why.<br /><br />Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, the detective who is too honest for his own good. As soon as Richie says he has to return the money he and his partner found, his partner knows they will be ostracized. Cops aren't that honest, if they are, they are probably snitching on other cops. They turn in the money and his partner's prophecy comes true. Richie tries to continue to do his job, but a pivotal moment leads him to realize they will never get the support they need from their department. This is why he welcomes the opportunity to head up the new Drug Enforcement Agency branch in New Jersey. After handpicking the members of his team, he continues to live an extremely honest life, to the amazement of his own team. But he sets an example they follow.<br /><br />Richie is very determined to pull in some big scores and when he sets his sights on Lucas, he almost becomes a pit bull, refusing to let go until he has the man behind bars. Crowe does a very good job of weaving all of these attributes together. Crowe brings all of Roberts' determination to life and makes it believable. It is also interesting to see the few glimpses we have into Roberts' personal life, as these illustrations only serve to further reinforce everything we know about him. Because he is so determined to catch the man, we understand this is a trait of Roberts'. Once he sets his mind to something, he doesn't do much else except pursue leads. This is why he is going through a bitter divorce with his wife (Carla Gugino) and fighting with her for custody of their son. This is why he has meaningless one-night stands with stewardesses. This is why his apartment is a sty.<br /><br />After Richie forms his new task force, he sets his eyes on an Italian Mafioso who is known to be involved in the drug racket. Armed with a camera, he attends the Joe Louis fight and watches Lucas and his wife, both dressed in expensive fur coats, walk to the first row and sit in better seats than the Mafioso.

I don't like it when films have nonstop gratuitous violence, but when you go to see a film about gangsters, you should expect some.<br /><br />That said, \\"American Gangster\\" is very good.

It is a film definitely worth seeing.hey are probably snitching on other cops. They turn in the money and his partner's prophecy comes true. Richie tries to continue to do his job, but a pivotal moment leads him to realize they will never get the support they need from their department. This is why he welcomes the opportunity to head up the new Drug Enforcement Agency branch in New Jersey. After handpicking the members of his team, he continues to live an extremely honest life, to the amazement of his own team. But he sets an example they follow.    Richie is very determined to pull in some big scores and when he sets his sights on Lucas, he almost becomes a pit bull, refusing to let go until he has the man behind bars. Crowe does a very good job of weaving all of these attributes together. Crowe brings all of Roberts' determination to life and makes it believable. It is also interesting to see the few glimpses we have into Roberts' personal life, as these illustrations only serve to further reinforce everything we know about him. Because he is so determined to catch the man, we understand this is a trait of Roberts'. Once he sets his mind to something, he doesn't do much else except pursue leads. This is why he is going through a bitter divorce with his wife (Carla Gugino) and fighting with her for custody of their son. This is why he has meaningless one-night stands with stewardesses. This is why his apartment is a sty.    After Richie forms his new task force, he sets his eyes on an Italian Mafioso who is known to be involved in the drug racket. Armed with a camera, he attends the Joe Louis fight and watches Lucas and his wife, both dressed in expensive fur coats, walk to the first row and sit in better seats than the Mafioso. He quickly puts two and two together and determines Lucas is his new target. He and his team start a massive surveillance effort and begin to amass information about Lucas and his dealings.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|A brilliant second album from James Blunt...An amazing production together with an incredible voice and very talented muscians could only bring a masterpiece to  our ears. All the lost Souls will blow your mind from start to finish, the quality of James' vocals technics are so crystal clear, the lyrics so heartfelt and true to James Blunt. This album is a must for anyone who loved `Back to Bedlam' as well as for the few who did not as it offers a surprising range of new musical styles which will reach out to any generation; it is an absolute must for any fans of the 70's. Like `Back to Bedlam', it is worth listening to `All the Lost Souls' as loud as possible on your sound system once you have gotten to know it...But for first time listeners, it is recommendable to play `All the lost Souls' on an Ipod (or at least with headsets if using a hi-fi) in a quiet environment with your eyes closed...in order to capture the true emotion of the chef d'oeuvre. This album will keep growing on you!!!...
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I obviously don't buy movies unless I absolutely love them. This movie is awesome. I do not like scary movies, but I love this. The humor takes off the pressure. And oh, the humor. It is non-stop funny, and yet somehow very realistic. If there was a zombie epidemic, this is in fact how it would be. Enjoy.
B000URDEB0|1.0|Cuando se anuncio que Tarja no continuaria con Nightwish mi primer<br />pensamiento fue que la banda se separaria y supuse que cada uno continuaria con sus pryectos por aparte, pero no sucedio asi, la banda siguio luego de,segun ellos, una extensa busqueda de una reemplazante de Tarja y es asi como una vez seleccionada la nueva vocalista que la banda lanzo para este 2007 este disco.<br /><br />Pero jamas estaria preparado para lo que llegaria a convertirse Nightwish con su nueva etapa, ya sin Tarja, aunque tenia la esperanza de que la reemplazante fuera de caracteristicas parecidas a las de Tarja.<br /><br />Mientras Nightwish buscaba vocalista nueva, la escena mundial de metal sinfonico evolucionaba, en mi humilde opinion para mal, pero saldria una banda nueva llamada Operatika con una vocalista que parecia cumplir con todos los requisitos para reemplazar a Tarja y mis esperanzas de que Nightwish tomara la decision correcta aumentaban.<br /><br />Pero una vez lanzado su nueva produccion todas mis esperanzas fueron aniquiladas y destrozadas.<br />El album resulto ser una completa decepcion, su musica es simplona, con una labor de Toumas (teclados) bastante aceptable pero nada extraordinario con una visible influencia de Hanz Zimmer, las guitarras con poca elaboracion, asi como el bajo y para hacerlo peor una vocalista horrorosa, sin nada de sentimiento en su voz, fria, poco expresiva, mediocre para la calidad que habia desarrollado en sus principios la banda y todo, absolutamente todo con una clara intencion de vender discos nada mas, sumamente comercial, pero no todo es culpa de Nightwish, sino de la misma escena sinfonica metal que han visto en las voces femeninas gran potencial para vender muchos discos con tan solo modificar las guitarras hacia cosas mas digeribles, menos elaboradas, aburridas y sin sentimiento, sin sentido ni corazon, asi resumo lo que ha venido a convertirse la tan maltrecha escena metal sinfonico o doom metal en general, con bandas como Tristania, Sirenia, Epica y ahora Nightwish que ahora practican una musica comercial y mediocre.<br /><br />Este disco de Nightwish debio llamarse Cold Passionless Play, pues asi describiria su musica de mejor manera, es una desgracia y muy lamentable que una de las bandas pioneras del metal sinfonico y doom metal en general se \\"despida\\" de esta manera y que por el contrario Tarja ahora como solista este sonando mejor aunque no con la genialidades de Toummas ni de una banda de renombre que la respalde pero siempre con su maravillosa voz encantando a mas fanaticos alrededor del mundo con su nuevo disco que sin ser una genialidad es mil veces mejor que este disco de Nightwish.<br /><br />QUE DECEPCION!!!!!!!

075640407X|5.0|I was hopelessly hooked from page one to the end.  I actually blew off work one morning (not my norm) to finish the book.  I ranted a bit to find out that I was going to kept in suspense, then realized that was good news! I didn't have to say farewell to the characters and 'world', and more good news that Book Two is on the horizon.  Thank you Pat - it is the best in a long time.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|It was great to hear some the good ole rock n roll from Bruce withthe E Street Band, some great tunes, I must have listened to it a dozen times or more since I bought it.  You will like this one
B0002KQNJU|4.0|I love this movie. It thrills me from the lavishly odd musical intro to the quirky period picturesque feel to the film. I feel like I am IN Transylvania. The film achieves the look of \\"old.\\" The professor is wonderfully kooky and watching young Roman Polanski is a delight. I did not realize that his wife, Sharon Tate, was so beautiful. I don't know that I have ever seen her in anything else. There is plenty of humor in the film. I wasn't so thrilled with the one vampire being gay, but it was not pervasive to the film and I saw the humor in the situation. If you are looking for a gory, scary vampire film...do not bother...this film is more about the period, the place, the charm of a fun caper gone awry. In our house it is the only vampire movie we drag out every now and again to enjoy. Thanks Roman and Sharon! Well done!!!!
B00000DOY2|5.0|Or should I say 'The One That Started It All!' After this Legendary Album Aretha has NEVER had a dry spell and/or looked back (Over 5 Decades of #1 Billboard Hit Singles & Albums and Countless Billboard Top Ten Hit Singles!). Starting with the Gold Billboard #1 Smash Single \\"I Never Loved A Man\\"! Aretha come back a few Months later with an even BIGGER HIT!...The #1 Gold Billboard R&B and Pop Hit Single: \\"Respect\\" which has become the All-Time Female Anthem. The album also includes B-Sides: \\"Do Right Woman-Do Right Man\\" which was a Top 40 Billboard Chart Hit Single, and the Non-Charting \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", along with Album Killers: \\"Baby, Baby, Baby\\", \\"Drown In My Own Tears\\", and \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" Aretha was offically off and running!!! Just for the History Records: This Album has NEVER been Out Of Print since it first seen the light of day. The down side to this Compact Disc Reissue is that it is presented in Mono with the exception of: \\"Respect\\", \\"I Never Loved A Man\\" & \\"Do Right Woman-Do Right Man\\" being Repeated. They (Rhino Records) call them 'Bonus Tracks' WHY???. This I don't understand when this entire project was Released In Stereo back in the day (Yes!, I still have my Stereo Vinyl Record of it!). In the meantime this is a Must-Have for ANY Collection, and who knows, maybe one day we'll get a Massive Box Set Of Aretha's COMPLETE ATLANTIC OUTPUT of ALL of Her Recordings for the label!...  Wouldn't that be nice????

0385486804|5.0|I was somewhat disappointed in the book, mainly because I thought it was more about the people he met along the way than himself. And I am not blaming anyone because Chris was a very private person and didn't write about himself much. It is a shame that he didn't prepare himself more for the trip and learn about the nature of Alaska instead of just wandering into territory he did not know much about and lost his life because of it.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I actually HATED both Europa and Pop when they first came out. I was not amused by the whole \\"sound of 4 guys chopping down the Joshua Tree\\" concept. Then a funny thing happened. Both albums grew on me. I do agree that it is an un-even album and I have long thought that by culling Europa and Pop for the gold, they would have had a killer record.<br /><br />Discotheque and Mofo are total guilty pleasures. Staring at the Sun and If God Will Send His Angels are gorgeous.<br /><br />Is POP as good as Actung Baby? Nope, but it has enough on it that I find myself listening to it once a month at least.
2070612368|5.0|I purchased this book along with all the other Potter books in French as part of my attempt to learn French some 40 years after high school.  I had read the English and Spanish versions previously and found this and the other FRench volumes to be delighful although it took  a little getting used to name changes for places and characters that probably made sense for francophiles but seemed unnecessary -- unless the french language versions of the movies also had the changes.<br /><br />That said, the books have been a great aid in language learning.  The translations seem pretty capably done insofar as keeping the story line anchored to the original.  I have seen many book translations (such as the Fernch version of The DaVinci Code) that are not faithful to the original in many respects such as cutting out dialogue and scene descriptions.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Why buy this if you already have all the lps and/or the cds?  Because the remastering and production quality is simply stunning.  The best rock music ever recorded has never sounded better.  So what if a few of your favorites are missing?  What you do hear is music recorded 30+ years ago sounding more alive, fresh and dynamic than anything else recorded since.

B000062Y98|5.0|I recently just got into Blind Guardian with the release of the 2007 Remasters of their first 7 albums (not including the Tokyo Tales one), and I've come to really appreciate the mix of soaring power metal interlaced with medieval guitar solos.<br /><br />Ironically, this was the last album I ended up receiving.  I ordered \\"Twist in the Myth\\" and this one at the same time (after I had acquired all the remasters, and for some reason \\"Night at the Opera\\" took a week longer to arrive.  So obviously, I had a chance to listen to all of the other albums before this one.  Well, I finally got this one and gave it a good listen.  WOW!!!  \\"Night at the Opera\\" is a sonic masterpiece.  Layered with complex vocals and a seemingly never-ending medieval guitar rhythms.  I honestly don't know how the guitarist keeps that stuff going all through-out the songs.<br /><br />I thought \\"Nightfall in Middle-Earth\\" was great, but \\"Opera\\" is right up there.  There ain't one bad song on this album.  Each song is a masterpiece.  However I could have done without the Spanish version of \\"Harvest of Sorrow\\".  Just didn't fit with the rest of the album.  My first exposure to this album was a MP3 of \\"Battlefield\\" and I loved the medieval themes in it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|For a long time I covered everything up (after all, that's what we do when we're hurt, we just dig over it and scar it up). I never cried even though I wanted to, and I became very robotic and indifferent.<br /><br />One night after having a huge fight with my (then) girlfriend, I took a long drive to sort it all out, and I popped in ( ).<br /><br />It brought everything to the surface, all of the emotions that were buried, all of the hurt, the shame.<br /><br />I exploded into tears as the music burst into beautiful orchestral waves of mania and melancholia. I hadn't cried in years. It felt so damn good. This music brought me to my knees and I saw my inner child, aching to get out.<br /><br />That cold night I realized that I can be human again. I am a living, breathing, colorful soul.<br /><br />Sigur Ros has a gift that most bands can not posess. If you're looking for beautiful, spiritual, mind-inducing music - look no further. It's like a musical drug that soothes and helps you.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|A disclaimer for the 25 people who, before I rewrote this, had stated that it was helpful. They may not think the same of what they read here now.     I had originally written that \\"finally there is Zep on cd that sounds as musical as it deserves to sound! for anybody who has been dissatisfied by the digital representation of zep to the point that I have (the last remasterings sound so lousy to me that I can't enjoy them; so I've been listening to Zep on vinyl only) this collection will be a Godsend. For those who couldn't care less about sonics there is no reason to get this, as 'nothing is revealed'.\\"   **********************************************************  A 'hat in hand' update of this review posted after further listening on 11/30/2007:    Mothership sounded great to me at first but after reading other folks at Steve Hoffman forums all pointing to the 80's cds as being straight transfers from the analog, i had to check it out.     I realized i may have never heard the 80's version but because i never liked the 90's remasters (compared to my analog copies) i just assumed the 80's were worse - this also was based on prejudice from hating 80's cd's from many other catalogs (miles davis is a good example).   so this re-review stands as unrequired further proof that prejudice is bad and assuming makes a you-know-what out of you-know-who.    Yesterday I got an 80's copy of zep I and sat down with it and \\"mothership\\" - and after going back and forth again and again and again  - I came to the same conclusion as those others had: the 80's cds sound better.     there are still digitally induced problems with the new versions though they remain vastly superior to the 90's masters to my ear.    So after my original proclamations of sonic bliss - I have to eat my hat (blech...).       I think a good mastering/manufacturing job now starting with the analog tapes as source (which mothership did not do) would surpass these 80's transfers easily due to so much ground beinggained in 16 bit quality since then. a quick listen to the doors or creedence or 100 other bands' or orchestras' cds that have been remastered beautifully in the last 7 years or so will demonstrate the potential.    For now, in terms of these Led Zeppelin cds, if you can compare mothership to the 80's diament mastering.  Try this: turn up a diament cut til Plant's vocal is pretty loud. all will be well, I promise.   Now - swap it for mothership and turn up that same song til Plant is as loud as you just heard him on your 80's cd. I promise that your ears will hurt from the loudness/piercing quality of one instrument or another.    at low/careful volume the new masters reveal a lot of detail and appear to have great soundstage. this can be seductive, but there is an artificiality to some of the tonal shadings and the imaging if you compare directly to the vinyl or the diament 80's cds, along with the loudness and clipping problems.      this from a guy who was wowed by the new stuff until he:    1) listened to the classic vinyl again and 2) did the  a/b thing with the diament.    ok. now I am done eating my hat (yuck...).     Still, if you have nothing to compare it to or have been living with the 90's remasters, mothership could rock your boat. I still enjoy it despite it's shortcomings, but not as much as the diament cds now that i've carefully visted them.    apologies to anyone led astray by my initial review.
B000QUCNP4|2.0|All I can say is disappointing, very disappointing.  Maybe I had too high of hopes for this movie, it definately fell short on all accounts.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Just had to point out to the review submitted by Taylor X.  He complains about only 1 song from Presence, and \\"why does no one else but me realize there is more to this album?\\"  Guess what partner?  Nobody's Fault But Mine is from Presence!  He has it listed under Physical Graffiti in his review.  I love it when people complain about things when they have no knowledge of the facts to begin with.
0060589469|3.0|decent book but wasent expecting such indepth knowledge and as much time spent on ancient greek philosophy and technology, understanding that is very much relevant to the book it just wasnt what i expected. decent book but very drawn out without much of a reward
B000UFAURI|2.0|It really is a dismal thought that Foo Fighters will never make another \\"Color and the Shape\\" or self-titled album. With that said, even though \\"One By One\\" was not as good as any of their previous albums, it still has relative substance. However, \\"In Your Honour\\" was just far too musically meager and deficient. If you weren't a huge fan of \\"In Your Honour,\\" then I can guarantee you will NOT like their new release whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\\" is just plain boring. There are about 40 other bands/albums that came out with products in the same month that were FAR better and awe-inspiring.
B000Y179KO|5.0|LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN proves that, 28 years after their last proper studio album, THE LONG RUN, the Eagles still have what it takes to write great songs and make a great CD. This double-disc set features the full range of the band's styles, from their early-70s country-rock sound to the harder rock direction they pursued later in the decade. The bandmembers' advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
