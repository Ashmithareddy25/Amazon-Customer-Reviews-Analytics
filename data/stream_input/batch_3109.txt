B00111YM5G|3.0|This is a very stupid movie, but it's great for the nights when you want to sit and watch a really poor/cheesy flick. Two thumbs sideways for this one...and they don't point down only because Andy Whitfield was in it!!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app works so good and connects to your computer. The stuff you do on your kindle pops right up on the computer screen. It is amazing and works so great. I HIGHLY recommend this app. Works so well.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie is great! It's lively and colorful. My parrots love it. One even sings along with the music. Entertaining!
006202406X|5.0|I just got done with Allegiant and feel like many felt, a bit numb. However, I am able to realize that it takes a good author to make you feel this way. So it didn't turn out the way you thought it would, it doesn't mean you get to mistreat the author. She made you feel, if you don't like that then stop reading all books and sit quietly alone in the corner. I for one enjoyed this book. 5/5
B003Y5H542|3.0|This movie is dumber than dumb. Thank goodness my ex took it with him. It looked good, it just wasn't.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|My background is in engineering so maybe I'm too critical, but this shouldn't have failed after maybe 5 or 6 careful uses in a year.<br /><br />There is a very weak connection between the camera mount and the arm for the weight. I only used a it handful of times before the arm fell off because the female thread in the arm became stripped.. It is a very small screw that doesn't go very far into the arm.. only maybe three tiny threads actually hold it together. That is a lot of stress on such a small bolt and so few of the threads.<br /><br />I'm going to try to drill a bigger hole and tap some larger threads into it to use a properly sized stainless screw.. Also, the fit between the arm and the mount has some play in it which allows the arm to twist. I had to use some tape to tighten up the tolerance between the two metallic pieces. The interface could have been made much better by having a flange welded to the arm and using multiple mounting screws to prevent it from twisting. This is a poor build design at such a critical point.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i have waited a long time for this game to be on kindle fire.alot of my family and friends have been playing a long time,now i can finally join them.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's great, super convenient. In particular for netflix users.<br />Couldn't have been more easy to set up and use. If you want to sit down and watch a netflix show, or a youtube video, this is the way to go.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Havent got this far in the series but love up to season two.I assume quality of show will continue at its high pace.<br />DVD package came as advertised in time and at a decent price.
B00B7FOQCK|3.0|The cable is just too short.  The only way to plug this into a rear USB port and still have access to the hub is to use an extension cable - and every extension cable I have tried makes the connection unreliable and/or too slow.  They should have added just a few inches to the cable and it would be great, but with this design I can't even plug the hub in and set it on top of my case for access.  Really poor design.  You can't make a USB 3.0 device that has to go through multiple extensions/connections and deliver the expected speed and reliability.<br /><br />**edited** Based on company explanation, I can see where this would not be a problem for people using a laptop.  I would still suggest adding 6 inches and making it perfect for everyone.  But I'm raising this to 3 stars because it is quite adequate for laptop users specifically.
1937053571|5.0|Said to see this series end but Jennifer did an amazing job to ending this series.. She doesn't leave you with questions or anything just a story well played in your head. This book had me laughing and crying threw half of it.

1451666179|5.0|I laughed the entire time I was reading this book.  If you're at all familiar with the blog, even if all you know is CLEAN ALL THE THINGS, then you'll enjoy this book.  The old content was just as fun to read this time around and the new content was well worth the wait.  Allie Brosh is one of the best comedians around and her delightful take on her life, both childhood and present, is always a blast to read.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|The special effects in Snow White was really the only good thing about it.  The acting was not good.  The story was not good.  This is not a movie I will ever watch again.
0156027321|5.0|I really love this book. Despite seeing the movie, the book has so much more information in it and similar to other movies that are based off books, the book's storyline is way more in depth and complicated.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is Stephen King's best book since The Stand.  Awesome---Stephen King is back and writing better than ever.  Read it.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|It is simply perfect :) Minecraft is game which is to be played by everyone, LEGO made it real. Thanks
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I really expected to hate this movie.  I didn't think I would be able to sit through a movie with constant singing.  I went with my friend to see it anyway.  I was one of the most moving stories I have ever seen.  Now I can see it whenever I need to be reminded how dear life is and how important each life is, and how small we all are.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a cool game!!!! It really kept me intrigued! All the little different puzzles you have to figure out just to open one single drawer or door was awesome!!  This is a MUST play game!!  Wish there were more like it....just nothing but at box!!!

B009KZMFOA|5.0|During the last 10 years, I have listened and greatly enjoyed nearly all of Patricia Kaas's CDs, including<br />many live ones; during these years, her excellent voice and superb French diction have accompanied me<br />through my studies of the French language. Now it is interesting to return to her with this latest CD and<br />find out that her voice has matured still, being now somewhat darker-hued and thicker than before, but still as<br />strong and impressive as ever.<br /><br />This CD consists mostly of re-interpretations of classic Edith Piaf songs (or chansons, as they really<br />should be called). There is one song (Avec le soleil) that sounds entirely new to me, plus two purely<br />orchestral instrumental pieces. Throughout the CD, PK is accompanied by - surprise! - the Royal Philharmonic<br />Orchestra, for which the songs were arranged by Abel Korzeniowski (Who? I've never heard of Abel<br />Korzeniowski before, but judging by the sounds on this CD, he really knows what he is doing). There is also<br />a rhythm section consisting of guitars, bass and a drum kit, plus some featured soloists playing string<br />instruments, trumpet, keyboards, accordion and the harmonica, one song even including the eerie sound of an<br />electronic instrument called Theremin.<br /><br />The result is a CD of a surprising breadth and variety. Wisely, PK does not even attempt to imitate Piaf, for that would be quite useless - Piaf's was one of the truly great voices of the 20th century, and cannot really be imitated, though many have tried. Instead, she and Korzeniowski have set out from a wholly different angle; the arrangements are often slower and more melancholy than the originals, giving the impression of perhaps being more informed with love's darker side than the now rather innocuous-sounding originals. Moreover, the orchestration adds to them a kind of brooding dramatics and cinematic flair, which to me sounds perfectly right - never overdone, just right.<br /><br />The arrangements, including the two purely orchestral pieces composed by Korzeniowski, sometimes brings to mind certain superior film music, like that of Philip Glass, John Williams or Wojciech Kilar.<br /><br />Indeed, new era demands - and deserves - new ways of seeing and interpreting old songs, and these ones really add something new to these old Edith Piaf classics. This CD also has great sound; the orchestra is neither too loud nor does it overwhelm PK's singing; both come out with clarity and a nearly perfect balance. Excellent job!<br /><br />In short, a CD that seems to be on a steady course of becoming a classic. C'est aussi en train de devenir un des grands Disques de ma vie!r />The arrangements, including the two purely orchestral pieces composed by Korzeniowski, sometimes brings to mind certain superior film music, like that of Philip Glass, John Williams or Wojciech Kilar.<br /><br />Indeed, new era demands - and deserves - new ways of seeing and interpreting old songs, and these ones really add something new to these old Edith Piaf classics.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|very nice book.  A bit different from the movie but both are good in it's own way.  Will defiantly share this with others
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great for posting updates, keeping up with friends. however the games are inaccessible without flash player on kindle fire or android.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|it's only chrome and youtube streaming for now... would be better if it can steam the desktop view like how the apple airplay does.

B00CTEU1HM|5.0|This easily lives up to the classics and is a must for any serious Sabbath collection. Full of masterpieces including the title cut, Air Dance, Shock Wave, Hard Road, and more! The only Ozzy era Sabbath in my option that is less than 5 stars is Technical Ecstasy and that is still a solid album. On to the review of the Rhino vinyl edition. It sounds spectacular, no surface noise, and crystal clear. Listening to Air Dance right now and completely BLOWN AWAY. If you like Sabbath and have not heard it on vinyl do yourself a favor and get it soon!!!<br />UPDATE- I also have the original vinyl which does sound equally incredible if not better. I highly recommend this album. The drumming on this one is some of my favorite. The keyboards are more prominent but Iommi is searing with incredible solo's and Ozzy's voice cuts like a knife. He could still hit all of the notes at this point in his career. This challenges the great Dio era albums...that is how incredible it is.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I used it for the first time and really like it. I have since thrown my electric clock away since it wouldn't keep time.

B005EGXTL2|5.0|This is just one from the great trilogy by Suzanne Collins, what a thrilling book to finish off with, fantastic
B004HGBUVG|1.0|What a sore disappointment.  After discovering that this CD had been released, I immediately ordered it without even listening to the tracks beforehand (a mistake I will not make again).  As a huge Lucinda Williams fan, I just assumed that she had continued her outstanding singing and songwriting on this CD, and that any changes in her artistic style would be those of positive growth, maturity and a fine honing of her craft.  However, I was completely let down from the first song to the end.  In some ways, this album felt like a cruel joke on her fans, or a consequence of her own deluded ego trip that whatever she puts out will be consumed with blind gusto.<br />  Once you have listened to masterpieces such as &#34;Lake Charles,&#34; &#34;Drunken Angel,&#34;&#34;Steal Your Love&#34; and &#34;2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten,&#34; the songs on &#34;Blessed&#34; are absolutely unbearable.  Whiny, depressing and predictable, they sound as if she put zero effort into them.  Where is the creative magic and inspiration that infused earlier amazing albums, such as  &#34;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&#34;?<br />  It's so sad to see a musical icon go downhill like this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me cry... so sad...<br />This book was so good the words were beautiful. This book not only showed the love between Gus and hazel but the anger. The sadness.  One of the best books I have ever read.
B00094OBS4|4.0|They never get everybody you want at an event like this - get over it!  Yes, Gary Moore and David Gilmour were great, but don't overlook the underrated Phil Manzanera, who (in my opinion) steals the show here on his own track and then backs up David Gilmour on his.  This is a very nice overview of Strat players with ups and downs, but must have been quite a show on the night.
1593272839|4.0|Friendly introduction in the spirit of _why's Poignant Guide. Much more casual and slower-paced than Real World Haskell. If you're not a career programmer, this is the best introduction to Haskell and functional programming generally. Advanced programmers will probably grow tired of the slow pace and &#34;explain like I'm five&#34; tone of some sections; check out Real World Haskell if you already grok most programming concepts and want to start writing non-trivial Haskell at a faster pace.

B00DUGCLY4|4.0|My daughter thinks that this is a good game. She feels that it helps her think. She gave it four stars because some of the words didn't make sense to her.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It works smoothly with YouTube (haven't tried with Netflix) , but other regular sites with streaming content are choppy because it has to play the entire page w/ video on both devices (TV & computer). Not sure why can't they automatically detect the streaming content URL from the page and play that  only on the TV to save the network bandwidth and avoid the choppy play. I returned it after trying for a week, but will buy if they can resolve this issue.
B0026NWBY2|2.0|The previous George Harrison best-of collection, BEST OF DARK HORSE NINETEEN SEVENTY-SIX TO NINETEEN EIGHTY-NINE, and this latest, LET IT ROLL: SONGS BY GEORGE HARRISON, could have included &#34;This Song,&#34; one of the late guitar man's signature records! Yet, once again, it did not make the cut.<br /><br />My dream George Harrison greatest hits collection would comprise:<br /><br />&#34;My Sweet Lord&#34;<br />&#34;What is Life&#34;<br />&#34;Bangla-Desh&#34;<br />&#34;Give Me Love&#34;<br />&#34;Ding Dong, Ding Dong&#34;<br />&#34;Dark Horse&#34;<br />&#34;You&#34;<br />&#34;This Song&#34;<br />&#34;Crackerbox Palace&#34;<br />&#34;Blow Away&#34;<br />&#34;Love Comes to Everyone&#34;<br />&#34;Faster&#34;<br />&#34;All Those Years Ago&#34;<br />&#34;Teardrops&#34;<br />&#34;Wake Up My Love&#34;<br />&#34;I Really Love You&#34;<br />&#34;Dream Away&#34;<br />&#34;I Don't Want to Do It&#34;<br />&#34;Shanghai Surprise&#34; (with Vicki Brown)<br />&#34;Cheer Down&#34;<br />&#34;Got My Mind Set on You&#34;<br />&#34;When We Was Fab&#34;<br />&#34;Handle With Care&#34; (Traveling Wilburys)<br />&#34;End of the Line&#34; (Traveling Wilburys)<br />&#34;She's My Baby&#34; (Traveling Wilburys)<br />&#34;Any Road&#34;<br />&#34;Stuck Inside a Cloud&#34;<br /><br />To sweeten it for the older fans, one could throw in B-sides from the vinyl era such as &#34;I Don't Care Anymore,&#34; &#34;Deep Blue,&#34; and &#34;Miss O'Dell.&#34;  Any such song deserves consideration over some of the album tracks on this LET IT ROLL collection.<br /><br />If you own no George Harrison L.P.s, while I like just about all his albums here is my short list: ALL THINGS MUST PASS; THIRTY-THREE AND ONE-THIRD; CLOUD NINE; and BRAINWASHED.<br /><br />At least George Harrison and his estate deserve credit for not overwhelming the public with greatest hits albums.  To my knowledge, LET IT ROLL: SONGS BY GEORGE HARRISON is but the third and only the second that Harrison or his estate authorized.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Best movie EVER!!! My all time favorite movie to date! The visual effects are so amazing!!!! This is the best movie ever!!!
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|I never missed a TYA/alvin Lee concert and this version of &#34;Recorded Live&#34; is what I've been waiting for . There was always great jams at the concerts and now we finally have them included on this set.. I've bought every version of this 2 cd set and this is the best by far. This and the &#34;Live At The Fillmore&#34;  recorded in 1970 are a must have for any Ten Years After fan..

I really loved captian phillips this movies is pretty much 2 characters and voices. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney both who i like but no other people are in it.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I must say I've never had a book stir my emotions like this one. Beyond my expectations. I enjoyed every moment.
0761169253|5.0|This is a surprisingly enjoyable and inspirational book. I expected very little from it, and regretted when I placed the order. But I figured I'd wait until it arrived and make the decision. I'm glad I did! Fast, quick, fun, and it just re-energizes your creative spirit.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down sand am waiting for the next one.  I suffer from severe depression and it is so nice how Allow Brosh explains exactly how it affects your life and psyche.
0812992792|5.0|A frightening and eye-opening look into North Korea.  Curiously written and thoroughly engrossing.  Highly recommended.  Takes a little work to follow the protagonist, but it is worth it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Awesome book. Very well written. This is a no-nonsense account of one man's journey into the afterlife. The best part is that his story is not filtered through &#34;religious&#34; glasses because he was an agnostic when he journeyed. You will not be disappointed if you are searching to find the &#34;truth&#34;.

B00C5R8364|3.0|Quick, overall entertaining read, but wow, what happened to Forsyth?  It's been a while since I've read one of his books, and I had to keep checking the cover to make sure this was the same great author I used to love.  The book held my attention, but was extremely simplistic, with stereotypical, one dimensional characters, no plot twists, and even a few this-doesn't-make-sense-at-all moments.  Don't know if it was just a lapse or if this is what he's writing these days...........

B00B5HQL50|5.0|A new M. A new Q. Fewer geek fest trickery and gee gaws. I tried to re-watch the old Bond movies and found them too laughable to sit through. It is a new world and a more sophisticated expectation of what 100 million dollars will buy in a movie. This one was a raw, exciting, and realistic portrayal of the nasty business of espionage. Ian Fleming would not approve, but Ian Fleming didn't have to live in our world and live with knowledge of how things work. The old Bond movies were like watching and old 1930's sci fi with space wind blowing our hero's hair as he clutched the outside of his ship while sailing through space. It was great in 1930, but scientifically laughable now. Bond porks fewer ladies but gets beaten up more. Just like in real life.

B00368PSN2|5.0|Well now.... I'd move mountains and slay untold number of creatures for the hand of Sophia Myles! You see.... this is where the Interstellar Warrior's heart takes over and wishes to remain on 'early' planet Earth with the woman he has become very much in love with. A very good romantic (viking resemblance related) story of survival and realigning of priorities when caring for those (particularly Sophia Myles) around him. I watch this movie pretty much on a regular basis as I just really like it for the love story and the action.

B006O6F932|3.0|The toy is great but beware when buying through Amazon!  This box arrived in it's original packaging- it's Monster High box with pictures of the toy.  This was incredibly upsetting as it was a Christmas present for my three kids and they found it on our doorstep when they got home from school.  So their gift from Santa is completely ruined and I am devastated because it was one thing all three have been so excited about receiving for Christmas.  Why in the world would Amazon ship toys, especially when Christmas shopping is happening, in it's original packaging?  I would also like to add that the lack of packaging makes it a target for theft- a big toy sitting on our doorstep in a busy neighborhood is all too easy to grab.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a fabulous piece of technology for a great price. Jump on this deal now, because it is only going to improve. If Google can get a better deal going with Apple the sky is the limit. Even as it stands now the streaming from iPad or iPhone to TV via Netflix or YouTube is pretty great. We have also used this product with my husband' s laptop and it worked great.

B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is an eye opener.  I never realized how much I thought negatively all my life.  This book will show you how &#34;ungrateful&#34; you have been in your life, and will turn you into a person who loves everything about life and make you grateful for all your blessings, even the little ones.  It does take some discipline to take the course, but it is well worth it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't normally read the book because I don't want it to ruin the movie...<br /><br />I felt the book added to what I remember of the movie and developed the characters more fully.<br /><br />I'm not one to get sucked into a book, but I couldn't seem to put this one down. Fantastic.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like that is not timed and involves strategy. Enjoying it Moe than others. Different from other matching games! Thanks
1603580557|5.0|One of the best books on systems thinking for someone who is a beginner.  It's clear, persuasive, and written well.
0452282152|5.0|An excellent book, I couldn't put it down and almost finished it on the first night but I had other school work to finish. Although this is a work of fiction the author did a great job creating a story around a famous painting. It is very historically accurate and does a great job in portraying the perils  which women had to face in that time period and the sacrifices that young women made on behalf of their families.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This App integrates with the companion weather app.  They are both very easy<br /> to use and are simple and clear in their function.  We are pleased to have them on our Kindle HD 4G tablets.
B00E9R3EEE|5.0|I thought there would be dozens of reviews on this one, but I am all by myself. This is the most famous recording he(Trane) ever did. It begins with &#34;Blue Train&#34; a famous minor blues composed by Trane himself. They say you are judged by the company you keep, and Trane is in great company here!<br /><br />Lee Morgan (trumpet); Cutis Fuller (trombone(; the rhythm section: Kenny Drew (piano); Paul Chambers (bass) and Philly Joe Jones on bass. The four original tunes on this gig (by Trane) are Blue Train, Locomotion, Moments' Notice and Lazy Bird, all bop standards today.<br /><br />Come on folks! How can you call yourself a jazz lover and not have this album?
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Slow,this app is just a wonderful time for the whole players who have this app,and you can earn points.Also,you can't stop playing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|REALLY ENJOY THE GAME. WOULD HAVE  GAVE IT FIVE STARS BUT I DONT LIKE HOW IT SHOWS YOU A COMMERCIAL BEFORE YOU CAN PLAY.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I can't say anything bad about this game!  It's one of the best ones ever!  Graphics were superb, story line very unique.  I give it 5 stars ! I would not change a thing.  I wished that it would keep going.  Can't wait for the sequel! Big Fish, you did it yet again!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|love these puzzles, but i have been finished for months...i hope an update comes soon.  none of the other nonogram apps are nearly as polished as this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|From the moment I started this book I was hooked. It's one of those rare reads you cannot stop reading and yet want it to never end.  John Grisham`s books have never let me down and I'd definitely rate this one in the top five.
B008MM9630|5.0|It's a great game just wish the houses weren't so expensive it takes a long time to get coins to buy stuff to complete tasks
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The New Oxford American Dictionary helps people understand what words mean. I would prefer this to my friends. This is a excellent dictionary.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I had lots of time to do some reading recently so I read the 5 book series.  The whole deal about the stairs all the time seemed to be the most important point of the book.  What? Has the author lived on the second floor all his life so has a hatred of stairs?<br /><br />I really wanted to like this series and regret I didn't read something else on my vacation.  It wasn't totally horrible, but I could never understand why all these people had to live underground.  The demise of the world in this genre should be well explained to make it interesting.  I also could never picture these people in the silos.  I have been in underground homes and caves before, but this series never painted that picture in my mind.  And then there is the big long staircase that goes 140+ floors and no elevators?  This was a society supposedly from the current time in other parts of the book, and they didn't have an elevator?<br /><br />Sorry, but I know the series goes on, but 5 books was enough for me.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Oxford Dictionary of English is a good dictionary. I would tell my friends about it. You should read it too.
B00EVW0VTI|1.0|This was awful.  Horrible acting, horrible script.  It fails as a comedy, action and any type of combination.  I want my two hours back, and I want my money back!<br /><br />Amended:<br />After having the extreme displeasure of watching the last 10 minutes, I don't think I'll watch anything that came anywhere near this awful Maggie Gyllenhal.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|Excellent image quality and very responsive touchscreen, however, it consumes too much battery. Makes your GoPro let you down sooner than expected.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing and Christmas go together perfectly.  All the best songs with the best voice!  Puts you in the Christmas spirit.
B00A5IXYR8|1.0|I actually went to a downtown theater (back when downtown theaters were scary) filled with my Indian (oops, sorry, back then they were Indians but now they are First Nations) brothers incredibly drunk killing time in the el cheapo art film grindhouse theater. This movie was so slow and boring I seriously was in such pain that I wanted to kill myself.<br /><br />Yes, I know it was a cult hit but it's interminable especially when surrounded by drunken Indians yelling at each other across the theater and the wailing baby onscreen. I have no idea why we stayed till the end. I guess we were hoping it got better. It didn't.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought it was a good book, with a lot of suspense. I think it's a great book for anyone who enjoys action and adventure, and a tiny bit of romance. I just wish the epilogue was longer. But other than that I really enjoyed the book.
B007QJBJ76|5.0|Adrienne's Barbeaus! Throw in Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis and holy B movie babes, we're onto something. What's not to like? Well, actually this is a terrible movie not scary at all as after all it's just a condensed air mass. \\"Ooh, scary, kids!\\"<br /><br />Anyway, as a \\"so bad it's good\\" B movie, this is a must-see. For that it's worth five stars not for any technical merit or cinematic genius.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|Not very long but worth it.  If you like Crimson Manor,Grisly Manor, Lost City type games you will definitely like. The other review had a good idea about taking a few notes!  You don't need to note much but there is no journal, hints etc  But easy enough while still a little challenge to complete
B00A2H9OZS|3.0|Vin Diesel returns for the third installment of the Riddick trilogy which takes place five years after The Chronicles of Riddick. Riddick is hunted down by bounty hunters as he toys with them throughout the film. You get 2 different cuts of the film in this release.

Fans can also purchase this film in [[ASIN:B00GHP8T1Y Riddick: The Complete Collection (Blu-ray + Digital HD UltraViolet)]].<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish DTS 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French, Spanish<br />Supplements: Featurettes, Short Film, Unrated Director's Cut
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I read this book in a day and loved the pacing.  End of each chapter left me wanting more just like the end of the book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book...odd perspective, and sometimes a bit difficult to follow, but the characters were very intriguing and fascinating, as were the circumstances they found themselves immersed in.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Heard about this knife on Youtube from a well respected prepper and survival expert. This is one hefty piece of hardware. Will stand up to a beating and get the job done. Great price from a quality knife maker with years of traditional American quality behind them. So worth it.
B004LROUW2|3.0|At 1156 pages this trilogy takes commitment but one that I happily undertook.  Within the firs dozen or so pages Murakami gives us the first twist and solidly hooked me.  For the next 1000 pages I truly enjoyed the intertwined stories, interesting character development, and introduction of some supernatural elements.  With about 100 pages left to go however the pace picked up and the style became decidedly more rushed, almost as if the author had tired of the narrative and was now out to wrap it up as quickly as possible.  In the process any number of major plot threads are simply left hanging as Murakami takes us through a very simplistic almost deus-ex-machina ending that was highly unsatisfying.  Really too bad.  This would have been five stars if it weren't for those last 100 pages.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Sounds fantastic. Seems like a more mature sounding album (if that makes sense), which I like a lot. Definitely check it out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|got it for my kids and now I'm  hooked.  Love that you don't have to access internet to advance to earn achievments.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great Movie and the picture and sound quality rock.  The 3D is very deep and at times, looks like you can put your hand all the way through the TV.<br /><br />I cannot wait until the next movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved reading this book. My heart broke a few times and I became frustrated with some outcomes but overall, a great book.<br />I wasn't happy with the abrupt ending, but I suppose the author had two options, a very thick book or summarize at the end. Heartbreaking, funny, interesting, frustrating and suspenseful.<br />I recommend wholeheartedly.
0316201545|5.0|This book was amazing! Don't listen to the bad reviews about this book!! I really like how Chris Colfer put interesting twists on old fairy tales. This is a must read for anyone who,<br />1. likes fairytales<br />2. likes princesses<br />3. can understand the loss of losing a loved one<br />4. Or someone who just wants to read a good book!!!!<br /><br />This book was even better than the first one! I think anyone could enjoy this book from a 8 year old to a 100 year old, this book is enjoyable for all ages!
006202406X|5.0|In the middle of reading but man it's an awesome read!!!! So glad I have the whole series can't wait to watch the movies when they come out!!!!
0446547654|5.0|Another great story by a great story teller.  I marvel how Sparks continues to come up with great plot lines.
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Great cd!  Heard a track of this on npr and knew I had to get it.  I was not disappointed.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great read.  Love his characters.  Hope more of this series is to come.  Would like to see what happens with Abra.  Definite must read.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Quality of writing and directing.  Acting performances by Emma Watson and especially Logan Lerman. &#34;We can be Heros&#34;  song by David Bowie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very great must play yolo swag cool fast run sick updates awesome mega fun great game lots and lots lots of train that are fast
0156027321|5.0|I would have to say that as a very passionate reader, I am happy I got ahold of this book. A few friends have recommended it to me and I am glad I refused to watch the movie before reading it. One of the best books I've ever read about the meaning of life and finding  faith. The price was great too! I definitely recommend this to EVERYONE.
0062255657|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />  This book is amazing. Haunting and mesmerizing. It grapped me from the get-go and didn't let up till the end.<br /><br />  &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; brought back memories of all the childhood wisdom , the truths and certainties that we lose through the years. Adults call it innocence, pretending and imaginary. But the young know... they know that there are faeries in the garden. There is a monster in the closet, under the bed. Magic is everywhere and a part of everything. In and all around us.<br /><br />  I want to thank Neil Gaiman. Just for a little while I felt the magic again. I saw the faeries and waved to the monster under my bed, I have missed them.<br /><br />  This is my first Neil Gaiman novel but it will most certainly not be my last. In my humble opinion, this book is darn near perfect, almost a 5 star book. It is just too short. The magic ends too soon.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It surely doesnt wrk like d one u get on any anroid or apple or Windows device. This seriously needs to be updated regularly so that users buying kindle doesnt feel left behind.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Not too hard...not too easy.  You do have to think and that's what makes it fun.  Select the right buttons and let the scissors snip away.  Very addictive.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I couldn't be happier! This three season collection of Downton Abbey was a &#34;must have&#34; addition to my personal collection. The price couldn't be beat and they were all factory sealed boxes. I am very satisfied!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is GREAT! I love it! :)<br />I am very happy with this bag so far!<br />The price is right!
1449410243|4.0|I love the Oatmeal.  I love the art, I love the writing, I love the attitude, and I love how Inman can so successfully shift his voice to meet the occasion and make the humor as biting as possible.  He is one of those cartoonists whose economy of style coupled with extraordinary artwork just works so well.  He does a lot of cat stuff, and I adore it.  This would be five stars, if he hadn't unfortunately put out a preceding book that was a lot better than this one.  He does have one running cat series that doesn't do much for me, but the rest of the collection of murderous plotting adorable cats makes it one of those books you a) read a bunch of times and b) buy as gifts for other people.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|Lots of levels and you can retry<br />each level and puzzle as often as you want.....no need to buy your way up.....Lots of fun
1451627297|5.0|NOTE: contains spoilers!<br /><br />A very enjoyable King effort, although more fantasy than his standard horror.  A mild-mannered high school teacher is afforded the opportunity to travel back through time (with complicating limitations) and intervene in the Kennedy assassination.  He is continuing the efforts of an older man in town who runs the local diner.  He moves back through time in a through-the-wardrobe kind of mode, and the writing about him rediscovering his old town in the sixties and how he has to adapt to it is enchanting - the reader shares the wonder and enchantment of the time traveler (I frequently put myself in the protagonist's shoes, trying to visualize what it would be like for me to do in my own hometown... that's how compelling the writing was).  While he's at it, he attempts to right some local tragic wrongs - preventing deaths, murders, accidents.  He has his own complications in the past... bad guys, wisdom-imparting individuals, and romance.  But, as in most if-I-went-back-and-changed-time stories, outcomes are often not the desired ones.  This was a really, really engaging book.  I'm  King fan, but don't love all his books.  This one's a winner.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was hesitant to try.  Everyone I know plays and have a problem.  Oh know I got the bug.  But I love this addtive game!
B00G725UZA|4.0|I'm mostly just glad that this EP is available separately, having of course already bought the deluxe edition of The Next Day the instant it was released. Too often, fans are forced to repurchase the same material twice due to re-releases with can't-miss bonus tracks. Granted, you'd still need to buy The Next Day's special edition if you want the DVD with music videos, but that's not something I feel I need. I just want the songs, and this EP has some great ones.<br /><br />The songs are looser than the ones on the proper album. The opener, Atomica, has a great, energetic vibe. The Love is Lost remix is epic. God Bless the Girl could easily have been on the original main album. Every song here is strong. This is definitely a great addition to The Next Day, one well worth getting for fans of latterday Bowie.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Stop bothering me with reviews I don't want to do.  No one should be required to do these.  Leave me alone
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story but slow reading.  The twists and turns makes it difficult to follow at times, hence the 3-star rating.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I found this game very challenging and exciting. I would recommend this game for everyone. I rate a 5 star.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the 2nd BEST game I've ever played. I'm so happy to have it. When I first saw the game I read about it and enjoyed it a lot'
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story, while not great, is generally interesting enough and it moves along reflecting numerous issues of our current society.  It seems Ms. Rowling is up on her current events.  What truly disappoints me is the excessive profanity.  Ms. Rowling is clearly a talented author as evidenced by her Harry Potter series but it seems she does not possess sufficient talent to convey vulgarity without being blatantly vulgar herself.  Too little is left to the imagination on this count. I wasn't expecting a children's book but the English language has too many offerings to limit oneself so often (throughout) to one or two four letter words.<br /><br />Some have said this book was supposed to be funny.  How so?  While not a tear-jerker by any stretch of the imagination, most of the subject matter is quite serious, even tragic.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I ate at Sukiyabashi Jiro in Tokyo in September. Except for being able to taste Jiro's exquisite creations, this film gives you a very accurate feel for what it's like to be in Jiro's restaurant. It's a no-nonsense film about a man whose passion for sushi is also no-nonsense. He takes his craft seriously, he is meticulous in his craftsmanship, and his product is outstanding. It's entirely no-frills, but that's the Zen approach. Everything that is nonessential is stripped away. The film is like the restaurant. There's nothing warm and fuzzy here, but the quality is unmatched. This is a great film about a man who strives for perfection, one piece of sushi at a time, and how his vision affects his restaurant and the people who work for him. It's a very interesting film on many levels.
B00AEFYX4U|5.0|I love this movie. From a technical perspective, it is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen with the level of detail.  I personally think it is geared more to adults and &#34;Rattlesnake Jake&#34; may be to intense for some children, hence the PG rating.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|Read a review which spoke highly of this book, though didn't deliver much more than &#34;focus on yourself&#34;. Seems to flounder occasionally with &#34;amazing success story of this guy I met...&#34;. I think I took away an idea or two from this book which are good things to remember, but nothing I haven't read before.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very easy way to stream netflix and other videos. Smart TV's are way to slow and cumbersome, this is easy. Quailty not quite as good as I would like for some things, but top notch for Netflix
B006PW0F52|5.0|I really love Dan Ariely's books - this may be a biased review, but fantastic book for people who love an insight in to human sillyness and what the statistics show about us
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm a huge nut for good endings. I need resolution. This delivered. Powerful and satisfying. I certainly can't complain. Collins gets an A in my book.
B003B02O0A|5.0|For being his first novel, John Grisham was ahead of his time.  The best part about this book is how it reaches out to people. How would you react in the same situation? If you love Grisham, you will love this book. If you have never read Grisham, this is as good a place to start as any!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Heard that this was a great movie.  I found it at a great price and it was worth it!  I didn't initially realize that the story was based on a true story.  I stayed up late to finish watching this touching movie with a few tears.  Once the credits started I started sobbing!  This story is very powerful, at least to dog/pet owners.  I love it and have watched it numerous times (with fewer tears).
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|can't get the update needed to visit the one and only friend that has been able to reply. something wrong with kindle edition.
B008JFUNHI|4.0|I remember \\"Ender's Game\\" making the rounds at the lunch table in my freshman year of high school. As each student in our clique of slightly gothic and artistic individuals finished novels in the series, we passed them on to the next person. So, I eagerly awaited the release of this film after seeing the trailer during my last trip to the theater.<br /><br />The story about a young prodigy, chosen as a sole commander of the earth's battle forces, is presented in much a similar fashion as in the novel. Asa Butterfield is Ender, the protagonist, who trains to lead the earth forces. Harrison Ford is his, sometimes, none-too-gentle superior who steers him in this endeavor as General Graff. I feel that in the novel, Ender is a much stronger character than the one portrayed in this film version. However, I've come to like the slightly more subtle Ender that might contribute less to deluded feelings of grandeur or overestimating one's ability to succeed in real life. Admittedly, after watching two hours of Ender's Game, I came out of the theater feeling like I could stop traffic with my eyes closed while waving popcorn from the machine, whimsically, through the air, across the lobby, out through the door, and into my mouth. Some moments in the novel and the movie are just magical like that!<br /><br />I had three friends with me, and after getting a feel for their opinion afterwards, I think this movie is best suited to us sci-fi, fantasy, and \\"geeky\\" types. I would have loved for all of my friends to have enjoyed Ender's Game as immensely as I did, but I suppose I can't turn them all. ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun it is like temple run but more awesome get this app it is a lot of fun. Just to let u know there are a lot of updates.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this app on my cell phone and I must say it is  much better<br />On the Kindle. I highly recommend this app. I do recommend disabling one click purchase so you won't be tempted to purchase additional lives. Get the app. It is a whole lot of fun!
B000002AGN|5.0|This is one of the best albums of its time for the 1950s and into the 1960s. A classic, this one is to be had by all jazz and general music collectors. It is timeless. It is refreshing and eclectic. It's a dialogue between mind and soul, for all to experience and share.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Met Christina Baker Kline at an autograph luncheon in Charleston SC. She spoke of her book and the whole story of the orphans and the Orphan Train. This is a riveting book. So much history to be learned.
B00005MM01|5.0|This was one of the first albums I'd every purchased. From here I went on to collect most of Donovan's songs, and then later do it again. This is a fitting title, for it is a gift, still. Donovan, despite losing favor among modern poet-songwriters, is under-appreciated, in my opinion. The 22 songs on this album are among the best composed and released by Donovan. At the time this was originally released, in 1967, I found the popular Kahlil Gibran to be exceedingly compatible with thoughts and sentiments expressed by Donovan in song. Those who enjoy one should also enjoy the other.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|We watched the entire series.  The first season draws you in because of the excellent writing and the actors are superb.  Not for those who avoid violence.  It caused us discussion on how far a person would step outside the law for his family.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Well, It's Ewan McGregor and man, he can sing! I just love him in this movie (uh, ALL movies!) And Nicole is great, so is everyone else, except for the bad guy. You really come to loathe him in this movie! Lovely costumes and sets, very imaginative & fun!
B007SO31BQ|5.0|As described with great shipping as always.<br /><br />This is an emotional and excellent movie, especially if you are an F1 fan. One of my all time favourites.
B00EJX2YGM|2.0|There is nothing new on this DVD that you haven't seen already.  As far as I could tell it was the same things that you got on the Blu-ray or special editions of each movie.  The only thing I liked was the album that holds the DVD's.  So if you already own the movies don't bother wasting your money.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love these books!  They are a fun dystopian read.  I recommend these, especially if you like Hunger Games style books.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Hey, I'm a BIG fan!  It's the last season with Ziva.  Gibbs is mellowing...a little!  I've got all 10 seasons.  It's a great show.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This game is good, but not as good as the carnival, where it's easier to earn the Hello Kitty heart coins, but it is fun. Technically, if you play the game for like a year or so, you'll &#34;earn&#34; enough coins to open up more characters, but it's hard as hell.
B00632HWOG|3.0|The app looks well and is fairly easy to use however there are some annoying bugs. Sometimes when you delete the spam, or you delete several messages from the inbox, they show back up again shortly after they were deleted. Also needs to have a way to delete a folder that the user can create if they do not need it any more.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|My aunt loved it and is very happy and is still trying to watch all of it and thank you again so very much
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a beautiful dream of a book. A story so good it hurts to come to the end of it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am not really a fan of video games where I am tempted to spend actual money.  I am not connecting with Facebook with this one and when I reach the place where I have to ask friends to cross a bridge or a river, that will be the end of reaching new heights.  I will just play the same levels over and over or it will go the way of so many others - regulated to the last thing I think about when remembering my games.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am now addicted to this game and can't stop its so fun I recommend this game for others because it's easy to play
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I have been tempted by ads for this game as I play some of my other video games.  I started it last night and have enjoyed it.  It really is more mindless than most, but a good time-waster can be very peaceful and helps reduce stress.
B000002KHB|5.0|Deep Purple rocks.  My brother had the Made in Japan album.  I was hooked ever since.  These cats were out there and seemed to have a limited following. Sad.  Ritchie Blackmore was a classically trained guitarist.  Just hearing the band throw it down is a class in music appreciation.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Dorothy returns to Oz.  I hadn't seen this movie when it was released, so it was pleasant to see when I saw it for the first time recently, even though it was clearly obvious that they were half-pushing the state of the art with digital effects and you can tell where they really wanted to spend their set budget.  If you love Dorothy, you'll love this film.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|I have all Trivium's albums and I believe &#34;Vengeance Falls&#34; is their best work up to date! Listen to this album a couple of times before you decide to write a review about it, ok? I've been listening to it for two weeks and I must say this album is EXCELLENT! I'm not a casual metal listener. I'm, in fact, a metal collector and I appreciate almost every genre in the metal word (except the crappy nu metal sound!). I could vote &#34;Vengeance Falls&#34; for best metal album / 2013 (Amon Amarth's &#34;Deceiver of the Gods&#34; is also a great album!).
0887431453|5.0|We got this for my daughter when she was about 3 1/2 and she's been working her way steadily through it. Good quality pages (that are perforated to tear out easily), colorful, with a great variety of tasks. Most of them she finds just a little challenging but enjoyable. Occasionally she finds something too hard (like making a check mark) but it's easy to adapt. We've bought a number of these kinds of workbooks and this one really is the best of the bunch.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is quite addicting. Which can be bad on the more difficult levels. Some levels are really annoying btw.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Where season 2 was all about the hatch, this season was all about the others and learning some of their back story.  Because this is still Lost, we do not learn everything through the course of the season, but we do get an understanding of who they are, and how they ended up there.<br /><br />Season 3 picks up where the season 2 cliffhanger left off.  Kate, Jack and Sawyer were taken and held prisoner.  So the first half the the season is essentially telling three or four parallel stories.  Those of the people still on the beach.  Fleshing out the others' story and following Kate Sawyer and Jack.  Most, but not all, of the character development in this season revolves around who the &#34;main&#34; Others were, and how they came to be there.  Although we do learn some other things along the way like how Locke was paralyzed, a familial relation that is revealed only to the viewers along with a lot more of the Jin/Sun relationship.<br /><br />Like in past years the characters do not get through the season unscathed, and the season ends not only on a cliff hanger, but with the first flash forward of the series.  It definitely ends the season on a high note, with again some questions answered, but many others left open.  We also get cameos from a few characters that were killed off in prior seasons.<br /><br />As for the blu ray set for those who get the discs.  The series looks and sounds great again.  The season play mode is not as seamless is it was for the first two seasons, but it does work essentially the same way and you do not have to create a profile.  There are a lot of extras for those who like to go through them.  There is a good 2hrs plus worth of bonus material from behind the scenes features, deleted scenes, a gag reel and commentaries.<br /><br />Lost is definitely not a show that is for the impatient or people who cannot accept weird twists.  You have to be able to suspend your disbelief and realize that you will not learn everything at once.  I is probably an easier series to watch on disc than it was when it aired because you do not get all the time between episodes and you can follow all the plot points better.  If you like fantasy, action, drama, and/or mystery this is definitely a show worth checking out because it blends them all together very well.
0803726570|5.0|I love this story!  Amazing, but true, for decades, both with our own children, and now with our grandchildren; while traveling in the car (especially for longer trips) I become &#34;Witchy-Poo,&#34; an imaginary (I thought!) witch who visits our car with her dog (Midnight Moonlight), her cat (Whiskers) and bird, (Slivers). &#34;Witchy&#34; has a very loud, gravely voice and fun, quick stories to tell that make the young occupants in the car roar with laughter!  Though they really know, I'm &#34;Witchy-Poo,&#34; somehow, magically, I disappear while they gleefully engage &#34;Witchy&#34; and her companions on our way!  Our son found this book and gave it to me (to my amazement!!) a couple of years ago.  In the most recent edition I just received, the dragon's dialogue about his &#34;witchy feast&#34; is different.  I like the former dialogue which describes his munching on a &#34;witch with french fries,&#34; ...and I actually wrote those words into my new book!
0062255657|2.0|It is a short (medium, actually) story blown up to a novel-size by using thick pages and large fonts. Consequently, the characters lack depth and complexity, and the action lacks breadth.<br />Furthermore, it looks like the author could not make up his mind about the target public being composed of adults or children.<br />While the story has its good moments, it is an overall disappointment from Mr. Gaiman. It is a pity, as I was motivated to buy the book after reading the excellent short story &#34;How to talk to girls at parties&#34;.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|One of the most interesting musical artist(s) out there right now! Worth every penny.  If you enjoy The Killers or similar artists this is your genre.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The charger is compact, easy to use and does the job.  Just plug the charger into the outlet in the car (we have 2008 and 2009 Honda Civic sedans) and plug the iPod cord and/or cellphone cord into the clearly labeled slot on the charger.  Simple.  Have purchased one for each car.
B005N95JA4|5.0|CD arrived on time and in excellent condition. This was a purchase for my 11 year old daughter's birthday and she was thrilled to have her first very own CD, specially Some Girls with 'Before They Make Me Run.' Thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really find this is a fun game. I dont like running out of lives and being asked if I want to pay money to buy more. it isn't too difficult to wait a little bit to play some more. I recommend the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game .... it's relaxing and a lot of fun.... I like how it changes the places where we play... great game for all!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|3 interlocking storylines come together in a satisfying .<br />way. enjoyable if a bit flat in the character and world building.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A lot of people hate on these new Star Trek films as they play games with the established canon, etc. etc.<br /><br />However, what people also forget (and let me add that I'm a lifetime Star Trek fan), is that the franchise was essentially dead. The last Next Generation film was (apart from the fact it was nice to see the characters again) diabolically bad, the Enterprise series, although good in parts, was something of a retread of old ideas and sometimes pretty bad.<br /><br />Something had to be done to rescue the franchise and I think that JJ, len's flares, action sequences and all, got it just about right. This is an exciting, visually stunning film that does an amazing job of capturing the essence of classic Trek (I think Bones gets it spot on), and respects the original, without ruining it in anyway.<br /><br />For the naysayers, I've always wanted to ask \\"How would you have resurrected it?\\" because a retread of what's gone before had been proved not to work (again, see Enterprise and Nemesis). This/these new films got us back our beloved Star Trek and in a pretty damn good incarnation to boot. This film is great entertainment and yes, it lacks some of the more thought provoking elements of classic Trek, but I'll take it thank you.<br /><br />As a standalone film, or as an extension of Trek, I rate this film A+
B005KJZDW6|5.0|Everything She and Him do is a pleasure to listen to and this is no exception. These guys are a perfect match musically. This is my favorite Christmas album.  They are both very gifted.
B00G6YH6G0|3.0|This won the 2013 Man Booker prize.  It's got terrific buzz.  Many \\"top shelf/staff pick\\" citations.  Lots of five star reviews.  But I almost gave up on this several times, and I'm willing to take on challenging reads.<br /><br />The fragmented revelation of elements of this gold-field story begins with the mystery novel cliche ending of a parlor gathering of suspects and a summation of the facts.  There is an atmosphere of danger outside the hotel walls where 12, then 13, men of divergent stations elect to trust each other against an enemy in their midst--or not.  It jolts forwards and back in time orientation throughout, and you may find yourself making notes on index cards to keep track of who is supposed to be whom.<br /><br />The social whorl of the New Zealand gold rush gives ample opportunity for self-reinvention.  The reason each person may choose to leave behind an identity--or not--or perhaps for just a little while--provides plenty of plot twists as tight as hairpin curves in a Porsche commercial.<br /><br />In the end, I was hoping for something more.  Perhaps the whore's opium would help.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Kept me wanting to read more couldn't put it down. The language of flowers will not disappoint.you will be drawn in to the story.
B0089LOG02|4.0|\\"The Orphan Train\\" is most effective as it details the often desperate life of urban boys and girls shipped in groups across the U.S. primarily to plains states in need of young, able workers to help establish farms and businesses.  Selected by families whose backgrounds and home environments were completely unknown to the guardians, these children were often abused and treated as chattel.  Given the desperate economic times, the best case scenario was often sharing the cold, the hunger and the desperate poverty of their foster family.  Worst case scenario was all of the above plus sexual, physical and emotional abuse.<br /><br />The contemporary interaction of a young Maine woman on the verge of aging out of foster care with an orphan train passenger maintaining a cold, closed existence in a mansion at the edge of town is a wee bit forced.  The book never quite overcomes that artificiality.  It is a \\"rebellious young woman meets mysterious older woman who ultimately shares her widsom\\" plot line we've seen before with more subtlety.<br /><br />Read this book for the glimpse of a part of American life that calls out for more examination as we consider how as a society we respond to the poor, the disabled, the solitary and the abandoned.
B003YV64OI|5.0|This is not the latest and greatest processor out there but it kicks the crap out of my old Athlon 64 single core.  People have put the heat sync and fan down but I don't see any cooling issues on mine.  Granted I haven't tried heavy duty gaming to really push it yet, but in watching HD videos, surfing the web, mixing audio/video the highest temp mine has reached is 46 degrees Celsius.  That said, there are better coolers you can get, I'm sure.<br /><br />I have also not overclocked this but can verify I was able to unlock the 4th core.  I only did that temporarily because it did not unlock the Level 3 cache as well.  It's not a true Phenom II on unlock without that.  The extra core could also be unstable and because I am getting the speed I need now I don't need that extra core right now anyway.  Maybe down the line I will look into doing it.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I didn't come to this book a Gilbert fan.  I'm apparently one of only five people in the universe who didn't fall all over herself to worship \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\"  I bought \\"Signature of All Things\\" despite the author, not because of the author.  And I enjoyed this book a great deal.<br /><br />Gilbert takes the premise of an earthy immigrant Brit making his fortune in the U.S. and enabling his daughter Alma to leverage rare intellectual freedom into a remarkable mostly unmarried life.  Gilbert keeps it just barely possible that this saga could actually have happened and that a self-taught female botanist confined to a Pennsylvania estate may have been hard on the heels of Darwin in developing a theory of evolution.<br /><br />Gilbert's descriptive powers are strong, the characters are robust even if Alma's blind spots are predictable.  As economic independence makes it possible, indeed desirable, for her to range the world, the botanist blossoms and finds her individuality and strength of self.<br /><br />There are random false notes slipped in here and there, but we seldom are able to enjoy a novel where a female protagonist succeeds on such a scale.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Not very well written. I purchased the whole series at once on someone's recommendation otherwise I never would've purchased book #2

A must read for women or men who find they &#34;bloat&#34;in the evening, many times after eating a dinner high in gluten.  Even if your not alergic to gluten you can have a sensitivity to it which can make a huge difference in how you feel, and in the weight your carry around your waist!

B009AJD5E0|2.0|really didn't like the movie it was OK but not worth the money i spent on it. take it from me find something better to spend your money on
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I really like this app and have had great luck with it. It makes finding, relocating, and renaming documents and PDFs very simple. I have not had luck e-mailing documents to myself with the Kindle e-mail address, so I e-mail them to myself through my GMail account and use this app to move the documents from the downloads to the documents. Easy enough.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This has been a fun way to spend some time.  I played to the end, which is unusual for me.  The dialog was fun, which added to the storyline, which was surprisingly good.  The mix of different games made this much more enjoyable than any other game in this genre that I've seen. Give it a try!  And I had no glitches or freezes.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|They have all sorts of emoticons, and is fun and easy to play and download! The downside is that they repeatedly ask you to write a review, but otherwise, it's fun.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I enjoyed this author's previous series and he does a great job again in this one. immediately buying the next book!
0446343129|5.0|Permanent addition to my library.  Well written, highly informative, entertaining...incredibly good nutritional advise, along with recipes.  The author's writing style is entertaining and engaging.  The story of his transformation from overweight and unhealthy to slim and healthy by changes to his diet (macrobiotic) is incredible.<br />This book is a great read and an eye-opener.
B00CATSONE|3.0|It gave great information. I would have liked more detail. There were may of the ideas that I would like to know more about.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great way to watch videos from YouTube and Netflix on my TV.  Works flawlessly with my Android phone and tablet.  LOVE this!  Will probably buy another for another TV.  Well worth it!
B001993Y2C|5.0|If you are a BSG fan, this is a must get.  Got it in Blu Ray.  Cinematography is excellent, some shots are grainy by design to enhance the scene tension and others superb clarity.  The show was filmed entirely in HD from the beginning.  An excellent series.

B0091REZMW|3.0|Ok game but not very clear with what's going on just started it, so hopefully in gets better.  Also, seems like you do have to buy a lot . Will rewrite after I play a little long to give a fair review.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book was great but regrettably had a sad ending. would definitely recommend it somebody else. makes me wonder what is gonna happen in the next book.
B005XLN97M|4.0|This house is small but packed with features for play. It doesn't take up much space and fits nicely under a window when on the floor. There is no place for dolls or dresses but add a Barbie car and it's all you really need.
B002KVAB5G|3.0|The first phoned it in Stones album.  Still rocks and is better than others working at full throttle.  Always loved Angie and Doo Doo (Heartbreaker).  Liked Star Star and Dancing with Mr. D.  Others tracks were OK, not bad but nothing special.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Such a simple game but hours of play and some really random things. Had a few laughs. Shared with quite a few friends.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|What a great story.  It kept me coming back to read more.  I would suggest this book for anyone that enjoys a quest.
038536315X|5.0|I had been getting increasingly disapointed with grishams books. With sycamore row he delivers the comical characters and fun reading that made me love his books. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Well worth it.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Fantastic mouse!<br /><br />Feels great, the lights are optional, and the buttons are programmable - what else could you want?<br /><br />I got a corded mouse because I don't want the hassle  of buying batteries or the unpredictability of losing mouse control while I'm playing games.  Wish I would've found this mouse a long time ago!  5 stars!
B005LAJ16I|2.0|Series excellent, DVD quality horrible, disc 2 and 3 won't even play, no scratches just doesn't play despite switching devices.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|His voice is great doing bluegrass. He wrote many (8 I think) of the songs. If you like Alan Jackson and bluegrass you will love this.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great story. Couldn't put it down. Read it in just 2 nights. Can't wait to read other books by the same author.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; was, this is one of John Grisham's best books. It keeps you interested throughout and unlike many of his books has a great ending. I highly recommend it.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|Ms. Setterfield has captured a very interesting time in history where secrets can lie hidden behind layers of ignorance.  With the new age of technology this story would be difficult to happen.  She has interwoven the present and past in a shocking story, but in a way of beauty and respect.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|My first book by this author and it won't be my last!  A master story teller, weaving tales that span generations, and continents, his tales so real, his characters so ... human.  I was spellbound and couldn't stop turning the pages!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a really good read that I really enjoyed. I have read it over and over again, and would highly recommend it to anyone.
B008MM9630|4.0|I love the game and am addicted to it. I play all day long. Can't get a enough of it.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Boy one has to believe that Hackett is really having fun with the current success of this project.I saw the opening night of the U.S. segment of this tour and it was jaw dropping good!(standing ovations after every song)This 5 disc set is a real bargain.The DVDs picture is \\"good\\" and the sound mix is 5:1(dolby digital);and very good.Highlights for this fan of pre-\\"And Then There Were Three\\"Genesis are,\\"The Musical Box\\",\\"Afterglow\\"(nice job by Wetton)and of course \\"Suppers Ready\\".Theres a fusion like entry to a slightly charged up version of \\"Los Endos\\"also.GREAT!!!Otherwise these songs are pretty much played to the note of the originals.The great part is this is 2013 and they sound FANTASTIC!If you're a fan of these songs ya gotta check this out.
B0073XORCY|3.0|I have always been a huge fan of Ian Anderson whether with Jethro Tull or not.  However, sorry to say, I am disappointed with this album.  Not that it's not beautifully created and produced, it just leaves me kind of uninspired and turning back to everything else that he has recorded before this.  Perhaps I am missing his point and maybe I will learn to love it over time.  But if you love the original TAAB and are hoping for a continuation of the same brilliant, witty and joyful music, you will probably be, like me and many others, disappointed.<br /><br />I still think Ian is one of the most brilliant musical geniuses of our time.  Maybe he's just getting tired.  Hopefully, he'll find some new inspiration in his next work.  Even if he never records a single new piece of music, I'll be quite happy listening to everything else he has ever recorded, over and over.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Makes you think to solve puzzles. I love it! The game gets harder as you go so you never get bored.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and addicting game. Wish there were different ways to accumulate energy and diamonds faster but still have fun playing.
0307278255|4.0|There has already been a plethora of praise heaped on Jhumpa Lahiri's fiction, and rightly so. I suspect that even years from now she will be recognized as the writer who most eloquently depicted the India-to-America immigrant experience. And the stories in her third book, UNACCUSTOMED EARTH, continue to document that phenomenon. Her emigrant characters ring true as fully realized human beings trying their best to make lives in a new and strange culture. And the first generation children of those people are equally challenged, torn between being faithful to the Indian traditions their parents try to instill in them and the desire to become fully American.<br /><br />My only problem with this book - and I should emphasize that it is MY problem - is that the characters from the eight stories herein began to run together and I found myself paging back and forth trying to figure out if I'd seen this character in a previous piece. And indeed, in the second part of the book, the viewpoints do shift between Hema and Kaushik, whose paths in life intersect periodically. I think perhaps the obvious answer to MY problem would have been to simply slow down and take some timeouts between stories. Which posed another problem: I couldn't wait to see what the next story would bring.<br /><br />But what the hell. Lahiri is simply a story teller of the first order, i.e. damn good. I'm looking forward now to reading her first book of stories, the one that got her the Pulitzer, and also the new novel, THE LOWLAND. This book? Highly recommended. (four and a half stars)<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I’m not a book critic. I’m a reader. I read because I like to be entertained. A book is real good if it grabs me from the start. This one did.<br /><br />Wool is a great story and was easy to read. I read the Wool series in a matter of days. The story flows well and doesn’t leave too many questions unanswered. The concept of the story was very interesting/intriguing. There were some good twists/surprises.  I liked the characters and felt I understood them. There was just the right amount of description. I’m not big on a page and a half describing the door handle.<br /><br />Again, I’m just a reader, not a critic.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Absolutely love this game, super fun! Can't seem to put it down, good bonuses. Wish there was more pictures to explore though, so I can complete more of the awards.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Thought this would be great based on reviews.  Down side, this isn't made for kindle fire 1st edition.  It randomly shuts the game down and when you try to reopen it, it won't.  I've tried reloading, but no luck.  what I have managed to play is good.  There should be some kind of message somewhere letting 1st edition kindle users know that this isn't going to work for them. :(
B00992CF6W|4.0|I`m on xbox live and play minecraft Xbox edition and play pc and all that biz , but it's still really good for traveling and stuff and is one of the most game-like app that I have ever seen. It is fun to play sometimes. I like it.
0553801473|5.0|A really great read. The author really spins a great story. Hard to stop reading it. Recommend it and all the other books in this series.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love this product and for the price it's perfect. Allows you access to your YouTube account among other things and brings it to your tv. If your tv is not capable of viewing YouTube already, then this is a great little device for the price. Only downside I find is that A) the unit runs very hot, and B) you cannot turn it off other than by unplugging it. I did check into the heat issue, and it seems to be normal and so far I have had no issues leaving mine plugged in all the time. I think it's safe, but wow does it seem hot for such a little device. If you don't have a smart tv with these features, then this is a very cheap option to bring these features to your tv.
B004Q9T4E4|3.0|Would recommend this book for first time readers of the genre.<br />Personally, I prefer an author who is far more objective in his assessment of history. For more serious readers, Simon Schama is probably a much better historian, both in terms of depth and in terms of being detached and impartial to the subject.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I  downloaded  this for my three and a half year old bc  she likes my little pony  and there were really no other apps  that looked appealing  but this isn't for her. I  gave it  one star bc  the graphics and sound are good but  it is better I think for an older child.  plus it takes a while to download each time she wants to play with it.  I'm probably going to uninstall it.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Both of the new Star Trek's are incredible. Quinto and Pine redefine Spock and Kirk and breathe new life into this decades old franchise. I expect I'll end up watching this 4, maybe 5 times, in the coming years and enjoy it immensely each time.
B00E5C3AJM|3.0|Star girl is an OK game, its free so what do you expect?<br />Pros: graphics are good, nice clothes to dress up in, nice quality<br />Cons: same old star girl, clothes are too expensive and star chat only works with phones, game repeats its self,  slow, minigames are not very fun.<br />Thats my take on this game, to me it gets boring very easily. My opinion.<br />Keepin you up with the games<br />~Br@nd&iexcl;Lynn
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|Not Will Smith's finest movie but I enjoyed it enough that I'm glad we got the disc. Jaden Smith is promising as an actor but he wasn't quite strong enough to hold the movie for the entire duration.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I need to add up my amount of money I need for my school book fair and I immediately got on my kindle and opened this app.it only took me about a minute.this app I'd AWESOME!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Makes you think outside the box. It is a pretty great game. I pull this game out whenever I am bored, it entertains me pretty quickly.
B0073COMUW|5.0|I have tried dozens of different LED bulbs varying in wattage, cost, light type, and this in my opinion is the best in trade off between wattage (10w), brightness (daylight), and cost ($9.99). You do have to be a fan of daylight white light to like this bulb as the light it provides is pretty bright. I purchased dozens of these and replaced every light in my house. My previous LED bulbs often made rooms look like they were lit by candle light. These make it seem like it is the middle of the day even at night. Most of the lights in my house are can housings, either recessed ceiling fixtures or track lighting. Thus these directional lights work fine for those applications. But even in table lamps they can work well as the bright light shines up and bounces off the ceiling providing indirect lighting. Out of the dozens I've purchased, I've only had 2 go bad and they each went bad in the first week. All the others have been in operation for months now and are still going strong!
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I fell in love with the single of Reflektor long before the album came out. The album is very different from the single. It took a few listens to get past that but now it has burrowed into my subconscious and become impossible to resist. No surprise since all their albums seem to do that. Excellent and progressive work.
B0094M2X6Y|4.0|This movie was much better than you would think.  It is close to the original book by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but not a direct transfer.  I have read accounts of how badly the production of the movie was botched by Disney, especially the marketing of the film and how they chose to open the film against stiff competition.  This film can stand on its own and is a very enjoyable ride.  Action, love, fights...everything is there.  Take a chance!
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|I didn't even know when this album was going to be release but after hearing Berzerk I was excited. I really wanted to love this album but in the end I didn't.  For some reason it just doesn't work for me. Em's flow is there but his lyrics are not. By no means am I saying he's  not trying on this album but what he attempts to do is more nostalgia driven than anything. I wish he would have came with something of a mix between Recovery and Hell: The Sequel.

159514188X|5.0|In my eyes, this is one of the best contemporary YA novels ever written--even better than a few of John Green's books.<br /><br />The story was so profound, and revolved around a topic not often discussed in YA literature: suicide. More specifically, the events that drove a girl to commit suicide, as recited by the girl over a series of audio cassettes the day before she swallows the pills.<br /><br />I will say that you will appreciate this book only if you want to hear its message. Anyone who doesn't care about the things they say or do probably won't be affected at all. If you genuinely care--in all regards--about the way you treat other people, this book is going to make you rethink everything you ever say and do to other people ever again. There were some tear-worthy moments, and even some moments where you felt utter pride...yet a huge sense of loss. Every chapter holds a secret that you will find yourself craving to have answered.<br /><br />There are a few adult topics discussed after the halfway mark, but these don't go into detail. But they add such profound meaning to Hannah Baker's ultimate decision, because she drove herself crazy knowing she witnessed--and was a victim of--some of these events, yet did nothing to stop them.<br /><br />\\"13 Reasons Why\\" connects the dots flawlessly. You see every connection throughout the story, you understand how Hannah felt, you understand how Clay Jensen (the main character) feels as he listens to these tapes. The stories feel real. This book will break your heart. I'm honest when I say: this book will change your life.

B008PZZUTS|5.0|At the first part of the movie, I though it was kinda draggy of the plot but as time has progressed it turned out to be very good. We all know that Robert is starting to show his age in movies but he came through with his self witted an it planned out perfect.this movie is worth watching
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun BUT over a year to complete a room is really a stretch! I even bought some credits. Everyone does not have time nor want to play with friends on Facebook. Make it easier for solitary play and advancement!

B00FWB6ZBA|5.0|As a fan of early/mid Genesis who saw the concert tours of Lamb Lies Down, Trick of the Tail, Wind and Wuthering, and And Then There Were Three, as well as Peter Gabriel's first four solo tours, all I can say is that this is a totally awesome re-creation (re-visitation?) of the best period of Genesis. While some fans may vote for the Lamb as the pinnacle due to Gabriel's incredible show, the Wind and Wuthering tour was a particularly moving concert that really highlighted Steve Hackett, and rivaled the best Yes/Jethro Tull/ELP concerts of the era. Check out the Second's Out album and you might agree, despite Phill Collins substitution for Gabriel - Supper's Ready will surprise you particularly. While I am not necessarily a fan of revisiting old material, and only a middling fan of Hackett's solo material since Voyage of the Acolyte (too much seems derivative), this live concert captures the flavor of this era of Genesis far better than I could ever have expected, and dare I say it even improves on it in places! Hackett's guitar work is amazing as I anticipated, but more than that the supporting band just knocked my socks off! The rhythm section is surprisingly compelling, and the rest of the instrumentals in general are extremely faithful to the original Rutherford/Banks/Hackett/Collins originals, but with tasteful and appropriate live embellishments. And Nad Sylvans vocals really capture the feel of Peter Gabriel, even better than Phil Collins ever did, with just that right bit of extra bite (plus he can hit high notes that Peter and Phil both abandoned years ago). There are a few songs I'm not crazy about (Los Endos is a little too bluesy for me, and Eleventh Earl a little bit too pop), but these are minor complaints compared to the overall stellar performance of the band. This is an absolute MUST for any fan of pre-pop Genesis who wants to hear a live rendition of the songs we grew to love back in the '70's, and highly recommended for anyone interested in listening to what can occur in rock music when the boundaries of a dance-beat are removed!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Enchanting novel showcases the full scope of Gilbert's talent. The kind of story you can't wait to get back to (assuming you don't finish it in one sitting!)  Highly recommended.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Brilliant product. I managed to take advantage of the short period Amazon was dispatching the Chromecast internationally as it is not officially available in the UK yet. Simple to set up and use, and I just needed to download the Chromecast Android app apk to get it all working. Enjoying watching YouTube in HD and making good use of my free month of Netflix. YouTube has frozen a couple of times or taken a while to load a video, but not enough for me to have an issue with it.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I loved this book, I loved the characters and the relationship they formed because it wasn't typical it was different. It also has a lot of historical references which usually I don't care for but felt it worked really well in this book.
B0053F042G|5.0|Excellent Science Fiction at its best.  If I write anything more, I will give away an excellent plot; but the coding for this preview insists on more words.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved everything about this book, it had me crying like a baby at the end and it was an end I wan't prepared for. It makes you face a new way of thinking and living (as someone whose dying) and it really just pulls you in.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I had seen some reviews prior to reading the book but avoided spoilers.  I expected that the fanatics were very angry because they didn't like the ending, and I admit my own prejudices regarding the “novella” releases feeling that the author had sort of lost her way when the movie deal happened.  So the beginning of the book was a struggle because I was looking for the issues and decline.<br /><br />First, there is no quick recap of where we were in the story.  I’m sorry, it had been 4 months since I read book 2 (the novellas don’t count because they were not related to the plot at the end of book 2).  I've read many books between and since I’m not a Divergent fanatic, I would have appreciated a short refresher.  Next biggest issue was the changing point of view between Tris and Tobias.  The chapter’s listed whose point of view we were reading but isn't that an indication of the problem with this format?  Even with this notation, I’d sometimes page back to check because it was hard to know whose voice I was reading.<br /><br />Spoiler alert starts here…<br /><br />I assume that the author used the changing point of views because of the ending but maybe writing in the third person would have been a better solution.  The first two books were written from Tris’ point of view and some novellas were from Tobias’ point of view, but the combination was confusing in the third book.  I didn't like that Tobias was weak throughout this book.  He wasn't the reluctant leader we were used to, but more a lost soul.  I don’t know if it was a device because he was out of his element and environment or not.  I didn't like that his mother became a crying brooding mess when she had been so brutally strong, and that she gave in without a blink of an eye.  And like other reviewers, it would have been nice to better understand exactly why Tris was immune to all the serums and more about her being gene purified.<br /><br />The short chapters made the pace of the book move along quickly for me.  And I suddenly realized that I was getting into the story for the first time in all the books and didn't want to put the book down.  I had forgotten about the bad reviews and my opinion of the novellas.  The very very very short chapters for Tobias at the end helped express his emotional crisis poignantly.  The fanatics may not have liked it but I thought Tobias’ reactions were very emotional and the final zip line trip well written.  There was some preachiness at the end that I could have done without but it wasn't over the top.<br /><br />If you’re a fanatic, you won’t be happy to lose a loved character and feel that there was no retribution.  I debated between 3 and 4 stars and decided to go with 4 because I liked this book better than the first two.  I like happy endings in fiction, but I know they can’t always turn out that way.  This series doesn't end with a ribbon, but it was satisfactorily written to me.<br /><br />Format: Borrowed eBookmove along quickly for me.

B0001US62I|4.0|Deeping disturbing movie but, I love New Orleans and found the &#34;evil&#34; in this movie highly believable.  Mickey Rourke does a great job.  Make sure you watch the extras on this movie.  Very informative about misconceptions of Voodoo and other beliefs.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it, it was amazing! I just can't it was ASDFGHJKL if you have never read this book do it now. It's so sad yet happy and it's very hard to under stand so I would just read it because it is AMAZING
B00DSO9RMC|3.0|Little disappointing. It has a few typical Pratchett touches and some really nice set pieces but it's one of weaker books. The major themes (racism, sexism, religious intolerance) are played too obviously, there is no subtlety there used to be in his earlier books. The main protagonists, with one exception!, are getting less and less complex and instead they are getting more one-dimensional. The main, the only exception, is the Patrician who is shown as a very complex person - an understanding tyrant, enlightened tsar. Moist is now almost a caricature of himself, the new characters are bland and the goblins seem too good to be true. I think that Pratchett is &#34;modernising&#34; the Discworld way to far, his books used to be like a distorting mirror held to our reality but now they are becoming to literal in lampooning our own world. It's still a fun read but doesn't hold a wonder of many of his earlier books. It's just, hhmm, too preachy. Score.. hmm.. 3.5 out of 5.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I first read this in the early 90s, and it's lost none of the magic. Even knowing what was happening I couldn't help but feel sorry for the way he was treated all over again. Glad I reread it before seeing the movie, and I'll carry on with the other books as well.

B00G70WLJA|5.0|Like Origins, we get to see Logan as he truly is: a conflicted outcast freak. Hugh Jackman owns this character. He could play this role until the wheels fall off, or until his knees give out or he needs a hip replacement. The only other actor who can outshine Jackman in a comic book movie is Heath Ledger, and he is pushing up daisies.<br /><br />Where The Wolverine trumps Origins is through the backstory. Here, the movie starts off with Logan at the full peak of his powers. He is a drifter, lone-wolf, shambling through WWII Japan. And then the bomb hits. Logan saves a Japanese soldier from Seppuku, then rushes him to safety. The soldier will not meet Logan again until he is on his death bed. The contrast between grizzly mountain man and ruthless formality of the Yakuza underworld is what makes this movie so special. There are scenes were long conversations take place in Japanese, which is unheard of from a big-budget American blockbuster of this type. The body count is pretty damn high. I watched the PG-13 theatrical cut and was surprised it wasn't slapped with a hard R.<br /><br />The two main enemies Logan encounters are Viper and Silver Samurai. Both are formidable, and both were well-casted and played by their respective actors. This is a classic chase movie overall. Expect lots of explosions, heavy gun fights, and Yakuza in full body-suits. The Wolverine is consistent from start to finish, and doesn't slow down much. Other reviewers have pointed out that the beginning is slow, but I disagree. This allowed the director some time to flesh out the characters. Here's to hoping the 3rd tops the trilogy!

B00BT70J7M|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann has become the \\"go to\\" tenor for anguished romantics and light Wagner.  His Werther, Faust, Don Jose and Cavaradossi are superb and his Siegmund, Parsival and Lohengrin are considered top of the line.  Now he is taking on Verdi.  I was doubtful at first whether he had the right sort of voice to credibly handle Verdi--for Kaufmann is a cool, controlled singer--and many of the great Verdi tenor performances sound as if the tenor is just this side of going off the rails.  I was very pleasantly surprised--in these cuts, Kaufmann sings with a level of intensity and melodrama that makes him very convincing doing Verdi.<br /><br />His dark timbre is a bit of a surprise, especially in the opening track of La Donna e Mobile from Rigoletto, but it works.  He nails the high Cs there and in other selections with a greater ease than many tenors with lighter voices.  Listening to the two selections from Otello makes one long for the day when he will add that role to his repertoire.  He was singing with the intensity of any of the great Otellos of the past, and reminded me of my personal favorite interpreter, the late Ramon Vinay.  I found myself really enjoying  listening to his interpretations and hoping he starts doing more Verdi on state. (He's already done a couple of highly acclaimed Don Carlos.)

B00A285OOW|3.0|The War of the Roses is finally over (or as Gregory calls it, the Cousin’s War) and Henry VII has been crowned and he has taken Elizabeth of York as his wife. As Gregory splendidly shows, his reign is anything but stable. He is not loved by the people and he does not have the charm to win them over.<br /><br />Elizabeth of York is the focus of The White Princess. She was the eldest daughter of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. Her brothers were the missing Princes in the Tower. Elizabeth now has to learn to love Henry VII even though her heart still belongs to the deceased Richard III, her uncle. She never truly measures up in her husband’s eyes even though she does show him sympathy and tries to be a dutiful wife. But since she was constantly left out of the plans that her husband and his mother schemed together, she never had a chance.<br /><br />Normally Gregory portrays her main characters as strong-willed and able to manipulate their future. Elizabeth is not this type of character. She was weak and I personally found her none too smart. She allowed herself to be manipulated instead of taking control of her own destiny. You would think with a husband that was obviously a mama’s boy and paranoid that she could have had a chance of becoming more. She was definitely overshadowed by her mother-in-law, Lady Margaret Beaufort.<br /><br />Philippa Gregory of course takes her own liberties with history which provides for an entertaining historical fiction read. There were times that the book seemed drag on without getting to the point but all in all it ended up being a typical Gregory novel. You don’t have to read this entire series in order but it does help to keep the timeline straight.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version narrated by Bianca Amato who did an exceptional job. Her tone of voice captured the characters well and I would listen to another audio narrated by her.
1932907009|1.0|Piece of crap. The most simplistic nonsense I've ever read. If you see the two awful movies this guy wrote, you'd understand he doesn't have a clue as to what makes a screenplay work. This book is just a stack of nonsense scribbled by a hack of the worst order, which appeals to the inexperienced because he makes screenwriting sound so simple. Stay away from this awful book if you have talent.
B007VPLNGW|4.0|We love this game but it is not available on the new Kindle Fire HD.  It is only available on the older versions.  My son wants it on his new Kindle. When will it be available for the new device.<br /><br />thank you
B00065MDS6|5.0|Just listened to this a couple nights ago. Great recording, great copy. Drums and base are tight, clear, clarinets and sax sound smooth and musical. For those who have never heard this album, and love jazz fusion, get this, because it is awesome.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is another gripping story from my favorite author. It was hard to put down. I tried to pace myself, but it was compelling. A sequel, yes, but a terrific stand alone novel. I never review books...that should tell you something. Enjoy!
B00BPA2PDY|3.0|I'm disappointed in this print. The quality is okay, but the disk does not contain any ancillary material. No interviews, no documentary on the making of, or conversations with the cast or director. It's just a print of the film, nothing else. While the print is fine (I don't have a 4k monitor, but wanted the best print I could get, I did expect, for this price, for the disk to include those special features that justify this kind of expense. I would not recommend this version, but the other anniversary editions which include the special features. Also, this is so cleaned up, it takes the grittiness out of the print, and hurts some of the character of the film. New York is supposed to look dirty in this film, but I found this print cleaned that up a bit much, and made the colors a little too primal and bright here and there, dampening some of the down mood of this film. I'd get a different print than this.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a short and easy to read book that is filled with so much knowledge about the road we are all on, life.  To me it is very reminiscent in style and form to Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.  Coelho has somehow managed to include information about each and everyone's personal life journey in 160 short pages. I feel that my takeaway from this book will be very different than the next readers, and the next and so on.  In the end though, we all learn that anything is possible but our way to that will all be very different.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Plex is an outstanding solution for people looking to host their own media server with access available to other networked devices in their homes.  I use it to stream movies to smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles. This app allows me to do the same with my Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  There are a few things to note about using the Plex media server, however.<br /><br />1 - your server needs to be powerful enough to handle the streaming load, ie to transfer the video and convert it on the fly to a media type your devices can handle.  A lot of people complaining about Plex don't realize that streaming/converting a large .mkv file on the fly to devices that support .mp4 playback is intensive for most machines.  I run an i7 with 8 gbs of ram and it can get bogged down if I'm streaming to more than 1 device. I spend time converting all my files to HD .mp4 android standard.  This makes streaming a breeze to multiple sources at the same time.<br />2 - your network needs to be stable and fast...If you plex server is connected via wifi, you will likely experience delays in streaming when converting formats.  I run a gigabit wireless router and, again, can experience hicccups. When I connect the server directly (rj-45) rather than via wifi, the hiccups disappear.<br /><br />If you take care of these two things, I think many will find that the Plex services improve exponentially.  As for this app, the Kindle store version is good, but not as up to date as the Google Play version.  For example, I have purchased a new Kindle HDX 8.9\\" and it's still not compatible with this app on the Kindle app store.  However, I know the Plex app is fine on large tablets because I run the same version on my older Asus Transformer. It's this kind of inconsistency that bogs down the Kindle app store.  It's excellent to have a safer store that is curated, but restrictions like this are a PITA for those of us who don't need the kiddy gloves on all the time.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Plex app and media server are amazing.  If you want to use it, I suggest getting it from the google play store if you can.a server are amazing.  If you want to use it, I suggest getting it from the google play store if you can.
141694737X|5.0|We love this book for many reasons.  I got it when my son was about 12 months. The first thing I noticed was how each page has a different angle to open the cage to see what is inside, which helped SO MUCH with fine motor skills.  You really have to get the tip of your finger or finger nail in to open the flap.  It is not hard, just takes practice, and my son loves it!  The animals are great, and the story is very cute.

This book is well written and thought out. I love the way the characters interact with each other and everything seems very real. However, this book does have a very sad ending. Ever after you are done reading it, this book will leave you feeling haunted by it.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Very well written with historical value.  Author did much research before writing this novel.<br />Do believe after reading this, young and old would be more appreciative of their past and their present.  Many lessons to be learned in the lives of these forgotten children. This should be a MUST for all high school reading.  Loved, loved the writing, the lessons learned.  I will read more of Christina Baker Kline novels.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Awesome game good graphics. Items cost to much. Not enough energy to last, always have to wait. All in all good game.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This feels like Christmas! It's a story of hope, inspiration, goodness, miracles, and keeping the childlike innocence alive. It's a fabulous story for kids of all ages.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book will revolutionize your understanding of what drives your cravings and how to regain control.  Simple fact:  insulin drives appetite and carbohydrates drive insulin.  I don't crave carbs at all when I eliminate them from my diet.  Most important of all:  I had no idea how much science supports the low/no carb approach, and that it isn't harmful to my health.  Must read for anyone at the end of their rope with \\"diets\\" and conventional wisdom.
B00F4386PY|3.0|I bought this on its release date, as I do with every new release they put out. Now that I've fully digested it I feel I should write a review. I consider Backspacer Pearl Jams only album not to get. It's poppiness and straight ahead rock jams are not Pearl Jams more mature sound that we all heard with other albums. Yet I still slap this on once in a while, and appreciate a few songs, hear Eddies always passionate voice, and their great sound as musicians.<br /><br />Key Tracks<br /><br />- The Fixer<br />- Just Breath<br />- Amongst The Wave<br />- Got Some
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great addition for a TV without SMART-features. Configuring is easy and once installed you can fully manage it with your smartphone or a PC using Google Chrome.<br /><br />Also the quality of the received streams is high.<br /><br />Just hoping for more applications to support the Chromecast.
B005LAJ1PE|1.0|This USED copy arrived with a sticky cover, tried to disinfect it and clean all three disks. Arranged out-of-order and the third disk had so MANY scratches that the last (and important) episode  stumbled, stopped, missed then re-loaded. I tried a scratch remover, don't know if it helped,  and  was SHOCKED  to pay a high price for this damaged I title. This mess was the first from  Amazon (- never had this problem before as a  used  copy) and the owner should have given away this mess (to the trash)!
B00FGGD9PG|5.0|I just bought the book and read it to my daughter at bedtime. She loved it! Very nice message .
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My absolute favorite Facebook game, and I haven't been able to be on a computer, so for it to come out on the kindle is a dream come true! And I really love this version...a step up so far!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraria is the best game on the Appstore right now. It's similar to Minecraft, but more of an RPG. Tons of content. And still being updated!!!!! Great quality buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is such a good game you have multiplayer ,single player ,and its challenging!and it has seeds well,you can get seeds. Like, jhonny golden Apple or zombie attack. It's so awesome!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this in 2013.  I still have this.  It is still my favorite pack to go to on my movie nights/binge weekends.  It even has scenes that are cut out when these are shown on tv.<br /><br />Right after I got this, I spent an entire month in Harry Potter land.  Every day after work, and on the weekends, I would play all of the movies over and over again, start to finish.  I even bought a variety of candy to go along with the initial train ride to Hogwarts.<br /><br />Many years ago, I was given the first 4 books as a birthday present.  At first I didn't think I was going to like them, but apparently my parents know me much better than I do in some areas.  They were absolutely right to get me those books because even though I was 25 years old at the time, they became some of my favorite books ever.  I wanted to have all of the movies so I could lose myself in the make believe world, and now I have them.<br /><br />The quality is fantastic, as mentioned they show scenes you may not have seen, they are still in excellent condition, no skips, no scratches...if you're a huge Harry Potter fan, and you want to get away from the real world for awhile, you cannot go wrong purchasing this set.
0515142247|5.0|Lovely great item. Exciting.  Good value

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book!! I loved everything besides the ending.. I was not looking for it to end like that.. can't wait to start the second book!!
1593272200|5.0|What an incredible resource for the Linux community!<br /><br />I'm an Oracle DBA, that has always been interested in the lower-level stuff (I/O, system calls, etc.).  I was researching Oracle ASM (Oracle's own volume manager), but feeling the need to get more insight into the Linux I/O subsystem.  So, I went to Amazon, started searching for relevant resources, and came across this book.<br /><br />I've bought thousands of dollars of technical books on Amazon, and read lots of Amazon reviews.<br />When I bought this book, it had 61 reviews.  60 rated the book a 5 star, and 1 rated the book a 4-star.<br />I have *never* seen a book rated so highly on Amazon before. A book, with incredible ratings like that, was simply unheard of.<br /><br />I'm now reading the book, and thoroughly enjoying the care, the attention to detail, the comprehensiveness, the technical accuracy, the methodology, the extremely well-written English, the clear explanations, and the well-written code.<br /><br />For example, on page 246, where Michael discusses Direct I/O, he says:<br /><br />\\"If a file is opened with O_DIRECT by one process, and opened normally (i.e. so that the buffer cache is used) by another process, then there is no coherency between the contents of the buffer cache and the data read or written via direct I/O.  Such scenarios should be avoided.\\"<br /><br />Wow. In just one sentence, Michael tells us one of the fundamental issues with concurrent I/O, and that by simultaneously using different I/O mechanisms, you can corrupt your files.<br /><br />Another example: on page 249, Michael writes:<br /><br />\\"When using the stdio library functions in conjunction with I/O system calls to perform I/O on disk files, we must keep buffering issues in mind.  I/O system calls transfer data directly to the kernel buffer cache, while the stdio library waits until the stream's user-space buffer is full before calling write() to transfer the buffer to the kernel buffer cache.\\"<br /><br />Wow. It makes sense, when you know as much about the Linux kernel as Michael does.  Need to insert an fflush() between the stdio write and the system call write.  Another \\"Aha!\\" moment, just a couple of pages later.  And the pages in between had one of the clearest examples of code for Direct I/O that I have ever seen.  Michael even writes about the memory alignment challenges of Direct I/O.<br /><br />It's simply incredible!  How in the world could anyone write so much high-quality technical stuff?  It's 1500+ pages of awe inspiring, amazing technical blessing.  It is a fabulous example to everyone in the I.T. industry, and a very high bar for any technical books to come.<br /><br />Thank you, Michael, for your incredible book.It makes sense, when you know as much about the Linux kernel as Michael does.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great puzzle game with amazing graphics. You will want to continually use the eye tool since some of the puzzles will not be visible without it. Also pay attention to every detail as you look at the boxes.<br /><br />My only concern is that the game is very short. I hope there will be more updates. I highly recommend this game.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I love legos and I love Back to the future movies, so... this is the best thing I can have :D
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Things excel slowly in the game and money isn't dished out as need for it rises  I stopped playing the game for a long time didn't even know it had an update. Hopefully it will do justice.. until now
B000UEYT8A|5.0|Large enough to actually use.  The soft cover makes it ideal for paging through and playing.  The &#34;keys&#34; are out of whack in all editions that I have looked through.  Don't even mess with the more current hard cover.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Not all characters are covered in this book, but the stories are all needed. May not have been my favorite characters but its setting it up for the dance of dragons.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzl Washington is always an exceelent actor, an always worht seeing. He becomes his part, making it very real.  It showed what is happening with the airline industry.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Wonderful &amp; exciting game, the graphics are good &amp; the plot takes time to understand but very enjoyable to play with. My advice, keep an eye on your watch or time will really fly by you.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Not as good as I was expecting.  tom Cruise is verytalented, but this was not one of his best movies.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|When I first got this game, I knew that I wouldn't like it.  Turns out I was right.  I didn't like it.  I LOVED IT!  This game is the best!  You can feed and care for guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and more if you buy the dogs, horses, birds, snakes, and cats.  PLEASE get this game if you're an animal lover.  You won't be disappointed.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I always enjoy watching Robert Downey Jr. on screen.  He is a very talented actor.  He becomes his part.  He has found his home in this, and Sherlock Holmes.
0143058525|3.0|I think this book is terribly over-rated.  I bought is for a car trip and thought it would never end.....  The book, not the trip, that is.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Very real, and possible, for our future.  I enjoyed the action, as well as the computerization.  This is a movie we all should see.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This war gun app is so cool plus it updates a lot and the guns are so amazing with good graphic too.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Excellent movie.  The key stars became the parts, rather than acting them.  It was frighteningly real.  My wife, and I enjoyed it completely.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|First a disclaimer.  I have every DT studio CD and I am a fan because they are reliably interesting and ambitious in their music.  My expectations are high.  My rating of 4 leaves room for DT work I like better.  I probably wouldn't go less than 3 on any DT CD I have.  There are a few songs on almost every DT CD that I would rate as a 6 or more if I could because they are remarkable, sometimes breathtaking.<br /><br />Maybe I need to listen a few more times until one or two songs strikes me with that quality on this one.  Right now I don't have a sense that any song on the new &#34;DT&#34; is remarkable or breathtaking.  I think the sound is more pulled together than Dramatic Turn, which may have struggled with Mangini settling in.  But the new CD is still less exciting and memorable to me than a lot of DT work of 10-20 years ago.<br /><br />To calibrate my opinions for others, I must say I am very selective of metal and prog.  To me, these genres are high-risk, high-reward in the sense that they make possible both really cool music and really bad music.  I don't like metal that growls and shreds, or &#34;prog&#34; that is just weird for the sake of weirdness.  DT has always found a balance in &#34;prog metal&#34; that has a metal-influenced intensity with high creativity, virtuoso musicianship, and strong melodic content.  For fans of the genre looking for this balance, this album is another good effort.  I give DT a lot of credit for not selling out and becoming &#34;pop&#34; as many bands do after an innovative start.  Once in a while I do wonder if they could take more risk but instead talk themselves out of it.<br /><br />&#34;Along for the ride&#34; seems like a song meant to try for radio time.  It is &#34;nice&#34;, but not exciting.  It reminds me of their hit &#34;Pull Me Under&#34; (not in how it sounds, but in the sense of radio-freindliness), which to me is among DT's least interesting work, while others love it.  I prefer Octavarium and don't expect itto get on the radio.<br /><br />Illumination theory is probably the most interesting and complex song, and is quite good.  It has a few very cool, hard-edge riffs at times (and we hear the bass), and it evolves in an interesting way, with some cool solos and good vocals.  Someone said they liked the orchestral interlude.  To me it was a bit odd and the only small flaw in this song. It seemed a bit ordinary compared to the rest of the song or compared to similar intriguing uses of classical sounds as an interlude in a rock song (think of the piano in Yes' &#34;South Side of the Sky&#34;).  I understand the soft interludes between intense sections that allow the listener to follow a transforming experience, but it seemed too long and disconnected from the rest of the song.  Oh well.<br /><br />A few other minor dislikes occur to me.  I think there is over-use of &#34;sort of Irish folk sounding&#34; instrumental melodies (usually keyboards that border on sounding like a flute) that they overlay on a heavier base.  I do like contrasting and changing styles within one song, but it also brings a risk that it sounds contrived or incohesive.  When keyboards come into hard rock, my preference is a bit more of the intense church organ sound (Yes, Boston) or many cool DT keyboard jams over the years.<br /><br />Finally, I find that sometimes the vocals seem mismatched to the hard-edged instrumental intensity.  Again, I am glad there is no growling, but it seems that James would prefer to sing ballads and he overtly tries to sound edgier in heavier songs.  Don't get me wrong; some of my favorite DT songs like Voices have a beautiful and remarkable interplay of heavy and light moments.  Maybe those are just moments of genius we can't expect to happen again and again.  There are times in this newer CD (and Dramatic Turn) when the vocal melodies seem to be too slow and smooth, lacking modulations or inflections that can be interesting as they were in Voices.  Great vocals in Illumination Theory seem to be the strongest exception to this complaint.<br /><br />These two little gripes seem to happen the most in &#34;The Enemy Inside&#34; and &#34;The Bigger Picture&#34;.  They're still pretty good songs.  Overall there is a lot of great music on this CD that continues to offer what I want most from DT; to escape the boredom of 95% of radio.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|It gave Will Smith an opportunity to show off his son.  the interaction was priceless.  I enjoyed it because of that.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|This is a great family movie! Old and young will enjoy it. I love that the movie comes with a little stuffed guy!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Bruce Willis, is always a good character to watch, on screen.  He is very believable, and real.  He becomes his part, always
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is  so addicting. I love it also it is so easy 4 all ages its like if i was2 this would tbe my favorite game
B00CFA225Y|3.0|It was good, but not great.  I didn't think it was done as good as it could have been.  It was worth seeing, however.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|With the new update 4.3, I have found this app to be terrible. There is a lag in between sending a text/message and writing a new one. Also sometimes the keyboard freezes up and letter suddenly just appear at once. Please fix it!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|It was interesting to watch a full movie with James Franco.  I found him to be ver talented.  This is worth seeing.  the computerization was fantastic.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally on the kindle fire. Very very very addictive. This is my girl friends kindle and now I can't put it down for her to use. Perfect!
B00B769XB8|5.0|This was very real.  I enjoyed the action, and the story line.  It was very believable, and worth seeing.  Action packed.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Broke my heart, but I am in love. :'( I think the storyline is great, pretty clean (there is just one slightly questionable scene), and written amazingly. Beautiful book. Beautiful author. Loved every minute of it. :'( WARNING:IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY!!!!!!!!!!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I alwasys enjoy watching Tom Cruise, on screen, because he is very real, and does his own stunts.  His talen is boundless.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  People are angry because Mark Darcy is dead.  But if he were alive then the book just wouldn't have been as funny.  She needed to be single for these hijinks to occur.  Plus, her emotion was palpable.<br /><br />She has grown up but she is still silly and very Bridget.  As someone who was always kind of silly in a similar fashion, I imagine I will always probably be this way. But it still works and she is a good mom and a great read.<br /><br />I liked this better than, &#34;Edge of Reason&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing, plenty of updates, lots of endless fun, pretty accurate movie villains and the unicorns is awesome
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|After Earth(released May/13)stars,among others,Jaden Smith as Kitai Raige,Will Smith as Cypher Raige,Sophie Okonedo as Faia Raige and Zoë Kravitz as Senshi Raige.This is quite a decent Sci-Fi tale,that I didn't think was going to do it for me,with the pairing of Will and his son.But lo and behold Will's son Jaden comes through and actually turns in a respectable performance.<br />The story finds father Will as a General in the army of the future,Rangers to be exact.The Earth is unlivable for humans and they have vacated it for other environs 1,000 years before.To top this their new home Nova Prime has been invaded by alien creatures who use their &#34;dogs&#34;,called Ursas,to hunt humans and kill them.An Ursa is blind and hunts by smell.To stop over producing pheromones which the Ursas can detect,the Rangers try to learn a technique to suppress all emotion called &#34;ghosting&#34;.<br />Jaden is haunted by the memories of his sister being killed by an Ursa.She died as he watched.Now his father is returning home on his birthday and he has failed to become a Ranger.It is a tense reunion and Will decides(with a bug in his ear from his wife)to take his son with him on a simple mission to take a captured Ursa to another planet for training purposes.Will tells his wife that this is his last mission and he wants to retire and work with her when he returns.Along the way their ship gets caught in a meteorite storm and they are forced down on a restricted planet.The planet is old Earth.Their scanners and warning systems tell them that everything there is deadly.Will is hurt in the crash and his son must travel in a heavier gravity and with a limited air supply to the tail section located about 60 miles away.The reason is that the distress beacon on board has been damaged and the only other one is there.<br />Jaden travels through dense forests,over hills and through rivers.His first problem comes when a pack of baboons try to corral him,then chase him.Then a leech attaches itself to his hand,whose poison almost costs him his life.In his struggles his vital air supply is damaged and he has little if any chance of reaching his goal.Countermanding his fathers orders to turn back,he continues and starts by jumping off a tall cliff.The environmental suit he wears is equipped with limited flying capabilities,similar to a flying squirrel.In his descent his is followed and eventually captured by a huge condor like creature,which takes him to its nest.When he awakens the nest is attacked by large cat like creatures.He manages to fend them off and he descends by rope to the forest floor to resume his travels.However the condor continues to follow him,presumably to recapture him and kill him.<br />Jaden decides to build a raft and take the river downstream.He falls asleep and dreams his dead sister is there talking with him.She tells him to wake up which he eventually does,but everything has turned cold.On his journey he has had to reach geo-thermal spots which don't freeze in order to stay alive at night.Now the cold has started to envelop the area and he is caught short.he continues,desperately looking for shelter by cannot find any.He collapses and lays on the ground ready to die.However some unseen hand drags his body to a depression in the ground and covers him<br />up.The next morning he awakes and extricates himself.It turns out it was the giant condor that saved him,and who died in the cold.It never meant Jaden harm,but probably thought he was one its young.<br />Jaden,just by the skin of his teeth,finally makes the tail section and resupplies himself.However the Ursa the ship was carrying has escaped.The beacon he finds doesn't work,but he soon realizes he must climb up a volcanic mountain nearby in order to reach higher ground.Along the way the Ursa picks his scent up and dogs him all the way.When Jaden finally reaches  summit,the beacon comes on and works.At that moment the Ursa arrives also and throws Jaden down,injuring him badly.At that moment he has an epiphany and he realizes he must suppress all emotions if he is ever going to live.This he does and he defeats the Ursa.The beacon activates and both he and his ailing father get saved and they receive the medical attention they need.In an emotional ending,Will orders his attendants to stand him up.He salutes his son,who can only react by running to him and hugging him.He tells his father he wants to work with his mother too.<br />The movie doesn't have alot of superfluous scenes and Jaden is pretty much on his own throughout most of the film.Once they crash land and Jaden is on his way,Will has to sit things out at the main section and guide his son along,as he is severally injured.The camera cuts from father to son get less and less the longer Jaden is into his destination,eEspecially when the communication between the two is severed.As I mentioned earlier Jaden acquits himself nicely.Though he has alot to learn of the biz yet,he is certainly off to a good start.The S/Fx are very good here and we get a nice slant of what Earth would look like 1000 years+ from now,as nature has taken back what was hers to begin with.The very last shot is the ship flying out over Earth's ocean,which is teaming with whales on or near the surface.And while that environmental element/moral is there,as befits the times we live in,it is not smacking us over the head as some films have done,thank goodness.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include four featurettes.<br />All in all a better film than I thought it would be.This is an M. Night Shyamalan film and is a step up from the past few duds he has helmed.Jaden Smith &#34;brings it&#34; on screen,as Will steps into the background to let the spotlight shine on him.It works for me.3 1/2-4 stars.Recommended.t that moment he has an epiphany and he realizes he must suppress all emotions if he is ever going to live.This he does and he defeats the Ursa.The beacon activates and both he and his ailing father get saved and they receive the medical attention they need.In an emotional ending,Will orders his attendants to stand him up.He salutes his son,who can only react by running to him and hugging him.He tells his father he wants to work with his mother too.<br />The movie doesn't have alot of superfluous scenes and Jaden is pretty much on his own throughout most of the film.Once they crash land and Jaden is on his way,Will has to sit things out at the main section and guide his son along,as he is severally injured.The camera cuts from father to son get less and less the longer Jaden is into his destination,eEspecially when the communication between the two is severed.As I mentioned earlier Jaden acquits himself nicely.Though he has alot to learn of the biz yet,he is certainly off to a good start.The S/Fx are very good here and we get a nice slant of what Earth would look like 1000 years+ from now,as nature has taken back what was hers to begin with.The very last shot is the ship flying out over Earth's ocean,which is teaming with whales on or near the surface.And while that environmental element/moral is there,as befits the times we live in,it is not smacking us over the head as some films have done,thank goodness.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include four featurettes.<br />All in all a better film than I thought it would be.This is an M.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|I am surprised by how much I love The Descendants. It is not really my kind of movie, but there is no denying that it is brilliant. George Clooney is just fantastic. You'll probably be tearing up by the end, but it's worth it. You will not be disappointed if you choose to own this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the best work Stephen King has written since Duma Keys. His continuation of the child Danny from the novel Shinning is fantastic. He led the reader several pages before the reader figured out it was Danny. He introduced others with 'the shinning; including a 20 year old girl who can 'shine' into the villains mind. A lot of the action was in the 'shinning mode'
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Such a great movie. Definitely one of my all time favorites and I was glad to add it to my Blu-ray collections. I hear some people don't like all of the silence, but in my opinion it was just right. I can't imagine how this movie could've been made any better. It is a long movie, so be sure to have some free time because once you hit play you won't be able to look away.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I downloaded this for my son, but I can't stop playing! I am on level 5 hopefully soon the challenges will get a little harder
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I got this set when it went on sale and I am so happy that I got the opportunity to add this to my collection. It's the kind of thing that you probably only want to want every few years, but when the urge strikes you'll be glad that you can pick this up and start watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun and addicting game. It doesn't work well on my phone but it works fine on my Kindle.
B00B5C0YOO|4.0|As few others have already mentioned that the data backup is coming, and as per other featurs llike Easy to use UI and easy sharing without root, I think this deserves more than 2 stars.<br /><br />And I love titanium backup, but it has its own method of storing data and apps making it hard to manage without the app itself. As for me I flash custom ROM a lot and need backup tool to backup my data for a few apps. So I will be waiting for that data backup feature.
0385349947|5.0|Amazing book! Sheryl's authentic and honest voice provides women......and men a new perspective for the thoughts and insecurities that sometime play in our head.

B001JNNDGA|4.0|The visuals are certainly difficult to take in their entirety; whether necessary depends on the viewer. Mel Gibson's point in the film's graphic depiction was to show that Jesus did not simply live and then die. Yes, this seemingly accurate portrayal is quite narrow in scope but the viewer must admit that by the film credits, or even if they are able to see it, The Passion has delivered it's message. Also, Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern deserves an Oscar as Jesus' devotional mother while she holds every ounce of pain and suffering any human soul could bear in her facial expressions.<br />One relevant footnote which occurred in filming the lashing scenes: Jim Caviezel states he nearly passed out when only one of the strands of the whips accidently caught him on unprotected skin.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very good,heady book. I'll never look at a motor coach the same. I'm glad Dan tuned up a nice good man.
B0099114WO|5.0|Funny! Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did a excellent job. I had recommended this movie to a friend, before seeing it myself, after reading a interview with MS and TJ. She has seen it several times, since it came out on TV.
B0013ND30M|4.0|Got it fast. One disk had come out but no sign of issues. It works great and I live it!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Excellent movie. I have always made a point to watch it when it came on TV.  Acting is superb. Henry Fonda a favorite.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's large, so it's easy on the eyes. Easy to use also. Love this app. I highly recommend this app.
B007XNAPX4|5.0|Peter Gabriel is one of my favorite artists, & this is his prime era.  Just buy it.  A little dated, but worth the money.
B0067R0APK|5.0|THANK YOU... I am very pleased with this application. It's the morning wake up call. Once again, thank you.<br /><br />Ronald Sienkiewicz
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Denzel did a great job, and the initial flight and crash sequence should have been in 3-D. Unfortunately the script is padded with the timeworn ex-wife, addiction, and inner struggle cliches that Hollywood often uses. The movie could have been a lot shorter, and if it had focused on the real problems of air travel a bit more (that the airlines shred maintenance and overfly their pilots while underpaying their crews), it would have been a winner.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Just a fun game to pass the time. There is a little good humor that adds to the enjoyment of playing it..
B005DNOAQY|5.0|i am amazed how well this 1972 romantic comedy holds up. i haven't seen it in decades and expected it to be awful. but the comic team of Allen and Keaton were very bright, young and funny. Herbert Ross directed it from woody Allen's play. Ross was well known for romantic movies with strong female leads. essentially Woody Allen is a complete nerd type who is terrible with women.  his best friends are Tony Roberts and Keaton who are a married couple.  as they fix Allen up with one disastrous blind date after another, allen and Keaton fall in love. he as aided along by visitations by the ghost of Bogie.  it is a delight.<br /><br />much comedy is made of Tony Roberts as a business man who is addicted to the phone.  everywhere he goes, he calls his office to leave a series of phone numbers where he will be able to be reached all night.  in 1972 he would have been considered a phone addict.  by today' standards, he is brief and to the point. other people around him rarely use the phone at all so he stands out.  no one would notice him today as he would simply be yet another person who spends most of his day and night on his cell phone.<br /><br />this is an interesting point in Allen's career. he started out writing for other comics and then for other comics on tv shows.  then he moved to doing stand up comedy.  he then wrote plays and movies.  he met Keaton while casting for the play of this film.  she was on Broadway in the cast of HAIR when he auditioned her.  he cast her in this role and they were a comedy team for the next decade. they were romantically involved for only the first few years after they met but stayed together professionally until Allen started using Mia farrow and Keaton went on to star in movies with other directors.  they both had major careers apart which is highly unusual for comedy teams who go their separate ways. they have always remained on good terms though so there was no bitter aspect to breaking up the team.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Being a fan of Dawsons Creek, I have purchased all the dvd releases throughout the last few years... I must say that the best was the (24 Disc Complete Series) which was released in 2009. This version not only contained the original music and edits, it also comes boxed in an album presentation packed with pictures, bio's and a music CD and of course every episode in 24 discs. It is the more expensive version usually going for $80-$100 but worth the money to any fan, it has been discontinued but you can still find it!  I rated this a 5 due to the show being worth a 5 this is not the best dvd release of Dawsons Creek!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best Grisham has written in a while. Thought I knew where it was going but then it surprised me.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Star Trek Season One Remastered, most impressive, it is so important to get the Remastered version, very impressive, if you are a Star Trek Fan you will be impressed.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|The Day After is one of those films that I'd always meant to get round to watching and never did, after re-watching Threads recently I decided to make a new effort to get hold of it. I'm glad I did, this is a very similar film to Threads (although it predates it by a few months) as it covers the same basic events but told from an American rather than British perspective.<br /><br />The film was made in the mid-eighties when the possibility of an all out nuclear war was still a common fear, it follows a more traditional narrative approach compared to Thread's documentary style. Its made for TV roots shows in the production, but don't let that put you off as it is an excellent, if grim film.<br /><br />It takes a while to get going, the build up is slow as you're introduced to the various characters (although they are all based in same region of the US). Besides the setting this is the main difference between the two films, Threads focused on one central character where here the cast is much larger (and there's quite a few known faces making it a fun who's who spotting exercise).<br /><br />Once the action gets going the change is stark, it's not quite as bleak as Threads but it is still a grim sequence of events. The actual nuclear attack is quite well done in a low budget way, but still effective. Only the immediate aftermath of the attack is shown (where Threads stretches further into the future), there is a comment at the end stating that the film probably understimates the impact of an all-out attack, which does drive the point home.<br /><br />For its time this was a very shocking film and while we have different fears these days it still illustrates the potential we have as a species to damage ourselves. It shows its age, but this is stilla fine, if grim film to watch.
B00021R7CG|5.0|Wow this movie is so awesome, just the best ever when it comes to Nucular War movies, never seen one as good as this one, a must to have.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Great family movie , great quality . This movie is a classic  that brings happiness every time out family watches .
B0017VG69U|5.0|Totally awesome and so was the price, quite inexpensive compared to what they were going for just a few years ago. But don't forget to get the Remastered edition it is as if it was produced today.
B00C1BHQXK|3.0|Give useful advice. However, the book does not seem to have much new information; it closely resembles many of the other business management books out there.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Read it, incredible, emotional journey for all. What a story of faith, redemption, love, sadness and joy, and sacrifice. This story is amazing.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|This is a rather short, simple point and click adventure, with nice graphics.  I played on a 2nd Generation Kindle Fire with no problems.  The way you move through the game is a bit different than most; the curved arrows in the upper left-hand corner spin you around 180 degrees instead of backing you out of the scene.  It takes a little getting used to, but navigation really wasn't as tricky as I thought, even for me and I'm somewhat spatially challenged.  The story line is not especially innovative and it's pretty linear.  You will mange to find the inventory you need without too much trouble.  There are a good number of different locations, and a bit of back and forth, as in all games of this type.  It does help to jot down a few notes to help with the puzzles, but nothing too onerous.<br /><br />I found the game easy, and as noted above, short.  So why five stars?  It was an entertaining way to spend a little time in the evening and it was only 99 cents.  I had fun with it, and it's always good to see a new developer, especially one who does not include hidden objects!  Good job, Echo Lake.  I'll be looking for more.
1401938906|5.0|I love this book , is simple, fun to read, and makes totsl sense. It helps to put in practice the concepts we know. And it works. We just need to let go and embrace this new or not so new way of looking at life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was one of the first items I loaded onto my Kindle and I love it.  I got it as a diversion to keep me busy on an overseas flight and it did the trick.  Even when I'm not traveling, I find it relaxing to play just before bed.  I noticed a couple of reviews that mentioned the ads as being an annoyance, but they only appear between games and there is a SKIP button to get past the ad immediately.  If you don't want the ads between games, just turn the wifi option off while you are playing and they won't appear.  I had downloaded a different free version of Solitaire originally and it was so spammy, I deleted it after only using it a couple of times.  I recommend this version - you won't be sorry!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I wanted to love these, really, but the fact that the pressure of these on my head kicks in after about an hour, makes gaming painful, literally. This is not what I expected, and most definitely not what I paid for. I hope to get a refund.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great graphics. Looks like a pocket calculator only on a 7 inch screen. Keeps a history of entries just like a printing calculator. Had the free one with the ads which was ok but this was a FAOTD so I got it. The same as the free one but with no ads. Works without WiFi on my kindle fire hd perfectly. Hint - If you don't want the ads on the free version turn off your WiFi.
B00CLMA3HK|5.0|This book is a classic example of weaving fact with fiction. I got engrossed in Jesse's situation with little trouble. Her brother was a little left behind in the process of me grasping who these two were, but I didn't mind as he, and Marcus, came back to the center of interest soon enough.<br /><br />  Jesse is taken on what I would call a grand tour of several different dimensions, and all I can say is, damnit, why does nothing like that ever happen to me? One can only hope... I'm loving this series, and am looking forward to seeing what on earth- or off earth, I should say, she finds herself in the middle of next as she tries to discover the truth about the past and her mother's disappearance.<br /><br />  She's in for a lot more than she can even imagine, and all I can say is, what a great thing to discover! What she experiences along the way, with her brother and good friend Marcus, makes for fantastic reading.
6305320802|5.0|Ahh the good old days, I love this book and recommend it to all, it is such a good read and fun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun. Challenging but doable. Even our 7 year old had fun with it. We want more levels please!<br />Will play Floor Escape next.
B00009ZYC0|5.0|Great movie for adults was blown away at the special effects, plot, and cinematography! Tom cruise is Tom cruise but this is not your usual tom cruise movie.
039472903X|5.0|A classic that opens your eyes to so many things you may have missed previously.  with these types of books, 1 tip can turn a mediocre campaign into a monster, and this is filled with tons of them.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|very good idea and graphics but I wish the robots didn't cost so much also the upgrade system is very good but should get better paint jobs for robots
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Already own it, and I love it.  I always get a backup if its inexpensive enough, and this is.  Plus my friend stole (ok he borrowed) my previous backup so I needed a replacement.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|They really did a great job creating this game. It is so easy to play and is really fun to play when you r anywhere
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is quite the challenge, yet also a great stress reliever. I enjoy playing this game as I can just unplug and continue to advance as I conquer each level!!!!:)
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Fantastic Movie.  Violent but, at times, very funny.  Ronan is an incredible actress.  The pacing was smooth and the action was spectacular
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is A Very Nice Game , It's Complicated At Times But For The Most Part It's A Pretty Fun Game , It's Just That It's Taking Forever Just To Get Other Levels unlocked
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I started playing the game, I decided to buy the game. I got to chapter 10 ,then it locked up on me. I hope that the maker of this game,  can fix it. Because I would like to finish the game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever.. I love playing this game. It is very real like. I would suggest this game to anyone
B0007TKNII|5.0|Beautiful music and great story.  A lot of poetic license from the book. The opening sequence where the opera house changes from dusty to beautiful amazes me every time.
B00F91G5BS|1.0|Pure trash.  Enough with the zombie movies.  Brad Pitt is like Superman in this movie.  There is nothing he can't do.  Fly a plane, crash a plane (and survive) and a crap load of other unbelievable Brad Pitt tricks.
0767903862|5.0|An absolutely great writer that does his research and teaches as well as entertains. I have most of his books.
0312370849|5.0|Excellent account of Jewish history, tragic but beautiful story. This is a true event that I had never heard about.
B00CSYR432|5.0|This is a beautiful story between a high school girl and boy. I enjoyed this movie, so did my family.
140006922X|5.0|It's a wonderful book.  Reza Aslan brings to life the times of Jesus.  An incredible history of the Jews of that time and before.  I learned a great deal of Jewish history that I didn't know.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was expecting the world...this one stopped short of my expectations.  First, it does not allow chromecast from your chrome browser on android or ios, only from PC. Second, it was pretty slow and bufferred a lot, though other streaming etc works well on my current wifi.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|Cute kitten games that any kid would love a lot. It the funniest game for cute kitten game. If you like cute thing.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Adorable movie.  The right amount of snark mixed with the delightful innocence of youth.  A delightful take on the classic story of a misunderstood villain who finds acceptance and happiness.  With a healthy dose of fluffiness.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|So far it's lived up to its 4 and a half stars especially in its co-op battles  I just hope I didn't jinx it
B00957T6X6|5.0|The game of thrones series is amazing. I love it for its realism, not afraid to get gritty, and never ending twists you can never predict. But I hated a feast for crows, I really couldn't give a hoot in heck for any other characters in that book. Best story series  I'v read in many years overall though
B002HR1W1K|5.0|This is true British humor at its best.  After watching this buy the newest movie for sure to keep the humor going.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fast, colorful solitare. I recommend this for beginner or expert.<br />Automatically deals and place cards were You want the card to go.
B00F57VFXO|4.0|I came to Operation Parsifal with a misconceived expectation. When I saw Ian Fleming's name in the title I made a quick assumption that it would be some kind of James Bond fan fiction. The fact that I had never read a single James Bond novel made me fear I'd be unable to relate to it, given that fan fiction typically attempts to ape the style of the original author. The only experience I've ever had of James Bond is from the movies and recently watching a documentary about Fleming himself.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise to find not a fan fiction but a full-blown novel about Ian Fleming himself! Operation Parsifal tells the story of Fleming's role in preventing an assassination plot against Adolph Hitler. (The reasons are far from traitorous to the Allied cause, and the pacing of the book kept me up reading and having to force myself to stop.)<br /><br />The story may be fictitious, but Fleming's character is so firmly drawn that the character perfectly embodies the man himself. Over the course of the book, I felt like I was reading about a real man's adventures, perhaps recounted by a friend who knew him well as a person. The plot bears some resemblance to a James Bond adventure in that we know what the mission is early on and then watch as more information and changing circumstances require Fleming to improvise. What makes it stand out is the realism and lack of silly gadgetry that litters so many Bond adventures (at least the movie versions, as I said I can't say what the books are like).<br /><br />As to the writing itself, Stevenson's narration is astounding. From the initial car chase it become obvious that the author knows London, and seemingly the other locales in which the story takes place. There is sufficient detail to allow the reader to clearly envision each scene while avoiding the excess that can destroy a good yarn. Stevenson balances detail, description, and action admirably.<br /><br />Having never been tempted to read a James Bond novel, Operation Parsifal has ignited my interest as well as made me want to read Stevenson's other Fleming books. A great read!
0744014956|4.0|Love the fact that its a hardcover strategy guide, more games need to go this route. The book is excellent to use for single player. Has detailed steps and explanations for every mission, stunt jump, and collectable needed to obtain 100% completion. The guide also fully explain every gun, stat, and car mod in full detail. My only criticisms is that the guide explains almost nothing regarding GTA: Online and the Vehicles in game and the maps in the book are far too small. A few of the explanations regarding car mods, stunt jumps, gun mods, and how to boost some of the stats will work for GTA: Online. The book does have pictures and statistics of most of the Cars available in single player and online mode but not every car. Some free online user made guides have better details regarding cars and I would highly recommend using them. Overall I would recommend the strategy guide. Definitely helpful.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Azada is a great game.  It is not a typical puzzle game. There are awesome graphics and a really good plot of story that goes with it. I started with the free version and had to buy the full game. Another thing that makes it different and a challenge is that you have a time limit, do not let this turn you away because it is plenty of time to figure it out. Please Big Fish make a sequel to Azada!!!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I really love this. Especially the updated version. It's so awsome! A lot of features I would have never expected!
B00459EZLW|5.0|What a great series - I want more - please make the next season - this could be a Amazon Original!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Can't wait to see what happens next! Will Martin tell us more about kingslayer? What has Tyrion been up to and what will<br />He do about the queen?
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is my favorite book.  I have read it countless times; it never gets old. Love it love it love it!!!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This story held my interest and since I've never traveled abroad I found it interesting. I read many mysteries and this one was on a par with quite a few of the better ones with a little surprise at the end. Kathy
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|As a long time Tolkien fan I could hardly wait for the release of the movie version of the HOBBIT.  Of course I purchase the first edition of the<br />DVD of this film from AMAZON and since ordered the 3D versions in Blue ray as well as conventional DVDs.  I have only watched the theatrical version on<br />the standard DVD and am impressed with the near HD quality of the images.  I do not however like the idea of the film being in three parts since the<br />book is fairly short and easy to read. And Tolkien himself was not happy with the story after he finished: he wished he had made it more for adults.<br />Well, the film accomplished that alright and beautifully well.  Still, two films could have covered the book easily. Peter Jackson, a fine director,<br />likes to expand original stories as he did with the LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG.  He almost ruined KK with a silly ending, but it was OK.<br />  Here he remains pretty faithful to the book with added violence though I guess that is what people want today.  Still, I loved it with an excellent<br />cast and I understand some returnies in  the next edition.  Splendid special effects, especially in the underground caves..kinda creepy.  I have yet<br />to visit the extras on the discs though I love motion picture production stuff: a field I wish I had gotten into.  If you don't know the story but liked the theatrical film, you will love this DVD.  Wait until you see the next films; there is a great dialog scene between Bilbo the Burglar and<br />Smaug the dragon.  I love dragon stories.  I gave this film five stars and guess what? no Dr Sweets...Yeah!!  Though I would enjoy seeing the dragon<br />eat Dr Sweets...Enjoy!!
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|This rating is purely for the added scenes. For the non-extended version, I would have give about a 3+. For the extended version, I'm very disappointed. Sadly, Jackson, in an attempt to add humor and exaggerate the rude barbarism of the dwarves, put in a scene of them all playing in a pool naked, in Rivendell. In addition to that, there was other unnecessary, suggestive humor, that Tolkien never put in.<br /><br />Why slide in trash?! It drives me crazy. I sit down to enjoy a perfectly decent story, and I get debased MTV/Hollywood garbage.<br /><br />Pros: There was a couple of minutes that meaningfully added to the movie.<br />1) Showing Bilbo, as a child, playing with Gandalf.<br />2) Slightly extended sequence between Thranduil and Thror.<br />2) Slightly extended dialog between Gandalf and Saruman at Rivendell.<br /><br />In the LOTR, Jackson's humility was prevalent through the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" materials. In these, he's more non-chalant, as though he's \\"arrived\\". I think his successes and his abuse of CGI, have caused him to become careless in the quality of his work.<br /><br />Disappointing is the best way to sum up my opinion.<br /><br />I'll be returning this, and the copy that I intended to give to a relative as a Christmas present.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and look forward to devouring the sequels. The author has a powerful grasp on his characters, they seem to come to life from the get go. His prose almost has a quality of poetry to it, though not in the least flowery. I haven't laughed aloud from a good book in a long while, and the gore and violence were superbly executed. I'm off to buy the next one!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is fun, as well as challenging.  It is helpful that hints are doled out one per hour so that I don't get too caught up in it.
0670023329|5.0|A &#34;must read&#34; for anyone wanting to learn more about the situation in North Korea and why we need to continue working on a peaceful resolution.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It's so addicting. I loved playing it on facebook and am so, so glad they finally made it available on Kindle.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Teeth, hair and eyes all over the concrete! Not for the faint of heart or the younger crowd. A lot of violence and some sexual stuff. Fun but one bloody mess.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow is the first word that comes to mind.  Suzanne Collins keeps you captivated until the very end and yearning for more!!
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|As a huge fan of rayman origins and legends, I had high expectations. Thankfully I have  been very pleased. Three bucks is a smoking' deal, especially considering I paid $60 for legends on the  Wii U. Like the aforementioned games, this game is polished, charming, original, addictive, and heaps of fun. So far it hasn't been slow on my Kindle Fire HD. One a side note, i wish Nintendo will take notice of what is going on in the real-world, reevaluate their strategy an acknowledge  all the overpriced crap they are selling in their eShop.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Held my interest. It was challenging, but not too difficult. I was pleasantly surprised that it kept me entertained for several hours.I would definitely recommend this game and think the designers did a great job. I am looking forward to trying other apps from MobiGrow
B00992CF6W|5.0|When are we going to be able to do stuff like on the computer?Or the X-box? I still love this game but when will we be able to do that stuff. You should update that.....
0544104404|3.0|I totally agree that character is important.I enjoyed some of the stories in the book.Did not however learn any new info or techniques to apply to life.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Love this game  huge big fish games fan graphics ,sound easy to find hidden objects ,can't wait for the sequel
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|The difference between Stryper and many 80's bands that are putting out modern releases is Michael Sweet STILL has the strong vocals that we remember and he is a superior songwriter.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed their last original work, Murder By Pride, which was in my opinion more like their original sound due to a mix of heavy songs, pop songs & ballads this release is more on the heavy side.<br /><br />You don't have to be in to the Christian lyrics to enjoy this CD, you just have to like good hard rock/heavy metal to enjoy it.<br /><br />These guys have a bigger fan base than some people think, while I was in line at my local record store on the release day the customer behind me had a copy as well and asked me where I found the deluxe version. They had Stryper CDs ALL OVER the store, some in Metal, Rock/Pop & Gospel, that was funny. Not many bands can be placed in 3 categories.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you've ever liked any Stryper songs outside of the ballads and you're starving for good rock music pick it up!
0762434260|3.0|bought this item locally mostly for the handle. If you have some form of wood clay and a wooden dowel of appropriate size with minimal work you cam remake the wand haft out of actual wood and use the clay for the wider part. MUCH more durable for kids that way than this or even the licensed reproductions.<br /><br />As for the product itself -  its closer in size to what the books say it should be, around 11 inches. And if you can either redo the haft as i said a above or clean it up a bit with filler and paint to be used as a desk display its great for that.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|. You can apply or erase hundreds of different effects with ease.  The final photos come out great. Enjoy the variety of effects and styles offered'

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I've seen the movie a million times and at first was shocked how different it was but I found all the adventures delightful
0786955570|5.0|This set is a very fine game that can be played in less than an hour or more. The miniatures in the set alone make it an impressive edition to any D&D player. Aside from the 42 miniatures, there is several sheets of interlocking card stock tiles representing the areas you explore. I consider getting the other items in this series due to the quality of this set.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Concrete and realistic actionable ideas. The theories presented about the Rider, the Elephant, and the Path makes down to earth sense in helping bring about solutions and change.

1932100660|5.0|One of the best eye openers I've been lucky enough to come across. The best part is that this book opens you up from the outset on a different outlook on the medical field. Not to mention the behind the scenes drama that take place. This book is a powerful tool guide where prevention is the key. Case studies prove their point and very easy for anyone to understand.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!<br /><br /> very do-able lifestyle change
B00CL0J99K|5.0|After seeing this in theaters I honestly did not like it that much but after watching this a second time it really is a good movie but still not better than the first one. I would definitely buy this.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a cute halloween game for kids, fun and entertaining way to suck time away and have a lot of fun
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Between this movie and Pacific Rim I could not decide which was the better movie of 2013. I'm not even a big fan of Star Trek and this was a great movie to me. By far one of my new favorites.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm left on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will happen with Gideon & Eva next! Awesome!
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end! This is a novel that truly captures the strength and courage it takes to move on when your world changes for the worst. Ahern truly has a gift of revealing these intricate characters that surround Holly and shape her into the woman that she is---from her silly friends, her eccentric family and the love of her life whom she lost. You'll find yourself rooting for Holly to be happy again and by the end of the novel you'll feel as if you've completed a truly significant journey alongside her.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is amazing! I was almost out of space! I wondered where all my space went. My storage space said category &quot;other&quot; was taking up 3.4GB. I looked for a solution to the problem online. This was listed. I didn't expect it to work. I thought it would be like all the others. I was wrong! Unbelievable! Took under 10 seconds!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|First off I get it. I get why the author chose to make the plot decisions she made. In a way she telegraphed it big time by having a second character narrating in first-person POV. The thoughts and narration as done by Four are not significantly different enough to be distinguishable from that of Tris. The massage, BE BRAVE is a hard one for kids to hear and so many people don't understand that sometimes just carrying on IS the bravest thing one can do.<br /><br />That being said, the writing was good, but not nearly as compelling as the man-I-gotta-see-how-this-comes-out writing of the first two novels. I just didn't care about the characters outside the wire and a lot of the mcguffins were forced. and exceptionally reminiscent of the Truman Show.<br /><br />If you read the other two novels and expected more of the same, that's what you get. But the shine is off the star.

B000001FO4|5.0|Never thought I'd like this band. But they are great. A combination of Guns and Aerosmith that just rocks. It really grows on you in a hurry. Great riffage, drums and singing and harmonies. Blues based guitar rock at its' best.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|See during certain times when I play this game I have lots of money from doing missions and stuff then when I need a little more money to get  a rocket launcher or tank I start a mission right,but noooo the game show a blank static screen like when you see Slender Man,then I exit the app and re-enter the app everything is the same as before BUT when I see my money balance I have $0!!!!!!(WTF where's my money this game need an update because this is the 4th time in 2 days!!!)but other than that this is a very fun and very great app :) Just plz help me Gameloft I want my money in game for tank or launcher.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The book was disappointing and ruined the great progress Roth made in Divergent and Insurgent. It would have been better to stop after the second book, even with the major cliff hanger at the end. The storyline of Allegiant made no sense and the ending was frustrating.
B000QUEHNK|5.0|I loved the story, the characters and the writing style!  A good curl-up-by-the-fire Sunday afternoon book.  Can't wait to try the author's other book!
0142410322|2.0|Trying to place Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator in Dahl's canon unfortunately brings it up short.  Like many modern movie sequels, this sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory lacks the humanity of the original - it seems mostly like wacky event after event with little of the pathos of the first book (and most other Dahl books, for that matter).  Children will enjoy it because it is descriptive and full of adventure, but as an adult reading it for the first time, it was the first of his books that did not outright make me feel like a kid again.

B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|I like it and it has grown on me with listening but still not quite as good as Only by the Night and Come Around Sundown.  BUT I am very happy to see something new from them.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great app. If you have watched real steel and did not want to pay for the official app, here you go. It gets very difficult but it is fun. Once you buy an upgrade you have to wait a bit to install it but you can do other things while you wait. There are things called power cores which if you run out you cannot fight if you run out. You can either pay to recharge them or wait, as they recharge fairly quickly. There are two types of currency, gold and silver. Silver is used for lower-end robots and upgrades and gold is for better robots and other things. You can have all the robots in the movie like Atom, Noisy Boy, and Zeus. Gold is rare to get. So its hard to get better robots without paying real money. Overall very fun game.
B00EJOCAYW|3.0|My 10 year old has some issues with challenges and details so I thought getting him a Lego set of his favorite iPad game would give him incentive to stick to the task.  When the package arrived I was dismayed that this will probably not work as I anticipated since the micro small pieces will probably prove to be too much for him.  It's a Christmas gift and I know he will love it initially I just hope that he actually does it.<br /><br />That being said, if I would have read closer for detail myself I would have noticed that it does say the completed product is a 10 cm square.  For those not familiar with \\"micro\\" sets the brick size is not even 1cm.  More like 8mm so buyer be aware if buying for a younger child.  I would most definitely stick with the recommended age of 10+ unless your child has demonstrated very good dexterity and building skills.<br /><br />Other than that I expect that this will have the same durability that most Lego products have.  Just disappointed of the size and price.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The trial lasted to long , that part was slow. But I knew the moment he was setting beside that girl on the bus<br />How it was gonna go, but liked the book in general . Love the story about how a family tried so hard to stay strong<br />And positive , but lost it all .

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great building of the characters.  I couldn't really tell how the characters were all intertwined, but it was awesome to see how their relationships developed.  And how all our actions and decisions affect not only our own future, but that of others.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My Granddaughter enjoys to read this series of books. Her review follows below:<br /><br />\\"hello there! I read your book and it is hilarious! apparently Greg had already had a date to the Valentine's Day party but he did not like her so he took advice from his uncle Gary. but the thing I don't get is why dide he take the jacket???? so I hope you can write more diary of a wimpy kid books this year and all the time whenever you do have time! so I hope you had a good time writing those books and the movies!!!\\"
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love everything by Sylvia Day but this series is my favorite. I honestly don't understand why so many people are whining about it not being the end of the series. What is your problem??? Clearly they aren't real fans if they're complaining about MORE books in a series that they claim to love. Since when is it a crime for an author to decide he/she wants to extend their series to more than 3 books??? And so what if they had to push back the publication date?! Maybe she had other things going on in her life and couldn't write as fast as she normally does. We should just be happy that this awesome series is continuing not griping because she decided to write more! Yeesh.<br /><br />So thank you, Sylvia Day, for giving me another couple books to look forward to! Can't wait to read them...whenever they come out!

1451695195|5.0|Wow this was an amazing story about a surgeon who didn't believe in a god and how a life after death experience changed him. It hit me deeply and now I read and am interested in more people who have had an afterlife experience. It really helped me spiritually as I had lost faith while dealing with depression.

B00G32MPWU|1.0|When are these old actors(?) going to retire and make room for some good ones?  And who<br />was that ugly guy?  Most of the time it was his double, doing the acting, running around<br />in the shadows?  Rouke doesn't even look like him anymore, fat and ugly, OLD.  The plot<br />was thin, the attempt at acting lousy, don't bother with this hash job.
B00178JDCK|4.0|This is a good working and good sounding pedal.  There is plenty of adjustment available in the controls to get a variety of sounds.  Solid reverb.  It's a machine.  Don't turn away just because it's a Behringer.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|We really enjoyed the film, but it stopped to buffer several times, and the resolution was pretty poor. I'm not sure that's a fault with my connection either, because I have streamed many programs through Amazon and have never experienced the difficulties I did tonight. I liked the movie, but I regret having viewed it this way.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|There is, maybe, somewhere in rural Sussex a house, country lane and a farm and the end of it. And beyond farm there, maybe, is a duck pond which a girl once called ocean. What is certain, is that all of it, and more, really comes to life in latest book of Neil Gaiman (second to latest in fact, he just Publisher another one before I got round to read Ocean at the end of lane).<br />As Gaiman’s works go, this book starts in surprisingly real, almost mundane and most of all tangible world. It is not a bad thing, I must say, but just bit surprising. On second thought maybe not so much, when we are looking at the world through eyes of seven year old boy. No wonder we can almost taste those burned toasts. Story get darker very soon: declining family fortunes, strains in marriage and perhaps even moment of abuse verging on murder. By then however we are already entering one of those world which Gaiman builds with his narrative. We again, sometimes with tightly held breath, enter that boundary zone between dream, nightmare and myth and walk on the edge between perceptiveness, rapture and madness. And when go through, across the worlds, through bucket into ocean and out of a pond, through fear, decision and sacrifice we end at back of old farmhouse, where perhaps not only former seven year old boy, now man in his forties, remembers again, siting on old bench by the duck pond. And as he starts his car to finally leave the story a return to his family we close this book still with a bit of distant look in our eyes , saying: Well, Gaiman did it well. Again.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Haven't played magic in years.  This game takes me back.  Great for a casual player or a someone that wants to relive all those old magic days.
0140557741|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out, back in 1995. I didn't have any children. I didn't expect to have any children. I bought this book because it was the most amazing book I had ever seen. It still amuses, intrigues and amazes me.<br /><br />There is no text, except for the writing within the illustrations. None is needed or wanted. Tonight I \\"read\\" this book to my almost-five-year-old son. He was almost as fascinated with it as I am. Once he worked out what was going on in the illustrations, he was drawn into the book and could not wait to see what was going to happen on the next page.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|You really can't miss on this one for laughter and fun. There have been other films that gather a strong star cast but either a really week story or lack of chemistry doesn't work. This is not the case here . The premise is pretty simple : Someone is starting to take out retired Black Op agents , a reporter , helicopter pilot. You can tell the cast is just having a great time playing out the story .  Bruce Willis still kicks ass but is really just wanting a regular life after retiring 2 years earlier . Mary Ellen Parker is fun as his love interest who loves spy stories and then unwittingly gets caught up with the old gang. Morgan Freeman is as easy going as ever. John Malcovich really shines as a superb former Op who still approaches the world with healthy paranoia. Watch his facial expressions - priceless. Helen Mirren : Classy and no nonsense and her former Russian agent lover re entering her life is fun. They all work well together trying to figure out who's after them and then take care of it. Or as Malcovitch says after one of the multiple attempts on their  lives &#34; old man my ass&#34; . The lead CIA agent refers to Willis as &#34; Grampa&#34; despite Willis out maneuvering him at each turn . Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss have small but fun parts. Definitely worth buying .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works great! No issues. Easy to use. Prefer to play the game it this way then on my small phone screen.
006202406X|2.0|Most of what I would say has already been stated by others.  Roth uses a serum to write her way out of several corners, does not develop her characters (I had to go back and check on who Uriah was), and the &#34;climax&#34; is simply anti-climactic and her plot is so convoluted that I found myself skipping the exposition just to get to dialogue and action. I did not feel any passion between Tris and Four.  Four just became stupid and wussified and I never really did relate to Tris, she was just so immature at times. I could not believe her as a leader or understand what Four saw in her to begin with.  The entire series started strong and then just fizzled.

0545586178|4.0|In the much-anticipated sequel to the \\"Hunger Games,\\" Suzanne Collins once again vividly describes a world in which tributes fight to the death. When the novel begins, Katniss thinks of the annual Victory Tour and how she's not looking forward to it. President Snow reveals that Katniss must convince Panem and himself that Peeta and her are in love, or else he will kill her and Gale's families. This presents the main problem that Katniss must overcome throughout the story.<br /> \\"Catching Fire\\" was an overall really good book. I especially enjoyed Suzanne Collins' way of grabbing the attention of the reader through the questionable love Katniss may or may not have for her friends, Gale and Peeta. Peeta has truly been in love with Katniss all throughout the first Hunger Games. During that time, Katniss \\"loved\\" Peeta on a more strategic level. Katniss has always had feelings for Gale, but she has betrayed him by \\"loving\\" Peeta. Gale now keeps Katniss at a distance. The frustration Katniss possesses is evident when she speaks of Gale and says, \\"I'm sure plenty of people assumed that we'd eventually get married. But that was before the games. Before my fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, announced he was madly in love with me\\" (9). Katniss makes it clear that everything was simple before the games, but now she may be forced to be with someone she doesn't really love. She believes that she will have to marry Peeta in order to please Panem and Snow, and keep everyone alive. Meanwhile, Gale tells Katniss that he loves her, and she ends up kissing him while he sleeps.<br /> By the end of the novel, the relationships Katniss has with both boys do not change very much. Collins leaves the readers wondering what will become of Katniss and the two boys that are in love with her. Readers know by the end of the novel just how much Katniss cares for Peeta, but how the one she truly wants to be with is still Gale. The book seems to focus intensely on these three characters and how they interact with each other. I enjoyed the tension in the relationships specifically, but the book in general was also very entertaining.teract with each other.

0374531943|5.0|The best of the astronaut autobiographies.  Mike Collins addresses technical issues as if you're sitting with him talking over a beer, but without oversimplifying.  He doesn't display much of an ego (hinting at the egos of other astronauts).  A quick and entertaining read.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|was a good old fashioned story but I did think it would have more to it.daniel Radcliffe is a good little actor.i enjoyed it.wish there would have been more character in it htough.oh well.
1439148813|5.0|Excellent story of how the engineers and guys behind the astronauts put Americans in space.  Gene Krantz takes the reader from empty office spaces and no idea what they were doing, to putting a man on the moon and, later, dealing with the Apollo 13 crisis.  The book is great from both a space history and leadership/crisis management perspectives.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book moves and is engaging. I love the perspective of &#34;reporter&#34; in the events of the Great Panic and beyond. Well written infused with humor and a serious examination of the human condition.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play this game every day. The karate (won't let me spell the squirrel who is obsessed with acorns or kind of karate)game is awesome. You get daily rewards,the first 4 are coins,then, the big prize. The more expensive the better the coins and the stuff that gets you to level up. The only way to get the expensive animals or other stuff in the shop is to either get a jackpot (on second sentence) or buy with real money,I would not suggest.

006202406X|1.0|I haven't written a review before, but I decided to because I've never been more pissed off by a series ending.  I won't reiterate what so many other one-star reviewers have so expertly outlined as the core issues with the writing, choices and character development, but what I will say is that I felt like I was reading a completely different author in book 3.  Crappiest story turns and endings in a long, long time and after hundreds of books I've read.  Will definitely be avoiding the movie and all future writing from her.  I wish she burned this book, pretended like it never happened, started over and created something worthy of her original creation.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love all of Nelson DeMille's books and read everyone of them - the John Corey character is very funny and I laughed a lot while reading this particular book

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love this product!  Makes downloading photos into my iPad so easy which is great since I'm technologically challenged to begin with.  You just plug it into your iPad and then plug the camera card into the device, wait a minute and your photos appear on your iPad screen.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|It is true that Sheryl sandberg had not so tough a start in life and had the right people at the right time<br />But her story is important for all women - it shows how she planned, succeeded, faltered but her convictions always helped her move in the right direction.<br />Her constant questioning and thinking about the best way to do things and her ability to remain grounded is inspiring.<br />Her acceptance of her faults and then improvise - like the time when she did not heed to the woman who raised her hand for questions and the impact that led her to change her style is one of the many examples which tells us how , we face similar situations and opportunities to help or change our own lives too but we often let them pass and think of another day. Maybe if we  stopped to think, plan and have the will, we will also lead to a new change.

B00E3IZIM0|3.0|Pacific Rim is a bold attempt to bring a certain WOW factor to the screen.  It misses the mark IMHO.  It's worth a view and after that you can go on about your business.  The lack of character development is what I thought hurt this movie.  You just sort of jump in after a brief introduction.  So, what I like someone else might hate.....and vise versa.  It's entertainment, just not on a super high level.

0711986746|5.0|I chose this 5-star rating because I LOVE FREDDIE MERCURY.  Even though it didn't tell me anything I didn't know - it was an extremely good read.

B0001GL3K4|4.0|Besides the host of GREAT STARS (Grant, Neeson, Firth, etc.), it's a great movie to watch during the Christmas season.  Lots of music.  Great stories about ea. group--it's about different people trying to find love/being alone during the holidays.  The boy who plays w/Neeson steals the show--(See Nanny McPhee).<br />What I didn't like was two of the characters portraying more distastful scenes--which, not that I'm unused to that in today's movies, but they simply \\"took\\" from the rest of the scenes.  The rest were so well done.  It has an interesting ending.  Very upbeat movie.

B0052UYJDC|5.0|As someone in the process right now of going through everything we own and honestly evaluating whether we love it or use it, I'm enjoying reading a handful of books I purchased on the subject of minimalism for my Kindle. And what a bargain this book was. Yay bargain! Anyway, we were already living with less than most, but we downsized to actually living small(er), and I've really enjoyed letting things of all kinds go. These books have helped me get things into perspective, to see how others view their experience with minimalism, and to help me free my own life. I don't wish to live with nothing. I merely don't want to be a slave to my &#34;stuff&#34;, y'know?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The candies r really delicious but if u have a lot of time on your hands i wouldn't recommend getting this game...it's very addictive=-o
B000067FP8|5.0|We bought this for our Halloween season collection.  We like to have a good mix of the new stuff and these, what we consider oldies. We grew up loving the Gremlins as kids, and continue to love them still. it isn't quite scary, it's more silly fun for us, but we love it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game totally. I love the game so so so so much never gets boring get the game it is free
B00009YXHN|5.0|This movie is so much fun.  I don't know many people our age (38) who hasn't seen this movie. It, to us, is a classic, and we watch it often during the Halloween season.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really think this is a good game, just wish getting points was easier! The games are all clever and funny and pretty hard.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I felt as if I were Jimmy Stewart playing L.B. Jeffries,  looking into the life of a neighbor, distantly affected by the events in the memoir. And yet, suffering from L.B.'s external conflict not being able to do crap about the neighbors dilemma.  I enjoyed this novel and sure as HELL would never want to experience the writer's &#34;adventure.&#34; All I can say is thank you for sharing you experience. And while you got yourself into your own dilemma, the reflection about the women in prison, the camaraderie, the importance of self, the degradation of being an animal trapped until the cage is full (sorry for the clichè), that is the part I can feel sorry for. Thanks for this.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|One of the greatest recordings of all time. Classic songs, well produced, played flawlessly, an absolute masterpiece of an album. I would say that the quality was well before it's time but the recording industry just didn't use high quality equipment on &#34;Pop&#34; music. It was reserved for the Jazz Masters back in the day. I would like to think that The Beatles changed all that for Pop music but I cannot say for sure.<br />  Anyway, 5 Stars for this classic recording.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like this but have decided to wait before paying $ on the no ad app. It crashes a lot. You cannot zoom in on the pieces or enlarge to see better, and when you grab a piece it almost always grabs the wrong piece, even when I am very careful to aim directly at the intended target. So, yes it is fun, but a bit aggravating, too. It could be better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to play, not to hard but still interesting and ads not in the way.  Have to leave review to get<br />past level 10
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the improvements to the Pintetest app for Kindle Fire HD ... makes it much easier to use!
1594202273|3.0|This well written book focuses on nuclear weapons safety.  Schlosser's essential and completely correct points are that this technology is intrinsically hard to make safe, that control of nuclear weapons use is similarly hazardous, and that we were fortunate to get through the Cold War without some kind of significant disaster.  The product of a great deal of research, Schlosser focuses on US nuclear weapons and their control.  This book contains a great deal of sobering information.  Schlosser describes a substantial volume of near misses, some due to problems with the hardware of nuclear weapons, some due to problems with the command & control systems, some (better known episodes like the now famous Able Archer incident) due to diplomatic miscalculations and miscommunications.  Schlosser's descriptions of some of these episodes and the often shoddy control of nuclear weapons is often scary.  The narrative reveals many of the problems identified by scholars as important features of the American Cold War experience.  These include the struggle over civilian and military control of weapons, the importance of inter-service rivalries, the perhaps inevitable race to the bottom character of our rivalry with the Soviets, and the way the Cold War rivalty became an autonomous feature of American political life.  Another positive feature is Schlosser's extensive bibliography, which will make this book very useful for anyone interested in further reading and research on this topic.<br /><br />Despite these useful features, this book has some significant defects.  Typical of journalistic work, Schlosser employs a a conventional framing device with an extensive reconstruction of a frightening episode involving a Titan II missile in the late 1970s.  This story is interleaved throughout book, alternating with more conventional historical analysis and narrative.  While Schlosser's reconstruction is convincing and very well written, the amount of pages devoted to this episode is out of proportion to its value as an example and the interleaving tends to break up the flow of the book.  Schlosser also tends to conflate distinct though closely related aspects of nuclear weapons safety.  It would have been more useful to deal with hardware problems, control problems, and use problems as distinct categories, and then discuss their probable interactions.  Finally, in a well intentioned effort to make this book as broadly accessbile as possible, Schlosser includes a number of background discussions of the Cold War, nuclear weapons development, etc.  The quality of these sections is quite variable; some are solid, others are superficial, and some, like the discussion of the early Cold War, are likely to be misleading.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, I hope this book reaches a wide audience as Schlosser's topic is a very important one.  Probably the only sensible way forward is a concerted effort to reduce greatly the number of nuclear weapons.t of proportion to its value as an example and the interleaving tends to break up the flow of the book.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Great read.  Problem finding last page read on more than one device I guess due to the size.  My solution was to highlight a line where I stop so that I can find my place.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|I have been using this app for a year, if I am not mistaken, and I love it. Just recently, my father let me get the pro and now I am loving it more than I used to. I recommend it to anyone taking math or an area that requires calculations. It is like a bigger version of a graphing calculator. Of course, it is a bit tricky to use at first, it is fairly easy to mix up your numbers or forget a parenthesis, but you get used to it after awhile. This perfect if you want an app that has a regular calculator, table, and graph. I have still yet to explore other things this calculator can do, but I am satisfied with what I know!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Graphics are amazing. Love the quality of the game. Very user friendly as well. It's better than any other deer hunting game I've ever played.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is good, but gems are a bit of a problem. The picture and sound is cute,and the animation is advanced. Totally worth the space! Gameloft games like this, ice age village and much much more are very interesting to my brother and I. I have bought gems and bits, and I have bought new ponies. This app is great for bronies, pegasisters, and kids! :)  I totally love this app and I recommend you get it! :D Have a nice day XD
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was an extremely well written book. While there were a few mistakes, it was still amazing. I loved this book.

B00DURHYWC|5.0|Pink Martini has done it again! I have been a fan of Pink Martini since 2005. This band exudes musical excellence - one that brings you high, and happy! I love how Pink Martini has incorporated different languages, and genres, and showcases different singers (I'm now not only a fan of China, but also Storm and Al).
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Was so excited to finally have it for my kindle xd but it does not work right. Constantly freezes up, stops and/or blacks out. Am ready to just delete it!  So disappointed!!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|As a radio guy, these are the industry standard. Top shelf.  This is the best price that I have ever seen for these.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen. From the rediculous/terrible set design, to the horrible accents the Smiths were using, my eyes were sore by the end of the movies from being rolled during every scene. Even for free, this movie is not worth it, let alone paying for it. New lows for M Night Shyamalan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this author's style of writing and I keep rereading this series, one of my favorite books. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because you can share and compete<br /> with your friends and I like how it changes<br /> were you are.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|This movie surprised me! Brad Pitt is awesome as always. Took a little while for me to figure out what was going on. I thought it had a great story line in the end.
B0016K40KY|4.0|Lawrence of Arabia (Collector's Edition)  its an old movie but with graphics and color it looks very good-- the combat  scenes are  neat and its neat to see a movie in a desert. very not the norm in movies. based on a true life event it seems.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|Funny Movie! Jennifer Ainston does a great job. Made me laugh and laugh. I bought this movie so I can see it again.
B001CWOCUO|3.0|dvds  of performances  rarely wantto show  the  buyers od dvd the audience  and the lights that are all over the  place -- mostly showing the stage but  you do see some of the  place on last song umbrella song
B009R6GN22|5.0|Finally a book about Marilyn Monroe that tells the truth about her life and her loves. This book is well documented and factual. It puts the pieces together and negates all the rumors. Monroe- as the real woman not just Hollywood hype.
B0009MAO46|3.0|Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) its ok- its a bit old pc  graphiced movie  where toys talk and have lives hiden from people. a boy  who has  a birthday and older  toys in the room give  a chance for several charecters.. the fun ones are the army people meanwhile  see the toys in action running between rooms-- the next door neighbor and other surprises
B009KCUX3S|5.0|One of the best programming book , I've read till now. I have to add that I'm not a fan of classic books anymore. I think they'r useful and helping but now that everything can be found on the web, you don't need that much. Head First Java is just enough to put you in the way and give you what you need to do the job perfect. Of course you need practice and practice to be the master of a language, but I recommend this book to everybody who's tired of big boring book.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|why ok? simple if they  where to do another version they need to show more of the world  your charecters are apart of.the main guys only went in some places--- some good visuals
B00BCWOWKY|4.0|I really enjoy this show for my fall-apart-friday nights.  I will admit the \\"non-lawyer\\" in season two is a little much with his moral issues, but the rest of the cast picks up the slack and makes up for it!  As good as season one, but your not rooting for the underdog as much.  I recommend, and cant wait for season three!
1423101472|4.0|The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 5)  the author likesthe  greek mythos it seems heres  the other book to the series and looks like hes made  another series with  percy jackson and the group as well as a sereis on the  egyptian side of things
B0058ZZBVK|4.0|This is an enjoyable show with good eye candy (male and female).  If you think about the show, you will ruin the entertainment value!!!  This show is to watch and enjoy, not think a dissect.  I find the main male leads having a good working relationship that you can believe, and you want to see continue into something more interesting.  The concept is far-fetched but entertaining.  Season two on the other hand, you just want sit the \\"non-lawyer\\" down and tell him to knock of the mellow dramatic persona!<br /><br />If your looking for a show that will keep you entertained and relax too, Suits is your show!
B0051MKNV8|3.0|visually neat looking yes! has potential yes---like a book i read - why is it that  what i call good  is very brief in stories?
B00A86AIAI|5.0|This BATMAN is the best. I cannot tell you how real he looks.

B000000OQ5|5.0|Tesla is one of the better bands to come out of the 80's. This is a great cd! I would have to say that every song on this cd Rocks! If you are looking for a great road trip cd or just hanging out at home, than check it out.
6305781427|5.0|very nice music on cd but its nice to see the performers  in action thus this dvd and well worth your time
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Is a very good product but casting local media is a must to be a 5 star product, for now is 3 stars.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&amp;E Miniseries)  filmed in  europe as best they could--the story  of rich ordinary people  living in the 1800's  could have been fun if they showed more of the high life of the lords  but good enough i say also the behind the scenes are different from the dvd
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|I don't normally write reviews for something unless I've finished them, but I felt the need to explain why I had to stop reading this book after the first couple of chapters.<br /><br />Before I begin, I liked the Mistborn series and I like Sanderson in general.  And for this book, I liked the general idea behind it; that some strange event has caused some people to have super powers, I had no problem with that.  My problem arose from the fact that these powers still didn't seem to be rooted in reality to make the book believable.  Let me explain what I mean...<br /><br />There was an Epic (bad guy with powers) in the book whose \\"power\\" was that he could shoot guns non-stop without ever running out of ammunition.  How is this a \\"power\\" exactly?  Does his power actually create bullets out of thin air that then load themselves into the gun's magazine or chamber to be fired?  Who knows, Sanderson never explained it, at least before I stopped reading.<br /><br />Steelheart, the main baddie of the book, has a wealth of powers but one of them is to turn literally anything into steel, which he then does to all of Lake Michigan.  Now maybe I'm just being too anal here but all I can think about is the impact that something like that would have on alot of different things, plumbing, sewage, fishing, etc. for all of the cities and life forms around the lake, but it's never really talked about in the book, it's just brushed aside and the world keeps on going like always except that this enormous lake is now made of steel.<br /><br />If stuff like that doesn't bother you, the book is probably fine, and I understand the target audience is young adults but even young adults and teens can see through some of these major plot holes that are simply brushed off by the author.  I expected a lot better from Sanderson.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)  it turns out the  theatrical and international version has same ending ... this edition  has  more than one ending  choice you can decide to see. a ending  that leaves you  wondering  a happy  version?<br />about a special cop who has to take down artifical humans that  escaped to earth why?  blade Runners are the hired hands like a mercenary  and special police there  job is to track them down and eliminate them oh yes depending on what version you would get harrison narrating the story or not at all
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, The Luminaries is a large, ambitious novel. Among the devices that Catton uses is accelerating the pace of the storytelling as the novel proceeds. The first half of the book felt very long and drawn out, so much so that I nearly stopped reading; but, like another reviewer, I had a \\"talk with myself\\" and persevered on. For a while I was glad I did, because mid-way through the pace picks up and, for a while, The Luminaries is an exciting page turner.<br /><br />But the pace continues to quicken, until the prose turns nearly telegraphic, and events that would have been told in excruciating detail at the beginning of the book are simply summarized. As a result, the resolution feels remote, rushed, and incomplete, with numerous questions unresolved (so far as I could tell; the plot is very complex).<br /><br />I realize that Catton is concerned with more than just storytelling, and there is plenty else to appreciate in this book; but if you are like me and read primarily for well-told story, you are likely to be disappointed.
B001QB9H10|4.0|The Transporter Collection ah jason  not to bad... but odd that he has rules  that  he ignores himself so easily whats it about?<br />Jason is a car driver  x military background his job is to transport  w/e  no questions asked and get paid
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. It is fun and fresh, and gets stuck in your head. They're is some minor language in the film add well as a few sexual references which are the only setbacks.
B000HT3PPG|4.0|Miracle on 34th Street this is the only one i ever seen --or perhaps fully seen--- a new modern version i never seen so  i cant compare... between the two--- know  that there isnt any magic  its all simple  but  a good story-- and the only movie that has ever shown me the macy's thanksgiving  parade i think it was thanksgiving-- i havnt re looked at the movie in awile.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Amazing movie about the need for men to be leaders in the home and vocational life. The movie inspires men to challenge the norm of the position of a father.
630469654X|3.0|fantasy  movie whats a ladyhawk where you see people  and a hawk on  dvd  case? let your fantasy  love  take you ehre to this  story and enjoy
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I loved it. I didn't really think I would enjoy a book about chefs and cooking  as much as I did this one. I have already recommended it to my friends as a very entertaining read.
B008RF0M9O|2.0|The fit is wrong. Quite often, when I put them on, I find that one cushion has come off, one side or the other. They seem to be too loose. I've had these headphones a long time. They awesome. But this is the first time this has happened.<br /><br />I'm a bass player and I use them every day for my practice sessions. Disappointing for sure.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|This game is Cool that it beats playing dragon games. Why do they make reviews so long to do one on a single game
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|I was excited to try this out, and for the first ten minutes it worked great. But it kept freezing, so I deleted and reinstalled it. I tried it three times, but no success. Is it because it was the free version? I may never know.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is one of the best asphalt games ever I've played 5 and 6 but eight is my favorite it has the best online too but the only thing wrong is that you barely get money and cars are expensive but I give it 5 stars
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive.... but I love it. Keep adding more levels and more challenges an  I will keep playing. I have  my mom addicted.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is a goofy but charming game that works for all Fires, with one small settings change for original Fires.  You get a funny little character and have to tap or swipe the screen as directed to save the little guy or gal.  For example, one of the first ones has piranha attacking,which you flick away.  You have to be fast!  Some times it's not clear at first how to perform the action, but eventually you get it.  You have three lives per round.  There is one character/level, the plane, that you can only play on the Fires with a microphone; you can turn that level off in settings.  Playable in airplane mode.  There is an ad that pops up, but it is suprisingly rare.<br /><br />Save the little guy/gal from trains, wasps, snakes, bears--all designed like paper cutouts, and some you don't see if you save the little character.  You unlock new characters as you progress through the game.  I really liked this one.<br /><br />It's whimsical, not gruesome at all.
B00DYOOGYK|2.0|This game map be fun for most (I did enjoy it) But this is a MASSIVE downgrade from Gangster Rio. The controls are awkward everything is overpriced and you no longer have the same details. Another thing is your gangster friends. Vegas doesn't really inplement this vital feature.
159315724X|5.0|LOVE this book! Admittedly the actual &#34;size&#34; of the paperback book was smaller than expected, but I just didn't look closely enough at the item details. Darren Hardy gives great, easy to grasp examples and visuals in this book that truly demonstrates the concept that it's not necessarily the big things, but the littlest changes added up over time that can yield the biggest results. It's very straightforward and a non-complicated, easy read. Would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in getting that extra little motivation or insight to begin changing their lives for the better.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|my daughter loved this cd. i purchased it for christmas last year. the cd is great. perfect gift for a twelve year old.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|it actually surprised me at how many songs I like Eminem. I'm just glad that most of them were on this one cd. my 1 favorite has to be space bound along with almost famous. but he does have another CD that I might end up purchasing later
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey stands for itself. Timeless entertainment, superb acting, wonderful sets and costumes...Characters that are larger than life..The very best!
B008JFUNHI|5.0|Ender's Game 4.5 stars★ (out of 5)<br /><br />I haven't read the book yet.  I plan to soon.  I did enjoy this movie.  A lot.  I just don't think it's a complete perfect movie.  It was all to quick and so much details to take in.  The run time of the movie is 114 minutes, just under 2 hours.  I think they could have lengthened the time.  Other than that, the movie was really good.<br /><br />The casting and acting was good.  Asa Butterfield was amazing as Ender.  He really had me believing that he could be the one to save Earth.  I liked that the cast for the youngsters were all fresh new faces or at least young like they should be.  Harrison Ford did ok in playing Colonel Graff.  He was a bit serious for this and I think that added to the edge.<br /><br />The, \\"simulations\\" were great.  The special effects for that was good.  There was a lot of space adventures (traveling, staying on a different planet, etc).  But I didn't think this went beyond the science fiction space silliness.  They did a good job in trying to keep this somewhat real.  I loved the battles in the battle room.  That was fun to watch and real edge-of-your-set stuff.<br /><br />Now I'm anxious to read the book.  That or see the movie again.
0805047905|5.0|When I worked with 2 year olds, this was the first book I got the whole class of ten to sit through. Imagine my surprise when they asked me to read it again!
B004RNPDX0|5.0|Had issue on the first delivery from FED EX just totally trashed the package as i got it and I had to reorder it and had UPS deliver it instead and got it the next day.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like having the stand available as well as having the protection for when my one and a half year old daughter gets her hands on it (and inevitably drops it). The only improvement I could suggest would be to have a way to charge the Kindle in the case without having to open it; right now, you can't access the charging port if the case is closed.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|These are some of the best sci-fi movies ever made!  Sigourney Weaver is brilliant, as well as the rest of the excellent casts.  This is an awesome collection to own.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great series.  If you've not watched it or read the books, it is something the whole family can enjoy.  Gets a little dark near the end of the series though.<br /><br />No issues with the disks. Didn't notice any difference in movie content between the American version and British version.  I think it's supposed to be a dialog difference.<br /><br />2 disks per case, standard case sizes (not thin pack). Deathly hallows case is a little wider as it contains 4 discs.
B008220BLG|5.0|this is such a cute movie and a welcome change on the usual &#34;zombie fare&#34; that is everywhere! thanks so much!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was so excited when I heard King was writing a sequel to the shining as its one of my favorites.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  I love how horribly human he makes the characters and how real he makes the supernatural stuff.  I hope they make a movie out of it!

B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is a fun book. It's short but cute. My little one really enjoyed it even though she is past the recommended reading age listed.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This album is absolutely incredible! Definitely recommended. It really is their best work since To Hell with the Devil. There is only one song I don't really care for and it is their cover of a Doobie Brothers song \\"Jesus is Just Alright.\\"
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|only okay...not my thing maybe.  It is so well liked everywhere, I tried it and just couldn't get into it.

B008YRVW0I|5.0|I don't usually spend any money on apps but the free version of Fishdom was very enjoyable, more so than the other aquarium games I've tried. I like that I can play games to earn money to buy things.

B000YJ54DU|4.0|I love reading anything Lee Child has written. No author even approaches perfection in writing. I certainly would not. Novels should be entertaining and Lee Child's novels certainly are, even when the author decides to put his own politically ideology into Jack Reacher's mouth in order to give his own political views a validity they would not attain if they stood alone. I'm willing to forgive this breech of trust. Writers work hard to produce good novels and they deserve a lot of leeway to indulge their whims, and we are all tired of being constantly at war. Our soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen are certainly paying a heavy price, but with no draft that is a choice we ourselves have made freely. This is a dangerous world that would be largely ruled by tyrants today if we had not stood up to oppose them in the past. In the Muslim world today we are now standing up against the latest form of tyranny that seeks to push America out of their segment of our  world so that their evil will face no effective opposition in the future. Imagine the world we would now live in if past tyrannies had prevailed, or our future world if this evil prevails today. We at still keeping the world free from enslavement to the tyranny of fundamentalist and radical Islam. This is not a war against a tactic, terrorism, it is a war against an ideology that seeks to enslave a portion of our world.  As the last superpower remaining standing, we will continue to face adversaries who's principle goal is to join in a coalition of like minded allies to diminish our freedom to act as they chose in their segment  of our world. That is why we went to war with Germany, and Japan, in World War II. If we had simply backed away from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, and let Nazi Germany have its way, that segment of the world would now be enslaved to an ideology that Britain and America would rightly consider evil. The new force for evil in the modern world is radical Islam, a danger to us and to the larger Muslim world, which is why we are involved in the Middle East now and have allies in the Muslim world. In promoting a Ron Paul-like unilateral disengagement from this struggle against the forces that wish to drive us from this part of the world today, Jack Reacher is not adding substance to his purported practical wisdom.to the larger Muslim world, which is why we are involved in the Middle East now and have allies in the Muslim world.

B002UXRH10|5.0|I enjoyed her last album that came out last year. this one is a great one to get if you are a fan of her music.
B008MA83HC|5.0|Very very good! Strongly recommend this CD. It has very good songs from Maná - specially number 7, that I liked the most!
B00428ZRFY|5.0|I enjoyed her stuff since i got in to her stuff this year. this is for any fan of hers.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Battle effects are awesome ! And I love the  robots names are funny and others are cool . I recommend it to everyone how love brawling games .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this. game . no complaints here . you must try it .  I love to play this on my kindle better then the computer. It's about time they got this ap for the kindle
B009NQLT0M|5.0|After reading several reviews about this fan, I decided to buy it. I replaced the noisy fan of my OUYA videogames console, and the difference in sound is amazing. I had to check if I was actually running the fan because barely hear. Also, the temperature of my equipment declined ~ 10°C. I recommend this product without a doubt.<br /><br />If you have an Ouya and want to replace the fan, here's a guide how to do it. youtube . com /watch?v=rra0FwlHvBA
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Awesome movie! Civil War buffs like myself will learn a lot. Fascinating movie and a Five Star performance by Daniel Day Lewis. You will actually believe that he is Lincoln. Sally Field also gives an admirable performance as Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln.
B00542UMIY|2.0|I bought this for my grandchild.  She loves dogs and normally likes to watch dog movies.  However, this did not hold her attention or mine for long at all.
B004FQX59I|5.0|Great thought provoking movie! Conspiracy theorists deride it but that's exactly why you should see it, judge for yourself. It makes sense on many levels. How could one lone gunman kill the president of the United States by himself? How on earth could Jack Ruby get into the Dallas Police building garage and murder Oswald in the midst of dozens of police officers? Who changed the parade route? Who ordered the bubble top taken off the presidential limousine? What role did LBJ, the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, or the Mafia play in President Kennedy's assassination? WHY would THEY have wanted Kennedy dead? Whether you believe the lone gunman theory, or think that there had to be a conspiracy on a much higher level, this movie will not disappoint.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Best movie this year by far.  The 3d is awesome and the extras are great, and the case is fantastic.
B001O4XWJM|5.0|One of my all-time favorite western movies. Ed Harris really &#34;knocked it out of the park&#34; with this one. He wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this film, an incredible undertaking. Acting is fantastic! Viggo Mortenson is outstanding in his role as Deputy Marshal. Watch this movie and you'll want to own it. I did.
B00E9PMML2|5.0|To get it out of the way, this trilogy is the equivalent of a Kardashian...nice to look at, but nothing of substance! But, my grandson wanted to see them and, at six years old, they were acted, directed and written on his level. So I was looking for a good cheap source and found it on Amazon. The seller had a great price on a set that was in perfect shape. Seller - 5 stars, trilogy - 1 star.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Pumped to finally see this on Kindle. Was looking forward to it for a long time. Duolingo is perfect for learning a lot of vocabulary quickly. I do recommend looking up conjugation tables for verbs in whatever language you're learning before getting too deep into the lessons. They don't take a lot of time to show you that aspect, but you'll need to know how to do it if you want to advance through the lessons.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not stop reading!  Only stopped reading when ABSOLUTELY had too!  Last chapter especially had me sitting on the edge of my seat!<br />  Now will start reading Mockingjay!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I've waited all year for the release of Allegiant after reading, and loving, the first two books in the trilogy. The book started out slow and never really picked up. I didn't get the anticipation that I did reading the other two. I found it easy to put this book down and almost had to force myself to finish it. As for the ending, to say I was upset was an understatement. I see that the author was trying to do something unexpected but the way she did it was awful. I feel there were better ways to end the book that wouldn't have pissed off a majority of the fan base.
B0035RFYT2|5.0|My daughter loves the Schleich toys. Great quality as always.  Sturdy, nicely painted and realistic. If you're getting these for a wolf lover confided getting deer or elk as well.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|KoRn returns to their roots with the return of Brian &#34;Head&#34; Welch, who had left the band in 2005 because of personal issues. With both guitars now, KoRn was able to produce that distinctive sound.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|It's a great buy. The narrative is funny and well-written through the point of view of the male. Quite an interesting take on relationship.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Hard to imagine Sam Vimes vacationing in the country, but he does...sort of. While not our normal tale of Ankh-Morpork, Snuff was a lot of strange fun. We had murder, goblins, loads of poo, and a very exciting boat ride down the Old Treacherous River. If you want intellectual stimulation, read something else, but if you want to be amused for a few hours, this will serve the purpose.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great to see the movie again, almost as good as seeing it in the movie theater.  Great special effects at home.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Logical, well-supported, and admirable... contrary to some portrayals of this book, Aslan is fair, even admiring, to the historical Jesus.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Very nice. I spent evening to enjoy this game.Recommended it to my friend. He was agree with me and getting fan too. Thank you very much.
B00DJZR46G|2.0|If I had heard this CD I would not have purchased.  The music is lovely but lyrics are like he is singing a story book.  Will listen one more time.......maybe it will grow on me.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of Steel's Blu-ray features some of the most interesting special features on a home video release that I've seen this year. It is also a visually and aurally flawless HD transfer, but at times the spectacle of it is thrown off by the clearly fake effects. It's interesting what aspects of the facade of movie making appear totally real on the big screen, but when put on the microscope that is a television contain only a fraction of the realism. Does this detract from the experience of watching the film? Only slightly, but the story's break-neck pace is what maintains its momentum and forces you to pay attention.<br /><br />Will the Man of Steel Blue-ray win over people that didn't like the film? It's possible. At times I felt the special features were more interesting than the movie, but not everyone will share my opinion on that. I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy the film as much on repeat viewings, but after dissecting the Blue-ray and watching the bombastic action sequences, I can say with certainty that I like the flick a lot. Fans won't be disappointed with what Snyder and company have in store for them here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm 9 and I love this game. Plus NO ONE can beat me. I can pass 7000 coins and im not lying.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's addicting<br />I love it and can't stop playing..wish it had more lives and extra moves without having to pay for them
B00A46H3J6|5.0|One of the greatest bands and albums of all time.  These songs have outlasted the grunge genre of music to become everlasting examples of what rock'n'roll is capable of.  They are iconoclastic and nostalgic.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview by Brandt Legg is an exciting story of four school friends on the run and has all the twists and suspense of a good thriller. The paranormal elements will also appeal to fantasy lovers. Can't wait to read the next one!

0385345054|3.0|This is a beautiful book, Worth the money because it is different and full of inspiring projects. I cannot give it more than 3 stars because I found the directions lacking. As far as crepe paper, luckily I travel to Mexico quite often and crepe paper or \\"Papel Mache\\" as it is also called there is found everywhere and very inexpensive.So that mostly solves the issue of finding that. I started making the \\"party sticks\\", I almost gave up. I found myself reading, re-reading again and again. The instructions run into one another from step to step.It is not clear what strips of paper you need for what. It is not in a bullet point format. There are pictures for all that you need to build the project but none showing what the project looks like after each step of building. Maybe a website to compliment the book to have a more detailed tutorial? I was finally able to make the party sticks for my daughters 11th birthday party. She loved them. I will continue to exercise patience and try to make other projects from the book. Good purchase you wont regret it,just difficult to follow along.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It's light but still challenging. Puzzles are fun and unique. Please create more levels soon!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Awesome writing,and Bryan Cranston was totally on his game. The entire cast made this show one of the best on tv,ever.

B002RKSZKI|5.0|I love Jane Austen.  Authentic dialogue.  Fut to read.  Almost like a history lesson.  This is a book that draws you into the subject matter and builds an intimate relationship between the reader and each character.  Highly recommended!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Movies are not made the same way any more.  I teach my grands the songs and listen to them singing the words in the English way ..  very cute.
0142501123|4.0|So fun! The 4 year old and 2 year old both enjoyed it. The rhyming was great! A new annual classic.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I play COD and BF3, this mouse is DOPE! Please buy! You can change the light color and it has alot of buttons, enough said.

I could not believe the ending...I never expected it...OMG!!!  George R.R. Martin is an amazing author!!! I would love to be able to get into his brain...his words...are outstanding...each step the characters take...make you beg for more!!! I am onto the next!!!

B004SEUJ82|5.0|I am moved by the power of this story. When people view the atrocities of WWII through the eyes of children, a more poignant impact is made.
B004XQO90O|4.0|At first, this movie was hard to understand about what was going on but I stayed with it and when it was over I watched it again and it is a fascinating science fiction movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I 'll always wonder about those people in their big RV's now just like I can't pass a street drain (while I'm walking my dogs) to look for clowns!  THANKS Stephen King! :)
B000I5XOVY|5.0|I saw this on TV and I love the plot and  I had to own it! Hugh and John are terrific and they make this movie great and worth watching.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I couldn't wait to get back to it, and then I was sorry to see it end.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I normally can't stand subtitles but they did not keep me from really enjoying this movie. It is a great story about friendship and commitment as well as finding humor in an otherwise challenging situation.
B005721W9O|5.0|Excellent movie. Today's movies can learn a thing or two about how to make an engaging movie without all of the nauseating CGI.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works well no problems.  Like the simple to read menu and the user friendly interface.  For the cost it can't be beat for the purpose.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train was a thoughtful and engaging story from America's past.  It's rich development of characters, historical facts and imaginative made this book a treasure to read.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Once again, Alan Jackson. comes through top notch! An excellent album! You will love Alan's bluegrass version even if you are not a bluegrass fan! Alan is a pure all American number one performer! Love this album!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The ratings are high because the book is great.  The best I have read in a long time.  Read the book and find it great
159102594X|5.0|&#34;The Blade Itself&#34; is a must buy, the first book of an absolutely fantastic trilogy that bends and breaks almost every single trope you've come to espect in modern fantasy books.<br />No more wonderful heroes with long manes of hair blown by the wind, no more elegant knights riding into the sunset.<br />A menacing brute, a braggart swordsman, a band of cutthroats and a legendary wizard are the protagonists of this first book that'll leave you holding your breath until you'll start reading the next one.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|great ebay app.  done a lot of shopping using this app its fast and easy. if you have saved searches u ll get notifications when new items are posted.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I purchased this product after seeing it on my relatives IPhone where it seemed to work fine. I downloaded it on my Kindle and it doesn't appear to work.  I read other reviews that said it was easy but I never found any clues after looking in several places. The drawer of the table would not open. I wouldn't recommend it for the Kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm left speechless. I read for hours straight and could not put this book down. I'm about to get the next!

B000FC2L1Y|3.0|I enjoyed the book. Did not like the back and forth of the characters but it all came together  at the end.

B002Q7JYPC|5.0|OMG!!! It is just wonderful.  There is a song in there &#34;What do I do with my Heart&#34;  is how I  basically feel because I just lost my husband.  It touches home.  But over all it is outstanding.  Thank you, thank you, thank you  :}
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I got this app for my Galaxy S4 yesterday &amp; it worked so well that i decided to get it for my Kindle today. I've managed to free over one GB of space on my kindle just by using this app to remove ad files &amp; unused files left over from apps i have uninstalled. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants more space on their android device.
B000062YAY|5.0|Make no mistake this isn't just any ordinary live album, its a Slayer Greatest Hits performed in front of a live audience. If your barely getting into Slayer, this album will convert you into a big time follower. And if your already huge a Slayer fan you'll love listening to this baby.
125000098X|4.0|Would have been 5 stars but I thought this one was going to be the end of a trilogy, it left me hanging to find out the outcome and now I have to wait for so long to find out what happens next.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|This book was OK but I liked it.I rate this book three stars!I am proud of myself and Read it!<br /><br />From,<br />  OM
0470474874|5.0|Great reference book.  So much information.  I prefer having a book to reference to while working on the computer.  Saves having to swich between screens.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|If you believe in dowsing rods and that spending money on clothes you can't afford will magically attract the money you need for a spectacular life, then this book is for you.<br /><br />If however, you are aware that dowsing is utterly unreliable and controlled by idiomotor responses, and that money spent on things you can't afford leads to... bankruptcy... then stay clear.<br /><br />If anything, this book left me feeling like a rube.  Like a villager someone was trying to scam out of a few rupees with a simple magic trick.<br /><br />Sad.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Love the book,  so much stuff that I will read it again and hight light more passages next time.  Thanks Tim
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Beautifully written, fully formed characters, awe-inspiring insight.  Not to mention the spotlight given to a precious work of art unfamiliar to many. To offer us this story, and this homage to The Goldfinch, is truly a gift that I appreciate on so many levels.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|I like you John Mayer. you just know how to write and record great music. i love the folk influences in this one, and the surprising duet with Katy Perry is good.
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|Enjoyable reading. I liked the twists but felt the medical back story was a little uninteresting at times. Unexpected ending.
B004EPZ034|5.0|If you love the Chipmunks this you will surely love. So much comedy and  a great story. The little girl chipmunks have a much bigger roll. You see them as much as the male chipmunks. A great entertainment for the whole family.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game but sometimes it clicks off before the end of the round and usually it is when I have several bongos. Please help.

B00FHATBGW|3.0|I was enjoying the game till I unlocked it. Now nothing is going right . I wish I had  never bought it. All the buttons are so close and extremely sensitive. Half the time I'm trying to find where I was. No I can't give this a five though at first I was really enjoying. I just  played a brand new game and it was fantastic.

B005LAIH2C|5.0|great movie and loved all the actors in it...was somewhat intense. Vampires gotta love it. would recommend to others. fast shipping
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|High quality app. I got it when it was the free app of the day, but I think i would have paid the .99 cents for something like it.  If you're looking for a moon phase app, this is a good one.
B00BT70J0Y|5.0|Sound is excellent. CD's are reproductions of original 33 album, so playing time is shorter. Still a great set & nicely boxed.
B00B5AIB14|1.0|Universal Records should be ashamed of themselves for such a shameful cash grab with this release.<br /><br />Disc 1- The first disc is simply the 2001 remaster, no different at all.  They left nearly 40 minutes on this disc completely empty of any bonus tracks when there are dozens of unreleased demo's, dubs, and songs from the Kaya sessions that could have easily been included, just as they have done with all of the previous Universal Deluxe Edition sets.<br /><br />Disc 2 - This disc is an incomplete live show from Rotterdam, Netherlands on July 7th, 1978.  They excluded two songs that are from (you aren't going to believe this) the KAYA album leaving only 1 track in the live performance from the actual album.  Crisis and Running Away were removed from the live set making the relevance of the live set almost nill.  Truly unbelievable and mind blowing as to how they came to this decision.  The two tracks excluded total about 15 minutes and could have been added to the first disc, while still leaving room for at least a half dozen unreleased tracks!  I had to go find the bootleg version of the show to get these two songs, burn them to CD and include them with my set.  Additionally, the sound quality on the live album is worse than the bootleg recordings found online!  They did not use the soundboard for this release, even though they have it and the whole show sounds ripped from an online source, and like the treble was tweaked.  Bob's vocals do not sound as good as the bootlegs available.<br /><br />Packaging - They have also really cheaped out on the packaging for this set.  The legendary plastic slip cover, which displays the signature \\"Deluxe Edition\\" has been completely eliminated leaving the cardboard double disc case just flopping around openly.  Unbelievably, they even trick us poor consumers into thinking this slip cover IS included by showing the slip cover on this very Amazon listing, displaying the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" text!  This proves they intended to include it but did not in an effort to pad their pockets with a few more pennies.<br /><br />I am truly shocked at how brazen Universal Records is to release such a shoddy rip off.  It's like they've become extremely dishonest and unscrupulous and do not care who knows it.  Zero bonus tracks, bad quality live show, missing songs from the live show, tricking us on the cover.  Just so overwhelmingly ridiculous.  The fact that they have released 5 great Bob Marley Deluxe Editions in the past also cements the fact that they know how to release quality collections, but for the sole purpose of bilking the fans and lining their pockets, refused to.<br /><br />I have been a massive fan of the Universal Deluxe Editions and have dozens upon dozens of them in my CD collection, including all five Bob Marley releases, which have all been fantastic.  However, the Kaya Deluxe Edition is just flat out unacceptable.  Universal owes us fans at least a refund, or more appropriately, a replacement release that coincides with the quality and content of all the other Bob Marley Deluxe Editions they have produced, and which we have come to expect.<br /><br />I truly feel ripped off on this one.<br /><br />Chris Elliott
B0084TWN9K|5.0|A surprising read.<br /><br />Each story is unique yet this writer brought me in and sat me down in the middle of each.  This is a book you can read many times.
B002VUFKG6|2.0|After reading Elizabeth Gilbert's book &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34; I expected her next book &#34;Committed&#34; to go on from there. I expected it would be about her new life with a new husband whom she adored. I was completely taken back as I read finding not the love story I expected, but a commentary on the &#34;History of Marriage&#34;.  I did make the conscience decision to read every word because I really like her as an author. What I found was quite interesting. I discovered that I learned more about marriage, its traditions and customs, than I did when I was in college in 1966 in a class called &#34;History of, customs and traditions of Marriage&#34;. She did a very good job of that. If I could do one thing for Elizabeth Gilbert it would be to somehow get her to understand that she does not need a guarantee. She is able to make a choice without studying it to death. I wish her well and hope she has found the happiness and peace she seems to want so badly.  How can she miss. She is living with a wonderful man in a wonderful place, a little remodeled church in the woods. Can't get much better than that.

B00E0SX118|5.0|I've lost track of how many times the kids have begged to watch this movie and we've actually watched it.  I can probably recite the whole thing from memory already and yet I still find myself watching it, laughing with the kids, and tearing up...you'll know when you get to the spot I'm talking about.  Nick Cage as the voice of the dad...wonderful...
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie has so many moments where you just think - they wouldn't do that or say that or behave that way. But it<br />has excitement and is fun to watch for the action. If you actually care about plots making sense, forget it.<br />SEMI- SPOLIER ALERT - the ending - why don't they even need to slow down as they pass him - he looks the same<br />walking down the hall.<br />I don't want to go into too much detail so I left that vague to avoid spoiling it. But the whole movie is pretty stupid.<br />Just a lesser zombie movie. It has some cool moments, so I couldn't give it only 2 stars. The pharmacy guy though!<br />And what about that mexican kid??? Did I blink and miss him joining them? And that plane crash- cool but, um, ...no.
0425166805|4.0|If you have watched 50% of the Ancient Aliens TV series then this will not teach you anything new. However it was a great read, not long and drawn out over any single topic, the author makes a point to give you diverse idea's and typically leaves the determination up to you (not imposing his opinion on you harshly, just giving you the facts as he finds them and allows you to make the conclusion).<br /><br />I would suggest this to anyone who feels interested. Great bang for the buck!
B00CHVJODE|2.0|This movie wasn't funny. It wasn't well written. It was boring. It did not keep the attention of either the children or adults who watched it with me. Glad I waited to pay $1.20 at the Redbox to watch this; if I'd spent the $45 it minimally costs to take 2 adults and 1 child to a movie, I'd have felt robbed.
140006922X|1.0|As I read this book, I realized the author is simply trying to advance the goals of islam by making Jesus &#34;just a human&#34; and not &#34;God's son&#34; as Christians believe. Anything a muslim writes about Christianity and about Jesus Christ should be taken with a grain of salt because of its self serving nature and because of the fanaticisim of muslims.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This album is great and includes a lot of the favorites, including two versions of &#34;Born This Way.&#34;  Just another one of Lady Gagas' successes!!!

0802473156|5.0|For anyone who wants to be the best partner they can be in a relationship, this book is a must-read. It is always good to be aware of the various ways in which your significant other feels most loved so you can make him/her feel safe and comfortable in the relationship.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|For those who like hunting game s, you need to get this! It's a great game and the only thing bad about it is that you can run out of energy!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies ever!  The nudity really isn't necessary but it doesn't offend me like I am sure it does others. I love all the different stories and how they intersect. Great actors, great story and I watch it every year. So many different kinds of love.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A gripping sequel to the first that left me wanting to read more.<br />This is seven more words and an extra.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was a good book. So as the others, can't wait to read Mark of Athena. If u like reading books about monsters then read Rick Riordan books.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|As a die hard, long time fan of Les Miserables I had to get this. I've seen it a few times on PBS and I really wanted to have it. The casting is amazing and in the end they even bring out the original 1985 cast to sing a few songs. It's basically Les Miserables without the action between songs. I personally like this, I love to have it  on in the background when I'm doing homework or housework. It's still beautiful and dramatic.
0451419243|3.0|First off, the Follett factory continues to produce highly readable novels. At 900 pages this one covers the years leading up to WWII and the war. For me I found many of the plot lines as having been done in many other novels and movies. There are many characters but each is fairly easy to classify and anticipate. The fascist English lord, the noble hard working maid, the earnest welsh coal miner, the ever evil German SS from lowly beginnings, the noble but suffering gays, and all the women even if they start out evil turn good. By the time you hit Pearl Harbor you realize its time to start the same plot as the movie. There is even a bit from a Bridge to far. It gets to be a lot. There is historical detail which to the uninitiated will be entertaining. I wouldn't recommend this book as a stand alone. If you read the first one and like it, lower your expectations (alot) and you'll probably get through this one.
B00C7607BC|4.0|A young sanitation engineer follows her dreams of transitioning over the objections of her family, friends, and gate-keeping healthcare provider, and finds true love and happiness.
0553103547|5.0|Awesome!One of the best books of all time! A song of ice and fire not not a series to miss out on, in anyone's lifetime!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|I hated this movie so much, my husbands detailed reviews sum up my opinion precisely. Reviews will tell you &#34;Flight&#34; starring Denzel Washington, is a &#34;riveting and powerful thriller.&#34; It is not. There is about five minutes of interesting Airmanship in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. After that it is a boring crapfest about alcoholism. It's two hours and eighteen minutes of nothing. Garbage. Don't even watch it if its free. It won't be worth the time of you burned to watch it. You can better spend that two-plus hours of your life watching a cat sleep, or some paint dry, or a corner do nothing. Light yourself on fire maybe. Any of these choices would be better use of your time than watching this movie. The cat sleeping is probably the best one. I would sue someone but I didn't pay to see this cinematic refuse, except with my life, two hours of it. I don't think I can get that back, even if I won the lawsuit. That would be great if I could get it back. Maybe I'd watch &#34;Last of the Mohicans&#34; again. The excellence of that movie could erase the memory of the horribly depressing and suicide-inducingly boring travesty that was &#34;Flight&#34;. Look, I've only seen one movie that sucked more than this. It was &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; which starred Daniel Day-Lewis who was, ironically, also the lead in &#34;Last of the Mohicans.&#34; &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; was so terrible I had nightmares. Not about any of the things that happened in it, just that I was still watching the movie. I hope when I go to sleep tonight I don't see Denzel  Washington. I'll be pissed and there will be nothing I can do about it because I chose to hit PLAY. I could have hit myself in the face with a hammer for two hours but no, I watched &#34;Flight.&#34; I could go on for a while but I need to go to bed and try to sleep. I bet I won't because I'll still be thinking about this terrible, awful movie but whatever. Good night. Gah! ! ;qghoiw hagoawig kflykf w4hghz. Sorry. I punched the keyboard a couple of times.hz. Sorry. I punched the keyboard a couple of times.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Every time I have played this game against the computer it either always wins or when I am close to winning it says &quot;stalemate&quot; . Really? Cause I saw several more moves that would allow me to win. And this is on the easiest setting.<br /><br />Maybe if you are playing a friend it isn't a problem but the computer refuses moves that let you win and are legal OR will quit the game before you win.<br /><br />Too frustrating to keep trying.
B002UHSDUK|2.0|Love foo fighters music, songs are great.  For me this mp3 album just doesn't sound good in my car (which has a decent stereo), computer, anywhere.  Seems like all mids, it is fatiguing to listen to, just doesn't sound good out of the box like most mp3/cds.  Not enough of an audiophile to explain this better, sorry.  Maybe the cd or other versions sound better?
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|I haven't found it to be glitchy. It doesn't ask you to keep buying stuff. There are lots of levels to play. It's easy to pick up on how to play- my 3 yr old can play the lower levels, but it's more challenging as you progress.
B004GYY714|5.0|Dependable, easy to use, and really reliable! Other apps just can't compete with this one for stations on almost any genre. I rely on it!
B000GFKUEK|5.0|The recordings here are top rate.  The sound is excellent and the interpretation (organ settings) are superb.  Also,  the price was excellent making this a very nice addition to one's organ music collection.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It's good, but it's limited in size of things you can view of course. I use it often, and have found things there while I was  away from home.
B00F8H0FNW|5.0|I checked this book out from the library a few months ago and fell in love with the company. I have not had the pleasure of visiting their bakery, but you can tell these guys know their stuff.<br /><br />The book is beautiful, the pictures are amazing, and the recipes are incredible. I just got the ebook and glad I can just stare at the pictures for days.

B00D555BBU|5.0|Finally a decent e-mail program for the Kindle Fire! Easy to set up and very configurable. Definitely the best out there.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This rating deserves a 5 star because  I like the way it kept me looking for more & more; very exciting and well played out.  There is nothing that I disliked about this sequel, I was just so happy when Christian was still alive. That was a very touching read.  I would definitely recommend this book to all my friends.
B00D3PYQT0|5.0|More happens in a single episode of this series than in an entire year of other regular TV programming. Character development is just amazing.
B001NIAQ9I|1.0|Can't seem to get anything but audio. Really disappointed since this is one of my favorites. I do hope someone can look into this so it can be enjoyed.
B008Q00OZM|5.0|Having grown up with the original Star Trek series, I howled with laughter at this movie. No, I am not a Trekkie but did like the series as a kid.  Tim Allen gives one of his best performances doing a royal send up of Captain Kirk (does the tumbling make it better?).  Alan Rickman is also brilliant but then he always is.<br /><br />My only beef is that once again (!!!!) the minute I buy a movie, Amazon puts it on Prime about a week later!!  I am either going to stop buying movies or drop Prime..

B008220C38|1.0|I'm 17 and Anna Karenina is one of my favorite books, it has so much depth, and so many beautiful subtleties... and I was looking forward to the movie. The translation I have (of the book) is 817 pages long, so I completely understand how it would be a terribly great ordeal to fit everything into a couple-hour film. The problem lies in the lack of depth, in the director's attempt to put satire and theatre to use where it shouldn't have been. Tolstoy's own satire and reality are almost completely masked. His subtle truths that could have been presented so beautifully on screen... were nauseatingly left out.<br /><br />I couldn't even get halfway through it. It's truly an insult to Tolstoy's great work, but I commend the person who read the book, enjoyed it, and attempted to put it on screen. I'm Orthodox and was curious to  see how they would present that aspect, such a part of Russian culture itself. Hopefully someone will produce a more accurate representation sooner or later. I think the intent of the director truly counts here, there has to be a longing to share such a story with those who may never read the book, profit will follow accordingly!<br /><br />+1 for the soundtrack, Marianelli can never be beat...I completely recommend Jane Eyre and its accompanying soundtrack.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I know the director made this movie to try to copy the old eastern monster movies from the 60's. Well he did it successfully. If you remember the plots were stupid, bizarre and plodding. Hey same here. It's really the fight scenes that are entertaining. But the inconsistencies! Why are you beating the monsters with your fists when you have a sword. Hit them with a boat and cause a bruise when you have A SWORD that will cut off their heads.  If you are a 12 or less buy this movie. Explanations why events turn sharply in the movie are revealed in a vague and authoritarian manner(or not at all). Who edited this mess? Characters develop serious relationships in a nanosecond and without explanation. Characters are themselves disjointed. The director must have been stoned, no he needed to be stoned.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The Goldfinch presents readers with a series of dilemmas: ethical, legal, social, familial and romantic as we watch the narrator grow from boyhood to manhood in a very contemporary setting. Though some of the events stretched credulity for me, so do many daily headlines.  As an art museum junkie, I enjoyed the art elements more than the drug elements.  The ending goes off on a philosophical tirade that should have been edited down but otherwise it is a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS ADDICTING AND FUN , I RECOMMEND  IT TO  ALL AGES . TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT
B00FHATBGW|3.0|I play on the Kindle Fire 1st generation. I am left-handed,  and always look to see if there is a section in the &quot;options&quot; that can be checked off for that.<br />That being said,  I cannot believe that no one else,  of these reviewers so far,  has had the problems with the tap response that I have encountered with this game. So far,  I have un- and re-installed this FIVE times,  and it happens every time. I have also sent a &quot;problem with app&quot;  report about this.<br />The need to keep tapping an item,  over and over,  takes away from the enjoyment and flow of the game. In the part where you have to hammer the 4 nails in order to make that &quot;bridge&quot; was so frustrating. I counted that the last nail took twenty attempts before it took.<br />I know how to play these games; I know my Kindle. There is a problem with the game app,  and,  therefore I will not buy the unlock until it works properly.<br />I would love to hear from my fellow point-and-click adventure game players if they have encountered problems with this game,  and any one with 1st generation Kindle Fires.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I enjoyed each Matrix, except the last one - very much..  and have always wanted to own them, to be able to watch them over again.. this is great because they are all in one case, and you get the entire collection!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A cleverly crafted story that demonstrates  how the characters created their own reality. Denial, rationalization, and highly defended facades described with honest insight. Many many plot twists.
1476733953|1.0|I, like many of the other 1 star reviewers, feel duped.<br /><br />I've bought many book from Amazon's \\"recommended\\" list, have held in great esteem 5-star books before, and have never been so utterly disappointed in a purchase like I was with \\"Wool\\".<br /><br />The premise is interesting, but the writing is well, horrible. It's amateurish beyond belief, and the writer has swapped any character development, dialog, and general storytelling with overly wordy descriptions of inanimate objects. The science is way off [the lower you are, the colder it gets?], the characters are too stupid to live [can't invent an elevator but can dismantle a generator?] and general reasoning is ridiculous [one person doesn't clean means war?].<br /><br />How so many people seemingly refuse to see through the hype of this book to the fact that it is a poorly executed example of the SF genre [and writing in general] is beyond me. I'd love to know where all those 5 star reviews have come from, and what sort of books those people typically read.<br /><br />Abysmal writing.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|fun read. page tuner. not very philosohical but enjoyable, especially for gamers. the 80s references are a fun flash back too
193700788X|1.0|Like so many I hated this final book of the series.  I'm so glad I found a free paperback copy and did not pay the Kindle price.  Okay, so Sookie and Sam had to end up together. Yada yada yada.  But why destroy the character of Eric? I have loved Eric ever since the shower scene. I loved him when he bought Sookie a new coat. I loved him when he fixed her driveway after it never occurred to Bill to do it.  I loved him for always being there for her, albeit in his own way.  CH did not need to destroy Eric.  I'll never forgive her, and will never read another CH book.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|At first I was a little confused by the format of this book but it didn't take long for me to figure it out and become completely obsessed. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about reading it or talking to other people about reading it. I am so glad I kept reading beyond the first few chapters.
B009EQG80W|5.0|It's a book to read, and think, and read again, and think again. Lots of deep philosophy thinking and idea to digest from, but the longer you read, the more you would understand it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I really enjoy playing this game and find it hard to step. However,revives and most costumes require tokens and they cost money. I'm on a fixed income so I can only afford a few each month or else I can't afford necessities or other luxuries.
B00F031X62|5.0|This is a show recorded at a time when songs like Foxey Lady ,Hey Joe ect.. were still tolerable and fun for Jimi to play, so those early songs and the rest are played with a freshness and fire that would eventually evaporate due to Jimi's musical growth, wanting to move on to other things..<br />Hey Joe- begings with Jimi turning the volume all the way up and creating a wall of feedback as he uses cord voicings,3rds,hammer on's the wha wha pedal and whammy bar, to make beautiful music out of feedback as he lauches into one of the best versions (my opinion)of Hey Joe.  I like the Monterey Hey Joe and the Berkeley versions the best, I now put this one up there with those as one of my favorites.<br />Foxey Lady- is scorching white hot and Jimi is having lot's of fun playing it (just look at the video)<br />Fire- a high octane version, like most are,but again these songs at this time are not frustrating for Jimi to play and you can tell he's having a good time playing it.<br />Tax Free- A rude,dynamic smokin hot early version of this tune that's shorter than the Winterland versions as Jimi was still developing it,Jimi makes Jimi use out of the whammy bar and wha wha petal as he drives Mitch and Noel as fast and hard as they could be driven.<br />I Don't Live Today- absolute feed back laced assault- sounds of guided missles flying, H- bombs  expolding ,sounds of rocket ships taking off and crashing,are all simulated by Jimi coaxing feedback from his stratocaster and rocking the living daylights out of this song.<br />Hear My Train A Comin'- This is a new song for Jimi and the band, it's not as formulated as it later would be, so really shouldn't be compared to other versions  like Berkeley ect.. as he says we only played this once before, so you can hear them at times feeling around the song, but who cares! Jimi burns when he solo's and there are things done on this version that on later vesions you wouldn't hear.<br />Red House- This is a really unique version- (they all are) this one, mostly beacuse Jimi puts down his strat , as he sometimes did for this tune( Stockholm 69 playing a Gibson SG, Isle Of Wright playing the Flying V) and plays this one with a Gibson Les Paul (its' obvious by the tone,sound and riffs Jimi's playing-Jimi had a black 55' Les Paul that had the \\"Bigsby tremlo whammy bar\\" that you can hear him using and there's a picture on back of the booklet from that day with Jimi playing the Les Paul, you can see some better pic of It- @[...]<br />During the first few minutes Jimi is getting a warm ,bluesy tone as he plays some really beautiful licks and runs while singing, Jimi starts to solo and plays some of his best blues riffs and expressions you'll ever hear on Red House ,  ( my fav's -Randalls Isle, San Diego,Isle Of Wright and now this version)intensifying and building up to the point where at 5:30 all hell breaks loose as Jimi turns it all the way up unleashing all the volume, power and fury from his amps and taking the blues where only Jimi could take them.<br /> I have to give this cd 5 stars beacuse of the bands preformance and Jimi's guitar playing,which is all top notch.<br />Mitch Mitchel and Noel Redding provide a tight, flawless backup for Jim and all of his unpredicable cues and spontaneous playing.

0486274268|5.0|Our daughter is working hard to become a math/science focused teacher for elementary and middle-school age students, and has been doing very well in the classroom and in the field.<br /><br />However... the girl just could not draw at all -- not even stick figures -- and she really wanted to learn how to improve her ability to draw so that she might be able to use those skills to help make points in the classroom. That's an admirable goal; she is trying to do everything she can to help improve her ability to teach.<br /><br />The pictorial materials in this book began to help her visualize how animal drawings should be conceived, as a build from detailed understanding of the animal itself. By looking through them and then tracing over the drawings, she gained better understanding (and now at least her cats look like cats and not alligators...).<br /><br />Combined with a few other instructional books like Fast Sketching ([[ASIN:1581800053 Fast Sketching Techniques: Capture the Fundamental Essence of Elusive Subjects]]) and Drawing Realistic Faces ([[ASIN:1581802161 Secrets to Drawing Realistic Faces]]), she really has come a long way in the last year.<br /><br />Highly recommended as part of a learning program.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|I am a little torn about this last book. I really loved the series - yes, everyone compares the initial books to Vampire Academy (which I LOVE), but I had always found Aiden to be even better than Dimitri because Aiden was just as hot, bad-ass, fiercely loyal & protective as Dimitri, but didn't have the long hair/ponytail and crop-duster-jacket-Russian-weird-cowboy thing going on. BUT Aiden went down a tiny notch in this book IMHO. There were too many lovey-dovey scenes between Aiden and Alex (and I'm on Team Aiden vs. Seth), and not enough hot tension. Aiden never got a chance to defend or save Alex, they never got to battle together (or against each other which I thought were some of the best chapters in Vampire Academy) and he was a bit too soft and sappy. The only swoon-worthy Aiden moments were when he was in his Sentinel uniform and his muscles would ripple or flex or clench or whatever. I needed a bit more.<br /><br />Alex is even whinier and moodier than Rose, and almost seems incompetent without Seth or Aiden. I get that this book was her final book to shine, so Aiden had to be more of a supporting character, but he just seemed to lack the elements of being a leading man, so I was disappointed here and couldn't give this book 5-stars. Four stars for the overall awesome series, many adventures in this last book, and for tying out relationships without crushing our souls (anyone read Allegiant?!).<br /><br />I add my vote to the many for a Seth series! I am still on Team Aiden but Seth deserves a spinoff series after what he did in this book. I will leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Perses was a riot and I hope Seth and him team up in the spinoff series to wreak more havoc in Vegas.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Cute, fun movie served with a big helping of innocence and environmental friendliness.  Funny situational laughs and jokes that make this movie both fun and funny to watch, especially for the elementary age group of viewers.<br /><br />Well done and recommended.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good first have, building suspense gradually and working in some interesting legal theories. 2nd half is a letdown. Creates surprises by just changing the facts. Gets a lot of legal stuff wrong. And towards the end just gets so contrived and hokey that you wonder why you spent this much for such a mediocre effort. It's still a good read, it's just not what you'd expect from Grisham.

B003Y5H4SO|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I had little interest in it. After all, the memory of M. Night Shyamalan's colossal flop,THE HAPPENING was still etched in my brain! Plus, it was about five people trapped in an elevator for 90 minutes. How could that possibly be interesting? Well, I finally watched DEVIL and was shocked by how wrong I had been!  Directed by Eric Dowdle (QUARANTINE, THE POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES), DEVIL (written by Shyamalan) is a fantastic supernatural horror / thriller about Satan, God, fate, sin, and  redemption. Shyamalon's script is probably the best thing he's written since THE SIXTH SENSE, packed w/ mystery, suspense, and outright chills!. The characters are interesting and believable, especially those in the elevator. We get to witness the battle between heaven and hell played out in this confined space, while the police, fire department, and others scurry around outside. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and recommend it highly...

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Whoa!  Almost as scary as the Exorcist.  I've been watching and reading horror for over 5 decades and this one got to me.  If you want a good spooky scare, get this!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love music by Adele.  She writes and sings meaningful words as well as beautiful melodies.  I will buy more of her music.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|derp lotto kinda hard to understand but I got used to it extemly fun and build a lot of wind genetaors
0670024856|5.0|Very interesting novel with a bang up ending. There were a couple of times when I said to myself &#34;What is going on and what next?&#34;  but by the end it was more than worth it. Gave it on to my daughter with a strong recommendation.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Good Neil Gaiman book,now I'll go back and read Sandman, because it felt unfinished and I want to know the rest of the story. His characters are always interesting. The fact that they are often children  experiencing scary adults is very evocative.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I wanted to get a linkin park CD but I didnt like their newest one so I chose this one, I love how soothing the music is, but also I really liked their old music. Their new music is different, but I like to say if its not broke dont fix it. Anyways the music on this CD was awesome.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I found the story inspirational and well written. It was an honest recollection of one women's struggle to find herself and sort out where she was going in life.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I'm so glad that they decided to come back. I was not sure about buying music online at first cause I never have before(usually from a store) But I wanted to get it so badly I could not wait. Anyways, the only thing I really disliked was the CD case. Its just a folded type piece of card board, It doesnt really protect the CD much. I would have also really liked a booklet with some pictures of the band and lyrics. But the CD and the music is good and it was packed up good.
B00280LYIC|3.0|all the other reviews say it and i will to. it is almost a complete knockoff of harry potter and you cant knock off harry potter. plus it is trying to much to appeal to gangster kids, and that is not good. it is still a good.book though so give it a shot.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book reads fast and I enjoyed it to the very last page as the characters are very real, the story takes new turns quite some time and until you end you keep wondering: who killed the judge? A very nice piece of work, very original!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|After all this time, it is still a catchy tune. I love the way she sings it to me.  yeah me.  yeah, stand up... #%^@&**$#  Yeah Me!
B00F2HW20M|4.0|If you liked the old classic Genesis this is a must have. Since nobody in Genesis wants to the re-live the past I am glad Steve Hackett did. This is a great show with many guest singers and guitarists from various progressive rock bands. Steve played with Genesis between 1971-77 and the material on the DVD/CD is from that time. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating because like the other reviews the DVD has a flaw on&#34; I Know What I Like&#34; where there is a slight pause for a couple of seconds. Definitely a tech error that needs fixed. I think there is too much gigabytes on the one disc and some of the music should have been put on the second DVD with the &#34; Making Of....&#34; part. Also the music could fit on two CD's instead of three. Hopefully if a Blue-ray comes out these issues will be fixed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works really well, Using it all the time to stream music. Can't wait for the api<br />to be free to see what's going to happen.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|very fun game. though menu's are not very clear at all. stuck on one mission and cannot progress any further
B00F35BV64|4.0|good picture we enjoyed it a lot missed the last part the boys loved it they enjoyed it if you like star trek
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|best hunting game i have played on the kindle so far. great selection of weapons. would add camo and cwll options.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I work three jobs. At night when I come home I like to play games on my kindle to relax and wind down. I really like these puzzle/adventure type games and this game was WAY to addicting to not purchase the full version. It was well worth my money and it is intriguing yet relaxing at the same time! I recommend it!!
0375851569|5.0|Perfect. The box set looks great. The stories are the same as I remember and my 5 month old baby loves the bright colors Dr. Seuss is known for. If I had bought each book individually, it would have been much more expensive. This was perfect.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes my Pinterest job so much easier &amp; twice as fun on my Kindle! It's so nice and handy to go from reading to pinning whenever I need a Pinterest fix! I just love it!!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Great product. The quality of the images is outstanding, specially when seen in a HD screen. Would buy from this seller again.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Book one took me back 50 plus years to reading Sherlock Holmes as a youngster, every chapter weaving a possible solution so different than the prior chapter.  Had a difficult time putting down for the night on more than one occasion.
1449305172|5.0|Great book that very effectively focuses on the methodology of defining a SaaS product and business model.  Start here.<br /><br />If you can't define your business on a lean canvas, you don't have a business.  Back up, stop wasting resources, and focus on the right thing at the right time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Me like bingos. Me like play bingos on kindle. Me like it when person scream bingo when me gets bingos. You play bingos. We be friends.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is the best racing game I've played on ky tablet. Very realistic! Cars are way too pricey but the game is definitely fun and exciting
0425256162|3.0|Very slow build-up and a quite forgettable ending. Unfortunately I could not empathise at all with any of the characters so ultimately did not care at all what happened to any of them.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|Lovely to know about my curlies, I can wait to start taking care of my hair, finally very good information, I think that I would like more information of growing my hair and pregnant status
B00DNUSFWE|5.0|What a classic!  It's nice to have the Universal Monsters on Blu-Ray separately,  This one is one of the best!  It also has some great insights by other filmmakers on how this film influenced them,  I enjoyed it very much!
006202406X|5.0|Allegiant is a phenomenal book, just like the others 2, if not better. Why I say that? Allegiant is filled with meaningful moments and words. While you're reading it, you just can't stop wondering yourself the things that this book brings to you, because if you read it between the lines, Allegiant just speaks to you even when you don't feel like wanting to express yourself. I learned so much with this trilogy, each one had something different from me, all good things for sure. I can't list the things that I got from this book because there are SO many, but trust me, they were all worth it. And now you ask me ''Did you really liked that much? What about the end?'' I honestly think that there would not be a BETTER ending for this AMAZING trilogy that I adore so much. If you really read the book, with open heart and eyes, you understand why this should be the end. Tris is a hero but she's also human, a normal girl that loves her family and friends more than anything. Her death should be and was realistic, because she died for a important reason, she's a revolutionary. Her journey is filled with determination, bravery and love, specially in Allegiant, showing that she's done everything she could have done and did it all right. Her death just showed that even more, because now she's not just a normal girl or a hero, she's now the face of everything that this trilogy lives for. Love, Bravery, and everything else. Was I sad? Of course. Not just because is the last one, but because I feel like I lost a very kind friend of mine and even though I think she deserved a good and long lasting life with Tobias, I understand her death and I accept it. Just like I said, I think was the perfect ending for the perfect trilogy.The meaning of her death is so beyond her not being there anymore, specially with Tobias. Tris is the strongest character I know and she'll always be remembered for all the things that she was and did. Congratulations Veronica, I could not be prouder of you, thank you so much.  \\"I'll say it one last time: Be brave.\\"
1892005034|5.0|If you have ever had issues with interpersonal relationships (and who hasn't?), this gives you a whole new way to look at the self/other dynamic, and gives you a way to deal with people in a way that will make you a happier person overall.  Even if you don't think you need help with interpersonal skills, Rosenberg draws some fundamental truths into his work that can enrich anyone's view of themselves and the rest of the world.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is probably the most epic online game I've ever played it is Sooooo fun I almost play it night a there's nothing to not like about it the graphics are awesome the the types of game modes are awesome even the classes are awesome and the best part is that it's free!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Though I am a Christian and the author certainly does not believe in the divinity of Jesus, his work I think is respectful of those who are Christian, perhaps because of the influence on him of his wife and mother whom I believe are Christians. Too, I thought his support for the historical Jesus positively influenced my Christian faith; so at the conclusion of the book, I felt that my Christianity, my faith, were stronger and positively rather than negatively impacted by Aslan's work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app for my children it is dealt fun they tell me look mommy there's victor and they say come on lets get Dave for the minion of the year
B00BEIYMTW|1.0|Planes in horrible this is Cars all over again, Dusty is Lightning, Chug is Mater, Skipper is Doc Hudson, Dottie is Guido, Ripslinger is of course Chick Hicks. I am guessing they only used the first draft of script from Cars.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Enjoyed this Harry Bosch offering though I found it slightly dry and factual. I'd like the Mickey Haller relationship to feature in his next book. The father daughter vibe is very American and doesn't always sit easily with a European sensibility which tends to be less effusive and, dare I say it, less mawkish.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Flawlessly spun, this yarn caressed the souls of those righteous Gentiles who risked their tenuous positions to save lives. The insight and tenderness gave this horrible time in history a deeply relatable and touchable face.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart was a fun and riveting book from an author who is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  Though the idea of regular humans gaining super powers is by no means a new one (ie Heroes, Alphas, etc) Sanderson puts an interesting twist or two in his version.  The characters are well written and developed (a Sanderson trait) and while I was able to predict a couple of the major reveals, the story was so well written I enjoyed it anyway.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Is a murder mystery for want of a better description. It also has elements of a horror story. I have now read three of Gillian Flyns books. The lead character as in all three books is a flawed person but manages to solve the mystery in a bumbling way. There is a little humour as the story progresses. I was kept guessing until the end.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I have three of Gillian Forbes' books now and this one is in the same style, with quite a lot of subtle humour, usually at the expense of the lead character or her family. The story is a murder mystery leaning towards a horror story. The lead character is a flawed but likeable person as in her other stories. She manages to solve the mystery in her bumbling way and I was kept guessing right until the end.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Always loved the wizard of Oz and this is a great way to comprehend how the Wizard got to where is was at the end of the Movie.  3 D aspect of the movies added a lot to the enjoyment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! Very additive!  Great for unwinding after long day at the office. Play levels against friends and family for an extra twist of fun.
B005DESVPO|5.0|Gary Clark Jr. is a very talented musician.  The Bright Lights EP compact disc is an exceptional acoustic piece of work.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I LOVE MUSICALS. This one is a CLASSIC!  I was very impressed with all of the cast and their ability to sing!  If you like musicals you will enjoy this movie.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|much like the previous two quell games this is a well made and thought out game with an added story line.  I've merely begun but am enjoying myself.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Ahhhhhh. What a disappointing end to an otherwise awesome series. I feel like the only emotion the author got right here was grief and by that point it was too late. Too much was spelled out. Not enough leg  to the imagination and just overAll disappointing compared to the other 2. Sorry ms. Roth. I enjoyed the series but hated this novel.
B008JEJPT6|4.0|Love the bright pink color.  FIts like most crocs shoes.  Great for wide feet and for going to the beach!
B0000524CY|1.0|I am all for adding new scenes to older movies if it can enhance the product and bring some insight that may not have been available in the original release.  But this movie completely bombs in its attempt to do any such thing. In fact, this release kills everything about the movie.<br /><br />What they basically did was add every scene that was left on the cutting floor of the original movie and threw it in this one. It is incredibly long and boring with no continuity.  They killed the original. I was so fed up by hour one that I tossed it and will now buy the original like I should have done in the first place.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best I have read in a long time... it gets to your heart and makes you want to read more....

B006YMLE7G|5.0|Great movie and awesome animation. It is a must see movie and I would recommend to any big anime fan.
0679805273|5.0|This is an inspirational and yet  realistic book. Definitely a must have in every child's and adult's library.<br />A thumbs Up!
0763617105|5.0|My 3YO loves this book.  It's so sweet and touching, most small children will be able to identify with the worry that these small owls feel when they can't find their mama, and feel reassured at the happy ending that parents will come back.
B00DVZ414C|5.0|Important note: Amazon groups both the CD AND vinyl reviews together. When reading a review take note of the format being reviewed. Now on with my review:<br /><br />Though listed on the package as the \\"Soundtrack\\" for this new Coen brothers film (due 12/20/13), which was \\"inspired by\\" the life of folk music icon Dave Van Ronk, I'm virtually sure that these are not the the same recordings you will hear in the film. I did have a chance to see the film in a preview and a Q&A with the film's star Oscar Isaac (but reviews are embargoed until release date) and have read the press notes. The Coens wanted the actors, who do their own singing and playing in the film, to be used to the music, so Music Producer T-Bone Burnett made studio recordings first and then the actors performed live, again, during the filming. But that doesn't affect the review of the CD, it just clarifies some things.<br /><br />Like their previous film \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\", the Coens incorporate traditional music in the film, but this time there are more complete numbers. The opening cut on the CD \\"Hang Me, Hang Me\\" fills the first three minutes of the film, and most of the songs on the CD are performed complete. The next-to-the-last track - a previously unissued version of \\"Farewell\\" by Bob Dylan is only excerpted in the film and the closer, Van Ronk's version of \\"Green Green Rocky Road\\" is played over the closing credits.<br /><br />The Coens state that they did not do research into Van Ronk's life and did not want Isaac to either look or sound like DVR. While the film will first attract those over 60 who remember the \\"folk revival\\", the CD is aimed at a younger audience with Justin Timberlake playing the role of \\"Jim\\", who has a singing partner Jean (Carey Mulligan). There was a real duo named Jim & Jean (Jim Glover, who was Phil Ochs' roommate, and his wife had hits with covers of Ochs'  songs) but Ethan Coen says he knew their name but nothing about them. Mandolin prodigy Chris Thile, along with the rest of the Punch Brothers appear on many of the tracks as does Marcus Mumford, lead for Mumford & Son. The only NEW song here is the very forgettable \\"Please Mr. Kennedy\\" (about an astronaut) as sung by the Isaac, Timberlake and Mulligan in a nod to Peter Paul & Mary. And Tom Paxton's \\"The Last Thing On My Mind\\", sung by actor Stark Sands, is well-done, but certainly out of the chronological time frame of the film since it was recorded in 1964, while the film has him singing it in 1961.<br /><br />By reading the credits for the performances included in the12-page booklet inside the digi-pak (which includes a fairly esoteric two-page essay by John Jeremiah Sullivan (I don't know who he is) and the lyrics (so you can sing along) I found some interesting surprises that will appeal mostly to those who were listening to folk music in the 1960s and 70s:<br /><br />\\" Please Mr. President\\" Has two guitar players: Canadian Colin Linden and Nashville's Buddy Miller!<br /><br />\\"The Roving Gambler\\" who Burnett says has \\"The Lost City Ramblers\\" (not the New Lost City Ramblers, with the late Mike Seeger, John Cohen and Tracy Schwarz) is actually a group called \\"The Downhill Strugglers\\" with addition of Cohen on Banjo.<br /><br />And, the Carter Family song \\"The Storms Are On The Ocean\\" sung by Nancy Blake (the only real folk singer in the film) also features her husband Norman as well as Gillian Welch and David Rawlings!<br /><br />I do like listening to the album and, hopefully, it will draw younger listeners to the original recordings. If you want to know more about Van Ronk, and hear the breadth of his work, check out my review of the wonderful new 3-CD set \\"Down In Washington Square\\" on Smithsonian Folkways<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"with the rest of the Punch Brothers appear on many of the tracks as does Marcus Mumford, lead for Mumford & Son.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Even though at some point in the book I began to figure out the husband's secret, the ending is still powerful and unexpected.  Well written book.
B007THA4FI|5.0|There was a good deal of controversy surrounding JK Rowling's first foray into &#34;non-Harry Potter&#34; fiction.  Partly, if I recall correctly, this was because residents in various towns who eagerly imagined that the novel's primary setting, Pagford, was modeled on them took offense at the characterizations and insinuations in the novel.  I thought Rowling captured, albeit in the novelists' traditional concentrated format, a wonderful range of characters, pride, hypocrisies and great tragicomic denouements, that were all entirely believable and well painted.  The book builds carefully, in Rowling's splendid facility with the English language, into a crescendo of disaster and comeuppances that kept me enthralled and amused to the last page.  I have no doubt that Rowling has proved herself as masterful in character and plot development outside the world of Hogwarts and in our equally jumbled &#34;real world.&#34;<br /><br />I loved the book and am confident that those who loved Harry Potter and those who have no idea about Harry Potter would be equally enthusiastic.
1449305172|5.0|This book contains everything you need to keep going with your business planning, but no only this!<br />It has great practical examples and knowledge which changed my mindset completely! Worth reading!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens in the next book. This is a very interesting twist on the Cinderella story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't read any SF in a long time... thank you, Hugh, for a great read with strong and interesting characters in an all too possible post-apocalypse world. I'm looking forward to Book 2, hopefully to find out how Juliette & company manage to create a society based on truth.
006029129X|5.0|My brother mentioned at a family gather that this was one of his favorite books as a child.  Thanks to Amazon, I found a Collector's Quality edition to give him for his 43rd Birthday! He told me when he opened the box and saw the book, he couldn't believe it! It was the perfect gift!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis takes us into the bizzare world of the what Really happened in the housing bubble. The scariest  part is how so few people could screw up our lives, investments and financial stability. The next part is how the same companies run our financial world even today after getting bailed out by our government aka us the taxpayers. I was told that the TARP money never was used to help home owners and small business but actually provided wall street the funds to make their money in the stock market since. Makes sense since major market corrections never have happened.
B004WOH19S|4.0|If you want an intelligent and gripping read, then Jeffery Archer is your 'go to'author. The Fourth Estate is a mature and tastefully written tale of rampant capitalism, unbridled egos and everything wrong with the relentless pursuit of empire building.  In a nutshell, an accurate depiction of human nature.<br />I love it!
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I am really tired of having to see surly, bratty, and undisciplined children on the screen. There are enough of them out here in real life.<br /><br />Take a paper thin plot, an absence of realistic character development, preposterous moments like Clooney's character going into Sid's room in the middle of the night to ask him advice, knowing this goofball's main vocabulary word was \\"dude\\", and you have what Hollywood considers an Oscar-nominee. It's really a strange film with strange people throughout. They are not Fargo strange, a film which is hugely entertaining. They are just strange.<br /><br />Even some glorious shots of Hawaii could not save this one.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book pulled me in hook line and sinker. Tris is amazing and the book reads so smooth, its beautiful. The ending shocked me so much to the point I cried, almost. I recommend this extremely, Veronica Roth, you are amazing at what you do.
B00BLGZDYA|4.0|If you're the type who likes everything to make literal sense, don't bother.  This has an odd man in a secretive line of work.  There isn't a simple explanation for any of the \\"missions.\\"  Although I hated the slightly similar films \\"Limits Of Control\\" and \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\" for being all style and no substance, the mysterious main character ultimately makes this one more than a poor man's Tarantino.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked this book, it was a great continuation of her previous books, and it was, like her other books, very well written. Most other of the reviewers didn't like that she has extended the series, but I'm of a different mind. I won't explain it all here, this is for those of you trying to decide whether to buy this book or not.<br /><br />Recommend?<br />Yes
B0049985XW|4.0|Three homeless Americans in Mexico decide to dig for gold.  Their first conversation in a boarding house is the key to the film.  The most morally bankrupt character has the least common sense and self awareness. His own obsessive scheming makes it impossible to imagine others aren't just as rotten as himself.  This film has a wit and sense of humor about the bad man always having to look over his shoulder.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I liked Gone Girl. I thought Sharp Objects was ok. This is a book with another set of unlikable characters, it just wasn't exactly a page turner.
0439023521|5.0|This is the best book I read this year. Two thumbs up! Highly recommended. Why? Combine \\"Battle Royale\\" with teen dramas on the WB (with a little \\"The Running Man\\" thrown in) and watch the awesome. I've never seen a novel with a stronger beginning - the environment and backstory is established immediately, there's tension from page one, and the story has started before the end of the chapter. You've got a doomsday clock going, high stakes, and not much thinking. And the whole story is totally relatable to high school - I'd almost call it allegorical.<br /><br />The story's composed in three parts. The first part is where we see our main character, a teen called Katniss living life in the slummy District 13, where starvation and poverty is standard fare. Part two occurs after she's chosen to participate in the District Games, which is essentially Battle Royale minus the backpack & collars and plus the rivalry, because whoever wins gets set for life (although evidence suggests you never live down the scars). This part is where my \\"The Running Man\\" reference comes from, because we see the pre-interviews, the training, and the media circus surrounding this young girl. It's where the high school allegory shines brightest.<br /><br />First people judge you on your appearance. Then you're judged on your chance for survival and given a score, but not told the criteria on which they judge you (may this be like the elite clique giving you your place in the world?). Then you give an interview, but it's Hollywood hype - it's giving people a personality they want to see. Some play the psycho tough, others play the cunning fox. You see, the purpose of this media circus is to get people to like you.  If they like you, they might buy you something during the games - food or weapons or medicine. So you've got to get yourself a personality, an image, and suck up to those fans. And it tears Katniss up because it's the opposite of what she is, a hard-working, bitter hunter from the coal-mining district. Now she has to be a dizzy damsel in unrequited love with her district partner. You can never be yourself in this game.<br /><br />But here the initial inertia fades as the anticipation of the battle seeps through every word. Flashbacks to her life in District 13 try to build her character and romantic tension between her friend and her District partner (who she may have to kill at some point). There's a great deal of her thinking on this, on the consequences of her actions, and what this means to her survival and future relationships. It's not really a problem, because you always want to see what happens next, but it feels like padding.<br /><br />Then we get to part three - the battle. Here it gets really introspective, because Katniss is on her own, clinging to the trees and looking for food, as she tries to play both the battle game and the media game (the audience is watching her every move, and could decide whether she lives or dies). It unfolds realistically, which is sort of the trapping of this story. Katniss does a lot of wandering, a lot of thinking, a lot of worrying. That's what you'd expect, but it doesn't move the plot much. You find yourself hoping to get to the end of the chapter, where you know something interesting is going to happen. But something interesting always happens. And you watch her alliances and enemies and actions have dire consequences as the plot moves along, and all Katniss wants to do is get out alive, compromising her values and hurting people as she does it.<br /><br />Then some mutant dogs made out of dead competitors attack them.<br /><br />Ahem.<br /><br />All in all, this is a definite must-read. I'm sure someday we'll recognize Suzanne Collins and Scott Westerfeld as the mother and father of modern YA science-fiction.l-mining district. Now she has to be a dizzy damsel in unrequited love with her district partner.

That's what you'd expect, but it doesn't move the plot much. You find yourself hoping to get to the end of the chapter, where you know something interesting is going to happen. But something interesting always happens. And you watch her alliances and enemies and actions have dire consequences as the plot moves along, and all Katniss wants to do is get out alive, compromising her values and hurting people as she does it.<br /><br />Then some mutant dogs made out of dead competitors attack them.<br /><br />Ahem.<br /><br />All in all, this is a definite must-read. I'm sure someday we'll recognize Suzanne Collins and Scott Westerfeld as the mother and father of modern YA science-fiction.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written and left a feeling of history that is so often lost.  Would highly recommend it to young and old.  Makes you think about family ties.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A great story - good to learn about this part of American history that I had never heard of.  Was a good book club book for discussion.
0736092269|5.0|As a personal trainer this book is great.  If a client asks what muscles we are working, the pictures are great to show them the details.  This book should be a part of every personal trainers library.
0345528581|1.0|Well, any \\"so called guru\\" that tells you that \\"cardio is a waste of time\\" is ignorant to scientific facts of the enormous benefits to burning fat via cycling, running or swimming, specially when you go uphill, or do high intensity intervals. Moreover, when I read, quote from this book, \\"More bad news for aerobic activity: Whether it's running, cycling or a step class the main reason it gets easier the more you do of it, is NOT because of cardiovascular fitness, but because of improved economy of motion. For the most part it doesn't get easier because of the muscular endurance, but because your body is becoming more efficient\\"  Really? is that what basic exercise science tells us? In other words, what he is saying is: when we adapt to aerobic muscular endurance from riding a bike up hills, we don't get any stronger...it just somehow gets easier? huh? What absolute and utter crap!...This guy needs a serious lesson in basic exercise science 101 notably on how the body adapts to aerobic exercise - AND how cardio training done RIGHT can get you lean and very strong.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game.  Super addicting.  And free!  What more can you ask for?  I love all the weaponry and the fact that you have to do good to move forward makes it more challenging.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was the most thrilling book ever you should all red the series I can't wait till the next book of his comes out
1909313033|5.0|was looking for a good gift for my wife who loves pugs and we have 2. she loved the book for her birthday and has reviewed it a few time as our pugs do a few things in the book
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica Roth is an awkward goober.<br /><br />I had her figured all wrong after reading Allegiant.<br /><br />But after seeing her interview on MTV and reading the explanation on her blog about the ending, I came to the conclusion that Veronica is just a darling, little, awkward goober. I no longer think she is a hipster elitist snob trying to distance herself from the not-as-deep-as-she YA authors by edgily killing off her main character, no, now I just see her as the young, inexperienced, emotional little sweetheart that she is.<br /><br />I hope she learns a lesson by trying to use her writing career to experiment in amateur psychology.<br /><br />Because the book suffered for it. Boy, did it suffer.<br /><br />You can't half-ass the resolution of a series just to force your idea to \\"work\\". Aren't authors told to never stay \\"married\\" to an idea? To trust in the writing process?<br /><br />If Veronica had heeded this advice and had spent more time developing the conflict resolution from the first 2 books, and exploring why Divergent was special (She admits that she really didn't know what was special behind that piece of genius there. But I know she could have \\"wowed\\" us with the definition of \\"Divergent\\", and what it really meant, if she would have given the readers the respect to actually flesh it out) why Tris was special and how it was all connected \\"Outside the Fence\\", instead of concentrating on Tris's development with self-sacrifice, alone, she could have written a highly fulfilling, highly satisfying end to a meaningful series that readers would be praising for years to come.<br /><br />Authors often tell beginning writers \\"to let the characters decide where the story goes.\\"<br /><br />I would have LOVED to read a conclusion chosen by the characters. That is, \\"characters\\", as in plural. Veronica did say that she allowed Tris to choose the way her story would go, so I know Veronica has a good handle on this particular method in the writing process.<br /><br />So, instead of allowing all of her characters tell the story, Veronica just sort of kicked them to the curb so Tris could carry out Veronica's idea about selflessness and the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />I would have, with all my reader-y heart, loved Allegiant to end in such a way where ALL the characters' stories were considered.<br /><br />I wish Ms. Roth would have widened her tunnel vision to allow Tris, as well as Four, Kristina, Caleb, Tori, Uriah, Zeke, and Cara, etc. to decide how their stories would end.<br /><br />All of her beloved characters cared about their homes, their town, and their respective families. They cared about the Faction/Faction-less war that was destroying those things.<br /><br />Caleb cared about the pain the had mercilessly inflicted upon his sister. He suffered shame and regret and wanted redemption.<br /><br />What a satisfying end if after Tris made it past the death serum, was rescued, last minute, from a power hungry, sadistic sociopath (David), by her older brother.<br /><br />By Caleb's insistence to NOT allow his sister to die, to turn around, go back, pick up the gun she left outside and shoot the bastard that brought all of this pain and suffering to everyone he'd ever loved.<br /><br />What a much more satisfyingly sweet way to show self-sacrifice, being willing to miss, as we were shown that his aim sucked earlier in the book, and get shot by David to save his sister and be the hero she always looked up to.<br /><br />Four cared about a future with Tris. They both wanted to resolve this war and let life settle back down so they might be able to spend their remaining years without death and destruction.<br /><br />Tori cared about her baby brother. Veronica might have given us the most beautiful, tear-jerking moment,ever to be shared by a secondary character in YA fiction, had Tori been able to see that her brother was, indeed, alive and well. I can only imagine how many tears I would have cried if a beautifully-written, bittersweet scene like this were in Allegiant.<br /><br />Four might have healed more fully after painfully defeating his miserable, self-serving parents, with Tris by his side. They could have gone on to lead and nurse a broken, dying city to back to health, and shown the readers all the awesome ways their lives had improved.<br /><br />The possibilities were endless, but we got stuck with the one possible end that one goofy author couldn't let go of.<br /><br />And that is the ending, with all the rabbit-trail plots and meandering, pointless subplots, and unresolved new plots, etc, etc, etc that we readers will always remember when we read or hear about Divergent.<br /><br />Aw, hell, Veronica. Please write for your \\"reader-self\\", NOT your \\"writer-self\\" next time.<br /><br />Veronica, if your sweet pumpkin-hearted, goofy-goober self is reading this, please at least consider giving us the respect we deserve as paying customers of your product, your CRAFT as a talented, yes, but also skilled, hard-working writer of stories meant to be published, by NOT being \\"married\\" to an idea, by trusting in the writing process.<br /><br />By possibly abandoning an idea that, if you keep it, the rest of the story suffers, and, most importantly, by allowing ALL of your characters \\"decide\\" where the story goes, and giving them ALL the \\"powerful ending\\" they deserve.
B00EEXST2K|1.0|This movie was soooooo boring. It was slow moving and there was really no climax -- real or faked. More blah, blah, blah with a slanted view on events that may or may not have happened. We rented it when there was a bit of buzz about the movie. That buzz faded quickly and the movie was so bad we didn't even finish watching.
B00992CF6W|3.0|The app is a lot of fun as everyone says and worth the price. There's only one reason why I have given it three instead of five stars.<br />I have looked online for hours and I can not find one blog or forum that teaches me how to easily make my own server for free.<br />If I paid seven dollars for an app, I should at least get my own free server or be allowed to play over WiFi with my sister and friends.<br />If anyone can clarify for me how I can play multiplayer over LAN then this app with earn my five stars.
0762434279|1.0|I complete am dissatisfied with this particular product. I was under the impression I was purchasing the regular size book, not miniature. The part that is the most upsetting is that I am having a hard time in returning it for a refund,since they will not exchange it.
1577314808|4.0|I gave the book four stars, as there is another work ABANDONMENT TO DIVINE PROVIDENCE, by Jean Pierre Cassaude, that covers the same subject, in a way that I personally found to be more profound.  He talks about the \\"Sacrament of the Present Moment\\" saying that God is at all times revealing himself to every human being with whatever He is offering us at the present moment. He says we need to be attentive to that, as if there were nothing beyond it, for in reality there never is.  Cassaude is Catholic, and his work reflects that, but, as a non-Catholic, I did not find that to be a problem. Cassaude says that happiness and holiness depend upon us surrrendering to the present moment as God's Will for us.
B000SOYEQY|4.0|It's more a rosey spectacles view of events, but still a good movie with excellent cinematography. Definitely deserves to be seen on a big screen.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is amazing. I only wish I read the books before watching the show. The books are so amazing and filled with tons of story. Now to read A Storm of Swords.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The closest comparison is the series Brideshead Revisited, lush settings, superb settings, and great acting. If nothing else, watch it to learn why the English aren't great tippers!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great description as extra dewsribing each family and their members, history behind the storyline, and detailed map of the entire geograhpy. Gave me a much better inssight to storylines and associated background.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This games blew me away! The graphics were phenomenal! Best I've seen in a long time. The story line kept me involved. Well worth the money and then some. I only wish they had used the scenes for more involvement. They were so good I wanted to stay in them longer. This game involved a lot of back and forth so if that bothers you then don't buy it. It didn't bother me. I enjoyed this game from beginning to end. It takes a lot of room so if it doesn't download at first it's worth getting rid of a few apps you don't need in order to play it. BLAM has my attention now! WELL DONE!
1250038820|5.0|I always loved the work of Brandon Stanton on his webpage and Facebook page. But to have it as a book I can open and see whenever I want is really fantastic. The book is beautifully designed, and the paper is really good.<br />If you like social photography and inspired insights made by strangers, this is a book you should take a look at.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I think this was the best book I've read, ever. I think John Green is an amazing author and writes like nothing I've ever read before. His writings emotionally perfect and everything I look for in a good book.
B0074QGGK6|2.0|Really nothing of substance. Breezed through this in the time it takes to read a magazine article; make that a People magazine article and you might grasp the disappointment I had with Mr. Kleon's advice. \\"Write the Book You Want To Read\\"---wow! That really fires up the creative juices. Steal from other artist, be nice, get out of the house, read away from electronic devices, and, what ever else you do, fill out index cards with pithy sayings [\\"be generous\\" \\"Quilting vs Weaving\\"] and draw juvenile cartoon figures that illustrate said sayings.<br />I read the book hoping to find something inspirational as a gift to a recent graduate, not sure of a career path. I'll keep looking.<br />But judging by some of the reviews, writing an empty headed advice book may be the road to easy riches.

B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Never know what they will come up with next, I heard this album and I think this is some of their best.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|Channing Tatum is always good to look at in an action film and Jamie Foxx plays a good president.  The story is good old fashioned action suspense however some of the scenes are a bit silly.  Overall,  I would say its good entertainment on a timely topic.  The story is an old one: guess who the bad guy really is and why he's doing it….but I enjoyed watching it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I loved this book because it's a true story of a courageous girl.  I hope one day her courage is rewarded.  Malala is a true hero!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I love the first two books but this one was a HUGE let down! It's as if the author needed to hurry up an finish the book. The author did a great job of building these characters and only to just give them meaningless endings. That is as much as I can say without revealing the ending. My vote: horrible book, if they do make a movie I hope this part gets changed.
044024367X|4.0|I've stopped Reading Reacher for the plots, I just want to know what's going on with him. That said,this book isn't as credible in the plot department as his previous efforts. The best scene is in the veteran's hospital.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. So happy I can now play on my kindle!! Can spend hours on it everyday. Can definitely loose the day playing
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun except for the time-outs. When you only have a limited time to play each day or sometimes every few days it's annoying to have to wait for lives to rebuild. I often end up just playing something else with my time instead.
0544139453|2.0|Found the book to be rather shallow with minimal character development .... was surprised to hear it is going to be a movie ... maybe I missed something but I can not bear to read the book again .....
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game and well as my grandson. As a hunter my self it's very interesting and I like the varies tools you can use. I've used for about 3 days now.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|It's taken me a long time to figure out why I am hooked on this program.  That there are really people out there studying why people do what they do, the compassion this team shows for the victims AND the perpetrators is amazing.  This program offers many levels all at once -- philosophy, literature, character development,  adventure, and a warning to all of us to stay away from abandoned roads and crazy people.
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of my favorite game. I have played this game on the computer for years, but I like the fact I can play will watching TV.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Best musical ever.  While there were surprises from some of the actors voices, I already knew that Hugh Jackman was more than Wolverine having seen a video of his performance in Oklahoma (an Australian production).  We saw this in the family on Christmas when it came out in theaters and once I adjusted my perspective to accept that dialogue almost completely existed in the form of song, I was able to allow myself to be pulled into the story deeper and deeper.  It is an amazing production with songs that make you want to sing along.  The words linger on in your memory (as do the images).  The cinematography set the scene so spectacularly that you almost felt like you were there with them.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|I like the idea of security but I am not to familiar with McAfee. I am sure it's a very good product
B00000J2PH|5.0|I have this on LP as well, but bought the CD for the convenience of taking in the car and loading to my computer.  Carole King has one of those voices that just capture your complete attention and you find yourself forgetting the troubles that have been weighing down on you at the time.  Fantasy is my second favorite album by Carole King.  Check it out too.
006202406X|1.0|Ugh.  Severely disappointed.<br /><br />First and foremost, the alternating voices of Tris and Tobias had no differentiation.  I had to repeatedly flip back to be reminded of which voice I should be reading the text in.  The back and forth narration slightly made sense at the end, but still made for a disjointed read all throughout.  After truly enjoying the first two books of the series, this book clearly showed plot-holes, lack of character developments, and a rushed storyline.<br />Tris' death was facetious and abrupt and it deserved more honor than that. The story and the readers deserved that. Yes I was mad about the death because she was a great character, Veronica made me fall in love with her in the first book. The death was not the damaging part of the story. How the death came about, and the lack of detail and back-story leading up to the death was Allegiants downfall.  It would have been more of an honor to her parents if she conquered to the challenges and lived her life through the new changes.  They died sacrificing for the greater good of the cause, and seeing Tris die that way as well was horribly disappointing.  I will not recommend this series to any of my friends, so they can avoid the disappointment and frustration!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This book delves into race relations past and present with candour.  The characters are clearly written and easily believable.  There is only one slow part near the end that was a bit boring. It is a story of righting a decades old wrong that all can appreciate.
159463176X|5.0|I've read Hosseini's other books, and this one is by far the best.  Just amazing.  I felt like the Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns were wonderful, but perhaps a bit too heart-wrenching--no respite between the tales of pain and suffering.  In the Mountains Echoed, Hosseini strikes a balance and sets his novel across Afghanistan, the U.S. and through time.  He subtly references politics and wars, but at the base of it all are intricately and beautifully woven stories of love--love between a brother and a sister, love between two men, love between a mother and daughter, father and daughter....  One of my all-time favorites (and I don't say that lightly).  Highly highly recommend.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Luv these type of puzzles to keep my mind sharp. Vivid colors and patterns hold your interest. Enjoy playing this puzzle game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|additive and fun. You challenge yourself to get three stars and get to the next level. it is awesome to be champion of a level.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I'm not a favorite of movies depicting drunkenness.  Denzel carries his addiction a little too far in this movie for me.  For that reason, this is the first Denzel movie ever rated lower that exceptional.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally have this available for the Kindle!  I have been waiting for this-so much easier to play on the Kindle than on my phone.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A good read with a haunting ending.  Grisham has done it again. Looking forward to his next book. I hope it also will be set in Ford County.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|When I upgraded from a Droid-X to my Razr Maxx HD, I decided to try this app and have been pleased with the results.  The light that I can get from my phone's LED flash is sufficient to light a small room.  Fortunately, I have not been plagued by any of the issues raised by a few other reviewers, such as obnoxious ads or phone crashes.  It works as it should without demanding too much of my phone's resources.
B00EJYGQFG|5.0|Great item and fast shipping thank you very much
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I ordered  2 of these fans for my Coralife aquarium light. The 3 pin to 2 pin adapter worked, though I did have to remove a tab on the 2 pin connector. Even having 2 of these fans operating at the same time is quiet.  They seem to move about the same amount of air as the OEM fans, without all the noise.  I would highly recommend them in any application that requires a quiet and efficient fan.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|The Beast is back!!!!! At long last the mighty Carcass has graced us with another slab of pure unabashed butchery. I will admit to be more a fan of their later material but still appreciated the early stuff as well. With this release they seem to meld both periods quite nicely. Walker & Steer haven't lost any &#34;edge&#34; over the years, they're still every bit as bad ass as before. Bill's guitar still rips and shreads with the best of them and Jeff's bass and sand paper vocals drive in the message &#34;We're Back&#34;!!!!! Daniel Wilding's drumming fits in quite nice, I will always be a huge fan of Ken Owens work with the band but no need to worry that he's not behind the skins on this opus. It's total & complete, no bones about it.......CARCASS
B005LAII12|3.0|Not as funny as we expected. The human has no expression throughout the movie. Ted could have made the movie by himself.Don't plan on watching it again.....:(
B007KB15BA|5.0|Accept are back with a vengeance! Wolf Hoffman and crew knocked one outta the park with the blood of hero's and continue kickin' ass and takin' names with Stalingrad. Personally I'm not missing Udo at all, Mark's vocal's completely fit the bill and carry on the tradition of Accept. I had the opportunity to see them live back in the day and again recently and will say with no reservation Accept is one of the greatest heavy metal bands of all time!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Reading John Grisham is as if one is seated near the fire with a glass of wine and an old trusted, dear friend is relating one of his experiences.  His writing is excellent.  He takes you where you need to go; backs up the story with enough background information that you don't wonder...&#34;Where did this come from; or what just happened?&#34;  He pulls it all together to a satisfactory conclusion, at least editorially speaking.  He's honest, sincere and comfortable but NOT boring.  HIs books are educational about the law, human nature, personal values and the South.  I liked that some of the original characters from Clanton were involved without it being a &#34;sequel&#34; per se.  It's a good read.  Intelligent and holds your attention to the end.  I think he has a real talent for telling a story and I'm glad to know of his work in my lifetime!
B00FFL8ZMY|4.0|The band has always been tight an just get better all the time. Mark is a true beast on the guitar and the interplay between his and Myles' styles is great, put it on top of the solid foundation laid down by Marshall & Phillips then add the awesome vocal abilities of Myles just makes for one kick ass album.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Let's start by saying I loved the first 90% of this book.  I was hooked from the beginning. A lot of twists. Caught me off guard more than once.  Fantastic writing and story.  Then.....it just ends.  Ends. No conclusion. No cliff-hanger.  Just over.  Totally ruined the whole book for me.  And any future books from this author will most certainly not be purchased by me.  So my review in short: if you want to be highly entertained for several hours, then sorely disappointed in the end: please buy this book.  If not; keep browsing. Happy Reading.
B00ELOOYZI|2.0|I found the app engaging at first, but it has suddenly begun to pop up a dialog box EVERY day asking me if I want emails from the developer about new games. I have a feeling that it stops if you reply 'Yes', but it does not stop when you answer 'No'. So you have to reply to it EVERY day. This is very annoying, and I will uninstall.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This came in great condition. It had no scratches or dust. It also shipped super fast. Very excited to have bought this at such a great price!
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|This 40 year old movie has held up well.  It was as interesting now as it was terrifying then.  Excellent acting.  As an aside:  It was interesting to note how many people smoked back then, doctors included.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were lovely, sweet, sad.  I really just love the way Ms. McKenna writes. Will definitely read her other books.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|After using this game for awhile it has become one of my favorites.  It keeps me supplies of credits to enjoy playing each day.  Other games gives you a very small amount for one or two games and that is it.  Update 5-11-15 - It has started freezing up with my credits (including daily ones) not being applied.  After a few days of this I emailed them.  I followed up with them today and they say ticket is closed.  Guess they did not care and if they don't I don't.  BTW I also do not like the new format (Map).  Never heard back from them so am just deleting from my Kindle and cloud.  Too many other good ones to bother with this one.  I think maybe they just don't care which is too bad.
B00E8B1358|2.0|Man, I like The Rock, but what a letdown. Plot was shallow and predictable. There was ZERO chemistry between the actors. Attempt at Military &#34;tacticool&#34; was truly lame. And the costumes were just way to large for life. Not one star because a couple of action scenes were gripping and we saw some actual vehicles modeled after the classic toys.<br />Boy am I glad I didn't see it In The theater!
B0035WTE52|5.0|Nice sound, great quality, the best recompilation from this big band. If you are a big fan from AC/DC and the vinyl you need this lp.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|... not enough levels. That's the only reason I rated this game 4 stars instead of 5. Sure, the game was free, but there were only 10 levels of play. There are no hints as you play, but I don't really mind that, actually. A challenging game, but not impossible. I found myself looking forward to each coming level, except for level 10 - because I knew that would be the final level. Looking forward to any updates!
B003Y3BMG6|4.0|The best collection, nice art, I sound is spectacular, Be great that they remastered all albums from Soundgarden, because for me is the best band of grunge.<br />Only I don't like something the sellers says limited edition but is the same edition, I read that limited edition the disc are in color green.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book does a good job of keeping you guessing about what the husband's secret is.  And the book's resolution feels a lot like real life!  Still, the entire situation feels a bit contrived to me.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Great album from a great artist. A lot of new melodies and modern twists. Interesting variation in songs and themes.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|One of the Best Entertaining and Funniest Movies ever! An Instant Classic on a par with &#34;Something about Mary&#34;, &#34;Meet the Parents&#34;, etc..I was laughing so hard and Jeff Bridges is in one of his BEST ROLES EVER I think he played Roy Great! The lines we're also spot on and pretty damn funny.<br /><br />I NEVER got bored once which happens a lot in bad comedies and the Plot was a great one, character development was decent and the action was non-stop and funny as hell with FANTASTIC CG/ANIMATION<br /><br />Overall a FUNNY MOVIE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love it...but it takes way , way, way to long waiting for things to happen, and crowns are so hard to get You should offer a crown / gold option, to by rare objects, I understand that charging for these things is how you make your money, and I intend to buy things in the future but I can't afford to pay all the time.<br /><br />Thank You!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|All you have to do when you run out of coins is go into your settings and change the date to one day ahead than it is. Example-if today was 11/3 then I would change the date to 11/4. This hack works because the time for getting coins is based on a 24 hour constant. There for if you change the date it would be a full 24hours and your coins will reach the max! (Just don't forget to change the date back to normal!)
B00FXEL00W|4.0|I thought this book was very well written. I enjoyed it.  I loved the characters and the story line.<br /><br />Thanks.
