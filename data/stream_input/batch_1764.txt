0547884591|5.0|Excellent book even if you have NO Interest in cooking.  Takes the guess work out and gives nice little anecdotes such as \\"The reason to use cold water instead of hot water for cooking at home\\".<br /><br />Very practical in eating choices for maximum health benefits and everyday living.  Your spouse will thank you for it on date night (whether you eat in or dine out).<br />Spend the $30. You won't be sorry.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game holds an amazing variety of puzzles within a simple set of rules and only a handful of obstacle types. The basic idea is to send your water drop through a maze collecting all the pearls. The tricky part is that a water drop continues moving in a straight line until it runs into a brick or destroys itself on a spike (or some variation).  Some of the puzzles can be solved in less than 10 moves, but a few require three times that. You're told the smallest number of moves that can solve it, so there's an extra level of challenge built in for those who want it.  I've played many dozens of the puzzles in this game and still find it fresh. Go, Fallen Tree!

B007WULJ5G|5.0|A brainy meta-flick containing shocking gore, razor-sharp socio-political symbolism, heart-annihilating family-drama, A+ Production values and at least 4 of the most disturbing, sexually aberrant scenes ever shot, A SERBIAN FILM is exactly what everyone says on BOTH sides of the argument:  Depraved and shameful exploitation meets infinitely watchable cult-classic awesome-ness.  Love it or hate it, you cannot dispute the overwhelming power and off-the-charts quality control at work.<br /><br />Most importantly, ASF addresses a question relevant to all fans of extreme-cinema:  Why on Earth does any person want to watch another's suffering and obliteration for Entertainment?  The lunatic Vukmir is correct that brutal torture and murder sell like crazy in our world.  If you're on this product page reading this review, you're likely interested in watching fictional graphic violence from \\"the comfort of your arm-chair.\\"  To feel the thrill of horror with none of the consequences.<br /><br />A SERBIAN FILM is super-smart sadistic art and, just as the delicious \\"bread-spread\\" Vukmir speaks of, perfect beauty derived from filth.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I do recommend this book as an interesting historical account of the early days of rock history. It's amazing how many of rock's most influential artists were all developing in and around London in the early to late 60's. The Who, Clapton, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin, The Kinks, The Yardbirds etc etc were all playing in clubs around London and they all knew each other. Pretty amazing. Townshend delivers excellent accounts of this period and the inner workings of The Who and the examination of fame, celebrity, temptations, over indulgences of a Rock icon. Towards the end of the book he delves a little too much into his studio purchases, publishing work and details about romantic relationships. But all in all a very well written book and one of the best in this genre.

But it also contained other of the author's less well known works that I just fell in love with.

B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I like Phillip Phillips and I wanted to like his first album.  I bought it without previewing it and just took my chances.  I noticed on the liner notes that Phillip wrote most of the songs himself and I know that is what he wanted to do as an artist.  I think for his first album he should have taken more input from other artists or songwriters to give more variety to his first album.  He is not a one-note artist but this album makes it appear he is.  I hope he gets a chance at a second album but I will preview it before buying.

0446580848|4.0|The Panther is DeMille's latest edition to the John Corey saga. This marks book number six for Corey, and according to rumors, there are more to come. I'm on the fence with that rumor. Although I love the character, I'm also ready for something new.<br /><br />John Corey is a former NYPD homicide detective, now medically retired and working for the Anti-Terrorist Task Force in New York City. He's cocky, sarcastic, and one bad dude. His wife, Kate Mayfield, is an FBI agent and member of the Task Force. She thinks John is a neanderthal, but brilliant and not too hard on the eyes. They are often paired together during assignments, whether intentionally or not.<br /><br />The Panther is the follow-up to The Lions Game and The Lion. Both books featured Corey battling a Libyan terrorist known as the Lion. It doesn't end well for the terrorist. The Panther hits a little closer to home with an American born Yemeni terrorist responsible for the attack on the USS Cole. Since the demise of the Lion, Corey and Mayfield are the perfect choice to draw out the Panther in an attempt to capture or kill him. This, of course, does and does not sit well with Corey and Mayfield.<br /><br />The majority of the story takes place in Yemen and despite DeMille's inability to travel to the country, is described well in great detail. DeMille's in-depth research of the region is evident in the narration, though sometimes to a fault. Hemingway would have cringed a few times during the read, being that he held fast to the \\"less is more\\" mantra of writing.<br /><br />Middle East history and psychological break downs of terrorists aside, the Panther is a fine read with brilliant characters and gripping action. DeMille fans get an added bonus with the inclusion of Paul Brenner (The General's Daughter and Up Country). Brenner is a nice touch. He adds some sexual tension that has been missing since Corey and Mayfield hitched their wagons together. Unfortunately, Brenner is also cocky, sarcastic, and one bad dude. It's like having a story in the Bible with God's two sons. One Jesus will do, thank you.<br /><br />All that being said, the Panther is worth the price of admission. DeMille may have overdone it a couple of times and the ending may seem a little hurried, but he hasn't lost his touch. Admittedly, the ending may seem hurried only because I didn't want it to end. That's a good thing, if you're paying attention.<br /><br />If you haven't jumped on the John Corey bandwagon yet, start with Plum Island and go from there. I also suggest that you check out DeMille's other works. He's a great writer. Even his newsletters are entertaining.ne bad dude. It's like having a story in the Bible with God's two sons.

B005K15SPG|5.0|For their debut album, it's easy to hear why Mumford and Sons took home the Grammy for &#34;Best New Artist&#34; in 2011. Their sound crosses Rock, Blue Grass, Country and Folk into a style that is incredibly unique. The first thing you notice is that these guys are very talented musicians, with each member capable of playing at least 2-3 instruments. The band specializes in an eclectic blend of traditional and non-traditional instruments. Sure you can hear guitar, keyboard, and drums just as you would expect, but then you are delighted by the mandolin, banjo, Dobro, accordion or string bass. While they may not be the first band to showcase such instruments, the resulting harmony they create feels truly ground-breaking. And woven through it all are the melancholy vocals of Marcus Mumford. Hauntingly captivating, his voice draws you in like a master story-teller unfolding a plot through lyrics and harmony. Pioneers of a style all their own, Mumford and Sons truly creates a most refreshing musical experience.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|I like to Rolling Stones so much that they could probably just put out an album of white static noise and I would buy it. This is a really good collection of the past 50 years. The only thing I miss is a song that Keith Richards obviously doesn't like and that is I'm Losing My Touch.  Keith is obviously not losing his touch so I guess he'll wait for a while to sing the song again. I guess I can't argue with 80 tracks though.
0345803485|2.0|I wanted so much to like this book, as I have heard such good reviews from friends and family members, but I simply could not. I kept waiting for the heroine to get a backbone...it never happened. The author uses certain phrases and character actions over and over so many times, I was not sure if it was funny or just annoying. (i.e. bitting her lower lip, hitching her breath)Seriously, what person does that hundreds of times over the course of a few weeks. My favorite author is Jackie Collins and her female characters kick ass and make a name for themselves in very male dominated professions. I don't like to see women portrayed as door mats who have absolutely no say. To each his (or her) own but it was all I could do to finish the first. I certainly cannot stomach book 2 or 3.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wish I had read all three books before I saw the Hunger Games. All three books were very good. Felt in the moment of the book
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Series is gripping and very entertaining! Must see TV! Watch out...it's not just the zombies you have to watch for!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I don't often read books like this, as I am more into sci-fi, military, technothriller novels. But I took a chance and was delightfully surprised at how interesting it was. Being a bookophile, I was intrigued by the premise of working in an unusual, 24-hour book store, and the book did not disappoint. It held my attention from beginning to end, and was difficult to put down. I ended up reading it in record time.<br /><br />The author did a good job of revealing the novel's secrets slowly, and only at the same time the main protagonist learned of them. Well done.
B009HEN7LY|4.0|Enjoyable. Bronson does a great job as the young agent. Keeps the series going, without being overly repetitive. Good family movie.
020161622X|4.0|I have to admit that I'm happy I got this as a hand me down from a friend. I agree that this is a classic, but also that some of this information has become so etched in to the programming community as a whole, that the experienced programmer/reader will already known the concept. That said, it was amazing to think that they were on top of these concepts in 1999.<br /><br />It's a fairly thin ~250 page book, and since I wasn't too worried about preserving it, I was able to tote it along in my gym bag and read while suffering through cardio workouts. Of course that prevented me from doing most of the exercises but I don't think that mattered. I'm also close to completing Code Complete 2 which is pretty similar in spirit so I found myself comparing and contrasting a lot. Both great books. Code complete 2 is too big IMO but I'm still forcing myself through it because there are so many nuggets. TPP on the other hand is a book you could read in the number of times you go to the toilet over the course of a month. If you're committed to \\"reading the classics\\", you kind of owe it to yourself to read this one even if just for understanding the historical context of things. Should you opt for a used cheapo clunker? I think so ;-)
B0010Z32OA|5.0|This is a fascinating trip into a fantasy world with a strong sense of humor.  Some may find it inappropriate for children since the hero is an illegitimate child but I did not find it objectionable since the hero's birthright plays an important role in the story.  I found it a great story for an evenings light entertainment.
0374214913|5.0|While I was in Denver for the NAGC conference I had the urge to buy a book to read despite the massive volume of research, presentation planning for another conference, and being on brain overload. This book has stuck out to me for some time and I decided to spend the money on a hardcover and give it a go.<br /><br />I cannot think of the last hardcover that I bought. It has been a few years. However, I was wise in this purchase. This was a great read and I might go so far as saying the best read of 2012 in terms of fiction.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel by Robin Sloan is AWESOME! Plain and simple. If you love books. If you love technology. If you love trying to live in a modern world while loving the smell of old. If you love a little mystery action. If you are human with a brain, then you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />You can read the Amazon description at the link above. Clay is basically a guy trying to find his place in the world. He has skills with web design and technology, but just cannot get going. He lands a job at a bookstore that leads him to meeting with weird characters all in a hurry for the next book on the upper bookcase of books that are not for sale. What he finds when he becomes curious is a world of intrigue, mystery, puzzle solvers, and characters all in a rush to find out the essential truths to the world. There is passion for books, cryptic messages, Google, technology, history, and relationships. It really does cover it all in a non cheesy way. It makes sense.<br /><br />I found myself taking notes of books referenced, cool ideas, and several quotes. This book is so good that I am actually reselling it so I can get it in the hands of someone else. I have heard it mentioned on online and in other reviews that this is the DaVinci Code for book lovers. I hate to make the comparisons like this, but this does work.<br /><br />A great read that you don't want to miss. Robin Sloan has created an excellent read and a new fan! I will be honest that I was hoping for a different ending, but what unfolds did not leave me disappointed  I was engrossed in the storyline that I had hopes for certain things. When you make these predictions you know you are in a good story.n!

0547884591|1.0|This book is such a disappointment. He jumps from one topic to the next with no thread holding them together. He goes on and on about subjects that are so uninteresting that you'll want to throw the book out the window. Ugggghhhh the worst 25 bucks I've spent in a long time.

B005E8KQPM|5.0|Opeth has slid away from its Death Metal roots in the interest of creating art. This is something I appreciate in an artist. The album comes out strong, and provides solid musicianship and song writing throughout. Keep an open mind, and let this album take you on a journey.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and I take it with me everywhere I go.  Occasionally, it will run out of battery at a very inconvenient time and I have been able to transition over to continue on my phone very smoothly.<br /><br />Once, horrors, I actually thought the Kindle was in my purse, only to arrive at a restaurant on my own, intending to eat and read, to discover I did not have my Kindle with me.  I was able to move right onto the Kindle app on my Droid and be completely happy.<br /><br />It is a well arranged app - and while not a Kindle, it definitely does the job very, very well.
0316228532|3.0|This is nothing compared to Harry Potter Series. So as a fan of Harry potter I bought this book but was highly disappointed. the story is slow and boring. Revolves around a small town politics.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I resisted the movie until I could have the opportunity of reading the book, so I had the complete and unspoiled experience of the book (and immediately after the two other books in the trilogy).<br /><br />This is an excellent book, as I think you would expect from Suzanne Collins.  It is like nothing I have ever read, however, and it almost seemed prophetic in some way and deeply stirred me emotionally, though its premise is nothing like we have going on in our world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and the two other books in the trilogy.  They are well written, the characters are terrific, it is fascinating, horrifying and uplifting.  A very satisfying story indeed.
1781163243|5.0|Tha art available is this book is fantastic! One of the best art books I have bought in recent years and surely a must have for every concept art enthusiast.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is a great book. There are a few times when I'd struggle to make it through a few pages, but it was worth pushing through. The only parts I didn't like were slivers of the last few interludes. Considering my Kindle edition was 1,376 pages and I only got bored with 5-10 pages, it wasn't bad enough to write home about.<br /><br />I do like how involved my mind was with all of the characters. And I'll say that if I ever meet the child version of Henry Bowers I'd like to break his jaw. Makes me sick to think that kids like him really exist and make the lives of other children a living hell. All of the characters in this book were SO believably real, and that's what I loved about It.<br /><br />After I finish a couple of other books I'm sure I'll read this one again.

1936608618|5.0|This book should be a mandatory read if not a text book for physical education departments. It boggles my mind that they (most) are still not teaching the basics in schools, sports, gyms etc  For that reason alone, this book will save you.  Not only is the presentation eye catching but it's clear cut and simple as can be.  This is a GREAT reference to all basic human movements performed in the gym as well as real life.  Regardless if you Crossfit or not, EVERYONE at some point in their lives will run, walk, bike, lift, swim etc  Why not learn how to perform these moves safely, efficiently and correctly?  Excellent work guys. Your research was not done in vein :)  Thanks!!

0307887448|3.0|The quote on the back cover describes Ready Player One as \\"Willy Wonka for Adults\\". Um, No. Regardless of the authors intended audience (and having so many 80's references implies an older audience) the writing is the kind that will appeal to young teenagers. It's high on concept and as someone who spent all but a little over a month of his teenage years in the 80's I should love this book but the writing is very weak and amateurish.<br /><br />The world of Ready Player One is pretty much how I would imagine the world of WALL-E except a few years before the stuff finally hit the fan. Climate change and over consumption have left the planet on the brink of collapse and rather than face up to the bleak reality most people prefer to spend their time in the massive online VR simulator OASIS created by the 80's obsessed James Halliday. After Halliday passes away he sends a prerecorded message to the world that he has hidden an \\"Easter Egg\\" somewhere in OASIS and whoever finds it will receive his $240 billion dollar fortune. The first clue is a 4 line riddle. Knowing Halliday's obsession the world's gamers begin to exhaustively research 80's pop culture in order to get into the mind of Halliday and solve the puzzle and so it goes for 5 years as not a single person manages to find the first key.<br /><br />The concept is cool but I don't buy any of it. If there is one person you can't hide something from it's a motivated gamer. In 2010 2K Sports offered $1 million dollars to anyone who could pitch a perfect game with their latest baseball game. Some questioned whether it was even possible. The achievement was met an hour and a half after the contest started. Easter Eggs are nothing new in video games but unless the Easter Egg is unannounced and locked behind something like a complex series of button pushes it WILL be found. There is no way OASIS is big enough to hide the first key which was actually fairly well marked. Even if you couldn't fully decode Halliday's riddle a brute force search would have found it quickly particularly since it was shown that OASIS includes some kind of pattern recognition tool for locating specific places over the surface of an entire planet. This problem is magnified by the fact that there is an evil organization employing thousands of gaming geeks whose only goal is finding the Easter Egg. On the other hand many of physical tasks to winning are WAY too hard and the manner in which the protagonist breezes through them is ridiculous.<br /><br />The unfeasibility of the Easter Egg hunt is only the tip of the iceberg but if I just close my brain and try not to think about it I could just play along and try and figure out the riddles myself. As someone who lived through the 80's I should have a decided advantage. The whole point of everyone learning every nuances of the 80's including individual lines from movies is to give them an edge in the competition EXCEPT THE RIDDLES AREN'T 80'S BASED!!! How does the author screw that up?!?! The first and second riddle relate to things from the late 70' and the third is from the very early 70's. In the case of the second riddle it's so obscure that it stretches credibility that it could be figured out so quickly and the book reveals the answer immediately so even if the reader WANTED to try and figure it out there's no chance. Other parts of the riddles relate to things within OASIS that the reader could never know about.<br /><br />Despite its high reviews this book is, in my opinion, not ready for prime time. This is the authors first book and it reads more like fan fiction than a professionally authored book. I assume the publisher felt that if enough 80's nods were crammed into the book the aging nerd audience (myself included) would eat it up regardless of how weak the writing is and it appears the publisher was correct. The ending is so trite and hollow that it seems hard to believe that anyone older than thirteen could find it satisfying. The main character isa creepy recluse that I couldn't identify with in the least and struggled to root for. The romance was about as heartwarming as the love affair of Anakin and Padme. Ernest Cline shows no real cleverness or successful humor. He includes a simulation of Max Headroom but captured none of Headroom's acerbic humor and merely had him stutter. The entire contest was a horror with much of society devoting their lives to living in a VR world researching Halliday and 80's minutia. In fact the top players and heroes of the book are successful because they are the most pathetically obsessed. Halliday should have been pilloried for what he did not honored. The weird thing was that I actually found the book to be somewhat of a page turner because the concept was so fascinating but the execution left me wishing I had skipped it entirely.a creepy recluse that I couldn't identify with in the least and struggled to root for.

B004EK926K|4.0|There were some scary parts, but my daughters (6 and 9 years old) both liked the movie and understood the plot.
1419705849|5.0|I admit that I missed two books from this series, since I found them not so funny anymore. However, I love this one! It is as good as the first.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Being of the age of or a little younger than the characters in this movie, made me appreciate the situations in which they found themselves - the scene with Judi Dench trying to deal with a customer service agent in India was especially familiar..  Some characters moved half-way around the world by choice, some by circumstance.  It was lovely to see how each person grew into a new role and how each got a second chance.  I wish I had the courage to begin an adventure like this.<br /><br />At first, I thought this was more a movie for us seniors.  However, old age can be scary and unexpected things happen.  It was very nice to see people who would be considered &#34;set in their ways&#34; forced to explore a side of themselves they never knew they had.  Just goes to show that you never stop learning about yourself.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for everyone over the age of 45 and to all the young viewers: watch it, you'll be older someday too.  It might give you a new perspective on those of us who drive a little slower and talk a little too much.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic calculator functions but it's super handy to have on my Kindle! It has nice big numbers/buttons so I don't have a problem with hitting the wrong numbers. And it's FREE!
1451695195|4.0|It was very detailed and interesting. I would like to have heard more about his heaven experience though.  He is a very smart doctor.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|I love this movie. The BLU-RAY version is exceptionally clean compared to the regular DVD. I never grow tired of watching Any Dufraine. A cool guy!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is very addictive ... lots of no brain fun! I like to just relax and see what prizes drop next. Definitely a fun one when you just want to relax and waste time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I think Mr. Follett's work is second to none! This book should be required reading for the world. It helps us realize how a few can can control and lead a mass of people into the depths of hell. The book combines history and a wonderful novel. Mr Follett has a way of making history exciting and easy to understand. He takes a balanced look at a very difficult time and it should serve to be a warning for all good people to be educated, informed and involved.  Most important it is a great book from front to finish.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Enjoyed the game while it worked.  Was fun to play. Now I am having the same problem other people are.....after the intro movie it goes back to home screen.  I reinstalled same thing.....I reset my kindle same error....frustrating to put time into the game be enjoying it and then nothing.  would be 4 stars if not for this error.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This third book of the trilogy is extremely entertaining.  It was very hart to stop reading the book.  If you have read the previous two, this one is a must.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is a great idea to get this game if you like mlp so if you are a hatee just go get a diffrent game.
0307279189|5.0|This was a great book.  It was a blend of a story and some good technical information about running. The story and the technical information were so closely interwoven, that it just became a great story and you learned some technical info from it. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to runners.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is just what I was looking for. I appreciate the daily information and games, as well, makes me feel smarter!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My first book on my new kindle. I couldn't put it down! Read all three books in the trilogy in three days. I highly recommend them!!
0547884591|4.0|Love this book for the learning techniques.....amazing.  I'm not into cooking at all.  However, his learning methods are really valuable.  I like the idea of scheduling time to learn any new skill, and use the fastest most concise method that one can afford.  I did watch his video with Leo Baubauta from Zen Habits.org.  These two guys, Leo and Tim are pure opposites, Leo is as calm as a cucumber, Tim is jumping around with enthusiasm.  Get the book, you'll learn a lot!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Lovely series.  Quite addictive.  Quality production, quality dialogues and relatable as to life process, relationships, people's life journeys and the lessons learnt.  Not much more to say except if you have not seen them, please get them. You will not regret it.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|1+2&times;3 doesn't equal 9.  it equals 7. your stock andriod calculator is better than this app! the programmers need to review their math rules.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Very fine compilation. Brought back memories of the disco era and the movie Saturday Night Fever and Staying Alive. Good mix.
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is the latest collection of Tim's learning about life.  I was so happy to be able to pre-order the book.  When it came to my house, I was mesmerized by the photos.  This book is eclectic and delightful for people who like to do their own thinking and exploring.  Tim - Thank you for your effort and willingness to share your experience on this great experiment.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Nice to have a video when there is only one surviving Bee Gee. Hard to replace a legend. Most enjoyable.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|My son was listening to this album and I think that he was going for the parent shock factor (lots of f-bombs) but the truth is I really liked what I was hearing. The lyrics all told some really good stories with insight into relationships that many can probably relate to at one time or another.<br /><br />I picked up some \\"cool mom\\" points when I was discovered listening to \\"The Truth Is\\" in my SUV. I hadn't told my son that I had purchased this album. When he found out I had the album, he called his friend over and said, \\"Guess what my mom is listening to?\\" His friend just smiled. I am loving my cool mom points as much as the album.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. It was action packed from the beginning until the end. Would highly recommended the movie!
B00009XITP|5.0|Nice story line. This movie and also has teaching and learning moments as The Deep End of The Ocean. A winner for all.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Excellent album. The music, lyrics, photos, side stories; everything about it is great! Listen to it whenever I can, especially on long drives.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I do Love the Culture novels.<br />And I love Iain Banks for bringing them to us.<br />It's a universe/a concept that I truly long for.<br /><br />Actually, The Algebraist was the first novel I ever read by Banks.<br />After that, I fell right into The Culture universe<br />with additional Transitions into Feersum Dark Background Endjinns.<br /><br />Anyway, I've never written a review<br />but I will try to do something here that isn't too confusing or boring.<br />There will be Spoilers though-so if you have not read The Hydrogen Sonata--<br />do not continue reading this.<br />I would also recommend that if you have never read a Culture novel<br />that you start with Consider Phlebas and read the rest in the order they were published.<br />It will be worth it. And help you gain inferred alien cachet value(positive)(honorary).<br />Actually, I started with The State of the Art--not that I knew what I was doing back then.<br />It was just on the shelf next to The Algebraist.<br /><br />So, I finished reading The Hydrogen Sonata last night and I was pretty pleased with it all.<br />However, there were some loose ends that kind of bugged me a bit.<br />I thought about some other Culture novels and maybe that is something Iain does on purpose.<br />Open-ended is the term I believe.<br />In prior novels, Gurgeh, Anaplian and Ledeje all go on wild rides that seem to sort of abruptly end as well.<br />Maybe it's just me. You sort of have to draw your own sort of parallel epilogue--<br />at the risk of being \\"incorrect.\\"<br />And at the risk of sounding contradictory, I am not a reader/viewer who needs every little last thing<br />spelled out for me. I do like to use my own imagination.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1. I kind of wanted the Liseiden punched in their eel mouths--hard enough to break teeth.<br />I do get how/why the Minds \\"let them go\\" with the understanding that the Culture's<br />long term disapproval would be way more damaging.<br />But still, they got away with unprovoked aggression and murder and that really bothered me.<br /><br />Maybe I'm not recalling correctly, but I also feel like someone should have definitely included the Beats Working<br />in on all of the developments-as it was the ship actually escorting the Ronte fleet toward this mess.<br />It sort of made for a sad side-plot in the end.<br />Melancholia Enshrines All Triumph is a most splendid name--and the name of my next cat--<br />but it was unfortunate that it also seemed to be their epitaph.<br /><br />With that being said, I was a little surprised the Beats Working was destroyed. Really??I mean, it seemed like child's play for it to haul along a whole dancing fleet of Ronte ships and it seemed child's play how it just disabled the Leseiden ships--not even actually being head on aggressive yet. So I found that suspicious that one missile killed it. I rather thought the Beats Working was going to turn up again. But I guess that last missile from the platform must have been seriously heavy duty.<br /><br />2. Jewilin of the Iwenick seemed a little suspect to me.<br />I couldn't put my finger on it but he seemed on the sly/smug side of things.<br />I thought there would be more with him/them but I guess not.<br />I was a little curious how the Iwenick and Leseiden hooked up--or if it was done for them.<br /><br />3. General Reikl and the 14th getting just wiped out like that was tragic.<br />I kind of thought that she was transmitting herself at the end as the shuttle fell into the sun<br />but we never hear from her again either. I would like to imagine that maybe she did transmit<br />some permanent FU signal to the 8*Churkun--something that blew it up later--or something.<br />I'm still not fully clear why they blew up the Z-R ship right then.<br />I mean it was like someone already knew ahead of time-<br />and met the Z-R ship there to make sure they did not actually reach Zyse.<br />As if the 8*Churkun was temporarily possessed.<br /><br />4. Fzan-Juym and Eshri seemed liked a kick ass base though.<br />Sadly, further bizarre Reikl and Cossont interactions were not in the cards.<br />I would have love to have seen a face off/fist fight between Reikl and Chekwri.<br /><br />5. Parinherm was here then gone as well. I just knew he was going to have a showdown with Urthuane but that didn't happen. Then I was like, \\"Ooh, he's gonna be recharged, show up again and Show OUT<br />when they go back to the airship--but nope--that didn't happen either.<br />I was pretty disappointed he just ended up at the bottom of an elevator shaft.<br />Not In Sim.<br /><br />6. Banstegeyn, Chewkri and Agansu got off scott free too. They didn't deserve to Sublime not after all the innocent deaths they caused.<br /><br />7. Why even have anything with the Zoologist? I mean it was cool to have someone aboard who had Sublimed and then returned. But I was thinking he was going to actually contribute something to the story beyond that.<br />He too--just disappeared. I'm sure me and the Caconym weren't the only ones who were disappointed.<br />Or maybe the Zoologist was some of secret secret agent? For who?<br />Him abandoning ship the same time the Gzilt sublimed was a little curious.<br /><br />8. Ximenyr?<br /><br />Despite all the that I still really enjoyed the novel.<br />And I believe this Culture novel was more a Ship/Minds novel.<br />I like ship action.<br />And I really like homoerotic ship action.<br /><br />The Mistake Not...<br />is a Badass.<br /><br />The Girdlecity was just mind-boggling.<br />It had to bigger than even I was imagining because just the Equatorial 353 had to be enormous--<br />not even counting the ginormous tunnel it had to be traveling in.<br />And I loved/envied Vyr walking around the empty expanse of the Girdlecity--<br />the wind--the twilight--the vastness.<br /><br />I also grudgingly came to be ok with the fact that Vyr was not a soldier.<br />I was like, \\"Oh, she's got four arms?!

B0041O40EI|4.0|I received the reaction I wanted from my daughter when she opened her birthday gift. When she saw<br />London she squealed. I don't know anything about the actual experience. The promise of what could be done was appealing to her.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app, as it runs on the 8.9\\" Kindle HD, is awful. It loads 8-12 posts and that is it. Then it just goes into permanent \\"thinking\\" mode. I like to be able to scroll through older posts, so now I'm forced to log in through the Silk browser app (which is also bad) if I want to use Facebook on the device.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a good starter puzzle/game.  It goes a little slow and I've only done one or two at this point (don't really have time this time of year) but just from solving the puzzles I did, I like it.  I feel they are just about the right challenge for me. Some puzzlers would probably not find them hard enough. They may get harder as you complete them, I don't know. But I say give it a try, can't beat the price!
B004ZNB12O|5.0|just get this disc.<br /><br />sound quality, content.. eveything's perfect. recommended to me by a friend. i know some ppl would like some other tracks on this cd (as i do..) but hey, it's just a cd and can only hold so much :-(
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It gets a little more difficult as you go along. I only wish there was a way to skip a puzzle when you can't figure it out but you can't so I'm stuck for a bit.  Eventually I'll figure it out though.
B008B68IEA|5.0|Just bought this for our daughter's birthday and it is amazing.  We got it before the Christmas season rush drove the price up to unreasonable and before it hit store shelves.  She loves it and is a perfect companion for Abbey Dead Tired.  If your little darling is a monster collector, then get this for her (but wait until the price comes back down.)
B0027MJU00|5.0|This item arrived promptly and as described.  An A-Plus seller and one I would easily use again. Excellent packaging was used.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a very good app in my opinion. Yes you will have to spend money to get the very last things done but to even get to that part would take forever anyways. Brohoof /)
B000VSYDRM|5.0|Entertaining, wit and well made. A great movie that enables the senses and makes us think of things that we usually dont think about.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Very funny take on all the possibilities for the composition of today's modern California family.  No stone left unturned and a few surprises along the way.  The whole family loves it.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Classic Christmas songs with a Michael Buble twist. A great addition to my Christmas CD collection. I highly recommend this CD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is a fun ride all the way to the end. Brings a sense of normalcy back to the characters.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|As you dig a little deeper in this book, you find that all isn't what it seemed in the first book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining!  I haven't found 1 bug in it yet!  which is very good.  the game takes a while ti complete which mmakes it.even better. I have killed my battery multiple times trying to finish! Hahaha great game.

Now you're making me<br />Write an ESSAY? That's what I do at s-c-h-o-o-l. I had to spell<br />It out for you because you're \\"Necessary\\" little ESSAY just gave you a reputation of stupidity.

B004GJDQT8|5.0|The design is very intuitive and easy to use.  The response to product requests is quick and accurate.  Good job.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This novel is filled with historical facts as well as 'alive' characters.  Haven't read even half of the book but have enjoyed it thus far.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I love Maroon 5 and this is their best album yet! I can't describe it, but you should definitely buy it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is a great story teller and the Racketeer is no exception.  Lot's of twists, turns, and the unexpected.  I couldn't put it down.  It was the first time in a while that I experienced the guilty pleasure of spending all day on Saturday on the couch...reading.
B000068G5F|5.0|Plays excellently, has 2 double-sided vinyls, and a flawless vinyl sleeve. Certainly a necessity if you're an RHCP fan with a record player, especially if you're a fan of the songs &#34;By The Way&#34;, &#34;Universally Speaking&#34;, and/or &#34;Can't Stop&#34;!
B000GWE44U|4.0|Great choice for Halloween or winter slumber party. Be warned!!! Super scary scene with Shelley Duvall opening a gallon can of fruit cocktail and sloshing it into a serving bowl!!! Aaaiiiggghhh! There are only three of you there! How are you going to hork that crap down?!! Made me nauseous, had to look away.
B006J3Y20Q|5.0|To start out with, this book has a wonderful plot, wonderful story, and I'd recommend this book to everyone, although I'd especially recommend it to people who prefer fiction stories, more specifically in the Fantasy genre.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved the way Pi was continually grateful to God for everything.  No matter the circumstance he found something to be grateful for.  This is what I took away from this epic story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 rocks.  Special effects are so much better this year.  Story line is very dark, lots of killing both zombies and humans.
0345803485|1.0|After reading just 1 chapter I lost interest ... It started off dull and repetitive ... I don't see what all the  excitement was about ..I will not recommend this poorly written  dull  book to anyone else .. I actually took the book back and  got my money back . It is a complete  waste
B000FZERIG|5.0|Often overlooked in the wake of Harrison's &#34;All Things Must Pass&#34;, (George's previous studio recording) time has been kinder to this third solo Harrison release than when it first appeared on the music scene in the early seventies. Indeed this effort stands on its own in solid musicianship (thanks to the stellar supporting cast of sidemen Voorman, Keltner, Hopkins, Gordon and Wright) What Living In The Material World lacks in overarching big production, big statement of its studio predecessor more than makes up for in rendering an intimate portrait of an artist attempting to balance or at least make sense of his “spiritual awakening” against the routine of everyday life. Make no mistake about it, the tight, crisp production backed by a solid, extraordinary rhythm section showcases some very well crafted writing by Harrison. From the upbeat bouncy, Phil Spector beat “Don’t Let Me Wait Too Long” through the lovely personally transparent “Who Can See It” and the rich, full sound of “Try Some Buy Some” this is a thoroughly consistent and melodically appealing release. I must say, when the album first was released in 73, some of Harrison critics and fans (myself included) were disappointed in the wait between studio albums (“All Things Much Pass”) which was released in 1970 and anticipated a heavier, wider sweeping sound and songwriting effort. Instead what we hear in “Living In The Material World” is music and lyrics that convey honest emotion and sense George’s disappointment with stardom, legal red tape spiritual dynamics of having one foot in the “material world” and the other in a “spiritual sky” as well as personal issues and pain in this period. What remains here is a totally musically satisfying lyrically insightful effort which lacks any pretension of some of the stadium and art rock band productions that were becoming the latest trend in this period of rock. A joy to listen to not a disappointment at all!
0205313426|5.0|AWESOME! Straight-to-the-point grammar guide. Everyone that writes on a daily basis should own a copy! I plan on using this in my classroom next year.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I loved the movie when I saw so I had to get it in blue ray to get the full experience in better quality. And the price was awesome.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Honestly, I loved the first Expendables.  I think it was pretty much the &#34;perfect&#34; cheesy action film.  It had tons of people that I really wanted to see in one  place.  It was great.<br /><br />I felt this one didn't quite live up to the same standard.  Sure, it had more &#34;stars&#34; (Arnold, Willis, CHUCK), but it didn't have as much energy.  There wasn't as much interaction between the characters, which really had a rapport going in the first one.  There was substantially less dialogue.  The bad guy just wasn't as interesting.  Van Damme will never be accused of being a great actor, but he was very 1-dimensional in this movie, very caricartured, almost laughable.  I thought they dynamics they had for the first one were great- they were very believable.  Dude wants to seize power and install his cult of personality on the island to make it &#34;better&#34;.  He doesn't have enough money, so needs an outside benefactor.  He doesn't like being anyone's lackey.  Stuff.  Oh, and he was intense, as were the gringoes calling the shots.  The rescue was a bit more emotionally appealing, too.  In this one, it's just not really believable.  Not inconceivable, just doesn't seem like it was developed enough.<br /><br />Worth seeing, just don't expect for it to be as good as the first...
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It is free shipping. It works as the description. No flaws at all.<br />I put it on my gpu of my dell laptop, and a nvidia gtx card. The working temperature drops a lot.
B005D4YOWI|5.0|I will state right here, that this is all based off of first impressions, since I haven't had an opportunity to exhaustingly test these out.  I ordered a size 9 1/2, because when I went to a conversion site online, it said a European 43 is equivalent to a 9, and I heard these tend to run small, so I went up a 1/2 size.  Since I have 3 pairs of Vibram 5-Fingers, all in 43, that fit snug, I figured that 9 1/2 would be fine.  Well, let me tell you, they were quite tight.  I promptly contacted the seller and informed them I would be making a return and had size 10 replacements in the mail within a few days- I got my replacements before they got their returned pair back.  So, the moral of the story is, order at least 1 size greater than your estimated shoe size, if you are converting from European sizing, and that their customer service is excellent and speedy.  They even reimbursed $6 of my return fee.<br /><br />So, on to the shoes.  The new ones are great.  The pictures give you an idea, but these things look and feel incredibly sturdy.  I bought some mandals in Israel, that had Vibram bottoms and looked very rugged, but they started coming apart sooner than I would have anticipated (and, to add injury to insult, they were more expensive than these!).  I feel these won't suffer that fate.  The bottoms are incredibly thick, and everything looks really well put together.  I read some reviews where people claimed to have had theirs in good working condition for years, and I am inclined to believe them.  The leather is thick and high quality looking, not the cheap stuff you often seen on boots or sandals.  Not using loop-holes or buckles probably also helps to keep these going.  They provide good support;, and properly snug.  The toe is no joke, where I feel you could actually kick rocks and not be the worse for wear.  Plus, you don't have to worry about those places that won't let you in because you have open-toed shoes, which is always nice.  Oh, and these definitely look good.  Obviously not good, but fashionably interesting.<br /><br />The negatives?  Well, I anticipate that foot sweating will be high, since you dont have as much ability for your feet to breath in these as normal sandals and they ARE quite snug.  I wish there was a bit more ability to adjust things, like the heel strap, for instance.  I am not having a fitting problem, but I think it would be nice to have that option, and I can imagine some people might not be satisfied with how they are adjusted (using the elastic cord thingy, which allows you to make specific sections along the top and sides of the foot more or less tight).<br /><br />So, I bought these for some trekking in S. America.  I plan on spending 6 months down there, hiking all over the place, so I'll update this when I get back, or possibly a little sooner, depending.<br /><br />* Update *<br />After using these almost exclusively during my 6 months in South America, they are still going strong.  Lost a bit of tread, but certainly not even close to bald.  Fortunately, they never developed the \\"stinky feet\\" smell, which is a big plus.  I ran in them and hiked in them, and walked countless hours in them, and never had a problem.  Quite comfortable and practical.  They are sufficiently attractive looking that I could wear them when going out, and while they probably didn't look great, they were passable- never got told I couldn't enter a club with them on (though, admittedly, there is more leeway given to gringoes in general).  Had lots of people compliment me on them, because they liked the design.  Never got a stubbed toe, which is pretty awesome.  I can say, they literally have zero problems- the quality is quite good.  Very happy with my decision to purchase these, and highly recommend them.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a wonderful book and i definitely recommend it. It has a mix of action, adventure and humor, with a touch of romance which makes it exciting. It's in the characters point of view so you know how they feel. If your a reader who loves Greek, Roman gods and giants and such, with powers, then you will definitely enjoy this book. Its also the third book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Typical MI movie. Tom Cruise is his usual self in this movie. I will pass on the next iteration of this series.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|When I first saw this trailer, I thought it was going to tell a different tale. A folk story of the Boudica (a female warrior). While it didn't go the way I thought, it was still a good movie. Definitely for kids, especially for mothers and daughters.
B000I186FW|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies. It is necessary to sit through it without interruption. A great movie. I will purchase it for my collection.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Several of my dear friends have said this is a movie to buy and watch over and over.  I watched it once, and then bought it, because it is a treasure that I could barely begin to take in in one viewing!  I'm so happy to be reminded that we can decide how the past plays out in the present, how deep and strong is the human spirit, and how enduring love takes many forms.  Jean T
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I am kind of puzzled by this movie. It could have gone in a number of directions. However, it ended up shallow, and without direction. I enjoyed the special effects, but, there should have been more of a story.
B001DJLCRC|2.0|The pilot was good enough to get me to see the first episode. The first episode was bad enough to keep me from seeing the second episode. The humor is for school kids. I would have liked it if I was still in school. The DVD was a gift so I'll push through to the second episode. I hope it gets more intelligent.<br /><br />If I was terminal I would let my wife know and I wouldn't start a carrier destroying other people lives before I died.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I could not wait to get this all the other reveiws are correct this man is fantastic very relaxing jazz and done in a genius way  im taking this to new york with me just for the joy of looking out the bus window and let the sound track begin.<br />my favorites are<br /><br />without you<br /><br />new breed<br /> miss marlene<br />the good stuff<br /><br />this is definetly a cd for getting friends together with bottles of wine and a good cigar for the holidays as only fagens music can.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Since it was written for 'young adults' I wasn't expecting much.  I assumed it would be something similar to the Twilight series which I found horrible.  But it was well written and I couldn't put it down.  I still haven't finished the series but so far, so good!
B008RTE08E|4.0|One of the more &#34;odd&#34; movies of that generation, but captures the Beatles in all their musical glory!  John's &#34;I am the Walrus&#34; was and is still brilliantly warped.  &#34;Fool on the Hill&#34; showcases Paul's vocals with scenes befitting the strangeness going on around him.  George's &#34;Blue Jay Way&#34; is eerie and haunting, but stands out as a showcase moment.  Of course, Ringo IS Ringo..and there's nothing wrong with that!<br /><br />If you like your spaghetti served with a shovel; check it out...just keep your expectations moderate unless you are a BIG Beatles fan!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is an exceptionally well done video.  To be able to watch it 3D in your home is incredible.  Whether or not you agree or appreciate the premise of the story, the special effects in 3D is spectacular.  I would highly recommend this movie as it is a movie that I would definitely watch more than once.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I rated it 5 stars as it had the information  regarding the Kindle Fire that I needed.  I would suggest anyone that has the Fire to get it too.
0786958731|5.0|-it leaves you wantin more<br />-you can paint the figures<br />-it has many adventures that dont lose replay value<br />-map is new picked by you<br />-room for custom ideas<br />-you can combine all three games!<br />-good for a serious RPGER and a NOVICE<br />-doesnt take nearly as long to learn roles as other games like arkham horror<br />need i say more
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry is such a hero for all! really enjoyed this final episode! am g;ad that this is finally available ! Thanks for your speedy service!
0679809015|5.0|Yes, I keep this book in my purse for those times my 24 month grandson needs his attention redirected.  The book is great for those times he gets restless.  He loves to name the animals and open the doors to find the animals.  The book is sturdy and he loves it!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|story line not as good as UP, kids probably didn't notice. every thing else, done well.needed a better side kick
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this for my Britax B-Agile stroller and have used it on my Abiee stroller too. It works on both.  It can hold a sippy cup, most any cups/bottles I've put in it, along with my phone and wallet.  Its super handy to move to either and hold my stuff too.  I've used it for about a year now and it still works and holds up to my use!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Good Read.  A solid Jack Reacher story that keeps you engaged and wanting ot read to the end.  I recommend
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I bought this for my grandson for his birthday.  He loves it and even took it to bed with him.  His mom says he really loves the toy and still plays with it!  He's 8.
1416583408|5.0|What a great read for any dog or animal lover. I learned a lot and enjoyed every word. Great gift.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I watch this movie every year. I have it on DVD but because I now own a 60&#34; plasma TV I decided to buy the BR copy. It looked great.
0061780308|5.0|As a dog owner and lover, it is the best! It made long drives entertaining. The story provides tears and laughter.
0131988425|5.0|All new. Unused book. A great deal with favorable rice. The content of the book is great too. As a required text book, recommand it.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I love the series! I have shared this with friends. A very good buy. Something to watch over and over again.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the star wars theme and angry birds and it is addicting to play.  I love to play Angry Birds Star Wars it brings back memories of Star Wars.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Just not impressed with it.  Lot of kids with flilthy language.  My grandaughter put me on there because she and her sister are on and they want to keep in touch.  I prefer facebook.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|sonic Super Ear personal sound  amplifier yielded slight improvement in volume of  TV sound but with added background noise.  Am not using.
B005AC65TS|4.0|I gotta friend I was in Vietnam with, he's gotta classic pickup truck, and every once in awhile when the moon turns blue and your breath hangs in the chilled night air of the mountains, he'll give me a call, ask if I wanna go ridin', and I aways do.  We don't say much on the flat out way to nowhere, or even on the way back.  It's in the diner, one of those little places off the inner-state, forty miles from anywhere, in the middle of no place, that we finally talk.  He pulls a disc from his jacket pocket and slides it across the table saying, \\"Been waitin' on you to play this one.  No one else keeps quiet long enough to let the songs wash in.\\"  It's the new John Hiatt album Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns, and I smiled finishing up my eggs, asked for and iced tea to go, and we were gone.  I slipped the disc into the changer, slid back the moonroof, and we headed off into the night, two old heads with more stories between us than we care to think about ... and John Hiatt putting all those stories to verse.<br /><br />After twenty albums most artists have settled into who they are, it's predictable, but not John Hiatt who brings to life some of the most intoxicating songs I've ever heard.  There's nothing on this album that's reminiscent of anything John has done before, say perhaps his analog comfortable weathered voice.  The songs have a new spark to them, they nearly jump, even if they jump softly and controlled, they still sparkle with a new attitude, absolute perfection, and resound with new influences that manage to keep John Hiatt one step ahead of anyone else strolling down the bluesy alternative country road.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B005PK1G76|5.0|This works out very well. I can keep everything organized and easy to get to. Worth the. Ones, I love it.
0307266303|5.0|So far I've only gotten through a few chapters, but so far it's a good book.  I have high expectations so I'll return once I finish it to update the review.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are great, I just wish I could have had them at my daughters wedding ceremony. I love their versions of the songs better than the originals.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was a good movie, but I believe that the book was a lot better. They touched a lot more issues in the book. This seems to be a case with most movies, due to the limited space. Overall though, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to others.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is an more complex and even more challenging game than the original Angry Birds.. lots of fun!! My grandsons love the game as well...
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I liked it.  Fun story, and beautiful scenery. My 4 year old thought it was a little slow, but made it through the whole thing and liked it overall.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I cant use it on my kindle so its pointless but you may try it on something else. I wasn't ever able to open it so I wouldn't recommend this for kindle fire owners.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|This movie was pretty good, but not fantastic.  There are a few startling moments, but the storyline is a tad predictable.  If you like Daniel Radcliffe you should watch it...
B005HSL626|3.0|Its a fun take for the kids yet gets boring fast. And its very simple so much that my two year old cousin can play it,  I need more of a challenge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read it first in the three parts, I loved it, so I bought it to have my daughter read it.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|I think anyone can relate and this is why this movie is such a success and its also an amazing movie.  Yes its a classic but one can still relate to it. Especially to the twist st the end.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Engaging an fascinating. What types of enslavement are there. How do women fit into the world in the late eighteenth century. A must read.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Its really funny, I love how the entire family can enjoy it and ive watched it over 10 times and its still not getting old.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not a Stephen King horror fan. But this book is wonderfully engaging and takes us back to a time I remember with absolute clarity. I really enjoyed it.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|Just horrible you would think from all the money they make that the quality would be better but nope you would be wrong its horrible the story isnt good and it feels like they didn't know what to do so they just tried to make the puzzle pieces fit
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Everything about this movie was terrible. Watch it when its free on netflix.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is really fun I love how it is for all ages and how they do challenge you. Also I really enjoy knowing that it gives me different choices to what to play.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This was a gift. I have had no complaints and the package looked like new. I am very happy with the service.
B00881PPTO|1.0|Recent experience with Kayak was disappointing. One and done? Hardly. You will notice that Travelocity and Orbitz are not included in the search. I have found good deals on both. Forget Priceline. Also ignore Hotwire. I'm sorry but if I am trying to compare prices, I certainly cannot rely on a site that does not show them to you. A good site for travel recommendations is Trip Advisor. Yes, it's a review site. However, you can also search multiple travel sites to find the best deal. And did I mention there is an app for that? Sorry, Kayak. This app is useless free or pro.
0545128285|5.0|This is a great book for Harry Potter fans and future generation Potterheads. I couldn't put it down. Highly Recommended.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham always amazes me on how he come create such interesting story lines.  They never seem to be all formula but to be somewhat unique.  Also, his books always have a certain reality to them rather than a lot of fantastic unrealism.
B0086449YA|5.0|I like it, my wife loves his relaxed style. Good mixture of genres. Top value, two for the price of one.
B005LAII9O|3.0|I bought this one on itunes and I have to say, I kind of regret it.  Blake Lively is just not that good of an actress.  She did good in \\"The Town\\" but other than that I haven't liked ANY of her other roles including this one.  She still seems stuck in this teenage phase which is weird.<br /><br />The main problem I had with this movie is that it was trying so hard to be deep but in the end there was nothing.  It was pretty much a superficial movie.  That would have been fine, had there been a lot of action and more shoot out scenes.  Instead we got a slow thriller with some pretty uninspired plot twists.  From the trailers you get the impression that these two guys are going to take on the cartel and get their shared hoe back.  That is not what happens.  They tip toe around the confrontation and try to get Salma Hayek's cartel to destroy itself.<br /><br />I guess the movie was trying to say something with the whole love story between the 3 main characters but all I saw was two dudes that loved each other so much that they had sex with each other through this girl.  The girl had some daddy/men issues and these guys where there for her.  They were using her to channel their suppressed homosexual feelings for each other and she was using them as father figures.  That's as deep as that relationship goes.  It was stupid and honestly this seemed to play out more like a slutty teenage girls college fantasy. I just don't see this as realistic at all.<br /><br />At one point in the movie one of the cartel assassins notices that they both sleep with the chick and calls them savages.  I guess this was supposed to be a comment on how some people see savagery in sexuality more than they do in violence.<br /><br />Out of everyone I enjoyed Salma Hayek's performance the most.  She stole every scene she was in.  That was the biggest highlight of the movie.<br /><br />In the end I'm glad I watched it, I just wish I had rented it instead of buying it.  That's what happens when you take a risk and just buy on impulse.ake a risk and just buy on impulse.
B0097JYVAU|3.0|A bit boring halfway through. Hat's off for 538's election forecasting though. A bit of a commercial for 538 it seems.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|If you havent seen or read the book of this movie yet, you are missing out!  One of my all-time favorites.  The drama and role play of each character added to a fantastic conclusion is a must see for all to witness.  After you see this film you will buy it.  I loved it on blu ray.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|I feared the worst - based on some of these reviews - but all my albums were thankfully as flat as pancakes. I've only played Abbey Road so far - and it sounded fantastic. I played the last part of side 2 back-to-back with the same album bought a couple of months ago (not remastered) and the improvements in the remastered version were obvious. I have a Project RPM1.3 with Denon DL-304 cartridge, which does a nice job. And the packaging of this box set is outstanding - really beautiful. It's obvious where the money has gone (in contrast to the mediocre Pink Floyd 'Immersion' box set packaging).<br /><br />EDIT: I'm close to the end of listening carefully to every album to see if my initial review measured up throughout, but there are some variations in quality which are puzzling. The problems emerged on HDN (surface noice - loud between songs), Rubber Soul (crackles throughout and big pops just after Taxman) and Revolver (some crackles and pops). The early albums were great. Sgt Pepper and MMT were perfect. I still have a few to go so more variations may emerge. I plan to deep clean the ones with crackles and pops to see if that fixes them. My overall impression now is disappointment that I have to worry about variable quality but relieved that my issues seem to be minor compared with what some other people have experienced.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|The lyrics and music reach a new high for Dylan.  His put a lot of creative effort into the sound and feel of this album.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|angry birds are fun to play.And a challenge as well. Actualy so many games in one since they change all the time
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I purchased this as a gift.  This show was a favorite of theirs. They absolutely loved the set. The quality if this set is great!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you thought you didn't like cello music, think again!  The cello was invented to be played like this.  I would pay twice as much for this CD, if I had to.  It lives in my car CD player and keeps me calm in all kind of traffic.  This is music for the soul.
0547884591|5.0|I've been following Tim for quite sometime now. His writing is always spot on, and always innovative.<br /><br />Just received this newest incarnation of his genius, and I gotta say - did it again.<br /><br />First off this book is not what you might be expecting... It's HUGE, and FULL of freaking awesomeness.<br />Let's just call it a cook-book on Life. It's principle based so you can immediately take the concepts and apply them to anything you want to master.<br /><br />If you're serious about personal development, or learning a new skill... this is the cheapest and fastest method of gaining proficiency to mastery, period. The only thing faster would be to mentor with a master of the skill you're looking to acquire. Good luck with that. In the meantime - get the book, crack it open, and get crushing whatever you've got on your plate... no pun intended - or intended. ;o)
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Kristen Stewart just cannot keep her own sullen mopey personality from showing through in her acting.  I thought she might do a better job than the Twilight movies, but alas, it's the same.  The only saving grace to this movie was Charlize Theron who turned in a great performance as the wicked queen.
B008KE3960|5.0|This game is quite fun.  There are numerous free maps (which you purchase using &#34;gears&#34; that you acquire through in game victories) in addition to free planes/jets/etc.  There are also achievements to be...  achieved... by way of leveling up your planes, beating maps, destroying x number of enemies, etc., so even after all maps have been beaten there's more to do.<br /><br />You *don't* have to sink any real money into it in order to enjoy it, but really...  what's three whole dollars?  People who are complaining about spending three dollars shouldn't have a phone capable of playing these games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I decided to try this game based on other reviews, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. The upper levels are challenging enough to make me think, but I have done very well solving them. This is the type of game I can pick up and play for a few minutes, so I find it very enjoyable.<br /><br />The ads are small and at the bottom of the screen so they don't interfere with play. I highly recommend this game!
B008UUPOVM|4.0|The first song I ever heard from these guys was Fireflies.  The album has a lot of energy in the beginning and then it winds down as you get deeper into the album.  Lots of catchy tunes on this album.  Got this for my wife because she likes Owl City and it was on sale for a good price.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I didn't realize there was a story behind all this sex stuff. There is...and it's good and sweet. Good read.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I am not much of a country guy but my wife is.  She really likes this band so I picked it up for her on sale.  The band sounds very good, the music flows well and I think  they will be around for a long time.  I heard \\"If I Die Young\\" on the radio and figured I would buy their album.
0740748475|5.0|the binding on this ed. of book is top noch! this bookset is a joy to have ,im enjoying it daily
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I have heard a few songs from Taylor Swift and they all have a nice flow and seem to all be hits.  It is rare that you find a young artist like Taylor Swift be as successful as she has been.  I usually listen to rock, but my wife likes Taylor Swift so I bought this for her plus it was on sale.
1451695195|5.0|Fascinating and provocative, the premise of an astral personality that is (presumably) indestructable goes beyond normal credability. The concept is at once incomprehensible, attractive, and a bit scary. A place beyond time and space with no judgemental issues is foreign to our logic. Is there purpose? Is there feeling? Are there responsibilities to this melieu?<br />Flying entities, beautiful music, no pain, no contrasts or challenges. Heaven or hell?<br />I do not doubt Alexander's veracity in this work.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best way to view without paying the awful monthly cost of cable..plus by buying  when it is over, is not gone (as it would be with cable) is saved in a great little library and can watch over again as often as you feel the need to..This is some of the best stuff out there outside a theater
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'll be reading this again and again over the years.  I hope life really never comes to this, it would suck
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Discovering these concepts will greatly impact my personal and professional life.<br />This book is a must read for my team and my wife!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|This was a great read, though sometimes you just need to skip over the sex and get to the story. And by the 3rd book it felt like they just wante to wrap tings up in a pretty bow.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!  Can not wait for the third and final book.  I can't wait to see what happens between the characters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved the story, and the surprises that came on the way! Once again Grisham succeeds in writing a book that you just can't put down until you've finished it.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I tried to use at thanksgiving and I couldn't get it to save and then it just went black - also you can't see what you are taking pictures of - I think it is worthless
B003IDMUX6|5.0|I can't remember when's the last time that I actually laughed aloud when reading a book, did it many times when reading this book. This book is great,  I couldn't put it down, so finished reading it in one day.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Case is well built, strong and comes with all screws and clips etc. Sleek and cool looking, but requires some decent fans to make good ventilation possible. My 2 stock molex fans were pretty weak to say the least.<br /><br />*Edited* I've had this case for a while now, it still looks great and does everything it promised. I will suggest this for anyone building a machine.
B00005LK94|5.0|I've seen this movie a while back & loved it.  I'm glad I bought it for my movie collection.  A wonderful true story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like minecraft and minecraft pe I recommend minecraft fans should buy this app and 7 dollars is worth it because minecraft is really awesome
B0064MT1U8|5.0|Without a doubt, one of my favorite films about the theatre - and this transfer to Blu-ray is utterly gorgeous.<br /><br />The film, filled with wonderful theatrical \\"inside\\" jokes and sight-gags, features a brilliantly witty script, gorgeous costumes, and utterly delicious acting.<br /><br />Not to be missed, this one!
1439153663|4.0|This was a great quick read. can't wait to get other books by this author.<br />i really like the plot of this book.<br />This item came in on time and was exactly as described.
0060531053|2.0|Charlie might be the godfather of home brewing, but the information (and pictures) in this book are starting to show their age.  There is a really great wealth of information found between the two covers of this book, and certainly enough to get a new home brewer started down the path of the best hobby in the world.  However, the details are a bit shaky, if not completely wrong, compared to most of the information available 9 years after this latest edition was published.  I rented this book from the library a year after reading through John Palmer's How to Brew a few times over the course of a year; I really have to recommend Palmer's bible over this bible because it provides much more accurate and updated information, not to mention the pictures are a lot more informational and a lot less cheesy (do you really need to have your wife and a pint of beer in hand in every single picture??).  Pick this up as a resource once you've decided this is a hobby you enjoy, but use How to Brew as a guide and read about the latest methods from online forums first; they will help you weed out the outdated advice and methods in this book.
B000T46O52|5.0|I was looking for this movie for a while.  I needed to write a paper on it for school and the only place I could find it was on Amazon.  I am taking a class on law and society and the movie definitely has an interesting perspective on lawyers.  I enjoyed Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington's acting, no wonder Tom Hanks won an Academy Award for this movie.  I really thought this movie was fantastic.  I was a little disappointed after finding out that the real family in this movie did not receive proceeds, I think they settled on a lawsuit later.  I think the movie creators, and the studio should have involved the family considering what they had to go through and the movie was going to exploit that for the studio's monetary gain.  However, this has nothing to do with the actual movie and performaces which were fantastic.
1423140605|5.0|OH MY GOD!!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AGES!!! I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH I'M ALREADY FINISHED WITH IT AND I JUST STARTED READING! It's in fantastic shape, handling for everything was great since not even a page was bent. I love amazon's services so much but they can get a wee bit expensive ;) I recommend this book to anybody who has a little thing for greek mythology.. but a bit of advice, don't buy it unless you finish reading the series &#34;Percy Jackson & The Olympians&#34; and also the other books from this series, which is called &#34;The Heroes of Olympus&#34;
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have recommended this book to friends and family, even some people I didn't know. The way this book is written is fantastic.  The author really makes you start thinking. I love the symbols and the story. The book takes place in WW2, so it is depressing (sorry if that spoiled it for anyone), but I think everyone should read it. The message and the characters are unforgettable.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I loved all of them! I felt like I retired my libido when I finished, so I am excited to look online for another book or books to read that will entice me as much as these did.
0060853980|3.0|The book arrived early and while I enjoyed some of the other stories this just didn't click.<br />Could just be I wasn't in the right frame of mind.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series, the attraction between Gideon and Eva is unbelievable. Their struggle to stay a couple amongst so many obstacles and heartbreak was almost painful to read, you really feel for them as a couple trying to find true love after so many heartbreaks they had to go through in their past. I can't wait for the next book.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Ive been doing this long enough to know this was a demo but I don't mind because it lets me try a game out before I dish out 5 bucks which by the way was paid because I couldn't get enough!!! I play all of the mumbo-jumbo; firemaple; alawar; G5 type adventure/h.o games and this game is one of the great ones. Graphics and storyline are fantastic and I'm great at hidden object but was challenged here. Had fun and thought the demo was long enough to get me really going! Paid for the full version without even blinking.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Ok, I am usually not a cry in my pop corn bowl type of girl but this one just did it.  I have three daughters so you can see why it resonated with me and them. I don't buy many movies now but this one was one I definitely had to own. I enjoyed the story, the accents and all the characters... and with a Lightning Deal of $8 bucks, I LOVED it even more!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Ok I am from South Africa, this Friday I am off to see the controversial Queen Monster in Johannesburg showcasing her \\"Born this way Ball World Tour\\", would have never decided to go if it was not for the actual CD \\"Born this Way\\", you see I was never a Gaga fan, The Fame did nothing for me, except for a few tracks like Poker Face, Just Dance and Eh Eh (Nothing Else I can say), but I did not bother buying the CD. The Fame Monster, got my attention with the Bad Romance Epic Video, also Alejandro and Telephone tracks have great videos and are okay songs, I appreciated Lady Gagas hard work and creative abilities in her music and videos, even though I would cringe at some of her imagery and symbolisms within them.<br /><br />Born this Way, was a surprise to me, I remember all the hype, decided to buy the CD and thoroughly enjoyed it, from beginning to end, it's a single led pop/dance/rock masterpiece, the work and time taken in the production is mind blowing, her improved theatrical vocals impressed me greatly too:<br /><br />Marry the night (4/5):  A great Opener, very rock diva driven, a great vocal and song, weird video but good enough to get you dancing.<br /><br />Government Hooker (4/5): Amazing track, great hard beat and typical sassy diva in heat vocal, great track.<br /><br />Born this way (5/5)  One of her finest tracks, with a rocking message, do not care that it has similar tones to Madonna's Express Yourself, Madonna is also a queen of taking popular ideas and making it her own, Vogue being one of them, ain't nothing wrong with that, a riveting, devilish, but creative video, this song went straight to Number 1 all over the world and propelled the album to have the biggest opening weeks sales of over a million in the first week, love this track.<br /><br />Judas: (5/5) I do not understand why I love this track so much, but I do, they say it's the little sister to Bad Romance, I can see the similarities but its a rocking track on its own, the hard beat in theverse, with her tough rough raw vocal, then a sweet gentle vocal in the chorus, Juda Juda aaaa, this is one my favourite tracks it should have been a number 1, although it did in Korea and a few other places worldwide. Love the video, choreography, an EPIC track.<br /><br />Americano: (4/5) I like this track it's different, a theatrical vocal, another aggressive sound, with a hint of a latino salsa vibe, this track is attitude at its best.<br /><br />Hair: (3/5) Hair is a great track too, but not one of my favourites, great lyric, and great vocal, no complaints here.<br /><br />Scheisse: (5/5) Looooove this track, with a German intro, always thought German is such a strong scary language, but it works, with an incredible spoken bridge and sassy chorus, cannot wait to see this one live on Friday. The beats on this track typical dance/pop funk, amazing, love it.<br /><br />Bloody Mary: (5/5) Love this track, got that old school 80s pop vibe, intertwined with a theatrical opera feel, great lyric and vocal again, love the beat and synthesizers, with the additional background vocals, GAGA GAGA at the bridge, that petshop boy sound another favourite.<br /><br />Amen Fashion: (3/5) An ok track not my favourite, maybe because I am abit sensitive to the phrase \\"Black Jesus\\", tend to sometimes skip this one, but its not bad at all.<br /><br />Bad Kid: (4/5): This track started off as a least favourite but that chorus and bridge got me, and now I love it, a great message of liberation to those kids out there who feel somewhat not loved and misunderstood.<br /><br />Highway Unicorn: (4/5): Her epic opening for her Born this way Ball tour, a great track too, powerful vocal, love how the song is structured production wise very dramatic and intense.<br /><br />Heavy Metal Love: (5/5): Love, love, love this track, mainly for the production, synthesizers, hard core beat, with a hard core I am gonna eat u up vocal, play this track on max volume and shatter your eardrums, its dark, delicious and another favourite of mine.<br /><br />Electric Chapel: (2/5): Least favourite of the bunch, but do not get me wrong it's a good track, with a catchy guitar rift a more subtle vocal by gaga, got an 80s pop vibe to it, which I love since I am a kid of the 80s.<br /><br />You and I: (3/5): I like this track, a nice melody, a country kind of feel, with a hard beat under it, a great vocal by Gaga, with the typical country backing vocal, like a Shania Twain track, who I am also a fan of, the video is quite a spectacle, a good song.<br /><br />The Queen: (5/5): Now this is my track, the favourite of the lot, love it, love it, love it, a fusion of pop/rock with a gutsy vocal and catchy chorus, it builds on and on, then gradually demodulates to a slower groove towards the end, reminds me of a Freddy Mercury Queen music, love her vocal, a pity she has not done a video or performed it on her Born this Way ball tour, it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />Fashion of his Love: (3/5) for the track on main born this way CD, on the DELUXE EDITION the remixed version by Fernando Garibay gets a (5/5), I love this version, it should have been the one on the main CD, I love this track so much, her vocal is amazing and a memorable chorus and bridge,<br /><br />The Edge of Glory: (5/5): Another masterpiece to bring the CD to a close, love her vocals on this track, another Rock/POP masterpiece, EPIC.<br /><br />I will always have issues with Gaga on some of her ideologies and her choices in how she chooses to express herself creatively, but musically and visually, she is one of the best out there, I take my hat off for her hard work, bravery, talent and tenacity, this is one of the best pop records of the 20th Century, even though I do not consider myself a monster I understand the hype, well done girl.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just received my new DSLR backpack this afternoon and it's awesome!  Appears to be pretty toughly made.  I haven't received my camera yet, so I will have to wait to see how everything fits inside, but right now it looks like it has tons of room!  Pleased so far!!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is by far a wonderful author, This book has a great love story and overall great story to it.,
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The major issue I have with this is that I fear it's not going to last.  The mechanism by which the tablet cradle turns isn't too sophisticated, and it's difficult to turn.  I'm not entirely sure it won't come apart before it loosens up.<br /><br />However, that aside, this is pretty much everything I could want for the Fire.  It supports the tablet both horizontally and vertically at three different angles, so it pretty much has you covered for hands-free use.  It also has a hand strap for ease and security of holding if you're not using the easel.  The cover is nicely padded and there is an elastic band that will help keep the covers closed either during use or while not in use.  It's pretty well designed in those respects.<br /><br />I can't swear that the cradle will hold the tablet securely, but that's a worry with a lot of different covers.  It's something you take on faith, I guess.  In all, it's pretty darn close to the cover I wanted, and that's a good thing.

B00783NWB6|5.0|im a fan of all the underworld movies i like the story,and kate but this movie has non stop action i got this movie in 3d and its worth it a big plus if ur a underworld fan.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|As a fan from too many years ago to even consider, I'm not sure what I was expecting in this new release.  I guess I was expecting some hard rock with some good power riffs, and Steven screaming as usual.  This I got, but what I was also expecting was something maybe a bit different.  This I didn't get.  Although not a bad CD, it's basically the same old formula.  After so many years one would expect something a bit fresher.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Came with a fmFREE digital copy so were able to watch over the Internet.<br /><br />Tin Tin is an animated adventure looking to reclaim a long lost treasure. I'll leave it to you to decide if you think Tin Tin can find it.
B00979CS50|4.0|You know, with Neil Young, you just never know what you're gonna get next.  When I put the first disc in and began listening, after about 15 minutes I'm thinking, 'This is getting to be a bit long...'  However, I was enjoying what I was listening too and that seemed to satisfy the length.  All in all, this double disc set is but another milestone for Young, who never disappoints.  His music is habitual, and his voice is so unique that you never grow tired of it!  A very good CD.
1451695195|1.0|I was looking forward to the scientist proving the spiritual, but alas, that celebration has yet to come.<br />This is basically a memoir of a massively over-sized ego. (I know surgeons have to have a grandiose ego in order to cut people open, but, wow.) Maybe an accurate title would have been \\"Proof of Ego\\".<br />Glad I borrowed my copy from the library; it's not worth contributing to this guy's piggy bank.<br />Now happily reading \\"After the Light\\" by Kimberly Clark Sharp. She can write AND she has something to say that's on-topic. Updating this review to add another terrific book to the list: \\"Lessons from the Light\\" by Ring. Love this book.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Although it's been stated that Rod Stewart is no Tony Bennett, (and this is obviously true), this doesn't imply that Rod should be denied the respect that he's certainly gained from singing the standards.  Rod's voice is very distinctive, and I feel it lends a certain amount of uniqueness to these 'sung-all-too-much' Christmas songs.  His voice is rich and raspy, and that's what makes these songs sound new.  The music is lush and beautiful!  A good addition to anyone's holiday collection!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I highly recommend the viewing of this movie.  A good movie for the whole family. Great actors/actresses.  I loved it!!
B009DJB9HC|4.0|There's nothing truly unique about this band, other than the fact that they're just plain old in your face rock and roll.  It's as though we have a group of super musicians who simply want to come at you from every angle, wrapping great riffs with strong melodies.  They don't care to be fancy, nor do they care about intricate jams; they are rock and roll at it's epitomy.  This is good!
B000T433CO|4.0|Very fun movie for the holidays!  Jude Law is gorgeous, and Jack Black is adorable!  This is a movie I enjoy watching any time of the year.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album has been on repeat for days. This girl has serious talent and and amazing vocal abilities.  Her words ring true and her voice puts me in a hypnotic trance.  Very well produced album.
B00684J49U|5.0|I love ANYTHING Grey's, but I honestly think that the writing during this season improved 100% fold. I love it!
B008B3GP2A|4.0|Maroon 5 seems to have decided they needed a new album so they hurriedly threw some song together and called it a day. Dont get me wrong- i have loved their music since they were Kara's Flowers-but they're heart just isnt in this one. They do have some decent tracks on here, namely the 2 singles &#34;one more night&#34; and &#34;payphone &#34; along with one i hope they release as a single &#34;lucky strike&#34;
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My wife and I have been together for 7 years and know each other very well. We both have claimed to have put in much effort to make the other feel loved yet ironically, both of us have felt under-loved and underappreciated by the other. After reading this book, we have found that we are speaking our own love language to each other but it is not the love language of the other! Our love tanks are not full. After discovering what the others primary and secondary love language is using the assessment test, we have practiced giving heavy daily doses of the primary and sprinkkling in the secondary and little doses of the others. What a difference! It has been a big challenge for us as both our primary language is the other's very least needed! Wow. Talk about having to be intentional. But I can tell you it has been well worth it. The more I hold up to the challenge, the more he feels loved and wants to give me what I need. And vice versa. No wonder this is such a successful book. Apart from making God the center of of your marriage, this is one of the greatest foundations in a marriage - keeping your love tank full by speaking your mate's love language daily!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Very entertaining. App runs smooth. No glitches so far! Excellent trainer for the full game. My 8 year old is quite adept with the controls.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|more than it is a \\"proof\\" of heaven, except from the author's perspective. What I love about this book is the fact that we have a man of science (neuroscience no less,) who has spent the better part of his life operating (literally) from a very typical reductionist mindset, coupled with a western approach to medicine in conjunction with some clearly atheistic tendencies - throwing a triple extra-large monkey wrench into current mind/consciousness scientific dogma. Dr. Alexander is a rebel with a clue, a certified turncoat in the most egregious sense of the word; he is uniquely qualified to have made the journey that he describes in the book and debunk any psychosexual/physio-temporal/material-reductionist explanation mainstream science chooses to whitewash his experience with.<br /><br />Admittedly, there was a bit more hyperbole regarding the minutiae of his physical life as opposed to the wisdom and information he gleaned on his expedition, but my guess is that will be fodder for another book. That said, Dr. A. propounds that he has it on very good authority that we are in fact: loved & cherished deeply, never alone and that there is nothing that we can do wrong (paraphrased;) hmmmmmm, sounds absolutely, well, DIVINE! A five star piece that took an awful lot of courage to write. Well done with much thanks!<br />Help other customers find the
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Great! I love this CD. Kid Rock is awsome, he has out done himself on this CD. Keep up the good work
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I'm surprised there aren't a lot more reviews on this book. It might just be the best book I've ever read (and it's really short and easy to read).<br /><br />Viktor Frankl is an amazing man- a psychiatrist who lived in the concentration camps during WWII, and not only made it through and came out alive, but went on to touch many people's lives.<br /><br />The first half of the book, Viktor takes you through his experiences as a prisoner of the concentration camps. It's a unique perspective because he's really getting into what happens mentally to the prisoners and guards. Why do some continue to have the will to live despite everything? Why do others give up and let themselves die? Why do some prisoners show incredible cruelness toward their fellow prisoners, while some of the guards show compassion and kindness? Everything seems to hint to the fact that we are not just a product of our experiences. Even in a concentration camp where it seems like every freedom is stripped of the prisoner, the prisoner is still free on some level to make choices about his own will to live and his own character. So what is it that causes different men in the same situation to make different choices?<br /><br />The second part of the book delves into the answers he came to for all of those questions, as Viktor explains his psychotherapy (or \\"logotherapy\\"). I'm not going to get into all of it now, because I'd rather just recommend you read it yourself. I am sure you will not be dissapointed!
B0086700CM|3.0|I just didn't like this one. Had my heartrate up too high trying to concentrate on what move to make next. Kidding, kinda.
B009IA3O2O|3.0|After the first listen, I was left wondering two things:<br /><br />1. Am I listening to the same album that the other reviewers heard?<br />2. Is this Kamelot?<br /><br />Overall, this album was too much promise and too little delivery. And that's to be expected, I suppose, especially when the band releases the best song on the album as a lead single (that can be argued, I'm sure, but I speak for myself).<br /><br />The album in general just wasn't going anywhere. There's some kind of story being told that just doesn't jump out of the songs to make them more unified in terms of lyrics, the way Epica and The Black Halo managed to string the story together. Musically, most of the songs just blended into one big mess in the back of my head. And it's not that the songs weren't good, really. I think they all have their one moment which saves them from being beyond redemption (some riff or instrumental segment). And did anyone feel that Song for Jolee and Prodigal Son were leading up so SOMETHING magnificent and then just fell short, ending nowhere? I did.<br /><br />Also, there was usually too much background noise taking attention from Karevik's voice, which is probably the single best trait of the album (and the guitar solos). Some of the lyrics are melodramatic and the refrains weren't very catchy, which makes me wonder whether they were trying too hard or not trying hard enough. This is where Roy's absence is felt the most. Of course, I will always miss his voice too.<br /><br />I don't know what happened here; Sacrimony was misleading in that it made me expect a lot more. And the reviews, too, described this absolutely mind blowing release. But my first impressions? This feels like a different band.  Maybe I have to let it grow on me in the coming weeks. Or just go back to listening to their older music.<br /><br />Also, My Confession and Solitaire are great songs.<br /><br />On a less important note, Simone should have returned for a duet. Just saying.
0061474355|5.0|I have this entire trilogy and its my \\"go to\\" set I books when I want something to read. Even before I buy something new. The way Mr. Nix has written the characters, you get emotionally attached to each one. When Sabriel is hurting, you hurt with her and when she triumphs, you'll find yourself smiling along as well.<br /><br />An extremely engaging, \\"can't put it down\\" read, I recommend this book to anyone of any age.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My boyfriend introduced me to Firefly just this year. I bought this Blu-Ray version and cannot be happier. The quality of the picture matches the genius and wit of the show.<br />It is a travesty that this show was cancelled. After finishing the final episode I craved more. To this day I itch to see more back stories, character interactions and what Serenity's crew would've done in upcoming episodes.<br />At this point Firefly will never return, but the immense amount of fans prove that Fox cancelled this show PRE-MATURELY.  All the characters are memorable, and contribute to the humor and synergy of the show.<br />Even though there are no more seasons to look forward to I hope some of you read this review and buy this copy just to experience the revelation that is Firefly. I promise you will not be unsatisfied.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.  I couldn't put it down, once I started.  The author was very knowledgeable..  His personal story was easy to follow and well written.  90 Minutes in Heaven is another good read.
B0094M2OPY|5.0|This movie is a favorite of my whole family.  Definitely a movie that you can enjoy with your children, whatever their ages.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I love Natalie Portman so I figured I'd give this a chance. What I found was another stinker as bad as the Star Wars prequels! It starts out with about 4 seconds of flirting then all of a sudden they want to \\"has sex\\" together. There is a 4,000 minute scene where Ahston Kutcher is mostly nude and trying to figure out which room mate he \\"has sex\\" with after getting drunk. One hilariously is a man! Can you believe that? Gay sex? So funny! (Sarcasm!!!!!!!)<br />Kevin Klein is some sort of \\"Always Sunny\\" Frank Reynolds wannabe, who is a older, unfunny d bag that indulges in depravity. How funny! Old people being disgusting! Never been done! Whoever wrote this really knows funny!<br />Look this move will give you no laughs because there are no jokes. It really seems it was written by someone in their teens who has no idea what the real world is like.<br />If you want to not laugh, not get turned on and enjoy stories of white over privileged butt stains searching for a way to bone each other, then this is the movie for you.<br />If you want to accomplish something with your life...stare at paint drying...it's also more entertaining!<br /><br />F+
B0091VTNZC|5.0|This is a great movie for Christmastime.  If you are wondering if it is good for the whole family, it is!<br />One of my favorite aspects is that they touch on the question of whether or not Santa is real and they make light of the fact that some people believe the parents leave the presents.  It is mentioned perfectly and my kids found the notion funny too.  A good movie to keep the belief in Santa alive.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I loved this movie!  Thank you Disney for finally making a movie about smart strong women who don't need a knight in shinning armor.  Even my husband stayed awake and watched the whole movie!  And that says something.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it is still scary for younger girls.  My 5 year old was truly terrified.  The bears are frightening and confusing.<br /><br />So if your daughter is over 7-ish and not easily scared please watch this movie!
B008PZ69Q6|5.0|i just wish there was a video of this show elvis at madison square garden but it was never filmed  just recored the music 1972 it took place thats a  shame.
1451695195|5.0|I really liked the start of this book, he really pulls you along.  But he lost me after the middle.  He wrote a great deal about having been adopted and how sad that had made major portions of his life.  Irrelevant.  Then he got really mystic.  If you are looking for a book about an encounter with heaven and the God of Christianity, this book is NOT for you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Keeps track of the last number, and where you were at in your calculations. Great when shopping sales that have a &#34;percentage off&#34; advertised.

B0090O07RS|5.0|I remember the melodic sounds of the doors and just had to hear more when their stuff would be played on the radio.  I was too young to be at a doors concert and this intimate look at them in concert is worth every penny.  Sure, Jim is taking a ride but once you get used to this and really listen to the music you get it.<br />I watched it three times and felt something profound each time.<br />They include footage of the band playing a more raw small-town concert that feels like it could be in any high school anywhere and you can see them play clean and sober and fall for them.<br />To me, Jim looks like a medicated rabbit that knows he may not be pleasing everyone but he showed up to let us see a glimpse of Jim--a glimpse at his soul.  -t.f.
B008D28HYS|3.0|It is a wonderful brain teaser that exercises counting and reasoning skills in a manner roughly similar to mine sweeper. I just wish the permissions were less invasive.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|We rented this movie and really enjoyed it. My kids liked it, and even I as the parent enjoyed it more than I expected to.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Interesting characters and fast paced storyline. The plot had me guessing every angle and still surprised. If you like Gillian's other novels you will enjoy this one. Although, not AS good- still good!
B008DYZKQE|4.0|I love the strong heroine and the funny story. It's not your typical &#34;happily ever after&#34; and that is refreshing.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|When one reviewer writes a bad review it may be attributed to a difference in taste, when pretty much everyone says the same general thing there is probably something to it. I was a big fan of the first three and ignored the bad reviews for Feast and now I regret it since it was a waste of time and money. I've never would have expected it after the first three but the fourth is a much inferior installment in terms of narrative, style, and especially pacing. I would encourage anyone thinking about buying this to first read some reviews for Feast AND the 5th book Dragons and consider those reviews together before deciding to continue investing in this unfinished series.
1439152756|5.0|I wasn't expecting to get sucked into a story about a woman with Alzheimer's, but before I knew it I stayed up all night to finish this book. It was sad, but still a tender story. It helped me have greater empathy for those I know who suffer from memory problems or who are their caregivers
B0098VYKSA|2.0|This really didn't hold my interest.  Charlize Theron is good but the rest is just so-so.  It just wasn't all that interesting.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Just four years ago, no one knew who Mumford & Sons was. Then they suddenly emerged out of nowhere in 2009 with Sigh No More. As the album rocketed to the top of the charts and sales lists, Mumford & Sons snowballed in popularity. Now they are back just three years later with another masterpiece.<br />While Sigh No More was an indisputably great album, Babel actually manages to top it. Sigh No More, when compared to Babel, seems to be a bit incohesive. Each individual track on the debut is very good, but together, lacks something when compared to the tight integration of the songs on Babel. I would even say that while Babel is the better record, its separate songs do not compare to Sigh No More's individually, but together are much more powerful. The sound on Babel is driving and upbeat; the sound on Sigh No More -- not so much (yet still satisfies, of course).<br />But this focuses solely on the aural aspect of Babel. As far as lyrics go, this album is right up there with Sigh No More. Expect nothing less than what Marcus Mumford penned  on the debut. Once again, Mumford struggles with his spiritual yearnings and his fleshly longings. Where else in modern music can you find a lyric like this one, written in \\"Broken Crown\\"? \\"But oh, my heart flawed/ I knew my weakness./ So hold my hand,/ consign me not to darkness.\\"<br />Babel is a standout in the far-too-lacking world of modern music, both lyrically and instrumentally. There were no mainstream folk acts recently before Mumford jumped into the scene. And it looks as if they are here to stay. Hopefully we will soon see more from Mumford & Sons, but until then, enjoy the fantastic Sigh No More and the even greater Babel.<br /><br />Recommended tracks: Whispers in the Dark, Lover of the Light, Hopeless Wanderer, Broken Crown, Not With Haste
B000089RVX|5.0|My Immortal and Hello are my favorite songs, and I love the videos....Everybody's fool is also wonderul.  The album is filled with great songs and there is a reason the sales were so high.....Evanescence talent exceeds the others in the market by far.  Amy Lee has a wonderful voice and I cannot wait for the folk album she often talks about doing.
0307712508|5.0|Extremely educational. I listened to the audiobook and kept rewinding to hear information again and again. The science was in depth, some good, some over my comprehension level, and the history was fascinating, I realized how ignorant I am to the topic. The family story and information about Henrietta was the best part, and so hard to believe. This is a story that needed to be told. Dare I say I will be a better person because of reading this?
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I look at it as an aquiired taste....I listen a few times and then loved it....now I can not get enough of the album...I listen to this one alternating between my other Evanenscence albums.....Highly recommend.  Track 11 &#34;Your Star&#34; is my favorite, with a beautiful melody when she sings &#34;I'm alone now me and all I stood for&#34;....I think it is one of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard.
0345525558|4.0|I loved the story and most of the characters in Language of Flowers.  The plot was plausible, not cheesy or unbelievably happy.  There were a few too many turns, but overall compelling and fulfilling.
0857685848|5.0|The book is awesome, excelent printing, the material is great not to mention the prime content. I would recommend it for everyone who likes paleoart and art in general, so they can have a closer look at the fascinating job of bringing dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures to life, whit scientific accuracy both in the portrayed organism and its environment.
0316228532|4.0|Great characters, not lovable, but developed extremely well. JK Rowling is an amazing writer, Harry Potter or otherwise. Some reviews are criticizing the lack of plot, but for me there doesn't always have to be a profound, dramatic, or twist ending plot.  The characters, relationships, and plausibility are what make Casual Vacancy a good read.  My only criticism is the length, it could have been shorter without losing it's power.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Ok sci fi movie. The story could have been deeper. Many unanswered threads, but I was able to watch to the end .
B004JYTWY8|5.0|i LOVE Ricky Martin!!!!! He can do no wrong and this album is just amazing. I am glad he had the courage to come out. I will love him no matter what
B009XY97VC|5.0|Another amazing CD! Motivating, exciting, and well worth a few listens...or a hundred. Love this group and their beautiful music!
B003O86FMW|5.0|sometimes when there is a trilogy the first book is the best and the ones that follow don't always live up to it but not with this series. Even better then the first. Also finished it in a day
B0011Z330C|1.0|I don't get it. I seriously don't understand why I ever worshipped these guys back when I was in eighth grade, and almost all the way through high school. The more I thought about it as I got older, and listened to more sophisticated music that was recommended to me by others, as well as that which I discovered on my own, the more I realized that Green Day were never really worth all the hype surrounding them. Even with this album, which I bought along with Insomniac, they prove to not be anywhere even close to a punk band, despite the media portraying them as such. As I see it, they are merely a pop band with excessive distortion and amplification.<br /><br />After becoming more open-minded and gaining the ability to explore more music outside the mainstream, and discovering and listening to bands like Kamelot, Symphony X, Rhapsody of Fire, Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Children of Bodom, Voyager, Dimmu Borgir, Meshuggah, and many MANY more out there, I came to my senses and realized just how much of a comlplete joke Green Day really are. Today, I see them as just another simplistic, watered-down band for kids, and their musical skills are barely even average at best. When I think of it, they are not that much better than a group like the Jonas Brothers. I am at the point where I find their style to be WAY too simplistic for my tastes, be it vocally, lyrically or musically.<br /><br />On the flip side, I also have to admit that I would be a fool to say that Green Day did not mean anything to me when I was a young teenager. When I was actually a fan of theirs during that time in my life, I might not have been able to digest the top-notch complexity of those other bands I mentioned, all of whom I am a die-hard fan today. Don't get me wrong, not everything I listen to today is a technical hurdle. I have always LOVED other bands from the same era as Green Day, such as Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, Rage Against The Machine, and Smashing Pumpkins. That is mainly because I feel that, unlike Green Day, those bands actually pack a serious punch with their music through sheer edge, emotion and meaning, technical hurdle or not. I know that this is subjective, but I am just being honest about my opinion<br /><br />In short, even though I no longer care for Green Day in the least bit, I can still admit that they have their place, even though I am obviously no longer a part of it. I can say that they are a good enough band in their own way, and that if you like them for what they are, then I have no personal objections. If they put a smile on your face, then how can I not be happy for you? It is just that, considering the development of my more sophisticated musical appreciation, I cannot help but feel cheated by Green Day when I look back on this album, and upon my former self. Look, we all have our likes and dislikes, and I am just being honest about my opinion as a former fan who has been there and done that, so please do not bash me. If you like them, you like them, and if you don't, then you don't. Simple as that.<br /><br />PEACE! ;)umpkins.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|i heard about this book from some members at the gym where i work. I thought it wouldn't be good because its a teen book....Boy was i wrong. This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down
B0001I561E|5.0|In our family we love watching movies.... so this was just another awesome movie to add into our collection fo movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book in the series is great. The story flowed so well and i couldn't put this down either. I finished all three books in three days!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am only 1/2 way through this book and already I can see how important this information is. It will make a difference in the divorce rate if couples read this book when the lust dies down.
B004AQR29C|3.0|Good action and lots of bravado in a movie that qualifies as good entertainment for a home watching experience. Overall; ok
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is one of the best series ever!  I greatly enjoyed it and cannot wait to see the next installment!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son and I just enjoy watching this show. It is horrifying and thought provoking at the same time. A Greek tragedy set in the modern world.
B005LAJ212|4.0|I love this series and its actors...a guilty pleasure!  The settings are very beautiful and I feel as if I am visiting the Hamptons!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I myself am a big fan of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, but I thought that this book ends of with him being I'll! That is saying to young readers that its AWESOME to be sick. Anyway I loved the book because Jeff Kinney just knows what we can relate to in funny story telling ways and that's what I love about these books.
B002CIY8EM|4.0|Chariots of the Gods is the original book that started the whole controversy about whether or not Earth was visited by aliens in her past.  Anyone interested in the topic of ancient aliens should read this book, preferably early into your investigations.  Mr. Von Daniken discusses the most prominent examples of possible alien input in our early past and lays the groundwork for other more detailed books to follow. Chariots of the Gods is the nutshell version that gives an excellent overview on the topic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book...I loved it!!! Read it for yourself don't look at the reviews. You never know un till u try :)
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I have read almost all of the Grisham books.I ordered this one early and saved it for treat. I was terribly disappoint. Poor story line, disappointing writing. I thought that this book was so bad that someone else had written it. It was not only a waste of time and money, it tarnished my opinion of his storytelling excellence.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Saw this with my wife. I always love a good story, especially when it's something based on reality. This is a story of faith put into action, where a well-to-do family goes out of their way to help a young man in much less-fortunate circumstances. Watching the relationship unfold is heartwarming, funny, and sad at different times. It's easy to identify with the characters and their emotions. The acting is very good.<br /><br />I rarely purchase movies to own. I'm much more of a renter than a purchaser and it's not often that I'll watch movies a second time. But I can see us watching this several times, and as my kids get a little older, I think they'll really enjoy this, too. My 10-year old son loves football and anything sports-related, and for the most part, this movie will be appropriate for him to watch very soon.<br /><br />It's hard to over-recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, get it. Or at least rent it. Definitely worth your 2 hours.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My daughter had it on NDS. My wife's android phone had it factory installed. But I couldn't get it on the Play store. So far very pleased with buying it. Works great on my Transformer tablet.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a nail biter !!!  But a good fast read, I have read all of Mr Grisham's and am waiting for the next one.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|My favorite of The Outlander series so far. Each book is a new adventure and I never know what's coming.  The characters grow with each book as well ... Not the kind of characters you get tired of.  Loved it!!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This CD relaxes me after a crazy day on the planet.It reminds me of my trip to Kauai this year.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|If you are a fan of YouTube and you follow YouTubers that post amazing videos that you would like to be able to watch anytime...like say you are traveling and you got no signal well if you have used this app to download a video you want to watch no problem you can watch it. This app works great on an android phone you can even sign in and download videos that may require birth date confirmation...so I highly recommend this app for YouTube video/music fans!
B007NCSQFO|4.0|Theres a few different songs but theres enough good ones to but it, especially for the price. Great cd from Nicki Minaj
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I always use this stuff to help keep my cpu's (processors) cool in my system builds. Being an IT guy I have to make sure I got at least 1-2 tubes of this stuff lying around to make sure all or my computers run cool and smooth. Kinda like this stuff.
0741470314|5.0|From the moment i read the first page i knew at last it was the truth at last thank you. I have been reading some of the reviews about Michael and for the best part i am in agreement with those that found this book informative and fail to understand how some were not lifted by Karen's words. Michael was the one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. Through his music, his complete dedication to those less fortunate he lived his life. Those that chose to find only negative things to say about him never knew him. I grew up with Michael in my life. His music , his charm and yes his difference . But who are we to judge what another is doing or how they live their lives. Michael was the start a tormented human being. He was different from the rest of his family right from the start. he was born to do what he did and he did this with total disregard for himself. From a young child he was witness to the vulgarities of the human nature. He suffered at the hands of his father ( something we all know so i am not in any way deriding the man who was his father) and the ambition his father wanted for himself through Michael. The Jacksons were a very talented family but the shining light was Michael. He made them the greatest family this world has known.<br /><br />Through his songs we saw the person underneath the outer covering. Unless you as a person have gone through what Michael did how dare you judge. When he sang \\" Ben \\" you could see the pain inside of him through his eyes. There are a lot of people who suffer from the awful body dysmorphia. To look into a mirror and see only ugliness must an awful thing and Michael lived this for all of his life. His desire to fit overtook his rationality and he continued to change before our eyes.<br /><br />BUT that did not change who he was inside and Karen was able to show us that.Forget the parts that don't quite add up its the effect it all had on Michael that she showed us through the eyes and words of those closest to him. Unfortunately it was those that should have been closest to him that let him down.The comments from certain members of his family during the molestation trials disgusted me. But this was just the end of the spiral that Michael was finding himself in. His addiction to prescription drugs after the Pepsi incident started that spiral but by then the pattern was set. Most people or i should those people that contributed to this are the ones that should be feeling the guilt of his passing. I am not saying that Michael was blameless in this he had ample opportunities to do something but peer pressure was always there. when you have a dependence like this its very hard to break but is possible if the right people are there to help. Karen bought into my life the true extent of Michael's suffering. I know he was the greatest entertainer this world will ever have but it was the Michael we didn't see that she gave to us. The parts we were not able to see she gave us. Michael was shown to us through her actions and those near him. Thank you Karen. This is a must for every MJ fan and for those who are yet to be.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|This app worked great for a while, you know you can sync up all your social blah blah blah cause it can learn how you type that's all well and good but eventually it will get to a point where it says &#34;it needs to re-download the English dictionary&#34; or something like that...and no matter what you do (try switching to WiFi) it will not download, and the notification of basically a corrupted dictionary will not go away until you completely uninstall this app and re-install it which can really be a pain in the bum.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Its alright I suppose but its kinds hard and even though I got a golden egg it wont show up :( So yeah well at least its free -_-<br /><br />Rottweiler Tokatsu
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Well here it is, we as fans have asked for it and we got it...This album returns Metallica back to the sound that we recognize from albums like &#34;And justice for all&#34; and &#34;Master of Puppets&#34;. I will say that my favorite album from Metallica is &#34;The Black Album&#34; but you know bands age and with time their sounds must also change or rather mature...and with this album you definitely notice a sense or maturity, but in a good way...unlike Linkin Park that changed their sound so much that they don't even sound like the same band anymore. I am and probably always will be a fan of Metallica, cause one thing you can count on with them is their unique sound they bring to the rock/metal genre that will never change.
B007MU85D0|4.0|Of Monsters and Men have a really unique sound, and  I would definitely recommend this album.  its unlike anything else on the radio.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie story line, presentation and ending is nice. The 3D is amazing. I am not rating this movie. My rating is for the experience of purchasing this movie at Amazon due to following two reasons.<br /><br />Amazon gifted me 'video on demand' (24hr free view of this movie on line) for a purchase of 3DBD disk. My shipping was delayed and therefore I turned on the Amazon's video streaming to use 'video on demand' gift. My preparation to watch 3D movie went into vein as this streaming was on 2D. Disappointed.<br /><br />I used discover card's free one-day shipping - worth of $12.00 but I did not receive the disk the next day. It actually took 3 days. The order was placed on friday evening, expecting to receive it on Saturday. I would still be happy if it was delivered on Sunday. But I received it after 8PM on Monday. I can't be happy with such a late-hour delivery. We won't be able to watch the movie until Tuesday. What a waste of Discover's one-day shipping cost. Amazon has to review its shipping via fedex.
B008XG1X18|5.0|gotta love pintrest. you can find inspiration for everything from fashion to home decor this is a great app to get inspired i
B00354YA4A|5.0|I absolutely loathed the movie but had heard that the book was very good, so gave it a chance.  Well worth it - beautifully written, with a great storyline and character development.  Adds weight to my opinion that it's nearly impossible to make a great movie from a great book.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|This album has a lot of promise and it makes me excited to see the man live but that being said the album is inconsistent.  Several times through out the album, Clarke Jr ventures into the realm of R&B and its just awful.  Also, track 11 is fantastic up till the solo where your ears are greeted with the worst solo I've ever heard (its Guy Clark Jr scratching on his strings to sound like a DJ).<br /><br />Other than that, I really enjoyed the album but I can't rate it higher than three.  Go see this guy live.  I bet its incredible.
B004D38HOG|5.0|I've never particularly been a fan of either Portia de Rossi or Ellen Degeneres (but then, neither have I not liked them), so I'm not sure what made me read this - the hype, perhaps?  In any case, it was quite the surprise package.  De Rossi comes across as a normal, down-to-earth person with a not-so-normal lifestyle.  I was half-expecting a bit of a 'poor-little-me' tone to the book, but there was none of that.  It was matter-of-fact, brutal in its honesty, and completely de-glamorises the myth of the effortlessly slim Hollywood starlet.  It made me think about my own attitude to food and to acceptance of my appearance by myself and others - the frightening thing was that although I am a healthy weight, and consider myself to have a healthy relationship with my body, I could readily relate to the thought processes described by De Rossi.  All up, a very good read.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY DVD YET BUT I  HAVE SEEN IT ON THE BIG SCREEN. I CAN SAY THAT IT WAS EXCELLENT AND THAT I AM A HUGH KSTEW FAN.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Simply put: I love M&S and I love this album. It's impressive how they managed to grow their sound from &#34;Sigh No More&#34; on this album. Great stuff.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|LOVED THIS SEASON. IF I NOT MISTAKEN, YELLOW FEVER WAS ONE OF THE EPISODES AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES TO DATE.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Wow, this was a wonderful book! I had to re-read the end because it didn't make sense to me the first time I read it, but I'll chalk that up to it being late at night and me being tired though! :) I think Mr. Zusak is an amazing author.
B002BWP49C|5.0|THERE ISNIT MUCH TO SAY OTHER THAN I AM A TRUE TWIHARD FAN. THE MOVIES HAVE NOT DISAPPOINTED ME. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was an enjoyable and fun read. It was nice to read about technology that is current and I thought the story line was interesting. There was even a little bit about knitting thrown in there! I thought the ending was too perfect but still I enjoyed the book quite a bit.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|SUPER, SUPERNATURAL FAN. ENOUGH SAID. GET MY DRIFT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. THEY ALWAYS AMAZE ME WITH THE STUFF THEY DO EACH WEEK.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am not a fan of horror like I used to be so I don't normally read books by Stephen King any more, but I really enjoy stories with time travel in them so I looked forward to reading this and it didn't disappoint.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|SUPER FAN HERE. LOVED THIS SERIES JUST LIKE ALL THE REST. JUST WANTED TO MENTION SOME EPISODES THAT STAND MORE THAN OTHERS, THEY ARE: YELLOW FEVER, TIME AFTER TIME, FRONTIERLAND  AND THE RABBIT FOOT CASE.
1419705849|4.0|As always, the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books please. This one is no different. In fact, I cannot say anything bad about it. The hardcover option was nice, as my son's friends all have the soft cover, so it makes it more durable, and long-lasting. My ONLY complaint is with Amazon. I ordered this book back in July when it first listed, to be delivered in November. I expected Amazon to match the delivery to the release. NOT SO. We waited an extra four days to receive it (as compared to the store copies), so it was not as special as it could have been.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I AM A HUGH SUPERNATURAL FAN. I AM SO GLAD I BROUGHT THE SERIES. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE EIGHT SEASON COMES OUT.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|great game &amp; a must have for when you have nothing else to do! very fun &amp; challenging! easy entertainment
B002JVWRAO|5.0|HEY, BJ HERE, ONE OF YOUR SUPER FANS. I LOVE ALL THE SERIES, BUT THERE ARE A FEW THAT STAND OUT MORE THAN OTHERS.
1419705849|5.0|my son finished this book in three days and said &#34;it didn't suck&#34; so i give it 5 stars indeed
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have it on my Kindle. It's like having a very good weather station!  Would definitly recommend it to my friends that own Kindles except none of my friends have Kindles, they just don't know what they're missing. I particularly like getting the current temperature, ect for my small town, usually can't get closer than the city 15 miles away from their weather station @ the airport & their weather station @ the Air Museum. We have a local weather station here @ the school district offices.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I've been playing this game for some time, and have enjoyed it. But after perhaps two hours, the game crashed, and I had to restart the nexus. I tried to open my profile but it said the file was corrupted. So I lost everything. Not sure I can be bothered to start all over again.
B00009NQQO|5.0|I love this product! I think every child should have it. It makes bath time fun, which for some children is an absolute necessity. I bought it for my nephew because he loves basketball, even though he is only 2 years old. I would have ordered it sooner but I looked in stores so that I wouldn't have to pay shipping and handling, but I could not find it! Well worth the shipping and handling though lol I highly recommend the product and seller, good experience over all!
1451695195|4.0|I found this to be a most intereswting read. At times, the medical terminology made it a bit slow, but understanding the authors knowledge and his need to establish what he experienced makes it understandable.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. I was half-way through and wasn't sure I wanted to keep reading. It was difficult for me to stomach the sections written in Kevin's perspective, but maybe I'm just sensitive. I was glad that I stuck it out to find the twist in the end though.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This was my favorite show the first night I watched it! I love all the characters and you can't wait to see who will show up next! I recommend this because who doesn't remember all these fairy tale people?
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Love this show.  Completely hooked me in the &#34;soap opera&#34; saga.  I don't usually get caught up into series like that, but it just hooked me. Younger friends of mine, couldn't careless for this show. You have to be of the era to appreciate all of the nuances, and cultural references. There are so many.  Sometimes I laugh out loud from the reality of it all!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It was just fun! I guess because it was Star Wars and the birds looked like the characters from Star Wars! I would recommend it to anyone, especially anyone that loves Star Wars!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I was looking for something to read over the weekend and I literally could not put this down. Loved the local references to Silicon Valley (local to me, of course), and the coming together of tech and literature with a mystery twist. The artwork on the cover is pretty amazing, too.
B00A135YUW|5.0|Love this album..best album of the year...love this artist..just great songs..listen to it every day..Lana is amazing...This should be a grammy award winner here...
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Daemon was pretty believable based on the technology utilized, spread of fear and desire for change.  I was looking for more of the same with Kill Decision.<br />Kill Decision was good but some of the premises were just beyond believability.  It became much more fantasy than cyber thriller.  I highly recommend Daemon and Freedom, two of Suarez's other works.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|I never realized how much I missed the Wallflowers until I listened to this CD.  It's as if they never took a break.  I can't stop listening to it and it's been playing in the car for two weeks straight.  Jakob Dylan's voice is as fantastic as ever.  The melodies are familiar and comforting.  The lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful.<br /><br />Listening to this CD just makes one feel good.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a outrageously fun game but I hate when I run out of coins<br />8) do you see the eight as eyes?  8)
1250010403|5.0|Once again, Jeffrey Archer delivers another masterpiece.  Lord Archer is the King of the dynastic saga, and he definitely doesn't disappoint.  The characters in the Clifton Chronicles are, as is typical for Archer, richly drawn.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down, and although I knew it was Book 2 of what was probably planned as a trilogy, I found myself hoping for a resolution at the end.  Can't wait for the next book!
B00000G09Q|5.0|Great gift for our kids.  Our whole house sits and watch movies together and enjoys this one the most out of all of them in our house
B008XG1X18|5.0|its a really great app! I love how you can pin things from any website you want.and you can personalize your account to make it your own:)
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Enough twists and turns to keep you reading and reading....... Can't wait for the next one!  I expect to see Chet again.
B001LKQDCM|4.0|I love falling asleep to this amazing album.  The music mixed with the chanting carries me off to dream land.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|Nice app. I downloaded the paid version because the free one only had one workout and it hurt my neck. The workouts that come with the paid version are better. Good app overall.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|First time I ever had a negative reaction to a Scarpetta novel.  I thought the water scene, with endless detail about the turtle and the body, would never end. Once that was over, I enjoyed every moment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very tightly drawn mystery. General fiction readers will enjoy the suspense. The ending was something of a letdown. But, overall the book is an excellent read.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I loved the originality of it, but the execution of it wasn't quite to my liking.  I didn't care for the crazed, super-unhinged jaw vampire types in this movie, as well as some of the visuals were a little ridiculous.  There were some likable plot points, such as truth itself being a more powerful weapon than anything, but eh.
0525952926|4.0|Ken Follett is a master writer, weaving fictional characters into historical events to give a sense of history that no conventional history book can approach.  The only problem with this book is trying to remember exactly who each character is, and how they relate to each other.  But if you ignore this difficulty and simply accept each character as they are you will get no less enjoyment from the panorama of the story.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|There were one large downside to the bok. I lost a lot of sleeping time. I just could't not stop reading.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I personally enjoy this movie but I had a hard time keeping my kids interested in it. I have an 8 yr old a 6 yr old and a 2 yr old and normally when we rent movies they watch them over and over again but I was struggling to get them to even finish this movie.
0547884591|5.0|First, I have not finished this beast of a book, I had a pre-order and received it last week. (I have read Tim's other books)  From what I have finished thus far in this book it is exciting, enthusiastic, and a learning journey. Tim seems to be an obsessively curious and driven guy. I am impressed and a bit envious of his talents and acquired skills.  I enjoy and understand his feeling his satisfaction from the ability to tackle and master anything. So far the book resonates with me. I see myself as average, with no special advantage except with focus and curiosity and a desire to have a real impact, all of us can live incredible lives of meaning.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]]
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Real page turner - Flick and her team were well portrayed; and in true Follett fashion, he made their assignment extremely believable, as well as that of the Germans!
B00364K6YW|4.0|I love this version of Pride and Prejudice, hands down the out shines the more modern movie version. They only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the DVD quality is a better poor.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|It is an an amazing epic of World War 2<br /> Loved the way Ken Follett made it into the stories of families during that time<br />and how descriptive he is could not put it down.<br />it is truly one of Ken Follett's best novels.<br />Delysia
1451695195|4.0|I'm a long time reader on NDE's so I don't need convincing they are real. I think this book is particularly good for those fence sitters or straight out non-believers. He's clearly a highly intelligent, science based man and his book is written in the why he knows best; as a scientist. Because I'd read SO many NDE novels, I have to say Eben's isn't the most descriptive NDE story and I understand it must be very difficult to describe the indescribable. I didn't learn too much from this novel that I hadn't already heard from other novels. However, his NDE was VERY unique in a couple of key areas ( I won't ruin the story) but it didn't 'blow my mind'. However I think the message is fantastic and I think his story is a must read for anyone that has an interest, that doubts or is a season reader of this topic.
B008G59IKO|5.0|While not their best, Green Day never fails to entertain. They truly are a band that can achieve greatness no matter which decade they are in. If you have it people you have it.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book, recommend by a friend, is unlike anything I have read before.  It is informative, interesting and humorous at the same time and I enjoyed every minute of it.  Highly recommend.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|Chris has been through every possbile situation a young man could ever gone through, the only difference is his life is public knowledge. This goes to say that his lyrics and song selections for his recent projects have reflected the pain, disgust and turmoil that he's gone through. I am quite sure if he hadn't been publicly humiliated and put on display like a circus exhibit his music would've evolved in a more gentile manner but who are WE to judge what this man's heart soul should pour out in his music. The grittier sound resonates hard in Tracks 2-4 but the rest of the album shows that this young chris is no more and he has matured into a sex symbol for women 18 & up. The 4 years old track really opens my eyes to what he's been through coming from a modest upbringing and having dreams of making his life more than what is was. Overall the project is a great follow-up to the Classic FAME project, it makes you want to Wake Up Turn Up your music and Party in your Cadillac! LOL. There are some tracks with auto-tune and honestly he doesn't need because the young man has strong vocal ability but in today's music industry synthesized man made sounds are what sale hit! #TeamBreezy keep up the great work Chris, your true fans appreciate your hard work and your BIG EGO :-P
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I've had this on DVD for years both the single disc and the 2 disc signature selection, and they looked fantastic if you got the remastered version, it seems this edition was also messed up when it was first released, or so I have read, they had the same problems with the DVD's and they fixed it, and they certainly fixed this one, I was a bit afraid when I bought later reading that Paramount messed up on the first batch of this edition, but I've read there are certain ways to tell if you got the good one, one way is to check the color of the UPC code on the back, if it's yellow, most likely you have the good one, another way is to check the numbers on the underside of the disc, the number should be B1R2, if you have both of these things located, then most likely you have the right one, my thanks to all the former reviewers that pointed out how to tell, much appreciated.<br /><br />Now on to the quality of the transfer, man oh man where to start, well, right off really, the battle of Germania is just unbelieveable, you can see every little detail, it is really fantastic, those shots of the fire arrows flying through the air is just incredible, and the columns of horses charging, wow, just wow, and the interior shots with all the candles and such just jump right off the screen, and once you get into the gladiator scenes in the arena's, oh my lord, it feels like you're really there, everything from the sand to the armor and weapons just looks so good, and another thing I really like is that I see no grain what so ever, which can happen with blu rays with older movies, not all though, and this one shows none, pleasently surprised.<br /><br />Now the audio, and I must say, it's right on par with the quality of the video, you can hear every little thing, from the sword fighting, to the charging horses, and of course the dialog, the 5.1 DTS really shines here, so double win for video and audio.<br /><br />Now for the extras, and this does have extras that even the signature selection DVD does not have, such as 'Strength and Honor: Creating the World of Gladiator' which is a whopping 3 hour making of, I have not watched it yet, but I will be for sure, I like to see extras at this magnitude, theres also the Scrolls of Knowledge which is an interactive feature, which you can learn what life was really like back then in addition to the movie, you can also watch all those seperatly, which is nice, and you also get the extras that were part of the Signature Selection DVD, which is HBO First Look, Creating the Music of Gladiator, and Gladiator: Roman Bloodsport, and A Night With Russell Crowe, plus some images, deleted scenes and such, the extras are fantastic!<br /><br />And another thing I really like about this set, is that it comes with both the theatrical cut and the extended cut which is about 20 minutes longer, 20 more minutes of Gladiator? I'm game! and both versions are on one disc, I love both versions, so thats another bonus for this set.<br /><br />Paramount has done a great job with these Sapphire Series, I will be reviewing the Braveheart one and the Saving Private Ryan ones when I watch them, I've sampled them, and they look fantastic, but this one here is truly outstanding.<br /><br />Now if you buy the triple feature sapphire series set, you get all 3 movies said above, but you won't get the extras, and I'm a completist, so I bought all 3 seperatly, but still, these 3 movies on blu ray for about $25.00 for the set is still a great deal don't get me wrong, just no extras.<br /><br />I don't need to say much about the movie, fans of this film know truly how great of a film this is, so my focus was on the product itself, so if you are a fan of this movie, this edition is a MUST HAVE!, I'll still keep my DVDs of it of course, but this one will see the playing time!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was elegant and simple. Not too much overbearing character development. It has the possibility to be expanded into one of the greatest long series written in the scifi post apocolypse genre. Please finish what you started Hugh.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love all of the Hunger Game books. This is the one that started it all and in my opinion is the best one of the three.
0374533571|5.0|The Silver Linings Playbook was the best book i have read in a long time. Not many books have really got my attention lately but once i started reading this one i could not put it down, litterally i read it in one day. It really shows that life does not always go how you want it too, but there are things that you cannot change and you have to try and be positive. This book will be a great movie and i am very excited!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book, very surprising. You don't expect what happens. If you liked the Hunger Games then read this.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I was looking for a pedal tuner that wouldn't break the bank, after all it's not like i'm a touring musician i just wanted something for convenience to use when i play with friends. I read some of the reviews about how it takes a while to \\"warm up\\" which is laughable in my opinion. You plug it in turn it on wait 2 seconds and you're up. If you can't want wait 2 seconds then you have some serious preparation issues. I like this product so much that it lead me to buying another pedal from Behringer. So if you aren't bound by brand and you are looking for quality for your dollar i highly recommend this pedal.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Before downloading this app my battery lasted a day or two. Once I downloaded it the battery maybe lasted half a day. When I uninstalled it the battery started lasting longer. So, no, I wouldn't recommend this.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's hard to believe the woman who wrote for Little Bear on Nick Jr went on to write The Hunger Game series. I thought this book was great, and loved the ending.
B004OBQDJ8|5.0|Great movie for the kids and has enough underlying humor that makes it entertaining for adults.  My 3 year old son loves this movie and is not a typical tv/movie kid; but this movie he will sit and watch the whole thing.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|I have been a Sting fan since his Police days.. I love the evolutionary path he has chosen in his music interpretations.<br />Always putting a new spin on his classics, not droning on and on with the same arrangements. I think as we mature, our music tastes expand to other genres, and he has managed to touch base with orchestral moods, jazz, and then<br />magically swing back to the rock and roll edge, seamlessly. I admire his integration of the English language with prose.. Truly a gifted musician... Keep on making em' and I'll keep listening..... Brava !!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I'm a big fan of the series.  SOA is may be on a low budget, but the story plot is always interesting.  Evidently Hells Angels enjoys the series as Sonny, head of the original Oakland Chapter, appears in several episodes.

B007MB5OCE|3.0|Very funny, lots of twists and turns, but somewhat tedious in the details. Interesting historical tie-ins. Give it a try.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book but alittle to hot for an older woman.  But I will  be truthful  I didn't want to put it down. I like the story and want to finish the Trilogy.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Albom does it again. Charming, thrilling, inspiring fable. Makes us all think about the true meaning of time. Quick read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I heard so much how good they where. But I was just alittle shocked how much sex was in it. Of course I made it threw and maybe learned a few things.  I do love the story line and can't wait to get the last one. I did talk a friend into buying them. She is much youger and can handle it.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|The Heaviest Most Complete Sounding Metal Album of all time. Nothing comes close in completness in my opinion other then Master of Puppets by Metallica but isn't nearly as heavy as this bad boy. If you are Just  getting into Heavy Metal, go big like I did at age 12 and start with Pantera and Metallica then find all the other good stuff in between as you go...If you already know metal pretty well and know pantera then you already know the power and impact that pantera had in the early/mid to early 2000's. You also knowthe importance and  how much of an impact Pantera has had on the metal community today. This album is perfect from start to finish. Phils Vocals for heavy metal are one of a kind(when he screams it has harmony like someone would have when they are singing)  that fit perfectly with the man behind the best guitar riffs and solos. Not to mention the best tone, Mr. Dimebag Darrell. I got this cd in the 6th grade (24 now and graduated college) and it is still my favorite cd to this day in any genre which still amazes me because  i own over 600 albums ranging from classic rock to death metal...(I am going to review every cd i own so check out all my reviews as i post them, everytime i listen to an album im going to review it afterwards. This is only the second cd ive reviewd so far, so its gonna be a Minute, haha) This cd was 3 when it came out in the year 1992 and  is still the heaviest cd i have ever heard put to tape, even as we creep towards the year 2013.  These Bach of songs come straight from the heart and are nothin' but straight up heavy metal. Also Check out Far Beyond Driven.,, That album Is balls deep in Heaviness also. All Panteras Albums are as heavy as can be  but Vulgar and Far Beyond Driven are my two Personal Favorites. .There was never a band on a level as Pantera before them and there certaintly hasen't been one sense. Often Imitated but NEVER Duplicated. Oh before i forget, for the people that are  saying pantera sucks and arent Heavy metal and Dimebag sucks as a guitarist and Phil sucks as a vocalist... I think you need a reality check, to get real and to recognize what real is.Saying Pantera isnt Heavy Metal is like saying the government isnt shady and doesnt screw us over. Pantera=Heavy METAL AND dont you ever forget that.<br /><br />P.s.- Check out Down, and also the bands on Phil Anselmos label, Housecore Records.. warbeast and Haarp. Phil Knows what's up.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Prometheus starts on a high note,  After the opening sequence with the Alien being left behind on earth to do his thing it starts a downward spiral and never looks up again.<br /><br />The story plot is pathetic, the actions of the so called crew a joke considering the magnitude of the mission. Like the stupid geologist and his buddy would even come close to passing the psychic screening for such an endeavor..<br /><br />And  Charlize Theron's  character tells the crew in no uncertain terms they will have no contact what so ever with any inhabitants to which the crew promptly hops in their vehicles and ride off like they are in a parade.  Please, This movie was a disaster.<br /><br />All I see is a lame attempt for some kind of prequel to Ridley Scott's Alien series.  I guess after something like the original Alien there is no where to go but down..<br /><br />I am giving it 3 stars only because I am a BIG Sci-Fi fan of the first order,<br /><br />Very good special effects for what there was.  Not hardly good enough to make Prometheus a movie you would want to own..<br /><br />Rent it at redbox for $1.50,  not worth much more than that..
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love reading Nelson DeMille books. They are always a fast and detailed read. This one however is a little drawn out. He takes longer than usual to get to the climax of the book. But he is a great writer and this is book is engaging all the way until the end!! I would recommend this book!
B008E374PO|5.0|Yeah, this is the Adam Young I know.  So many of his best songs are on this.  I can only hope there's plenty of more songs to come.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie! Tons of action...great cast!! Just Fun! Special fx are really awesome...I give this one five stars..maybe six!!<br />Watch it
159315724X|5.0|Simple, yet dead-on.  This book can have a true life-changing impact on its readers.  As an avid reader of the self-development genre, I put this book near the top.  Well done!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I'm not gonna say it was bad acting, I'm not gonna say the plot was incoherent and lacked the statisfaction of an ending, I'm not even gonna comment on much of the movie... because that would take more of my time. If you have to go to existentialism and things outside of a movie to justify watching it guess what... you've just had a two hour time suck. goodnight
B0076DCT2G|5.0|De Mille's books are mostly great with only an occasional bummer.  I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;The Panther&#34;.  It's clearly the best I've read this year and that's a lot of books
0547884591|5.0|I just totally love this book. The amount of information surely indicates that there was a lot of time and effort put into it. I also have Tim's two other books that are great. But this one is just so cool to look at with a wealth of information. I also have the kindle versions of all these books. Make no mistake the kindle version won't do this book justice, its great as a quick reference.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying more of the recipes. I tried a couple so far and they were all very tasty and quick to prep. Since I love to cook I appreciate the tips and some of the tools he suggests. How can you not love the Aeropress. It certainly set me free from $5 coffee shop lattes.<br /><br />Anybody who follows Tim knows he isn't an ordinary guy, so don't expect an ordinary book! He goes from making a poached egg to taking apart a deer to preventing fat gain when you binge. There is just so much to discover. It's worth every penny and then some.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game to unwind with.  Adults and kids can play, as there are many, many levels. They all like it.
B006FE83U4|5.0|Excellent movie for all generations to view.  Actors were superb in their roles.  The interview would have made a 'stand-alone' purchase.  Great for a family viewing and discussion.
0143035711|5.0|Interesting take from a guy who was there. Not a gung-ho type book which made me like it more. Questioning the morality of war while doing his job to the best of his ability. Sad that he went through so much PTSD before it was ever recognized by health professionals.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This information was great! I used it to format my book. It's from KDP, how can you go wrong following their information!
B000I3PERS|5.0|This is a specific gift requested by a family member.  We are all fans of Mel Gibson and consider this the pentacle of his career.  The scenery is right-on--we visited the Highlands of Scotland a year ago and the layout of the land is breathtaking.  The history is reliable--about as accurate as a film adaptation can get. Not much is known about Wallace (and he didn't have contact with the French bride of the English prince!), but beyond that, the depiction of the English king was accurate, at least from the Scottish point of view!  The battle scenes are grisly--again accurate.  Some of the battles do not include geographic accuracy, but this isn't a documentary.  Most interesting:  we are history teachers but were embarrassed to not be familiar with Wallace; as soon as we got home we hit the books and &#34;Blam!&#34; Wallace was all over the place!  So, this film introduces the general public to an actual hero.  There are monuments, etc. to Wallace all over Scotland!  And a &#34;must have&#34; for anyone who collects Academy Award films.
B007UZO3F6|5.0|Absolutely no problem so far. BIOS was good to go with Ivy Bridge processor.<br />Use recommended components for a trouble free build.<br />Beautiful case design. Great small size.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|Like any good stylus, this one borrows the basic design of a pen. A pretty short pen, to be sure; it would certainly be easier to use if it were slightly longer. But what it lacks in length it makes up in tips. Three of them, which really seems excessive. However, the tip eventually wore out on my last stylus, so it can happen--And I guess there's some comfort to be had in knowing that I won't have to worry about that again for a long, long time.
0316187216|5.0|When a book's dedication includes a shout-out to Clint Eastwood, you are probably thinking something different than a fantasy novel by one of the best writers in the genre, but from the first page on Abercrombie makes this fantasy/western mash-up work on it's own merits as well as a homage to the western genre. I kept thinking what a ball Abercrombie must have had writing this one, as he had to stock up on a big pile of classic western flicks to get inspiration...I saw references to The Searchers, Unforgiven, Wagon Train, Eastwood's \\"Man With No Name\\" series, Deadwood, Stagecoach, Ride the High Country, and Shane in the story, but imagine those classics directed by Quentin Tarrantino and John Woo and you have it a little closer to what Abercrombie does. All in all, the western and fantasy genres play off each other very well, and this novel set in Abercrombie's \\"Circle of the World\\" series is great as either a continuation or stand-alone...you don't have to have read the earlier books, but it does help as many characters (older and certainly not wiser, in some cases) make their return.<br /><br />I think at this point it's not really a spoiler to mention that this novel also features the highly anticipated return of Logen Ninefingers, star of the Third Law trilogy and perhaps Abercrombie's most intriguing character. Interestingly he is never named as such during the novel (much as Eastwood's characters in Pale Rider and others never seems to get around to having a proper name), being known as \\"Lamb\\" to his fellow villagers and his family, his step-children (including the interestingly named Shy South, who tells one character \\"It's my name, not a description\\"), and anyone who asks. It's better Logen remain dead, but the kidnapping of his two small kids send he and Shy on a quest across the Far Country, to the city of Crease, and eventually high into the mountains to a classic confrontation, where Lamb's old berserker past comes more and more to the fore. The story is never told from Lamb's point of view, which I found very appropriate considering the genre Abercrombie is trying to emulate, but the return is very enjoyable indeed as we see how the intervening years have (and haven't) changed the old warrior.<br /><br />After the children are stolen, \\"Lamb\\" and Shy South (who it turns out has quite a bloody past herself as an outlaw) must travel an extraordinary length to find them, coming across evidence more children have been stolen and driven to a place high in the mountains. Along the way they run into many new characters and some old favorites (Including Nicolo Cosco, Sgt Friendly and their band of mercenaries), and some interesting new ones (including Temple, the cowardly lawyer of Nicolo's band, who soon joins the two and becomes one of their band). They join up with a group of settlers heading west with gold rush fever, battle \\"Indians\\" (Ghost barbarians), experience a decadent and depraved frontier town, and head into the mountains pursued by Cosca's band to enter into a remake of The Searchers as Shy South's brother and sister may not want to leave the paradise they have found within the mountains...all the while Logen's old enemy Caul Shivers follows and waits for his chance at revenge.<br /><br />While the western motif is strong, this book is not just a sum of western cliches thrown together. Shy South is an interesting character and possibly the \\"nicest\\" character ever to be a protagonist of a Abercrombie book. Although she has had a bloody past, she has rejected it to work on her late-mother's farm and take care of her siblings, and throughout the book is motivated only to rescue them or die trying. She is also as total bad ass, and while not enjoying the violence she must engage in, she knows how to get the job done. Temple is another intriguing character. An abject coward, he follows the mercenary Cosca (who sees himself as a benevolent father figure and mentor to Temple) until the violence finally gets to him and he runs away, only to be found and rescued by South's little band. An attraction arises between South and Temple, but if you know Abercrombie, he's not above subverting a traditional western love story and making it quite a bit rough around the edges. Despite his general uselessness, Temple makes himself a part of the band and once Crease is reached his many other hidden talents come into play, including reluctant hero. Is there anyway Abercrombie can bring this two together for a happy ending (which as you know Abercrombie NEVER does), or will it follow a more unusual path? It's worth it to stick around and see, but I found Temple and South two protagonists I actually rooted for (which is pretty dang unusual) as their character flaws are minimal compare to those in past books. Other interesting characters include many members of the wagon train (including failed actor Lestek, the barbarian Savian, the corrupt guide Sweet and his woman Crying Rock, and the \\"villain\\" Waerdinur who has been stealing children for what he believes is a higher purpose. One of Abercrombie's strengths through the years have been his interesting and enjoyable characters, and he does not disappoint here.<br /><br />There are several plots swirling here (the kidnapping of the children, the hunting of the rebel leader Conthus, the traveling across the plains, Shivers revenge on Logen, Logen's revert to his brutal past, the corrupt town of Crease, Cosca's search for treasure)and they are all resolved in one way or another. Many western tropes (the corrupt town, the killer who put his violent past behind only to resurrect it again, the wagon train across dangerous territory) work well in this context and are explored by Abercrombie to good effect (entering the town of Crease gives Abercrombie's descriptive powers a workout as he describes it as hell on earth, no skimping the disgusting details). And what can you say about a book that ends with a showdown on main street, and one of the protagonists riding off into the sunset like Shane? But the book has to work as a story on it's own without the western OR fantasy cliches, and this one does admirably. It is a tale of the end of old ways and the beginning of (bad) new ways, of love (between man and woman, sister and siblings, father and daughter), of keeping your word and showing bravery under the worst of conditions, of the civilized world vs the primitive world, of bloody vengeance, of greed and cowardice, and of justice (well meaning or not). It succeeds on these merits and by the end had become my favorite Abercrombie novel after Last Argument of Kings.<br /><br />While this book had my highest rating, there are a few negatives to bring up. If you are put off by bad language, graphic violence, and mature themes, you won't enjoy this book. Abercrombie's books have few heroes (most inhabit a world of grey at best) and happy endings are not guaranteed. It can be read as a stand alone, but personally most of the enjoyment for me was as a continuation of the earlier books in the series, as several of the allusions and characters make more sense once you know their pasts. While many would say this is not his best book, I think by far this is his best WRITTEN book, Abercrombie is clearly getting better and better as a write (not just a fantasy writer). Still some loyal readers might be disappointed by what they see is a \\"softening\\" of Abercrombie, but I think this is just his maturity of a writer growing (aka, you don't have to kill or corrupt everyone at the end to have a good story).<br /><br />If it still needs to be said, buy this book if you are a fan of Abercrombie's previous novels, or either fantasy or westerns, you won't regret it.nd he runs away, only to be found and rescued by South's little band.

0763652245|4.0|There really wasn't much to the story, it just talks about what the witch keeps in her kitchen - and one side of the flaps is the &#34;good&#34; thing, and the other is the &#34;bad&#34; thing.  It didn't knock my socks off....but my 2 and 5 year old wanted me to read it every night.  I didn't find the illustrations any better than other Halloween books, but I suppose the draw is the flaps, which lift in two different directions on each page.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|I ts disappointing that i cant even quite figure this one out...  dont know what to say except i can see why it was offered free.... dont bother
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait for another to come out.  I started reading Percy Jackson so that I could see what my 11 year old son was reading but now I'm all into the series
B0018D4SHY|5.0|It just got to me yesterday and I can't stop listening to it, even though I already had the songs in my PC. The thing is, the quality is so much better it's not even fair! I love this CD with all the great songs by this great rock n' roller.

B009X01C64|4.0|I was looking for a case for my Kindle Fire and this one looked like a good choice. The reviews are favorable.<br /><br />The Marware Case arrived in an environmentally friendly Green packaging. Easy to open, and biodegradable. Inside the case was protected. The case itself feels hefty. Directions for installing the Kindle into the case were explicit except for one tiny item. You must make sure to slide the Kindle where the charging side is to the right. There is an open space on the case so the charging side is apparent. I slid the other side into the hard shell, and it was very difficult to remove the Kindle to change sides. The hard shell is just that and it took some strength to remove the Kindle. Once the Right side of the Kindle is in place, push down the left side into the hard shell until you hear it click. The Kindle is very secure! The directions for moving the Kindle to a vertical or horizontal view are explicit and easy. These features are excellent! There are small 'feet' that fit into the inner shell to secure the Kindle in the exact position you favor. The leather is well padded and quite attractive. There is an elastic strap to keep the cover closed. Like all good cases, this case turns the Kindle on when the cover is opened and turns the Kindle off when the cover is closed. There is also a small handle to carry the Kindle if needed.<br /><br />This case is an attractive, easy to use case. Including the hint to place the Kindle charger side down to the instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 11-27-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0079R8KXG Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire, Red]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005HSG3U6 Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover by Marware, White]]
B000YHG72E|5.0|my son and I can watch it over and over during the holidays. I am glad I puchased it. Just waiting for it to arrive! ;-D
B001OGWY1W|4.0|This continuation of the reboot of the Batman franchise delivers strongly.  I watched the earlier Batman movies, which were fine for their time, but Christian Bale is the &#34;real&#34; Batman to me now.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great CD. Phillip Phillips is true to himself and it shows in his songs and performances. Loved him since the auditions for American Idol. Keep up the fine music Phillip.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|I hate the term &#34;coming of age film&#34; but there really is no better way to put it. Among all the  humor is something very real and deep. This film has earned a place in American cuture and will always be a classic as far as I am concerned.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the ease with which I can swap between devices. Now my notebooks are available everywhere I go.  I can dog ear articles on my work PC, jot down notes on the fly with the android phone, pick up at home where I left off at work on the home PC to dogear a few more articles and by the end of the day I have an awesome array of reading material before bed on the kindle.  Evernote, if you ever make a task manager akin to Astrid I would pay to upgrade.
B002L9N4EM|5.0|I love this movie, I had to buy this collectors thing. The box is awesome, the book is amazing, the scratch and sniff chocolates are sweet, but the feather inside makes no sense.
0547884591|5.0|I'm in the middle of reading \\"The Four-Hour Chef\\" now, the first (cook)book I know of to feature its own soundtrack!<br /><br />The book itself is ridiculous, in a good way. It's like the best cookbook ever because it starts from scratch (pun intended). But more importantly, it's one big \\"headfake\\" -- two headfakes, actually:<br /><br />1) Tim Ferriss uses cooking as a headfake for learning, which is daunting, ambitious -- and actually pretty cool,<br /><br />2) He's teaching a whole generation of young men (what I believe to be the target demographic for his book, although of course it's open to men and women of all ages) how to cook healthy, which has huge potential benefits for lots of people.<br /><br />The Four-Hour Chef is part of a larger dialogue in this country over obesity, food policy, diet-related diseases (the #1 killer in America).<br /><br />Teaching people how to cook (as opposed to eating fast food or ordering out) has been seen as a way to address these issues, but this book may actually make people *want* to cook who didn't care about cooking before -- that's a big difference.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my favotite books of all time, next to the Harry Potter Series, of course. Loved it!
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I'm not reviewing the disc and packaging itself as much as I am reviewing the movie. The packaging is pretty standard - Blu-ray quality is good, Digital Copy is good, love that it comes with a DVD as well. I'm not crazy about the cover art they chose for the Blu-ray release - the actual poster was much better that this cover. Now about the movie:<br /><br />'Super 8' is very likable and very stable for a &#34;monster&#34; movie. It's so stable and such a throwback to the classic Sci-Fi movie feel that it may strike a contemporary audience as being a bit boring. I am very impressed with the child actors - they all do an excellent job, arguably much better than the child actors did in the films of the 1970s and 1980s, of which Spielberg of course pulls a lot of influence for this film from.<br />The most jarring thing about the film for me is the obvious visual queues for each director - Spielberg's fingerprints are all over the characters and J.J. Abrams' fingerprints are all over most of the action cinematography. If you know these filmmaker's work, you will find very obvious evidence of both here.<br />All-in-all, I say 'Super 8' is a good movie. Not great, but very enjoyable. It's fun but not overly so. It's thoughtful but not a tearjerker. There is an element of mystery here, and sadly it's not more pronounced. I would have preferred more of the 'Cloverfield'-type mystery surrounding the &#34;creature&#34;, but instead it's not built up enough. It feels like we're about to get an 'E.T.' moment and then we end up with a somewhat harried ending that leaves the movie feeling flat. However, that's not really a huge complaint since the rest of the film is so much fun. If you have a choice, drive out to the middle of nowhere and watch this in your car. It'll make it feel like a good old-time drive-in flick.
1444737112|5.0|This is such a heartwarming story.  It just shows us humans that when we think we are saving an animal, they are in fact saving us!
B009E2U7L2|4.0|The first most people heard of Cher Lloyd's 'Sticks & Stones' was the first US single 'Want U Back' - a fairly annoying song, but catchy nonetheless. It also has a lot more clever lyricism than you will find on many 'break up' songs, incorporating a satirical nature and a type of self-influence when the singer tries to tell herself that she's not jealous, but clearly the guy didn't think this through. This type of clever lyricism was the first thing that stood out to me about Cher Lloyd.<br /><br />Swagger Jagger is one of my favorite songs of the year, and I'm sad it didn't get more radio play in the US. This song is simply incredible - catchy, danceable, and Cher Lloyd demonstrates just how versatile she is - great rapper with an excellent singing voice.<br /><br />Oath rounds the album out and is a perfectly welcome new BFF song for the teenage girl<br /><br />When asked to explain Cher Lloyd, I usually compare her to Ke$ha, only with less glitter and more talent - an actual singing voice and an actual rapping voice, and the stage presence to hold her own with the big girls. Cher Lloyd is a welcome addition to the girl pop-music culture and stands alongside Karmin as one of my favorite new rap/pop combination efforts of the year. I'm very excited to see what Cher Lloyd brings us in the future - this girl has got some serious skills!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I hated to see this one end. I cut my teeth on Star Trek, which first came out when I was just entering college. I didn't know if the new crew would disappoint. They didn't! Bones was spot on! Some characters were even better than the original. They took a bold tack by their departure from the original story line--a brilliant move, actually. The story had substance. The characters were engaging. The view compelling. Even if you have never seen a Star Trek episode and don't know Spock from Kirk, you can step right into the middle of this one and love it.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Wow- what a story reads like great  fiction.  Really draws you in- waiting for the BBC miniseries-really as cinematic story
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Okay, I'm not a superhero fan--not like some. But this movie had some excellent stuff. Yes, the graphics were amazing, but it was the story that struck me. An ordinary man is faced with extraordinary circumstances and found his purpose in the process. Yes, it's an oft told tale, and this one is well done!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Catchy, easy to listen to, and all around amazing. Must buy if you like good rap music or anything with a beat
B003UESJH4|5.0|If you are one of the few people on earth who hasn't seen this, time to remedy the situation. it is a movie of hope and courage and inspiration. Every character in this movie contributed to the end product, and in my estimation, showed the very best that people can bring forth in times of crisis. You'll be a better person for experiencing this one! Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush were extraordinary! Their interactions made this movie! Not enough superlatives to describe it.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|This unplugged album gives Florence such an angelic quality; the photo on the front of the album is a perfect pictorial representation of how she sounds in just about every song. I also like how she drops a few keys in some of her songs so I am able to sing along without sounding like a dying cat (I'm thinking specifically of &#34;Cosmic Love&#34; here!). I am almost moved to tears by the way &#34;Never Let Me Go&#34; and &#34;No Light, No Light&#34; have such a sad, mournful quality to them.<br /><br />The surprise covers of &#34;Jackson&#34; and &#34;Try a Little Tenderness&#34; are welcome additions; the way she carries that final &#34;Tenderness&#34; note for what feels like minutes gives me chills.<br /><br />The DVD portion is such a gift; Florence makes singing a visual art form as well, and I love being able to watch her whenever I need a dose of feminine fluidity. It was seeing her on this DVD that prompted me to see her live in concert earlier this year.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogoy.  Finally Christian found his love and  freedom from what he felt was his norm for life. True love does wonders when it comes to deep seeded issues
B009P5S11G|4.0|WOW WOWOW! Ive been waiting for this album to come out for what seems like ages when in fact only a couple months since shes steady releasing a cd every November the risk of being overexposed valid but she is consistently makin quality music so its not an issue! This cd is solid theres only a few i dont care for and one is **HOLD YOUR BREATH** the duet w Eminem! All ill say is BORING!!! So con outta the way heresw the pros:<br />Phresh Out The Runway- A fiesty opener with Rihannas sailor mouth over a hot hiphop beat! 3/4<br />Diamonds- whats left to say one of my favs that everyones heard so.... 4/4<br />Jump- loving this of course you know its samples Pony but has this very 90s RnB esque vibe that is relevent considering the sample it uses! 3/4<br />What Now- My abs favorite its amazing vulnerable lyrics with top notch vocals from RI RI 4/4<br />Right Now- David Guetta produced sounds like it could be an outtake from Loud or Talk That Talk im enjoying it tho none the less 3/4<br />Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary- PERFECTION a very layered song that flows 2 songs together smoothly i love it!! my 2nd fav 4/4<br />Stay- An unexpected treasure, Im not sure who Mikky Ekko is but after his verse they sing in perfect harmony and the song is beautiful some of her strongest vocals ever!!! 4/4<br />Loveeee Song- Future (whom I have no idea who he is)is featured on the hook and verse is a pretty good song, mellow beat to it almost a chopped n screwed vibe to it! 3/4<br />Half Of Me- Worth gettin the deluxe for, this song is written by one of my fav singers right now, Emeli Sande and this is prime example of Rihanna bein true to herself the bridge she throws in the F word and it couldnt have been placed better! Turns a vulnerable song into an honest song to RiRi's true personality 4/4<br /><br />I threw some of my favs in the review but like I said in the beginning solid album minus Track 3-Numb feat. Eminem I havnt grown more in love with it everytime i listen to it! The deluxe comes in a slighlty longer digipack w bertiful pics of RiRi and the cardboard its printed on has a very matte feel to it I cant stop staring at the cover! It also comes with a first look dvd of selected parts of her Loud Tour from 02 Arena dvd which shes releasing sometime soon!!!!<br /><br />Id recommend this to anyone #NAVY4Lyfeuxe comes in a slighlty longer digipack w bertiful pics of RiRi and the cardboard its printed on has a very matte feel to it I cant stop staring at the cover!

B00064X282|3.0|This SACD is really great ! The quality is here but the album itself is a little bit two slow for me ...
1451638450|5.0|Ivan finally gets his book and it's a great read with lots of humor, romance, crazy Jacksonians and Cetagandans and a small amount of action.  I wouldn't recommend it as the starting point for the series as a lot of the humor and fun depends on knowing all the other characters who make cameos.
B00064X3BI|4.0|Very nice album from Mr. Slowhand. The \\"Cocaine\\" version is really great and the SACD quality is here !!!! And \\"Lay down Sally\\" is a very cool song too.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first in the trilogy. It starts to get interesting about half way through. Once the games actually begin it becomes interesting although a little redundant. Maybe the last novel holds more promise.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Gameplay is pretty great. The game is excellent. The only problem is when you exit the game. I had to do the final mission against the lizard. I wanted to get the black suit first. I only needed 400 more spiders (the currency of the game) to get it. I took a break from the game. When I got back, the game started all over! This wasn't the first time; the first time, I reached level 22 until the game suddenly froze. I had to reinstall the game and start over. Get that fix and the game will be worth it, if it's still $1.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Not just a cult classic. A bona-fide classic finally perfected. Ridley Scott playing the part of a fine wine that only gets better with age. A must-see for any sci-fi fanatic. Let alone any lover of movies.
034580404X|5.0|The book was exhausting and would make any woman live in a fantasy world. i was relieved when the trilogy ended, but upset knowing it was the last one :(
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. Not only is the cast aboslutely wonderful, but the story, setting, and nuances of the characters and their interactions with one another are just so great. What a lovely film. I will certainly be watching it again and again.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a greast movie.  Both Cher and Christina are fantastic as are all the others in this movie.  The dance numbers are just great.  Highly recommend.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|If you are one who takes their history very seriously you may find this one difficult to watch.  This is just fun alternative history that dishes up a lot of action-filled fight scenes that bring martial arts rather than history to mind.  There is a good deal of gore (of the low-budget special effects variety) and not a lot of character development but the action keeps things moving along despite the somewhat shallow story line.  If you are looking for serious historically based fiction or bone-chilling horror, you are looking in the wrong place.  If you are a fan of alternative history and science fiction with a yen for martial arts movies, you will find a fun diversion in this movie.  But fun diversion is about as far as it goes.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I adore Bruno Mars and this CD is terrific.  The songs are great and upbeat make you want to dance. I even have a few on my phone as ringtones. Great buy.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|Everything you could ask for from the genre and more. Long songs make it a great value as well for purchase.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the zombie genre in general. This is far and away the best series produced for TV in decades. JMO
B000929AJQ|5.0|I love this it works great and I love NIN so this was a great buy also it has very small scratches and it came early
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a fan.  It's easy to scroll through the different categories to get many ideas.  Now I need to focus on actually doing some of the things I see on there instead of just looking.
B003YOMN68|4.0|Actually, I hadn't heard a Bill Evans performance in more years than I can remember...but a reminder in an Amazon visit reminded me how much I liked his music back when I was going to clubs as a young woman.  Then, I listened for the excitement of it...now I listen to appreciate his virtuosity--and even, to be transported in my meditation time, out of the noise of my wordy mind.  This CD triggered purchase of more Bill Evans music, and an escape from the over-amplified contemporary music of current performances....
B0035OC7PO|5.0|Bill Bryson's droll sense of humour and turn of phrase is hilarious.  I've made the mistake of eating when reading his book and a sudden guffaw will invariably send the food the wrong way!<br />Anyone who likes a good laugh should read Bill Bryson.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|After reviewing two other Bill Evans trio performance, I'm running out of superlatives.  I remembered the Bill Evans name from the '50s, when I would listen to jazz  in noisy clubs, and didn't really know how to pay attention.  Now, in my '80's, after  decades of hearing magnificent classical music in concert halls  and via the increasingly well-engineered sound reproduction of CD technology, I can appreciate not only Evans's technical virtuosity, but the subtlety and musicality of his variations, and how they also inspired his fellow musicians.  What a gift to my old ears--and musical sensibilities!
B005VPRET4|4.0|I still think legos are too expensive, but that is probably me.  I think toys in general are.  But my little girl liked it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the greatest game ever! I have all of my family and friends playing it too! I recommend this definitely!
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena. The book we have all been waiting for...<br /><br />Well, where to start? There certainly wasn't that much action, just drama, struggles, and reunion. The ending was just like WHAT, and overall, there wasn't a single moment where I got bored. Awesome book, just don't expect too much action and go along with it.<br /><br />Oh, and totally forgot to add - Percabeth fans won't be disappointed.
0756686970|4.0|My son loved it!! It gave us a lot of info about the characters in star wars.  Not only that, the price is really good.
B000HEVZ6W|4.0|Gattaca is set in the not-too-distant future.  Genetic modification has developed to such an extent that parents are now able to order custom babies, eliminating what would have been any physical liabilities and putting in their place brains, brawn and beauty (the movie derives its name from the letters found in DNA sequences: G, A, T and C).  This technological advance has created a two-tiered society of elites (called \\"Valids\\") and normal people (called \\"In-Valids\\").  The former get the best jobs and all the perks, while the latter muddle along as best they can.  The protagonist, Vincent, was born the normal way, but he refuses to settle for mediocrity.  He aspires to be in space.  And nothing is going to stop him.<br /><br />This is not typical sci-fi fare.  Indeed, there is virtually no sci-fi action in it at all--it is all character-driven, with strong acting all around.  Director Andrew Niccol gives us a compelling story of human achievement.  The movie wrestles with the ethical implications of genetic modification, but it also shows that the spirit of man cannot be altered in the same way.  There is no gene for courage and determination.  You either have them or you don't.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG-13 for brief violence, some language and some sexuality.  There are two scenes of implied intimacy between unmarried individuals, as well as three scenes involving obscured male nudity.  Characters smoke and drink.  A man nearly drowns twice.  A character commits suicide (mostly off camera).<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is good, both audio and visual--not the best I have ever seen, but perfectly funcational for this type of movie.  If you already have the DVD, it is a judgment call about whether you should upgrade or not.  If you really like this movie, then go for it.  Otherwise, the DVD will work just fine.<br /><br />I recommend Gattaca as an interesting piece of speculation about where we might be going as a society, and the ethical implications associated with genetic modification.  If you are looking for something a little more high tech and action-oriented, like [[ASIN:B000RJEHK8 The Island [Blu-ray]]], then you will be disappointed.  This is more of a thinking person's film.implications associated with genetic modification.  If you are looking for something a little more high tech and action-oriented, like [[ASIN:B000RJEHK8 The Island [Blu-ray]]], then you will be disappointed.  This is more of a thinking person's film.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham is an amazing story teller. The way he twist the story is so smooth and give the reader unbelievable end of story. I love his books and collecting it in hard cover editions.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|First I would like to say, I rarely buy holiday music any more. For years, in my opinion anyway, it's been mostly the same music over and over, just re-recorded by another artist. &#34;A Very She & Him Christmas&#34; is different. I am indeed a fan of their music, but wasn't sure what exactly to expect, having not listened to any previews of this holiday recording. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! I have listened to this cd in it's entirety three times already. I also plan to purchase it for a few stocking stuffers! Soothing sounds, great voices, and definitely sing along songs included! Highly recommend this cd!
B000I0QL82|5.0|I have always loved ths movie, so happy I got it from Amazon.  Enjoying it yet again.  Thankyou for the movie to add to our collection
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Rod's distinctive voice on these holiday songs will have you singing along. Not quite a classic but one you will want for your holiday collection especially if you are a fan of Rod Stewart.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good movie for girls and moms to watch together. It was cute but not my favorite Disney movie. I think my kids felt the same way.
0385535147|4.0|I admire John Grisham's ability to tell an engaging story without crossing the line into territory where the story might be meaningful or have a theme.  Grisham excels at putting together complex lots which keep the reader guessing and the story moving.  The Racketeer may actually be a little better than most of his novels in achieving those goals; it's well plotted, fast moving, entertaining, but is nevertheless the same empty fluff which all of his novels are.  His narrator seems to thumb his nose at the federal government a little more than most of his narrators, but is, at the same time, exceedingly careful never to allow the novel to develop a theme.  It's all for fun, and probably more entertaining than spending an evening watching television.  It earns four stars just on Grisham's story telling skills.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This case is the best value you can find.  It is flexible and tough; it does not stretch out and fits the phone snugly.  You can't beat it for the price.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I purchased as a gift for a friend at his request.  I have  also  purchased other volumes as gifts to him.  He really loves this stuff.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Simply a great film. I watched it with my wife (no kids) and we laughed all night. Steve Carell does an excellent dubbing job, and the development of the other characters is just fantastic. Very enjoyable without having to put up with parts that don't make sense or push the envelope.

B009GEAPYW|4.0|For some reason I didn't pick up on this being animated when I ordered - I really like the &#34;real people&#34; films - thought I'd watch it anyway and it wasn't bad
B008BZIUHG|5.0|Just when I thought Rock was dead a CD and group comes along to renew my faith in the genre.  Why this is not available in the U.S. is completely beyond me.  It's like Led Zeppelin meets Trapeze in a backroom and jammed but with a very modern sensibility.  Highly Recommended!!!  (and if you like this go back and check out their older disc's as well).

B0036BP6XQ|5.0|I am bias when it comes to Bullock, but the kids were great supporting actors.  The story itself is heartwarming as it's like a modern day Cinderella story.  A kid that has had everything go against him yet he has the fortitude to stick with doing what is right instead of becoming another crime statistic.  The fact that it's based loosely on a true story makes it all that much better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We have seen Season 1 and 2 many times now. So bring on Season 3 and I hear there will be a 4 and I hope so on and so on... Don't stop producing this fine show. Love the actors, costumes, house and humor and intrigued and romance.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Lady Gaga may have been born the way he/she is; however, this music album is just plain bad.  I got it due to the $0.99 price from Amazon, but pretty confident it is not worth it.
1451695195|5.0|After hearing the author on tv I knew I wanted this book.  It exceeded my expectations!  I would recommend it!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Kids loved this comical parts in the show. Kinda puts the fun back into the superheroes that most leave out nowadays.
0061474355|5.0|I first saw this book when I was in junior high and the one thing that piqued my interest was the binding with Sabriel's belt on the side. I picked it up and thought the cover was so intriguing! Thus began my adventure into Garth Nix's world of The Old Kingdom. I have loved this book ever since. He develops the characters so well and still leaves you with just enough questions to want more from this world! Sabriel is a great book for anyone interested in adventure, mystery, suspense and a little romance. It is good for many different ages. I got my dad to read it and he also enjoyed the story very much (I believe he said that it was better than both the Twilight series and the Hunger Games series...how's that!)!! I also got several co-workers into this story, including the following storylines of Lirael and Abhorsen. I can't wait for his newest book to be out! I have been eagerly awaiting it since he hinted at it several years ago. Hope the next person enjoys it as much as I have!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fast game with great graphics.  This game is for anyone who enjoys an intense game with surprises.  I would recommend this game.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This case works very well with my D5100 camera and accessories.  It has a spot for just about everything on the inside, and has a tripod holder on the outside, as well as some other compartments.  It works perfect when I'm carrying multiple lenses for my camera.<br />I would not recommend it to carry around just your camera and one small lens, I would recommend something more versatile for that.
B003JJA59K|4.0|It was a good movie, could see this happening in the near future!! Hope we don't have to think that way, though.
0060723513|3.0|I love the topic and much of the content but internal details in the story reveal a not very well crafted work of fiction. The power of the story is in its credibility; there is insufficient consistency to tempt the reader to suspend belief.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book wasn't as great as the first but it was still really really good! Can't wait to read the last one.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Incredible story -- in fact, I read all 3 books of the trilogy in about 10 days.  Thank God I have a Kindle...as soon as I finished the last page of each book I turned on my Wi-Fi and ordered the next one.  Within minutes I was reading on.  I have not seen the movie but cannot imagine it would do justice to Collins' writing.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Do not hesitate to buy it.  It is addictive and hard to break. If you read previous two this one is yours must have!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The best book I've read all year!!!  I couldn't put it down!!!!  Highly Recommend! I have told all of my friends to read Into the Darkest Corner.
B00A856U7O|1.0|I think this woman needs to keep her role as a housewife and forget about singing, this album is so LAME, BORING, WEAK, perfect for someone that has give up in life and just want to hide and cry in the corner of a room, will NEVER buy anything from this woman, waste time, money and part of my life.
0756407125|5.0|The series is terrific so far.  For a second book in the series it read well.  It was lyrical and built characters and the world slowly with out any hint of boredom.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|I have been a huge Maroon 5 fan since 2002 when my son's band covered their songs. I have seen them in concert and even more a fan now! This album has all my favorite songs. Every time  I turn on the radio, ride in an elevator, shop at the grocery store or mall I hear M5 being played and it is usually a song from this album. I like their more recent recordings as well, but have never tired of this music!
1936608618|5.0|I have a background in competitive bodybuilding and have been semi-retired since 2009. I'm a full time personal trainer and with that being said, I'm constantly on the lookout for new, educational material to help myself as well as my athletes/clients. While I'm not a Crossfit instructor, I enjoy learning about the CF philosophies and especially love reading and learning Brian Mackenzie's theories on running and endurance in general. I also enjoy watching Kelly Starrett's videos on MobilityWod.com. He's hilarious, quick to the point, and his information is always helpful. He shares his views in the mobility section, which is a highlight of the book.<br /><br />11 months ago I took up running and over the summer I ran 3 different races; a 12K, a 5 miler, and a half marathon. Coming from a bodybuilding background, I had never been a runner or incorporated running into my routines even in short sprints or HIIT. I despised running and would avoid it at all costs. Something switched in me last year and my attention shifted to endurance training- and long runs/races. The problem I kept encountering was that I'd have one injury after another. First it was crippling shin splints (that I'm sure ultimately turned into stress fractures in both legs), then it was a tight IT Band and knotted up Vastus Lateralis muscle that wreaked havoc on my right knee and took me out of training for a few weeks. Then both knees started acting up... then minor pain in my achilles. Rest and ice helped, but when I was purposely training for an event, I found it difficult to sit still and take time off.<br /><br />Brian Mackenzie's theories about doing less (running shorter distances) is difficult to wrap your mind around at first because the old school \\"way\\" is long runs scheduled throughout your week leading up to a race. The longs runs were difficult for me in the beginning, but I gradually built up my endurance and embraced the mental and physical challenges that the long runs provided me. 10-13 mile training runs were super important in preparing me for the psychological side of running, which was very alien to me. I'm planning to run a full marathon in June, and Mackenzie's principles will be at the forefront of my training. I'll definitely put more of a focus on my mobility, and strength training this time around and not beat myself up running so much.<br /><br />I received this book last week, and have already read through it pretty thoroughly. I've also started implementing some of the ideas and strategies listed. Right now I'm working on my running form, which needs a lot of work. I can already tell the pages of the mobility section will be worn down and bookmarked in no time- it's invaluable information. I'm aiming to compete in a Triathlon in July, so the swimming and biking section will get dissected soon as well.<br /><br />While I don't strictly follow a Paleo diet, I eat pretty close to it 90% of the time and find it a suitable way for me to eat. I don't consume bread, pasta or rice and I feel that my energy levels are perfectly fine while running. However, before a race I'll deviate a bit and have a piece of toast with jam and almond butter (this is rare for me), but it did seem to help with my energy levels, especially during the half-marathon. Eating in this way also helps me keep my body fat lower than if I were to consume a higher carb/grain diet. Brian Mackenzie is a proponent of the Paleo diet and he briefly describes it in the book.<br /><br />All in all, this book is great! Fantastic photos, excellent explanations and advice, all you need to do is give it a shot and test the theories. I feel this book is appropriate for the novice as well as the seasoned athlete, and for the skeptics- you need to read and apply these principles probably more than anyone. Someone mentioned in another review that the form/exercise description on some of the strength training movements was sketchy (the deadlift, I believe). To this I'd say, check out multiple YouTube videos on powerlifting movements if you're unsure how to do them. Hire a personal trainer with a background in these type of lifts, or join a Crossfit class to make sure your form is correct and you stay safe. It's difficult to look at a picture and know how to properly execute a complicated movement like the Deadlift. But hey, don't take my word for it. Read, apply, and kick ass!
B0088XXCZ6|2.0|Although I have considered myself a fan of Fiona Apple since her debut album, I can't quite get into this one.  She indulges in quirky vocalizations and overuses the growly-yell effect to the point that it distracts from her unconventional, poetic lyrics.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a very great book series, the premise is really understandable and maybe even possible.  In many ways this could happen anywhere.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great Movie for all ages and you don't have to be a football fan to enjoy it.  Saw it with my 12 year old daughter and she love it as well
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Great for mom's and dad's! Very funny. A story for every parent. It touches on every type story you have ever heard!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is free and it works. It is a basic calculator and filled the need on my Kindle Fire.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am not finished reading yet, but really an enjoying the book. Nelson DeMille is the best.<br />Look forward to the next book.
B001NPDCFQ|2.0|I love the picture quality. The color and grain are perfect for my taste. But I'm having a huge problem with the musical numbers. The soundtrack is fine during the dialogue, but as soon as a musical number starts, the vocals drop. I have tried every single sound channel, and this doesn't fix it. I have the sound coming from the tv as I can't afford a sound system at the moment. I've even tried changing the sound on the tv. Any ideas? I tried contacting Warner Home Video months and months ago, but they have never responded.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Flynn goes deeper into the characters which makes you almost feel sorry for even the people you should hate.  I also read Gone Girl and will be downloading Flynn's other novel also.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Wow!!  This is the most intriguing mahjong game that I have played thus far. At first I didn't care for it because they had gpne so far from the original tiles and game concept, hiwever, the longer I played it, the more that I am enjoying it. It is challenging and definitely not for the unsophisticatd player...nor for a beginner!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Cool effects!  Lots of different choices. I wish there were more choices for the picture collages. Overall good app.  I would recommend this picture app.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The DB Tech 35mm Film Scanner is a wonderful product. It is inexpensive, easy and fast to use.<br />And if you have questions about the product, the Company will give you great support.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i love this game!!! it is awesome!!! not alot of adds, and it's free. you should get it. and if you finish it to soon, you can just try to get 3 stars on everything and get all the bonus levals and get 100% eagle score. and before your done, there will proberbly be an update. trust me, you will NOT get bored.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I've always liked Carrie Underwood and this album is just another great one in my collection! I'd suggest it to friends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was expecting a lot from Suzanne Collins after I read the Hunger Games. But, I got much more than I expected. Catching Fire brings a new twist into the story, and one that readers will enjoy. Victors from the past get a not-sweet surprise, the readers get a surprise as what happens in the book is enjoyable and violent at the same time. Make sure to read this book before the movie is made, because reading is better than watching.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app is the best a ever. haflbrick is a really good game company. jatpack joyride deserves a five stars.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Always Kiss Rocks great cd lots of great music that is always updated but still Kiss signature as only Kiss can do Rocks you to the core from start to finish
B0037KMHRY|2.0|It's really my fault I heard one good song and thought it would be a GREAT CD.  Unfortunately the one song I liked is the only one like it on the CD.  My mistake.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The price is well worth it.  This is the best angry birds yet.  Can't wait for the update.  Just buy it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|mr. follett presents the historical facts of post wwII in a most interesting manner presented through diverse but extremely interesting characters.  can't wait for number three.
B001CMOH8G|5.0|I love this movie. It's awesome. I love the songs, the action, the characters, the music, and the comedy. I also think that the dark crystal was on Prime.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|This retro look &amp; feel arcade game is like a marriage of Space Invaders and Arkanoid.  You move and shoot like Space Invaders but you get power-ups to change your abilities like in Arkanoid.  I like it alot because it its simple - not requiring an understanding and remembering of a dozen or so keys/commands.  It's a straight forward way to enjoy some fun, fast-paced old school video gaming.  I even liked the pseudo-techno music, which you can turn off if it gets to be too much.  Enjoy!
B0056C6XIA|5.0|I am very happy with my multitools , and I would highly recommend it to everybody who always on outside work ...<br />most interestingly is the finishing of the product which converge my expectation indeed ...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Definitely in my top 2 shows I have watched in recent years (Breaking Bad being the other) and I'm normally not a huge zombie fan but this is more than just a zombie show. Great storyline and the camera work is exceptional
0060594888|5.0|This one book is a very  complete &#34;collection&#34; of the many principles that have been around for a long time; it is the most Complete Collection I know of.  Usual things, positive thinking, commitments,, planning, choices, friends, saving....but clearly written, very direct and convincing.  An excellent Bundle of Carnegie, Dyer, Hill, Robbins et al.  It has been a good review for me in my retirement.
B00006ADFL|4.0|KATE WINSLET'S Film debut in an over the top performance. Paired with MELANIE LYNSKEY (who was absolutely magnificent in her role), Two TROUBLED teens meet, BOND, create their own world and devise a plan (crime) to remain together. The story is written around a diary kept by the MELANIE LYNSKEY character of a grisly, premeditated murder (THAT REALLY HAPPENED).<br />Very definitely a PETER JACKSON movie (filmed in New Zealand).
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a fantasticly great book that I could read over and over again and it would stool interest me every time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have such a fun time with this game.  The dragons are so creative and cute.  I look forwards to watching my little island grow!
0062127241|5.0|First of all, I found this to be an incredibly quick read; I finished this 500+ page autobiography in about a week, an almost-unheard-of pace for me these days. Yes, I am a die-hard Who fan of 30 years, but I don't think you have to be particularly into Townshend or the band he plays guitar for to enjoy his highly articulate tale of his exciting, high-profile (how many other musicians can YOU think of that have played at Woodstock, Live Aid, and the Super Bowl?) life. There is a bit of a sense of life lived inside a bubble here (Pete knowingly quotes from his composition \\"Eminence Front\\" (from The Who's [[ASIN:B0035QIYFE It's Hard (Remixed And Digitally Remastered)]] album) at the beginning of the final section of the book, presumably in reference to this), but Townshend's signature empathy for his audience keeps this from being as cloying as it usually is in celebrity bios. In sum, highly recommended for just about everyone.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Just seemed to be missing something though. I think it needed more pizazz...more oomph! All in all not bad though.
0375420525|4.0|This book arrived unbelievably FAST!  It's a beautiful book and was in good condition.  The price was right!  Read a review on Oprah.com that it was on a list of &#34;unforgettable&#34; books.  I'm looking forward to reading it... but have to finish one more novel first.  It's a scary looking book, so I need to be prepared to take a frightening ride.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This is worth watching...especially if you liked the 'alien' franchise. Supposed to be a prequel so I'll be curious to see next movies in tne series. Excellent cast.filming.special effects and story line.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Brave is the worst Pixar movie to date.  Not that it is a bad movie.  Far from it.  But it reeks like old time Disney fairy tales and the pace is much too slow.  For the first time, I am left wondering if the amazing creativity at Pixar will ever come back.
B009GENZ12|4.0|Great Movie, loved the Twist!The movie leads you in one direction while still keeping you on the edge! only until<br />the very end does it come clear!! its really a sleeper! Great Movie
B007HACDLK|5.0|In this newest installment in the Mitch Rapp series, Vince Flynn brings the storyline to the present day. I can appreciate getting caught up on Rapps history but I was longing for something in the here and now...Vince Flynn delivers in this; another fast-paced thriller.<br />This story of corrupt CIA insiders colluding with corrupt Pakistanis (supposedly our allies) smacks of the realism that we have come to suspect of the people that we have been forced to ally ourselves with in the war on terrorists...bin Laden hiding out in Pakistan, anyone?<br />Suffice it to say, with Rapps tenacious perseverance and his trusty BS detector, he makes the bad guys pay dearly and makes some unlikely allies along the way.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I often thought of my grandmother, who was a nurse in WWII & wouldn't talk very much about the war and the front lines. She often said she would have traded places with the girls at home. Wow, Ms. Morton made me feel like I part of the story.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Face it, this is the only behavioral analysis (criminology) show that has an extremely written storyline, and last this many seasons.<br /><br />The stories are getting more intense and the criminals are advancing to the level of disturbing. I have been interested in criminologies and psychology, I do find this series very exciting to watch.<br /><br />Again, as what I have mentioned in other reviews, I hope there will be more seasons to come.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works as advertised. just what you expect from a free calculator. a a a a a a a a a great
B0054JELS4|5.0|I got to know this series thanks to amazon.com.<br /><br />The story lines are good and getting better from season 3 onwards, the characters are unique in their own way.<br /><br />And who can forget Bert the Farting Hippo?<br /><br />Highly recommended
B005L38QK2|4.0|Like the feel and movement, but wish the additional buttons were in a different location. I still needed a new mouse, and it certainly fits the bill as a quality mouse, but I was looking for more of the additional benefits from having more buttons easily accessible.
B0053O89IS|5.0|My wife and I have been following Bones since season 1 and we loved it very much. The stories are well written, cliff hangers are really heart pounding and best of all, the chemistry among the casts is definitely excellent since season 2 and we can see them grow.<br /><br />The props, yes, corpses, that are in various level of decomposition (often boney), are highly realistic, in fact to the extent of funny. We sometimes watch this show over meals. No appetite was lost.<br /><br />Season 7 is interesting as usual, with a little twist or addition to the casts. The return of various equally 'whacky' interns is also welcome.<br /><br />If I want to 'complain' about this season, it is because of the short season, which is inevitable.<br /><br />I look forward for more seasons to come!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to everybody, provided they do not get grossed by the excellent props
B0083IQFEG|2.0|Yes, Azealia Banks is the current Hip-Hop hype! Yes, her musical release are highly anticipated. Yes, it's cool that she's available on vinyl. BUT charging the FULL price of a LP/CD for only 4-song EP?! That ain't fire.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I purchased this just to add it into my library as I have watched it in cinema.<br /><br />Picture quality is typical of Blue-ray and definitely a good buy
B003RT0NK8|5.0|This is hands down one of the best sci fi movies in the past 10 years. Highly recommend it! Music is amazing too!
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is a fantastically fun platforming game. Game play is very fluid yet precise; I would say that it is very similiar to the gameplay of Super Meat Boy, n (the ninja game), Fancy Pants Adventures, etc. It has a great 8 bit style with a cool chiptune soundtrack.<br />Controls work very well, though I would still prefer to play this game with a physical controller.<br /><br />One neat trick the game uses is that whenever you die in a level (and you will be dying a lot - this is a precise platformer) on your next attempt your previous failure is played back by a shadow character on screen. This is a neat effect similiar to what Super Meat Boy does on level completion, but instead of all of your attempts being played back as a replay, those attempts (looks like maybe just the previous 8 or 10) are played back realtime while you are trying to complete the level still. If the replays get too overwhelming you can quit the level and reopen it to clear out all of your failures. Your best time replay will always be present as a dim white ghost, which helps with making time runs.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the app is that when I complete a level, the game seems to freeze up for several seconds before showing the results page. For example, I'll run up and attack the professor, his head flies off and then stops in mid air as everything freezes. (sometimes the music keeps playing, sometimes not) Several seconds later the results page pops up, the prof's head finishes its flight before exploding (w/ sound effect), the music starts playing again, etc. This is not a big problem, it just gets annoying, especially when I complete a level in 9 seconds,then the game freezes up for 15 seconds before showing me the results and letting me try again or move on.<br /><br />I'm playing this game on a Motorola Droid X running Android 2.3.4
B009GENZKS|4.0|If you two hours to kill and you are feelinn nostalgic, this is a fun movie to watch.  It makes for an interesting addition to the resident evil series, as well as bringing back classic characters like the lickers and Mr. X tyrants.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Its not a very good science fiction story.  When only 650 people are left on the Earth, you don't kill any of them.  It annoyed me
B009VB97EY|2.0|Absolutely no context of value.  I don't even think it was scintillating for the women<br />I watched it with.  Extremely boring at best.
B004I744AS|5.0|Best app I have ever gotten EVER!!! It is so much amazing than you think it is!!! It is far much more than a simple dictionary.<br />#1:You can translate. the word you are searching in more languages than you can count.<br />#2:it gives you many things to do like: Play a game of hangman, it shows your horoscope, it gives you an article of the day, temperature in your area, you can do a spelling bee,  or look at a time of history has happened today.<br />#3: All who have a Kindle Fire, it works fantastically.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Tinkerbell is one of my daughters favorite. This movie actually puts a good spin on the normal story of Tink.
0547884591|4.0|I was more interested in the meta learning, but now that I am about 10% into the book I am getting excited about cooking.  I also read parts of the 4 hourbody and this book seems to follow a similar format.  It is a \\"choose your own adventure\\" style writing so people that say it skips around are accurrate.  It could be several books in one.<br /><br />True.  Tim likes to embelish a bit on successes and I believe his intentions are always pure and on a larger scale to help humanity.  The Slow Carb Diet is probably one of the most effective and healthy diets available.  You can only benefit from reading this book.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|There were funny parts; however, you saw them in the previews. The movie was highly predictable and as usual had distasteful jokes.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is a great addition to any CD collection.  I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes this artist.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|The movie was decent. However, the hype didn't really fit the movie. At some points, it seemed more B-movie-ish and gore. When Ms. Lincoln was \\"old\\", the make-up was horrible.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This is a great gift ideal for anyone who loves this series.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|I can't stop listening to this. When I first got it I was looking for a bit more of an A HA sound but on his own he is a bit different.<br />His voice is truley amazing .
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is a great gift ideal for anyone who loves this series.  I would highly recommend this DVD. Also great addition to any DVD collection.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|This product Amazon Fire HD does not work as promised. I tried with 3 customer reps and went through their help and direction to use the apps and to utilize directions to download apps though security and confirm by utilizing \\"unknown sources.\\" It doesn't work! Lucky for me, I didn't have to pay for a couple of these apps I ordered.  However, the customer support team still doesn't know the product or the device of the Kindle Fire HD as they are asking questions themselves among each other to see if anything works and I went through many hours to find out about this.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is a great CD addition to any CD collection for anyone who likes this artist.  I would highly recommend this CD.
0525952926|5.0|I loved this Book Two in the Century Trilogy and am looking forward to reading Book Three. Entertaining and intelligent writer.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|My boys are 7 and 10.  They are huge fans of both Lego and Star Wars.  This seems like the perfect choice for a Christmas present for the whole month! Last year the Star Wars Advent calendar was a big hit.  I was lucky and a sale allowed me to buy them at a reasonable price.<br /><br />This year, I saw the Star Wars 1-3 movie characters/ships and knew my boys would love them.  Though, I have to admit, I nearly fainted when I saw the price.  Though I love my children and enjoy their happy faces, the price was a considerable issue since i need 2 of them.  With no raises in a few years and rising costs, it just was something I could not justify.<br /><br />A couple weeks later, I was lucky enough to find a half price option.  For that amount, I am willing to buy this set for my boys.  Otherwise, I don't feel it is worth the price.<br /><br />Summary:<br />for the pure joy of Legos and Star Wars-5 stars<br />value for the money, taking into consideration the number of parts/figures and lack of exclusivity or rare items-2 stars (unless you can get this at a significant discount like I did)
0446580848|5.0|Another winner by Nelson DeMille.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one as I have all the others I have read. Thanks.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My granddaughters aren't the only ones who love this movie.  I also enjoy watching it with them.  Lots of fun.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Love Dexter!!  I hope they keep making the series--what more can I say?  Michael C Hall is one of my faves.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Another great season of SOA. You can't go wrong. Even if  you're not a fan, you will be as soon as you understand the underworld of these characters. I watch ever season and was thrilled to be able to get this on Amazon before it was released on DVD.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She is a very talented woman and I love to hear her sing!  Easier to buy online than have to go to a store to get it.
B009ME47H2|4.0|I am still playing with it and learning it.  I have not figured out yet how to apply it, but I know it will be useful.
B009X01C64|5.0|Putting the 8.9\\" Kindle Fire in this case required a little extra \\"oomph\\" to get it in, but that's because the surrounding material is a little more dense and not flexible as it surrounds your Fire.  I think that is a good thing, as you want the material to be protecting your Fire in case of a drop, etc.  The Fire fits very snug, and you shouldn't have much apprehension in believing your Fire will be secure.<br /><br />This is a quality case and the leather feels good, and is well-padded all the way around which is an added protection layer to protect your Fire.  The cover closes tight, and I don't think you will have to worry about the cover flopping open at an inopportune time like you can with cheaper covers.<br /><br />Having the Fire stand up at an angle for better viewing of the screen, for videos as an example is pretty easy and there are three notches in the opposite end of the cover so you can choose / select the best viewing angle for whatever you may be doing.  The backing mechanism to the Fire itself is a little stiff on the swivel and only rotates 180 degrees vs. a full circle: I don't see that as a problem but thought I would mention it in case that was important to any of you.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a quality case and will do a good job to protect your Fire.  It's a little pricier than other covers, but I think at the end of the day you want a quality product protecting your $500+ investment instead of scrimping a few bucks on something that may not do as good of a job.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor. There is something special about her. She speaks well, is beautiful, can sing and she is only 22. I think she will have a long career.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Even though I haven't heard this set yet and won't be buying it anytime soon I still couldn't bring myself to give less than 5 stars.<br />I have the stereo and mono remasters and I love the sound quality. I also have the USB set and it's outstanding. To my ears the mp3  @ 320 sounds as good as the cd's, but the FLAC blows everything else away.<br /><br />My reason for no longer wanting to buy this set is that there are far too many complaints of poor quality. It looks like EMI farmed out the work to the lowest bidder. They never respected us fans in the past so this comes as no surprise. If Paul and Ringo don't want to see the Beatles legacy ruined because of record company greed they are gonna have to step in to oversee future releases and there will be more to come. You can count on it. In a few years when sales of the remasters slow down enough there will be a new box set to sell us the \\"new and improved\\" stereo catalog. This time we will get the music remixed.<br /><br />As of now I think I may have to wait a year or two before buying this latest attempt at ripping us off. The first pressing is an obvious failure, not that they care. After the second or third run maybe they'll get it right. The greed at EMI never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />Updated 11/27 -- see comments.
1442359315|5.0|This is probably the most &#34;concrete&#34; account of life after death I have ever read.  It has tremendous credibility due to the fact that Dr. Alexander himself is a neurosurgeon and did not believe in such things before he had his own NDE.  When he did, his views and life changed radically.  Dr. Alexander also suggests that we all become more aware of the spiritual beings we are and provides resources of just how to do this.  I have read this book over & over and truly enjoy it evert time I do.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|This is a fantastic story!! There is action, sorrow, joy with a great resolution which reflects a real life solution.
0895260131|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book!  It is eye opening to say the least.  And it is easy to read.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I was looking for something simple to de-stress and generally stop thinking. This fit the bill well. Acting was  just OK, but you really don't watch these superhero blockbusters for the acting. Action sequences, big booms, all requisite for the genre with  some funny quips added in for good measure. It was fun without  expectations.
B0086700CM|5.0|I suggest u do buy it because it is a very very awesome and fun game its way better than temple run brave and its VERY addicting BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|It wasn't great by any means. Too much love story and not enough action.  Like most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days, it's either just OK or totally stinks.  This was close to stinking .
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I expected it to be extremely cheesy and it turned out much better than expected. Special effects weren't too bad. I originally turned it down in theatres because of the plot, but now I wish I had seen it in theatres because it was actually pretty good.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|not particularly a comic book fan, so i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this movie.  i learned a lot about the Marvel superheroes!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Good read for a bit of fun, made for plenty of interesting conversation around the coffee table with the girls.  Can't help but wonder if the young girls of today think this is the norm. lol.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The fact that the DVD doesn't get all the features of the Blu-Ray is lame!  I understand that SOME Blu-ray features require the Blue-Ray technology, but give us the freaking Making Of videos.<br /><br />And although I have only seen this movie twice prior to buying it,  the movie is only Very Decent, as opposed to the Mind-Numbingly Awesomesauce most people were expecting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids ages 2 and 4 absolutely LOVE this app!!! Thanks! I even spend countless hours playing play this with the kiddies on their kindle. Downloaded on my mobile device too.
0547884591|5.0|As a 26yr old who had no cooking experience, this took me to new heights and in the the week the book has been out, i have already created over 14 dishes! People like to be around the guy cooking good food!<br /><br />Thank you Tim for this stepping stone into a new world. Not just in the kitchen but in life!
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Since the dead of Data in the last movie saving Picard, et al at the hands of Shinzon, we knew Data was going to return because he had downloaded his memories into his slow brother B4. Contrary to other recent Star Trek resurrections (i.e.,Janeway), David Mack does an outstanding job developing the story and providing a final outcome that within the realm of sci-fi is completely plausible and intelligent. Mack's writing is solid as always and can't wait to read the continuation in the second book.
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is simple, entertaining and makes the time pass quickly. I am in my sixties and this game does not require a lot of dexterity but enough to keep the user on his toes. I would recommend it to my friends of any age.
0547884591|5.0|I love to just learn. I like picking books up and getting something out of them. Whether it's learning something about myself or actually learning how to do something. This book does not disappoint. You can actually do both with this book. The best part of this book for me, is Tim's story telling. He REALLY knows how to make it interesting, and funny. Love the guy. (One goal in my life - meet Tim in person and be able to chat with him for a few.) Anyway - well worth the money, and your time! mb
B002TXZSLM|5.0|I love the leap frog approach of one story followed by another theme. Great author, easy to relate to with real life stories
B008QE9XD2|4.0|When it comes to the world of Sparkly Vampires that walk about in the day time a fellow like me just wants to Trash a Wal-Mart every time the names Bella or Edward are mentioned.<br />When remembering the Vampires of my youth I often fantasize about Lestat stalking a tender teen into an alley and just as he's about to put the &#34;BITE&#34; on she says &#34;But your not SPARKLEY&#34;.<br />. Which brings me to Dark Shadows. As a child I would peddle my bike home after school to watch the daily adventures of Barnabas, Victoria and The Collins Clan and years later watched every episode of the NBC Prime time reboot so needless to say I was looking forward to the Tim Burton spin. This where my problems lies. I loved it. However I am not sure weather I loved it because it was a good movie or that I was so caught up in the idea of a Dark Shadows for the 21st century and I could not be objective. For that reason I could not give Dark Shadows 5 stars. That being said I loved the casting Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, Michelle Pfeiffer  and Eva Green give extremely entertaining performances, I can't say brilliant ( Get real we're talking about a Vampire Movie) although there is something about watching Depp and Haley they bring always bring wonderful nuance to all of their roles. Now don't look for a Jonathan Frid 1960's gothic soap style because this Film does not have it. The difference between Dan Curtis and Tim Burton is Quantum and the &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; is definitely Burton's UNIVERSE with all the quirky twists we have come to expect from him. However none of the flashes of brilliance you might get from an &#34;Edward Scissorhands&#34; instead the watcher is left with the nagging impression that the &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; project  was a much wanted toy that Misters Burton and Depp wanted to have but then got bored with. From the Box Office Response I am guessing I was not the only one who got that impression.  I wanted this film to start a wave of&#34;Barnabas Mania&#34;. It didn't. There was enough to keep an old die hard fan like me engaged but for those with a backlog of memories The film may fall short of expectations and for those unfamilier they may not get it. In short Dark Shadows is flawed but like a cinimatic equivalant of a Reeces Peanut butter cup  not memorable, not gourmet but really enjoyable while you are consuming it.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Every song is memorable as is the person singing. I wish I had ordered the CD so that there would be more information on the songs and their origination. However, this was an easy way to go and I can now listen on my PC and my tablet. Even if you are not a Susan fan, you will lover her renditions of these songs.
B00AAOQINE|3.0|This season of How I Met Your Mother has been a slow burn, but I feel the last few episodes, while not being as good as any of the series best, have begun to step it up. This installment is no different with a good Barney story line and okay stories from Marshall and Ted.<br /><br />If you were hoping this episode would provide immediate answers to the questions raised at the end of the last episode you will be disappointed, as that is hardly addressed in this episode. However without spoiling anything, the episode does end with a scene that directly addresses Barney's dilemma at the end of the last episode. This is really only their for setup though.<br /><br />All in all not much happens, but there are some funny laughs and some setup for what could be a great next episode.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This film is entertaining,  and thoughtful. Dame Judi's blog in the movie should be listened to carefully. She has great wisdom and humor. The colors and sounds of Jaipur are real and engaging.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Glad I watched it, good entertainment.  This movie includes some of my favorite headlining actors but not a particularly surprising plot.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A relatively quick read, and a fun and entertaining book, particularly for those a little more plugged into modern technology.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it's. really fun to play. I like all the different animals you can buy. I wish the levels were easier to get to.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Small package - Big results.  Does exactly what it says.  I love it, posting old photos from negative online for entire family to enjoy.

B0042RJWTC|4.0|...on the first two disks, when we can't read them. But not too many and the series itself is, of course, fantastic.
B006ZCWTXS|4.0|I am not a professional product rater which so often appears to be what shows up on Amazon, just a regular customer.  Saw her perform on the Graham Norton show and I really love her voice.  I listen to a very wide range of music and would definitely say this is worth buying.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|You'll get some enjoyment out of their latest effort. There are at least three hitworthy repeats. They should definitely continue.
B008J34466|3.0|I am not a professional product rater which so often appears to be what shows up on Amazon, just a regular customer.  I would not say this is her best album but it's pretty good.  I would say its worth buying.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Although it's a VERY adult story with subject matter to match, the nudity is not Blake Lively's. The new presentation of Kick-Ass' Aaron Johnson is really cool. I actually love him in this. And can't lose with Taylor Kitsch.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|One of the best animation movie I've ever watched... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
B0098VYCCE|2.0|If you like repetitive Kristen Stewart affectations you'll be fine with this. Casting rather stinks but the art directions, effects and wardrobe are stunning enough to make up for it. Watch it with the sound off.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Heartwarming movie for the whole family! Some parts may be scary for small children but all in all..Great job Disney!!
B009LIQ5FQ|5.0|If you want a one word review of this concert video the word would have to be \\"FUN\\" no question about it.  This video captures a Pogues show quite well showing the band and the crowd having a raucous good time!  We were lucky enough to see the Pogues here in Chicago about a year ago and this truly does capture the energy in the room during a Pogues show.<br /><br />For those of you that follow the Pogues you'll know that frontman Shane MacGowan likes to have a little bit of the whiskey before the shows, sometimes causing him to miss the performance and sometimes making him pretty incoherent on stage.  While all of that adds to the charm and the mystique of the Pogues if you ask me here, for a night in Paris, Shane is in fine form.  There are times during the show where you catch another band member's reaction to what Shane is doing on stage and there are smiles all around.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent and the shots and cuts all make sense.  We have all seen concert footage where the director thinks his job is to jump from camera to camera with no apparent rhyme or reason and that, thankfully, is not the case here.  Even with this video being pushed out the door a few weeks after the concert the end result is a quality product.  The sound quality is excellent and should be turned up until it is making your speakers shake.<br /><br />The crowd shots here are a whole lot of fun.  If you've never been to a Pogues show you might be surprised that a mosh pit is a regular sighting at the front of the stage and here in Paris is no different.  The crowd is banging around, people are crowd surfing and overall having a damn good time.  The Pogues music is all about fun and the fans react to it.<br /><br />The musical selection here is pretty standard for a modern Pogues set, it really plays as a greatest hits type of show and I think that is exactly what the fans want.  Shane gives up the mic for a few songs giving Spider Stacy and Andrew Ranken a chance to lead the best Irish Punk band in the land.<br /><br />Overall I have to highly recommend this to anyone that likes the Pogues and to anyone that likes good music whether it be Irish Punk or anything under the sun.  I love Shane and I love the Pogues and this video had me smiling from beginning to end.  This concert video is a whole lot of fun and shows the absolute joy the Pogues have making their music and their fans have listening.the best Irish Punk band in the land.<br /><br />Overall I have to highly recommend this to anyone that likes the Pogues and to anyone that likes good music whether it be Irish Punk or anything under the sun.

B006YM9JSW|5.0|I have been building computer systems for friends, family and myself for over 20 years now and have quite a bit of experience due to that. I really love this processor for more than its obvious power.<br /><br />Pros -  It came with an attachment (which it just so happens I did not need - lucky me, right!) to mount it to just about any motherboard that may not have the appropriate locking bars. Additionally it came with a heat sink which I was not expecting but perhaps I missed in the item description. Did I mention it has amazing power right out of the box with no need to overclock! I almost always overclock my CPU's to get some extra power, but after running this one I have seen no need to do this. Plus, I got this on sale so that was an added bonus!<br /><br />Cons - not really much of a con because it is pretty standard for these things not to come with this, but there was no thermal compound included for mounting my heat sink/CPU fan to the CPU.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a pretty neat game.  Everything in the city is linked in some sort of way just like real life.  There is only one flaw I have with this game and its how slow your energy regenerates.  Other than that its a cool game to have.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Does what it says it will do! Turns out I did not even need to order this as Cooler Master Case came with some thermal compound! But I went ahead and used this one anyways!
B008YRVW0I|3.0|this is an ok game because i bet this game i one days worth and so the levels dont get any harded
0547884591|5.0|I think this might be the first review I've written on Amazon, and Im not even a friend of Tim's.  I am however, a HUGE Tim Ferriss fan.  My friends are tired of me talking about him.  Call me an early adopter, I read the [[ASIN:B006X0M2TS The 4-Hour Work Week]] as soon as it came out, I pre-ordered [[ASIN:B007C5PO0W The 4-hour Body]], and this one, [[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]].  As I started talking about it this week my friends say that I will rave about anything Tim writes.  That isn't true.  I actually thought about not getting this one, $30+ and 600+ pages, and I already know how to cook, why would I buy it?<br /><br />This is his best yet.  Seriously.  It fills in the voids of the other books.  I am already working on learning Spanish and the recipes he breaks down are, so far, delicious.<br /><br />Some people are saying that the book is unfocused.  I can see why someone would think that at first glance.  But, I don't think they get it.  Tim is clear, up front, it is not a cookbook.  It is a book about learning, using cooking as the main example.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book of recipes, you are looking in the wrong place.  If you are looking for a book with the tools to learn almost anything, Spanish, skinning a cat, and cooking a baby seal, than you found the right book.  See, Tim doesn't spell out any of the afore mentioned skills.  However, he has given me the starting points on all three and the skills to improvise and be successful.<br /><br />I read these reviews sometimes and think that it is just the author or company having someone write some rave review.  I am still yet to meet Tim, and I have nothing to do with him or his products.  I'm just a bloke who has lost weight, gotten stronger, worked less and made more money because Tim spells out the truth.  You have to apply it.
B00684J49U|5.0|Excited to see my daughters reaction to this gift. She has all the other seasons so this will complete her set.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I am impressed! Never would have thought of Abraham Lincoln becoming a vampire slayer. Awesome computer graphics, action packed and I didn't yarn once. I viewed this movie several times all because it's good! This movie is good only if you can remove what you learned in school about Lincoln. It's a treat and a sidetrack from normal action pack movies.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Everything about this movie works and works well. The acting, the character design, the plot, the action scenes, and the soundtrack are some of the best I've ever seen for a summer blockbuster. All of the actors sold their characters and made us not only believe that they were who they were portraying, but also showed us why these characters were part of the Avengers in the first place. Loki is a great villain. Mark Ruffalo's take on Bruce Banner turned out to be one of the best decisions Marvel Studios has made with these movies so far. The fights are action-packed, funny, and full of tension and thrills. What few complaints I do have are minor: Captain America's costume looks odd, I'm not sure why the shadowy organization of people hiding in shadows was there, and I don't think Colbie Smulders as Maria Hill got enough screen time. Other than that, loved this movie and loved this release. It's got all kinds of cool bonus features and the picture quality is amazing. Definitely one to put in everyone's collection ASAP.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is all Emily VanCamp. The acting she delivers is amazing. Her looks - even the way she walks - are refreshing. The show is a hit. I hope we will see Ms. VanCamp playing in the big screen and earning more than the $55,000/episode she makes now.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|A laid-back rendition of classics as only Reod can do.  A great Christmas listening piece for the holidays for you to enjoy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great characters, story lines but most of all the historical backdrop is superb!!!<br />Ken Follett has the magic touch to create an entertaining novel filled with historical data.<br />A true pleasure to read and so  glad it was  an ebook because is it over 1000 pages.
B008Y1NY14|4.0|Quick overview for CSS and version differences and support options. Easy read and much to think about.<br />Nice History and forecasting where this might lead.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started this series after Dark Tower, Excellent read that will keep you up night after night. You will not be disappointed
B003SNJYSK|5.0|I love Scandinavian crime stories and this one ticked all the boxes, though you have to be patient to get into the story (for me about 1/3 of the book).
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Continues to be a great read but sooner or later certain characters need to get back to where they are attempting to reach. It gets tiresome when every time they are almost to their destination they are taken by someone new and well....you get the idea. Dont want to spoil it but for God sakes, enough is enough. LOL
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Great app that keeps my 4 year old entertained and busy. He loves to take care of all the sick animals and keep the hospital clean. He has a great time!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have truly enjoyed this series thus far. Cant wait to see what happens. Very exciting and hard to put down.
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|This movie was your average vampire movie but was still really good. I was surprised that an obvious low budget film was so good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple to use. Always there. Does everything I need. I am in a retail establishment and there are never enough calculators around. But with my Kindle by me all the time I have this app and Cal it right up. always there when I need it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This series is definitely not like real life and a little hardcore so don't read it if you can't handle some crazy sex but the story line is pretty good.
B005XI9456|5.0|My 12-year-old daughter was ecstatic to receive this.  She loves JB and hasn't stopped listening to this since we purchased it.
B000OY8NII|5.0|This show no matter what season you watch is really good. Once you watch this first season your hooked and need to watch the others.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally a Pinterest app for the Android!  Easy to use, stable, and makes it easier to surf my newest favorite site.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This series is kinky but the story line is pretty good. Wish there was a little more to the end of the story though.
B0091LS07E|5.0|\\"Girl On Fire\\" is an excellent new album from Alicia Keys. The piano instrumental \\"De Novo Adagio\\" is so smooth and enchanting.\\"Girl On Fire\\" is the title track.  It reminds me that women can have it all.  This song empowers me as a man, that is how moving this song is.  Alicia proves that she is a girl on fire with this song.  \\"New Day\\" is my other favorite song.  It has a positive message and a great beat.  This is one of those songs that can change my outlook on life.  \\"When It's All Over\\" is groovy jam that reminds me to live for today and not worry about tomorrow. \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" is a very relaxing song.  This song makes me forget all my problems.  I could listen to thos song all day \\"Brand New Me\\" is a song that features lovely piano playing.  This song reminds me that I have power to transform my life.  \\"Not Even The King\\" is a pretty song that reminds me that true love is priceless.  \\"Tears Always Win\\" is about missing a loved one. \\"Fire We Make\\" is a song about creating that special fire with someone.  These two songs are probably the most soulful on the entire album. \\"That's When I Knew\\" is a song about that special moment when people first fall in love. These songs are very smooth and soulful. \\"Limitedless\\" is a song that gets me on my feet.  This song has the same spirit of a belly dance song. This song makes me feel spiritual. \\"101\\" is a pretty song that expresses elements of frustration and hope in a relationship. I love this new album.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have read some better authors but for the kind of book it is the author did a good job. It is kinky and not at all like real life but it is a fun read.
0141033576|5.0|This book is absolutely enthralling! I wasn't pulled in so forcefully by the first few chapters, but as the book digs deeper into the human psyche, the momentum of intrigue it holds over the reader builds upon its well of insight as to just how flawed our intuition, perception, and memories can be, and how illusive it is to factor important statistical concepts such as chance, correlation, and regression into the outcomes we judge. These revelations, once learned, help every reader discover how to approach decisions and conclusions in a more cautious and humbled manner through the awareness of a whole volley of hidden biases we use as mental shortcuts. It has profoundly changed my thought processes and the level of confidence I have in assessing situations. This is extremely valuable to me as an engineer and as a person. The world would be a much brighter place if every person with an important decision to make was precedently empowered by the wisdom of these pages. It is useful enough to read cover to cover more than once, and as it upends many conventions and assumptions that you probably adhere to today, a second read will most certainly help drive the point home towards a practical working knowledge of just how we think, fast and slow.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books, most of them when I was immobile after knee surgery a few years back. This one I could not put down. I like to stretch my reading of new books from my favorite authors out a bit because they only come out once a year, usually. Wasn't happening with this one. Had to finish it.
B008RYN44U|4.0|I was so excited to see one of my Favorite Bands reunite again. After hearing Settle Down and Push and Shove, I was like yes!<br />I will say I was a bit surprised after hearing the entire album that the tracks were slow. Anywho...I love this band and it makes me smile to hear new music fast or slow by them I like. Fan for life!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A stunning and convincing argument from a very well prepared neurologist. A must read on a subject that nobody escapes!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Hardy candy is sweet to my ears. I liked Madonna, love her since this ablum and Confessions on the Dance Floor.<br />Tracks I just can't get out of my head.... Dance 2 Night, Give It To Me and The Beat Goes On. I love the album as<br />a whole, but when I heard those tracks I was like her sugar is sweet. Fives stars not enough!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book but I did not like the ending.  I would recommend it.Gone Girl A Novel was an easy read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following many artists on YouTube over the years, even before Google Purchased it. But this is the first time I have come across an artist that I liked enough to purchase their music and not just one song but the album. These men are remarkable with their talent. Every song is a new Journey into music itself and brings back the true feeling of being immersed in music.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|So Amazon makes a tablet now... this ISN'T the way to motivate people to buy it.<br />Amazon, you just made me jump through flaming hoops to get your app on my Nexus 7, so you've lost all tablet sales and recommendations from me (&#34;the tech guy in the family&#34;), and you get one star, as it's now clear this is bogus.<br /><br />For EVERY other Android device I have, I went to the Google Play store, and installed the Amazon Mobile app.<br />On the Nexus 7, Amazon has marked the app as &#34;not compatible with this device&#34;.  But it is! And you control that.<br /><br />NEXUS 7 OWNERS:<br />To get it, I had to first side-load the Amazon App store by downloading it from Amazon via their website (really), THEN once that was installed, I could download Amazon Mobile from the Amazon App Store - and it works 100%. Of course most people won't do this... (I would have installed this app months ago, thought it wasn't possible myself)<br />...so on their behalf, Amazon (and for disrespecting me and my time), you get one star.

B001XVD21Y|1.0|We turned it off after 30 minutes, which was too long. My fault for not reviewing other comments about the language in the film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great visibility and ease of use. Not too many functions. You can see the equation you just did below your total which is helpful and convenient. When you just need to do some quick math this is the calculator for you!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With all the attention this book was getting, I was very excited to finally own it. I found it repetitive, poorly written and lacking in imagination. But then again, there may be something wrong with my boyfriend and me.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This stuff works great, when building a computer. It is used in our house hold when<br />building or just up dating one of our computers. Why change when you have something<br />that works great!
B00846TTDG|4.0|Very graphic. A look inside at the life of these special men. The movie was very real. My husband really enjoyed it.

B0090EHVMC|4.0|This review is from: Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (Amazon Instant Video)<br />Environmentally friendly message for kids well executed. I did enjoy the story even though it was a bit predictable. But for my grandkids is just the perfect movie.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|i still think the first one is the best but as long as you're not expecting an oscar-winning movie and just want something to laugh at, then this is the movie to watch!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Great action from begining to end. I liked seeing all my favorite action heroes in one place.<br />Worth watching again.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Some new and different songs here as well as some of the usuals.<br /><br />If you're an RS fan, you'll like it.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed his rendition of &#34;Auld Lang Syne&#34;.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|It is one of his best albums ever, considering that he has over 50 albums it is one of my favorites.  I pre-ordered and it was there exactly when they said it would be.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this app has many great features. I love that I can access my notes from my phone, laptop, or kindle fire without any issues. there are some features that are complicated to access such as the personalized email which I still have not found, but overall this app is great for the projects that I use it for!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Another season full of episodes that I will enjoy watching over and over again.  Now that I have all 5, the only problem I have is in finding time to watch them all.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a huge John Grisham fan and have read everything he has written to date, including Playing For Pizza and Skipping Christmas which are certainly a departure from what I like most from him. I did like both of those stories and found them quite entertaining. Although The Racketeer was fiction, it was too obviously fiction, sort of unbelievable and hard to buy into. Not his best work, in fact possibly his weakest in my opinion.  Thank you!
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Great musicianship and another addition to my growning collection.  The fab four definitely has what it takes, and will enjoy blaring this album from the speakers of my car with the top off!!!
B0041D843M|4.0|I just received it recently and just started reading it. So far great information and it is captivating to read. Ask me more<br />when I finish.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I really tried to get into it. I read almost 3 chapters and could not keep track of any of the characters, tribes, places, etc. It's been a long time since I haven't finished a book and this one was a waste of money. Now I have no intention of seeing the movie.
B000001ED1|5.0|I already have had this cd for 16 years. The friend I gave it to loves joan and this cd.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|My wife is collecting EVERYTHING that has to do with the twilight series.  This is the easiest and cheapest way to do it
B008WCP2PG|1.0|the worst movie I have ever seen! The story is predictable. The acting is terrible. Half of the movie looks like it was shot on a home video camera. Do not buy it!
B008VBYN80|3.0|game is fun. dissapointed on the push to spend real money.makes game play difficult. haven't even really started and already expected to spend a fortune to play.
030726999X|5.0|Best 3 books I have read in fiction.  This was the last of the series.  I recommed all three books highly.
0446310786|5.0|The book is new and it's what I'd expected, so there isn't much more I can say about it! Thanks.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I am 73 years young.  I loved watching Magic Mike. It reminded me when I was in my thirtys and<br />went to Chippendales.......I loved Channing Tatum he is a great dancer and actor.Not just from this<br />film but other movies he has been in. And what can I say about Mathew McConaughey, he is a great actor, but to<br />see him do those sexy dance moves......was electrifying. I had a great time watching, laughing and saying to myself<br />I wish I could go back to &#34;chippendales&#34; and place those Dollars in their pants.<br />During the time of &#34;Sandy&#34; I had no T.V. for 17 days.......what kept me was watching this fun movie. Its important<br />to have a good collection of DVD's for times when you have no cable.
B0060D123K|5.0|Muppets, classic Christmas story, enough said! I watch this movie over and over again every holiday season.  It is the best.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|Great buy, excellent shipping, above all one of the most greatest movies of all time on movies making. Powerful heart and driven story. Worth the buy original quality meets the buyer.
0307352145|3.0|Had high hopes for this book and not sure what I expected but it read more,to me, as a textbook than anything else. Didn't finish it because it was a little boring and repetitive.
B008D37J6O|3.0|I downloaded it for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Video and Audio was not in sync while I was trying to play an HD video. However it was playing .flv files correctly. I am not satisfied on it's performance.
0547884591|5.0|I'm slightly biased because I've read both of his other works (4-Hour Workweek and 4-Hour Body) and taken a great deal from them.<br /><br />I'm about a quarter of the way through this book and so far its his best. I think the way he presents information in this book vs. his other two is more concise, and it can be used more like a reference than a novel (not that you shouldn't read it cover to cover. You'd be amazed at what you learn!).<br /><br />If you haven't read the other two yet, start here. I think it's an easier read overall, and like I already stated, you can read something quickly, go test it, and apply it to your life.<br /><br />Too much fun!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very good app with many features on weather forcast, news items, tips and satalite maps as well.
B008NW67E0|4.0|The largest criticism of this CD is that it's too much like their debut. That is very true, but I also think it works. If you liked Sigh No More, there is no real logical reason do dislike Babel, because they are the same sound. I would say, however, that Babel has more energy and punch to it. Well worth it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the large numbers, makes it easier on us &quot;older&quot; ladies!  I use it to add up my bills and balance my checkbook.  And the fact that it was free to download made it even better!!
1401233791|2.0|The Knightfall story line is certainly dynamic and important to the Batman mythos, but the fact is this just isn't an interesting read. It hasn't aged well.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Took you long enough. The first time I tried to buy the 3D version of this movie, it cost $175.00. Are you kidding me. It's been out for what 3 years. Get serious. I do like the movie. Visually stunning. You almost forget where really stops and animation starts.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent read! Mr. Grisham does not disappoint with this book! Loved the fast pace of the story. Kept me totally hooked from the very first page. Couldn't wait to jump on the eliptical every morning just to see what was going to happen next!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I especially liked the interviews and stories on the last disc. No down side that I can think of. I definately recommend this disc set of &#34;Dr. Who&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A page Turner!  Couldn't put it down.<br />Now on to the next one... go Catnip!<br />Five more words are required?<br />Why ??
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|As I have a 3D Television, this is the perfect set. I'm not always at home with my 3D TV and Play Station 3 to watch 3D movies, hence the DVD disc. I love the special features.  Good quality product. I'm a big Marvel fan also.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Works perfectly fine with my Android Phone. At a glance I can see all my listed games, and it keeps me up to date on gaming news. Love it, Love it.
0316227706|5.0|Great book for dog lovers and animal lovers in general. People love looking at it when they come over, pictures are great and in high quality.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Should have read up on it more, This is not for cell Phones, pityfull, never again, Mahjong ancient escape is far better.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny movie!! I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but was instantly hooked.  Its one that I could watch many times over.
B009K45Y62|5.0|this is another badass movie...im sure they will continue with a new robin...it cant end...there are no words to describe it
0547884591|4.0|I'm just having fun reading this book! LOL It's not like any other book on cooking (or any other book on anything!) - it's all over the place but in a very fun and enjoyable way (for me at least). I am not a cook so the information is really valuable and I'm already putting some of it into practice! I highly recommend this book to anyone - not just those interested in cooking since there is SO much great information embedded throughout the book.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Criterion collection of Seven Samurai is excellent. the 2 disk package come with the movie it's self and a second disk with extras. It also comes with a production book with photos and articles relation to the movie. It is absolutley beautiful they did an excellent work on restoration. A definite for anyone's collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read this book a few times! and every-time I couldn't stop reading it! It sucks you in and you feel as though you know them personally.
6305949980|5.0|The item was the same as what it was described as. Great value for the money with the Special Edition!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is a classic and it makes me want to cry every time! It is a must have for any child at heart!
B006G3CFU8|5.0|Remember this movie from 2002 even though i was 42 at the time enjoyed then and now.<br />Good visiual effects.
B006RAFHFK|5.0|Great movie, lots of laugh....If you like Murphy and DeNiro, they make a great a pair. The two really compliment each other.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good story line with suspensfull twists. Entertaining and thought provoking. Makes you wonder if the Washington bureaucrats are really as described!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love the video. Have enjoyed the entire series to date but love to watch episodes more than once. Worth the money.
0064400557|4.0|Why read: It's a children's classic I had never read before.<br /><br />What impressed me: This is a nice, timeless story that easily teaches children about love, death and friendship.<br /><br />What disappointed me: I didn't find the story nearly as emotional as I was led to believe I would. I didn't really enjoy the writing either. It had a tendency to go on and on and on listing synonyms. While that may help the middle grade reader learn new words, it was annoying.<br /><br />Recommended: Yes. I believe this remains a story all children should read while they're young.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle brings me joy.  Her latest album, Standing Ovation, is beautiful.  In every song you hear her outstanding voice and the emotion she brings to each song.  I love the duets.  They are as classic as this wonderful new album. What a thoughtful Christmas gift this will be.
B009329Y30|4.0|I was not let down by this movie.  I like the story and Zac Efron.  Good chick flick for a cold night.
B008M34INW|5.0|Mel's character in this film reminds me of his character in the first Lethal Weapon. An on the edge vet doing things his way, getting hemded up, and in the end doing good. Plenty of action!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|It was cute and fun and exactly like the trailer, but I thought it would be a little more than that.  was not a waste.
B0092YRYBS|5.0|Great album! I love it, cant wait to see them next week, settle and sun are my favorite songs on the album
B009VB97EY|3.0|Channing Tatum is super handsome that's for sure, but the acting in this movie is not so great, in my opinion.  It's fun to watch and definitely eye candy but really lacks much else.
0061474355|5.0|I first read this book years ago and immediately fell in love with it. I reread it recently for a course in school and remembered why I thought it was so fantastic in the first place. The heroine Sabriel is easily relatable as someone who is trying to figure out who they are and where they belong.  It's a novel of growing up and making it on your own for the first tine, even though she feels completely unprepared from this transition from student to someone with responsibility.  All of the secondary characters are memorable, from Sabriel's father, to her teacher and to Mogget who is clearly more then he seems.  This book is a wonderful beginning to a great trilogy, it sucks you in and makes you want to find out how the characters journey ends.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Entertaining app for me and my kids.  addicting and easy to play.  glad that i got it, great time spender for sure!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie compares very favorably to the book!  The actors were well cast and characters were pretty much as I had imagined.  Looking forward to the sequal(s)!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Kids stay interested the whole movie!  was great movie to download and travel!  Kids were laughing and enjoying in the back seat
B0090NNQX6|5.0|I had been wanting to buy this CD for a couple of weeks but it was hard to find in stores, let alone the deluxe version! i'm the type of person that still collects the physical CD so this was a great find. it came super fast and the CD itself was completely new, wrapped and it's amazing. Great service!
B0076DELIG|5.0|My history with Harry Bosch has spanned over a decade (My first taste of this series was back in 2002 -- I remember because I bought the first six books in 2 omnibus, and at that time book 8th was just released) and every single time I get my hand on his story, I feel the same excitement as I did ten years ago. Bosch, for me, is simply one of the personal literary detectives. He wasn't perfect: he had flaws (one of them being that of prodigal detective, he easily made enemies left and right -- in this book, he butt-headed again with his boss and the person upstairs), he still learned how to be a good father for his (now) sixteen year old daughter. But Bosch had that determination that never waver, a sense of justice. I admired him for it.<br /><br />The case itself took life in a way that I couldn't even predicted. First, I thought it was related to some sort of war crimes, because Anneke was a Danish freelance reporter that cover war stories. Even until half-part, I still had no idea where the crime case would take me. When the truth was revealed, I felt sad for Anneke and her brother, who has waited for twenty years to find out what has happened to his sister. It was truly well-written plot -- by the pen of Michael Connelly.<br /><br />Aside from the case, I enjoyed reading about Bosch's personal life -- most notably with his daughter, Maddie. I loved that Maddie made that birthday dinner for Bosch. I'm not sure about parenting ways of teaching teenagers about guns; how shooting simulation could be an idea of a father-daughter activity, but this is a different culture than my own, so I couldn't really judge. I wasn't really sure about Bosch's love life, though, seemed that he couldn't really retained a personal relationship *smile*. On another note, I did wish Bosch could be slightly kinder to his younger partner -- but maybe Bosch was always better as a lone-wolf type of detective, anyway.<br /><br />Here, Bosch hinted that his DROP contract was for five years and with this book, he still had another four years coming. Could I really hope that meant that there would be at least four more books of Bosch? Though of course, I would always get the new Bosch, no matter how many books it will be...
1477419497|3.0|This book, \\"A Sea Change\\" was an interesting mystery and kept my attention throughout. Though it has some shortcomings it kept me reading and that is what is imposrtant, isn't it? I enjoyed it.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank author \\"Wesley's Ways\\" and \\"John Wesley, Natuural Man, and the Isms\\"
B008MZU8R0|5.0|The more I listen to it, the better it gets.  The last 4 or 5 tracks are the best but that's not to say the first few aren't good.  This is a really, really good album.  Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Clockwork Angels.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book should be read by every person under the age of (80) so they know first hand the cost of freedom.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This apocalyptic zombie book rules. Great read, in fact read it twice in a week. Great addition to the genre.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|What to say? Incredibly well-written? Check. Fully realized and complex characters? Check. Fascinating new magic system? Check. The only downside is that he leaves you hungry for more, and given the multiple other projects he juggles, there's no guarantee he'll be revisiting Shai anytime soon.
1932100660|5.0|Written as expected a little biased. The author cites many studies a copulation of 40 years of research.The opposite of diets that will kill you. Interesting studies on plant protein vs. animal protein. Want to know what causes cancer, diabetes and many other diseases studies to show proven results.  Warning this book may change your thinking and turn you into a Vegan.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I ENJOYED THE ACTION, HOWEVER THERE WERE A FEW SLOW PLACES.  OVERALL I FELT IT WAS ENTERTAINING. THE ENDING WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I EXPECTED.
B003O86FMW|1.0|This book is a waste of time! There is a lot of action and precious little literature between these covers. Poorly written, and exploitive.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|It is hard to believe that there are not more people in the group. Their sound is so rich and the arrangements are cool.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Extremely well written novel that takes it's story line from the headlines of a responsible news organization but uses humor to make the characters come alive.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She is amazing. I love the song selections. Sound is great and have enjoyed it immensely. I will buy other cd's by Adele.
1932100660|5.0|This is the most straightforward book on the relationship between diet and health I have ever read. After reading it, I immediatly went 100% Vegan. Two others where I work have as well after their read.  One of them participates in Ironman contests and I understand she is quite good.  My total cholesterol has dropped to 89 - yes that is the correct value.  My heart doctor dropped my Lipitor dose by 1/2.  No more ups and downs in my mood.  The China Study has changed my life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I used to make fun of my husband for watching this show.  I decided to watch an Episode with him and ever since, I've been hooked
B008WCP2KG|4.0|First, if you don't enjoy watching male strippers, this isn't for you.  The dance scenes bring much of this film's energy to the front so if you find male nudity to be tasteless or boring, you'll miss much of this film's charms.  That being said, the film's script and direction are just deep enough to keep this film from being eye candy alone but never so deep that the viewer who is watching for the eye candy is disappointed.  Sure, the film fell into some cliché with its plot.  (I could have done without the drug subplot). But the performances and the film's energy kept me interested until the end.  Like one could discount Saturday Night Fever by calling it a \\"disco\\" movie, one could easily discount this as a \\"male stripper chick flick\\".  But if you \\"get\\" what the film is trying to say about family and growing up, you might just enjoy this film on more than an aesthetic level.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. The whole story leaves you wanting more. I can't even begin to guess the next move any of the characters will make.
B0015AARJI|1.0|this item is NOT made by Sony like the picture shows, its a cheap off brand, that could have been picked up for less than half the price
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was a bit leary when I started to make this purchase but it has turned out to be the best one yet... in fact I even bought a second one as a gift. The sound is out-standing, comfort is great, recieving distance is good.  I bought these because I game alot but I move around to do other things at the same time and not having to take them on and off everytime I decide to run do something is priceless. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for freedom from wired headsets.  You can expect about 10 hour usage with a 2 hour recharge and yes you can use them while they are recharging... but that 2 hours you will be wired... (for them to hurry up because you are already spoiled - hehe!)  Thanks Logitech for a GREAT PRODUCT!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book ned to comeback with a clear Warning. It is a pervert pornografic piece of crap. It is not even worth 1 star. Don't waste your money on this horrible book.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is Rod at his very best.  The perfect Christmas music to enjoy all through the holidays.  Don't wait on this one!
B004I744AS|5.0|I love it. I read a lot of historical books and it helps translate the language. I like the options for word of the day, quote and this day in history.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a delightful movie, if a little goofy. It was heartening to see a young woman take her life into her own hands. The men were fairly sad in the way they were depicted.  It seems to me that a little more balance would be a good thing, not all smart and brave if female and not all stupid and clumsy if male. However that said, it was a breath of fresh air to see the heroine not have to go off into the sunset with a suitor.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Very pleased with the Star Wars version of Angry Birds. I bought it for the Kindle and can't keep other family members off my game!  Much more challenging than previous versions.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is the greatest series ever canceled. Its a great price and as usual prime is amazing. Recommend for even non Syfy fans
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the challenge trying to better my time and I like that I can pause it and come back later.  It gets to be very addicting.
B005BCE7FQ|3.0|great movie and the kids love it both in blu ray and 3d. i myself prefer it in blu ray.<br /><br />only 3star because the 3d disc has parts that skips even though there is no scratch in the disc.<br /><br />im not gonna bother returning or replacing.
0316069434|5.0|My copy of Connelly's new book hasn't arrived yet. i expected it today, 11/26 but no such luck. Hopefully it will be here by tomorrow. i love to read and if i don't have a book i tend to get a little loopy. Then i run off to get  a book at the book store or i read--again--a book i've read before.  Sometimes i think i spend as much money on books as some folks spend buying dope. i could spend hours in a bookstore. When i run out of room i donate some of my books to a library. Not any of Michael Connelly's or Nelson DeMille's or Daniel Silva's. i have all of theirs and i've read all of them at least twice.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|This movie truly brings the idea behind its book. I read it (almost to the last few pages) and I was able to go deeper into the mind of the characters and be able to follow along the movie. Some changes (every movie does it) but I think it is a movie that truly brings a different approach to SCI-FI and into science as well. It is a good mixture of well documented science and imagination.<br /><br />Matthew and Jodie makes a good team in this movie and James Woods plays a great &#34;Devil's Advocate&#34; character.
0446580848|5.0|There is always a lesson to be learned in books by DeMille--especiallyThe Lion's Game, The Lion, and The Panther. i was just so involved with the story line and how DeMille brings in characters fro his previous writings. Awesome story.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|If your a Deth fan and especially if you like live music then this is the set for you.<br />The albums remastering is terrific but even better is the live in San Francisco 1992 record, it sounds fantastic and it contains songs from their peak albums.<br />Get this now and enjoy one of the greatest American metal bands ever!
0385535147|5.0|Some of Grisham's books are so wonderful. A Time to Kill, The Chamber, and now The racketeer. Never would i have figured out the path the storyline was taking. i kept reading and reading. At the end i loved how Grisham said he did no research like he usually does. He just wrote and it turned out terrififc. i really liked this story.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These replaced a old pair of wireless stereo headphones. This pair is a gift to my son in law for christmas as he always wants to use mine when we watch a movie together. I have a pair in the basement for my Samsung 3D led tv and a pair in my bedroom to use in  the lazy boy when listening to streamed music from my country and rock W7 machines in the basement computer room. I have never owned better headphones. 7.1 surround sound is mind blowing with the bass boost feature I was not impressed with the X42 replacement headphones that have replaced this discontinued product. If you find X41's in the $160 dollar range, you should get them while you can!
B00735HGQ6|5.0|The book was quick read with time to reflect which is what the book is actually about - to reflect on life and your choices.
B007T7MIR0|3.0|It works fine as a pdf viewer.  Not quite as well as Adobe's but still ok.  Of course the price was right -- free.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just what I expected from the author.  If you have something else to do don't start this book.  Can't wait for the next one.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app. I use it a lot, but it should have an option to start on startup.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game except for sometimes on kindle fire controls don't register. I recommend temple run highly to anyone.
0316227706|5.0|I LOVED this book! The pictures are fantastic &  Laugh Out Loud Funny. Everyone who has looked thru the book has actuaqlly LOLed!!  Would highly recommend Underwater Dogs!!
B009DH371K|5.0|amazing concert and also quality, well everything Queen did with Freddie mercury (the greatest singer ever) its amazing, if you love real music i recomend this concert its a true live concert.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Perfect pre-precuel to Alien, good special efects and music.<br />Excellent Movie, great collector's edition with all the necesary: bluray disc and DVD.....
B009439HEY|4.0|Long story short...if you love the classic Genesis of the 70's, you'll probably love this.<br /><br />My question for anyone who already owns the CD set...there is a disruptive dead spot between Fly on the Windshield and Broadway melody 1974 (tracks 6 &7 on disc 1), instead of the smooth segue from the original Lamb album. I've played it on several players and get the same 2 second dead spot. Is my disc (or mastering process) flawed or is everyone else's the same way? It's a really annoying spot on an otherwise beautiful set of Genesis classic tracks. GRRR!!!
1451695187|5.0|It was great to read about someone who is a Neurosurgeon who believes!! Was an awesome account of what happened to him that even he can't explain except to say this life isn't the end!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I really love Amazon and all they do. I just wish this app displayed the sales ranking of items on their details page. This is a great and accurate app for basic usage.
0547884591|5.0|I am a huge fan of Tim Ferris! I tried to inspire my children to read the Four Hour Work Week as a blueprint for their careers. The Four Hour Body was a great book on hacking. Now the natural extension to the first two book The Four Hour Chef tells you how to do the rest. As always Mr. Ferris' writing style makes it easy to read but not so much so that you feel like you are being talked down to. His examples and explanations are both entertaining as well as informative. You can quickly see that this book was thoroughly researched and the information inside is equally or more valuable than the first two books. Another Great Book from Tim Ferris!<br /><br />Highly recommend it. If you are not already a fan you will be after you read this book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|These books keep my daughter entertained.  She loves to read about the trouble he & his sibling will get into...I like these books as they are &#34;side&#34; books that are fast reads for my daughter.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I still like Susan's first ever CD but this recording is something that takes a little getting<br />used to. Worth the price to add to a collection .<br />Robin Iveson

B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Just received the Music Cares tribute. The tribute was very moving from all the performers. The highlight for<br />me was hearing and seeing her actually sing the two songs from the Bergman collection. Quite moving!!<br />Robin Iveson
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I loved the movie and I can relive every moment through the soundtrack. You just can't help but sing along. Highly recommend this soundtrack if you like GLEE or STRAIGHT NO CHASERS.
B00914JWSW|5.0|This is such a joy to listen to this music!! Streisand is reaching new vocal levels that will either send shivers<br />through you or make you cry.<br />The majority of the selections are beautiful but one song, How Are Things in Gloccamora has everyone talking<br />about this one piece.<br />Stay tuned for more hopefully in 2013<br />Robin Iveson
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Hell yes, I love MGMT and some their best songs are on this cd. Fantastic music that makes me want to take acid and dance around naked in the rain in a field of daisies....
B007OUINLC|4.0|I really loved Keira Knightley in this movie.  The subject matter was a bit surprising but overall still great to watch.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|It doesnt say &#34;limited printings &#34; and when I tried to buy the pro version... it said: This is not compatible<br />with your device
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has proven time after time that his work stands up to almost all tastes in writing, the term genius applies to Mr. Grisham<br />time after time, an excellent read with a lot of suspense all throughout his work. Thank you John Grisham. All I can ask is more please!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book blew me away from the start. I wanted a fantasy book to read on my kindle and this was what I ended up with. I would suggest this book to anyone looking for a great fantasy book! Excellent read and just keeps drawing you in the more you read!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have found it an excelent way to our shoping, it alows us (husband & I) to have the shoping list with us so we do not duplicate purchases. Also keep a to do list availeable to both of us.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Do read this book!  Lincoln is a fascinating, complex man and this book added to my knowledge of him.  More important I learned a great deal about the group of people who formed his cabinet, their influences and generally about the political climate during the fight to add the 13th amendment.
0978606310|5.0|This is a very well organized and complete checklist of ponies and their accessories from the G1 era (1980s - early 1990s). Each pony has a picture, and some accessories are pictured as well. The pictures are also fairly high quality, and you can definitely identify each pony by the picture shown. The ponies and accessories all have tentative prices and values included, though if you want to find an accurate price for your pony at this exact moment, doing a little research on ebay, etc. would be a good idea.<br /><br />I do have to say that this is a very good book to use when organizing your collection, and every MLP collector should own a copy!<br /><br />Note, however, that international ponies are not listed in this book. These are all American releases.
B0097UGXFK|2.0|I recommend  this movie to today's youth. I'm 42 and the loud music and unnecessary violence didn't appeal to me. But 13-25, go for it! It's a living video game!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|The movie was alot of fun and really enjoyed what I got to see. I was disappointed that I didnt get to see the end because the batteries in my Kendel died before the end and I couldnt get it charged before my rental ended.
B005COO1X6|2.0|The plot was an interesting concept, but for some reason it didn't grab you like most of Steven Kings other novels. Perhaps if we knew the charaters better we would care if the car ate them.
B000IZ0KRK|5.0|Great movie. I won't review any more items unless they remove this silly 18 word rule. I have four more to go. Now, submit.
B005MM0AHY|5.0|This Fritz Lang film is excellent with a very young Peter Lorre as the cornered child murderer.  It is almost film noir, with no music except the tune the killer whistles that finally gets him caught.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Good quality picture and everything I could ask for to view my favorite show. Recommend to anyone who loves sci-fi/drama/romance.
B004N9DVW8|5.0|This is a fun film, worth seeing if only for the dance sequence at the reunion.  It's good to see a female buddy film.
B003L77GHE|5.0|I was glad to find this season on blu-ray as the first time I watched it I had to find episodes online and the resolution was poor. Much better in hi def! The screen cuts get a little frustrating at times but it is what it is. Still an awesome show!
B0098G7AWS|5.0|This movie was fantastic!!! It was beautifully converted to HD and I love the romance in this movie! It was overall amazing!
B002JVWRAE|5.0|The commentary is a good addition, however, I have not yet been able to watch full episodes with it due to its distracting nature. Very informative though. I watched the first season in record time, couldn't pull away! Awesome show!
B009MB682W|5.0|awesome album and great value, a great deal on some of the best songs bond ever brought to the silver screen
B002SYXCVK|4.0|This has a great blend of sacred, classic music with not-so-traditional music. You certainly feel like you are celebrating Christmas in GB with the mix of instrumentation and sounds.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Great movie.  Definetly one of my all time bests, and for sure Neesons too.  Love that poem, wouldn't mind it as a tattoo.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|A wonderful account of the whole arc of the global war but at just over half way through the tally of death, stupidity and evil is becoming very depressing.<br />Beevor does not glamorise war.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the trilogy of Fifty Shades; Christian & Anna's chemistry & dynamics are WOW! they couldn't live without each other!
B0090EJR1K|4.0|It was cool  this movie is very good , it expalained in depth the reality between the middle eastern policy versus America<br /><br />[...]
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I couldn't put any of this trilogy down; so much I wanted to know & find out about Christian, his issues etc!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|very please with this purchase..all seven disc are in one hardcase and that made it easy to keep everything in one place.. my son loves it..excellent buy!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony and this is a fun little game to play. The only thing I dislike is that everything costs a lot of bits and there are time limits. For example, you have to wait 1 min and 30 seconds before bread is made - making bread gives you money. Also it is very hard to get gems.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan is as entertaining as always. The story moves at a breakneck pace as 7 demigods race against time to find Athena's statue and save their friend. Can't wait for the next installment.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|As an adult, this movie is pretty silly. For small children who love Tinkerbell (like my nieces) they will probably like this movie a lot. Lots of animals and the snow/winter fairies are an interesting differentiation from the &#34;warm weather&#34; faries (They reminded my of the frost faries from Fantasia). Probably a good movie to watch during the winter given the snow faries.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|This over hyped rehash of 'Alien' is so lethargic and predictable it is really an embarrasment to Ridley Scott's legacy. Was he really so desperate for money that he needed to do this? The unscrupulous corporation, the marines, the strong 'survive-at-any-price' heroine who gets impregnated with an alien, the robot who loses his head, etc... its all fished out and repackaged with a few 3-D special effects. There are some interesting touches, like a throwaway tribute to Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, but on the whole it's a waste of your time and money.
B002JIEYL2|5.0|My CD arrived quite quickly. It was exactly what I expected with the exception of it arriving in the mail sooner than anticipated.<br /><br />Lee C.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've read all the diary of the wimpy kid books and no other has been so hilarious as this. In this book they have a valentine dance at the school, and Greg desperately wants a date. He finally gets a date with another girl. There's only one catch...its with Rowley too. Will Greg be the one to win her over or will he be the third wheel?
B002GSXKN8|5.0|great great great great great and great and great and grate and greate and awsome, nice, wonderfully greatly great. perfect
B009HV2JT8|5.0|When my husband proposed watching this on Amazon Instant Video, I admit I grumbled a little.  I grumbled even more at the beginning, which was quite violent and scary! Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that these vampires don't twinkle in the sunlight or profess their undying love to young girls, but these vampires are SCARY!<br /><br />Before long, though, I was completely engrossed in how history and fantasy were interwoven seemlessly.  Very engaging movie and perfect for a night home with your spouse (AFTER the little kids go to bed, of course :) )<br /><br />Also, you will NOT regret ordering this on Amazon Instant Video....the HD quality was as nice as a blu-ray on our large tv.
B001NLL93W|4.0|It is just like her other books. Very entertaining and story brings you right in! Loved every moment of it, and I am reading with my 16 yr old daughter, that enjoys it just as much as I do.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I love this series.  The acting is wonderful, the scenery is outstanding, and it makes you feel like you're actually a part of the western experience.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|Sting could sing the phone book and it would be wonderful. not the traditional Christmas songs everybody and his/her dog does
B0000667RO|5.0|This is to replace a cassette to a disc of an old song my wife loves to hear!!<br /><br />Thank you,<br />  J.L.
0425263916|5.0|Read Bared To You first & loved it couldn't put it down.  Waited a week for Reflected In You to come out, couldn't put it down.  Can't believe I have to wait til May for the next installment, but will be on the waitlist til then!  Christian Grey doesn't have anything on Gideon Cross
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Ive searched for an answer to the ever so dominant question of why the game turns off after the intro and am starting to think that gameloft has done thisnon pourpuse mostly because nobody has responded to it.
0307716988|5.0|good  book easy to read an a true  account by Michael with out all the lies and trash  that some people have written<br />  our of greed and try to make money
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|Purchased this and didn't even bother to check the region or language since this is the American Amazon site.  It's Region 2 and the primary language is Italian and Mono at that.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|I thought the the close-up crotch and sex simulation scenes were a bit heavy for PG-13 rating.  Glad I didn't just put it on when all the grandkids were over.  Loved the soundtrack and the rendition of all the 80&#34;s bands and songs.<br />All the stars sang their own parts and did a good job.  Kind of a fun story line and comedy with the chuch-lady opposition yet they were doing stuff on the side including civil leaders wanting to shut down the Sunset strip clubs.<br />I liked the special feature where you can go through the film and pick out on the spec. features and play mainly the musical numbers you like out of the film.
0425263908|5.0|I was a big fan of this story from the very mention of it. I thought &#34;oh no, rip off&#34; but honestly it's competing with one of the biggest books out there... and it could easily win.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I loved the humor in this film with each of the characters from the UK all having to deal with the culture in India and a retirement home they were seeking not turning out to meet their expectations and how they each begin to cope with the differences.
0425263916|5.0|I don't want to wait! January-March I will be on pins and needles trying to be patient! Oh Gideon and Eva
B0091MW50G|2.0|I have a considerably lower opinion of this disk than John Gleason in another review, but am deeply indebted to him for his careful and detailed analysis, which was the reason for my purchase. I paid around 9 dollars from a reseller, and feel it was worth it, but if this disk had been much more expensive, I'd have felt cheated and would say to others to hold off. I found five or six of the excerpts at \\"Met level\\" or thereabouts, but the others considerably less strong. Beyond that something Mr. Gleason doesn't comment on is the production value of the video (not the staging, but the sound and photography). (By the way, all of my references are to the Blu-Ray version, which is the one I bought.) It was a real disappointment to me. E.g., the quartet at the end of Rigoletto did not utilize the potential of modern individual miking technology to bring out individual voices/harmonies/vocal interactions. I have no idea how it was miked (radio or whatever), but I have heard many Blu-Ray disks with better, sharper sound production--both recording and mixing. (I checked my DAC and the disk was, indeed, recorded at 48/24, but, for whatever reason, it just doesn't sound a whole lot better than 44.1/16--CD quality--to my highly trained ears; and that's not mentioning the aforementioned miking and mixing issues--where voices are not adequately separated or the levels of different voices, or voices and the orchestra, matched and carefully adjusted in post-production.) Ditto on the same sort of production problems in the visuals. Not only were the productions not lighted for high-resolution video (easy to do and still produce a work on stage in front of an audience), but many of the shot selections (closeups on buttons on a performer's costume or a performer's legs rather than face, etc.) are downright bizarre. (Probably trying to cover for missing material where another cameraman didn't shoot the assigned face.) In short, I approached this disk with the highest hopes and expectations, fully ready to be persuaded that I should buy the whole set when it appears, but I have to say I made the opposite decision as I watched, deciding that \\"no, this is not the set I want to mortgage my house to obtain.\\" Too bad. Verdi needs great productions, and great Blu-Rays for those of us who don't live in New York, Paris, or London. But in my humble opinion, this is not what we were waiting for. I wish I could have been more enthusiastic. (A suggestion for any \\"newbies\\" out there who are just looking for an opera aria compilation Blu-Ray for themselves or a present for a friend. Search Amazon for \\"Anna Netrebko\\" (a soprano) and \\"opera concert\\" and \\"Blu-Ray.\\" She and friends have two amazing concert disks from around 2006 or 2007. The better of the two is an indoor concert and the other, only very slightly less amazing, is an outdoor concert. I forget which cities, but you should be able to find both easily by searching with the three terms I have given. If you are thinking of buying the Verdi disk just as a kind of \\"sampler\\" to get your feet wet in opera, you would do far better, in fact you would have your mind blown and your soul transported, by the Netrebko Blu-Rays, both exceptional in all three areas: performance, sound, and photography. Truly exceptional.)
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a very good series. The star of the outstanding series, &#34;Life&#34;, does a very good job again.  5 Stars!
1603427244|5.0|I learned a great deal from this book  it is very well presented and extremely helpful  I have been knitting for 60 years and only knew one cast-on and one bind-off method  this book greatly expanded my knowledge
B003V40SGS|3.0|Nice to see this again but too bad they couldnt upgrade the video and sound, this should be remade or something.
B0059XTV4Y|2.0|Following her \\"Filth and Wisdom\\" (2008), Madonna directs a film, this time about a life of \\"W.E.\\" - Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII. (Actually there is another \\"W.E.\\" but about that, later). The story of \\"the romance of the century\\" is so famous that I don't think I have to repeat it here. Wallis Simpson is played by Andrea Riseborough; King Edward VIII is by James D'Arcy.<br /><br />Somehow Madonna (who also co-wrote the script with Alek Keshishian, director of \\"With Honors,\\" \\"Love and Other Disasters\\" and a documentary \\"Madonna: Truth or Dare\\") thought that the subject matter needs an unconventional narrative style. As a result, about half of the film is spent on the story of another W.E. living in 1998, New York: two fictional characters Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), wife of a successful psychiatrist, and Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), Russian security guard working for Sotheby's. Neglected and mistreated by her husband, Wally is obsessed with Wallis Simpson.<br /><br />Though panned by critics, \\"W.E.\\" is not that bad. Actors all deliver fine performances. Period costumes are beautiful (the film is Oscar nominated for the costume designer Arianne Phillips' brilliant work). The dynamic musical score of Abel Korzeniowski is impressive. Some of the songs Madonna chooses (including The Sex Pistols and Chubby Checker) are used in an unpredictable way.<br /><br />But the film as a whole is a mess. \\"W.E.\\" is ambitious, maybe too ambitious. The film struggles to fit two stories separated by sixty years into one narrative, but the result is not good. The editing is too busy and confusing; character of Wally is hard to connect with; camerawork (including too many close-ups) is hectic and intrusive, detracting from the story of the real W.E. we really want to know. Clearly there are so many good ingredients here, but somehow the film is overcooked.
B008EZVNO0|2.0|I've been a big Van fan since the 60s, have (and regularly listen to) several of his earlier CDs, and eagerly awaited the arrival of his newest.  I was underwhelmed.  Nothing really jumped out and grabbed me on this CD.  Nothing made me think, &#34;Wow!  I want to listen to that one again.&#34;  I don't think he's lost his magic, I just think, sadly, that this one misses the mark.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this movie. It kept my attention right up to the end. I would recommend it to all my friends!
B008Q6SML4|3.0|Was not what I was thinking it would be but it did find me interested in some of the characters.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|Not very bright, the normal light coming off my Kindle is brighter than the light coming from this app. Waste of time to install it, especially having to uninstall. Keep looking.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The format of this Trilogy version is one big book on your kindle. It didn't bother me too much because I just read them back to back, but I really would have preferred three separate books.<br /><br />The trilogy itself starts out strong and then kinda goes downhill. I still stuck it out till the end, but by the last book I was really just trudging through it. Luckily it's a very easy read! For the more mature readers out there, this may be a tedious read for you. I can see how a younger audience would appreciate it though.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 23/F.
B0019OP0GU|4.0|I really liked this movie. I felt that the actors did a good job. I have not read the book but would like to now.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|One of the most intense and well written shows on tv. the disks are great for picking up on all the little details i missed live. the show has so many layers the set is def worth it if you want to get everything.
B007V5XT1O|4.0|This was a great album that I got for a great price. Carrie Underwood has great vocal power and meaningful songs.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Jeff Lynne managed to sound as good as Bobby Darin, Etta James, and Roy Orbison on some of these old favorites. He's one in a million for arranging, and producing terrific listening music.
0143038583|4.0|Interesting.  Probably a must read for any one who consumes food in the US.  A good picture of the &#34;organic&#34; farms and how they aren't so small.
B007THA4FI|4.0|If I hadn't read Harry Potter, I'd give this book 4 stars so that's what it's getting. I had to really separate myself from the stories I grew up with and loved in Harry Potter. Enough about HP though... this was actually a good book in the end. It's not an easy read and the characters were not very likable at first. The first half of the book was really slow but once you get past part three, it really picks up and becomes interesting. The ending was not what I expected and overall the book was very dark. I'm glad I pushed through to the end though. JK Rowling's writing style in this book is totally different than what I am used to. I love the way she switches which character's mind you're in. It makes reading the book kind of fun once you get used to it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for adult readers that haven't read HP or are able to separate themselves from HP while reading this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this app so addictive. no complaints except one i just wish i didnt have to deal with the ads everytime i started a new game
B008NB0SQO|3.0|It's hard for any of the 1990's Muppet movies to escape the shadows of the first three classic entries in the franchise starring the charming creatures. \\"The Muppet Movie,\\" \\"The Great Muppet Caper,\\" and \\"The Muppets Take Manhattan\\" are looked at by many to be Jim Henson's sacred trilogy of films starring the beloved characters. Disney gives \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" another chance in the limelight with the \\"It's Not Easy Being Scrooge\\" Blu-ray + Digital Copy 20th Anniversary Special Edition.<br /><br />The title of the movie is a good indication of what viewers can expect from \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\\" Michael Caine is old miser Scrooge, who plays straight to a cast of everyone's favorite critters including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and the rest of the gang. He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.<br /><br />\\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.<br /><br />Michael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.<br /><br />The high-definition transfer of the movie looks and sounds great. The picture is near flawless and clear. The 5.1 surround sound breathes new life into the musical numbers, which aren't very memorable in the first place.<br /><br />There are some nice special features on this new edition of the movie. There's audio commentary by director Brian Henson, Kermit, Gonzo, Rizzo, and more for starters. \\"Frogs, Pigs and Humbug: Unwrapping a New Holiday Classic\\" is a 22-minute look \\"behind-the-scenes\\" of the movie that's included.<br /><br />A couple of featurettes entitled \\"Gonzo: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Weirdo\\" and \\"Christmas Around the World\\" are featured as well. A Blooper reel and five Intermission songs round out the bonus material for the Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />Most fans of Jim Henson's fuzzy creations will want to pick up \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol: It's Not Easy Being Scrooge 20th Anniversary Special Edition.\\" The obvious reason is it's the debut of the movie on Blu-ray. The film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone. I'm sure it'll be and is considered essential viewing for many during the holiday season. Just don't expect the magic and wit you get when watching 2011's \\"The Muppets.\\"o, Rizzo, and more for starters. \\"Frogs, Pigs and Humbug: Unwrapping a New Holiday Classic\\" is a 22-minute look \\"behind-the-scenes\\" of the movie that's included.<br /><br />A couple of featurettes entitled \\"Gonzo: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Weirdo\\" and \\"Christmas Around the World\\" are featured as well.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book of the trilogy was very well written and<br />was enjoyable to read through. Un fortunately this second<br />book is more of the same and does not add anything new.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I felt this book was not as good as its counterpart.  It had a similar read but a more immature storyline.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|I haven't finished this book but I can already tell that it is up to his standards with Old Man's War.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I enjoyed reading 50 shaeds as it had variety and also some steamy chapters. The story line was easy to follow.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show with a fantastic plot and character development. The Amazon streaming service was amazing too. I highly recommend watching the show.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I love this album. The beats and songs are perfect. I have listened to it twice already. Always loved her music, this album makes you want to dance and think all at the same time. :-)
B005DF2QMC|3.0|WORKED WELL FOR THE SHORT TIME I USED IT. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ENTIRE TAPE. ALSO, SOFTWARE WAS A LITTLE TOUGH TO UNDERSTAND AND I DIDN'T FIND IT EASY TO BREAK APART THE SONGS.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|It is a very sick story in the book. I was so surprised at how many people loved the book and the sample didnt  really state the contence of the book.  It is boring and sick!
B009ANP48G|5.0|I've seen all the step up movies.  Love them all.  This might be in my top 2.  I can't be too sure until I watch them all again and these days who has time.  All I know is that the story is generic, but the actors/actresses are well liked.  The acting is some of the best in the franchise.  Of course that curly haired kid is in this movie again, at the very end.  We all love him.  I'd recommend this version.  The cinematography is great.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love it the only way it could be better is if it had more levels. it also has not froze my kindle yet.
B005LAII08|3.0|Let's get one thing straight.  I am an avid Disney Movie/Pixar mother.  I earned over 6,000 disney movie rewards over the past 18 months.  As soon as my daughter was born, I started to build my collection.  I have my collection in VHS, but wanted Blu-Ray.  Blu-Ray is awesome.  Now, let's get to this review...<br /><br />  The accent on the main character is really bad.  There is no consistency with her accent, which really takes away from the story of the movie.  Not that the story is that great.  Spoiler...  A young princess runs away, meets a witch, her mother turns into a bear, and she has to learn that she loves her mother even when her mother is cross, and all that jazz.  Her mother becomes normal again, but let's face it, this movie isn't normal, IT IS WEIRD!!<br /><br />  I have never been great at reviewing movies, but I bought this one and regret having done so... My daughter has made me take it out of the player 3 times in the past week because she just isn't interested.  Her movie of choice over this one?  Tangled of course.<br /><br />  If you can get this movie really cheap and used, do it... New?  Not worth your time or money.
B004BSWC8A|5.0|I am slowly replacing all of the VHS tapes that I have cataloged and stored. This is a very good movie.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|As with everyone else who fell in love with Susan Boyle via YouTube, she has been an inspiration to me on several levels. I have pre-ordered each of her albums through Amazon, and I have always gotten a good deal and prompt delivery when the release date arrived.<br /><br />In terms of &#34;bang for the buck&#34;, both Susan Boyle and Amazon have redefined the term. I absolutely love Susan Boyle, and I definitely appreciate Amazon's being one of the first distributors in the U.S. to make her albums available even before they are released.
B008M34INW|4.0|Lots of action and easy to follow. I give it an A+ I have nothing else to say so i will stop now.
1441879919|2.0|The guy who reads this book for the audio CD has a weird, clipped and lilting reading style that makes every. single. thing he says sound sarcastic. I couldn't listen to him and turned it off in the middle of the 1st CD.
B005LAIGTG|3.0|Product was as described. I didn't care so much for the movie though. I didn't understand why everyone I knew that had seen it &#34;cried the entire time.&#34; I didn't even shed a tear.

B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Product as described, loved this movie in theaters. I'm a fan of the muppets even though I'm in my 20s. Sometimes you just can't grow out of certain childhood things. Such as good kids movies.
B001FBSLH2|5.0|I purchased both the Crusaders Gold CD and this DVD of the Crusaders at Montreux 2003.  The members look like myself - getting older -  but the fabulous sound is still there.
B008JEJVXG|5.0|I love this album. The band reminds me of everything from 80's English space pop, The Smiths, Stone Roses but they also sound very much a modern band and not just a novelty/retro act that's stealing their best ideas. Listen to the samples (here or on itunes) and then buy it. Enjoy!
0743270754|1.0|I have a history degree from Berkeley and have continued to read history and biography since graduating long ago.  I have also published a bestselling novel that includes well-researched historical interludes parallel to a modern story. The Lincoln film, which I liked very much, prompted me to try this book.  I had read a great deal about Lincoln already, so never felt compelled to read the Godwin book before. The back story on the film is that Spielberg met with Godwin more than 10 years ago when considering a film on Lincoln. The screenwriter attempted to do a screenplay based on her book. He worked on it for years, but it always came out like a long, boring biopic, more like a Ken Burns documentary. They finally gave up on that approach and zeroed in on the dramatic story of the 13th Amendment.  Godwin only devotes 5 pages of her 750 page textbook to this situation.  (See the November 2012 issue of Smithsonian Magazine online for more detail).<br /><br />The other problem is that Godwin is a well-documented plagiarist.  She has a research team that has lifted whole passages and even pages from the works of others which she has dropped wholesale, verbatim into her books. In reading this book, I noticed the sudden changes of style that are more descriptive and colorful, for example about members of Lincoln's cabinet, before reverting to her plodding style.  I've read my share of well-written biographies and histories. It can take on a novelistic flair in the right hands, but she belongs to the dry, pedantic German school of historiography. I donated the book to my public library.

006016848X|4.0|A man takes pride in feeling competent, in being trusted, and in being respected by his mate/spouse. And when a woman corrects him, and nags him, and constantly tells him he's doing it wrong, a lot of what a man hears is: you're incompetent, I can't trust you even to do this simple task, and you don't do anything right. This book helped me, as a wife, stop harping on my husband so much. No, he doesn't always do things the way I would do them, but if I correct each and every thing he does wrong, he will: 1-stop trying to do things to help me out, and 2- feel like he has to ask permission or for instruction everytime he does the simplest task. I've seen men who have been so belittled by their wives that they are more like lapdogs instead of men, and that's not sexy!
1608871452|5.0|I think from the title you could gather two things. One, that I'm a fan of the series and horray another piece of merch. Or Two: This bookw as just that damn good. It was both.<br /><br />This book is for the DIE hard fans I can tell you now because of all the behind the scenes info and GEORGIOUS pictures. And included are insider references, and a guide of episodes/characters/actors and goes all the way up to season 7 (we at the time of this review are airing Season 8).<br /><br />It is an expensive and LARGE book. hard cover with a jacket. When removing the beautiful cover jacket, you can see a simple yet fitting old fashioned bound book facade of the actual cover in a brownish color. You will need to make room on a tall shelf to accomidate it, unless you intend to put it on the coffee table.<br />The book is like all of the companion books in that it gives you details about the show as well as the true insider knowledge. It is just detailed and very well put together.<br /><br />A VERY VERY special bonus is that there are things in there for the reader to take out. Such as these little &#34;postcard&#34; type photos of the cast. However, they are SO glued in that even though they are intended to come out, DON'T. I've already ripped on of the pictures in the book and dented the card. It is better to just carefully lift them up to see what is underneath rather than try to take them out. Then there are the easily recognized insider jokes carried out in things like a religious air freshner in a tiny bag for us in the Impala chapter, a folder of book cover posters that CAN be taken out and hung up from Carver &#34;Chuck&#34; Elund, and at the VERY back, a poster of the road map of Sam and Dean.<br /><br />I know that I've taken away some of the surprises but I felt that I needed to because someone might make the same mistake I did in trying to remove some of these cards and thus damageing their book. Besides, where are you going to end up putting them?<br /><br />Overall, this was AMAZING. It really, really shows dedication to the fans (read the intro by Eric Kripke I swear it is great!) and what we like/want. I was impressed and it is one of my treasures. I may honestly buy a second book to take all the cool stuff out of it ^^

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am a professional audio engineer of 16+ years and i swear by these headphones! They are my second pair (my toddler got a hold of my first pair and destroyed them, don't ask how.. it still hurts). I use them for everything from listening to music on my computer to editing audio files to PFL'ing on sound boards.<br /><br />To me they have near perfect sound replication without adding frequencies (unlike the Beats headphones that sound horrible)! This is why they are an industry standard in most recording studios!

0547884591|5.0|Pre-ordered books, and even had one sent to a special gal. Oh my - guys, this is a great book to send sight unseen to someone on whom you've got your eye.  It will confirm to her that you are in fact the type of guy she'd love to spend a day/weekend with adventuring.  A little nervous doing so prior to seeing the content, but it went over incredibly.<br />The rest shipped to me, and I'm distributing.  I now plan to get a bunch out to customers, old friends, college roommates, etc.<br />Now, which chapter/lesson to attempt with my gal first...

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great camera bag because it doesn't look like a camera bag.  It has lots of padded dividers and Velcro straps that you can put anywhere you need them.  I give it 5 stars for the amateur to prosumer photographer but when you start to upgrade your equipment, like the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GDOQS/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00 I just purchased, it will start to get crowded in this bag.  If you're a pro and you carry multiple camera bodies and large telephoto lenses it will probably be too small.  The good thing is you can always pull all the Velcro dividers out and use it as a regular backpack when you get to that point.

1400032717|5.0|Autism is a behavior disorder that affects someone both physically and mentally. They can communicate with us with their own way of speech. I have a 13-year-old brother with severe autism. It's hard to understand what he's trying to tell you, but he manages to explain it with his hands and the words he says. In my own words, someone who have autism doesn't mean they have trouble trying to learn, they have their own way of learning. In this novel, the main character shows that thought with true strength, and will leave readers with astonishment and emotion as it left me.<br /><br />We follow a British teen named Christopher John Francis Boone who has autism and has many unique traits. He hates the color of yellow, knows every prime number there is, and remembers every world continent. The autistic traits he has are not looking directly to others, not wanting to be touched and interested in things that not all people are crazy about. His mother died supposedly when he was still young and now lives alone with his father. Chris and his father are almost the complete opposite. Chris is a kind, gentle and honest person, while his father is hardheaded, hard to please and has a bad temper.<br /><br />It all start when Christopher finds a dead poodle named Wellington with a fork in the beginning which sets off this drama. He is then confronted by Mrs. Shears, the dog's owner and gets in a grapple with the cops when being questioned. Later, his father bails him of the police station and then gets in a ball of rage when he learns that Christopher is planning to solve this mystery. He goes to his neighbors near where the murder occurred and jots it all in the notebook which he is writing about. But while doing so, Christopher learns more about his mother and her affair with one of their neighbors. Meanwhile, his father discovers his curiosity with the murder and will put Chris on a shaky path of danger throughout his journey.<br /><br />I read the novel two years ago, and I've been reading it recently in my college reading class. I relived that powerful and unexplainable feeling while rereading this novel. Everything is excellent from beginning to end. We truly see the real side of an autistic child from this narration. This is, no doubt, one novel everyone should read so they can understand the world of autism better. Readers who understand autism will fall in love with the novel in an instant, like I did. Some who are unfamiliar will have trouble understand Christopher's narration, but will enjoy the experience. \\"TCIOFDITNT\\" will leave you fascinated and surprised in the mind of an autistic child.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This is about the best Album i've heard in the last few years. Not even going to straddle it into a single genre. Becuase it goes across so many. It's just good music. Each song gives you a new feeling, a new experience. Frank Ocean is super dynamic and inspirational. Definitly worth buying!

B009O2XY12|1.0|I liked this game and had a fun time playing until I downloaded the Thanksgiving game for jewel credits on this game. Once you downloaded it, Bubble game would not open any more on Kindle Fire. Kept doing a force close. I uninstalled both games and reinstalled Bubble Mania and still could not open and it did a force close still.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wonderful I could not put it down!! Grisham has done it again and I hope they make a movie. He,says its only fiction but as  you read the book you begin to believe that it could really happen. Well done and I highly recommend the book.

B004YD1KTO|4.0|It’s going to be difficult to review Afterwards without giving too much away, so excuse me if I’m deliberately vague. Afterwards is one of those stories that evolves bit by bit and if you rush it, you run the risk of spoiling the whole thing. There is a fire and a mother, Grace, tries to rescue her daughter. Having saved her daughter from death (for now at least) she wants desperately to uncover who started the fire that nearly deprived her of a child.<br /><br />Thus begins an incredibly compelling mystery with some very strange twists and turns. I’ll won’t go into the reasons Grace is restricted in her investigations – I’ll allow you to discover those for yourself – but they certainly add a very surreal dimension to this tale.<br /><br />Lupton proved with Sister that she’s capable of writing great suspense and developing a good plot. More than that, she has a real knack for writing about family relationships and not just cosy, ‘everybody’s happy’ relationships but instead gritty, fraught and difficult ones. In Sister we saw the relationship between two sisters laid bare. In Afterwards the mother-daughter relationship receives the same thorough examination.<br /><br />Afterwards is a story of jealousy, anger, fear, loss, hope, love and protection all rolled into one. If you can get all the way through this book without a tear in your eye or a lump in your throat at any point, you’re made of sterner stuff than me!<br /><br />**I received a copy of the book in exchange for a fair and honest review. I did not receive any additional compensation and all views are my own.**
B0041VT6HW|1.0|This movie was not what I expected.  If you are looking to enjoy a good western this is not the movie!  This was more of a matrix movie.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|For all of you who followed this Alian Cult Classic, this is a must see.  Ridley Scott does it again.  Great visual effects and story line which leads us back to where it all began back in \\"79\\". Promethus is a muust see.  Absolutely genius Ridley!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great storyline. I wish there was more, I finished the entire game including the bonus level in less than 2 days.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|A boreing book that I didn't like it was so stupid and I didn't like it I am 16 turning 17 on december 12. But the book didn't appeal to my likening . Try reading just Ella or identity heist
B001T3RA8M|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time! If you love magic and a wonderful story than this is the book for you! Travel along with the Heroine of the story Sabriel as she journeys into her new life across the wall. This is a wonderful and unique story that puts a new perspective on death. Once you start this book you can't put it down. It grips you from the very first chapter and you are compelled to finish it. This is a story that you will want to re-read and enjoy again and again.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|First off, if you're reading this review with any hopes of getting an objective opinion of the movie, be warned: I am a Browncoat.  Which means I am COMPLETELY and utterly in love with the Firefly universe and everything in it, this movie included.  That said, I think I can still honestly say that I would still give this movie a 4 star rating were I to objectively rate it based simply on its entertainment value alone.<br /><br />As for the product itself, you can't go wrong unless you're looking for some special edition packaging or something.  It's got a blu-ray, DVD and comes with a digital download (only valid until 12/31 I think) so you can watch it on your tablet or whatever too.  And the price is great too.  If you don't already own this movie, get it, you know you want to.  If you haven't seen the movie, Please Please Please do yourself a favor and do so...  Rent it, borrow it or steal it if you have to.  And if you already own another version and you're looking at this review, well, you know you're already going to buy this one too just to tell Universal \\"thanks\\".  ;-)<br /><br />I own several versions of this DVD but not too recently stepped up to Blu-Ray and decided I needed a BR version as well.  Not sure if it's any different from any other BR versions out there but can say there were some fun additions over the DVD version including a picture-in-picture commentary which was kinda fun.  If you're a Browncoat then it's definitely worth the couple bucks to add this to your collection.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|would recommend to other people an interesting story line  i read the review and was interested the beginning half of the book was the best

B009E3EY4M|5.0|Forget all the wordy stuff and analysis. This is a kick ass DVD that sounds great and looks great. I was thrilled with it and am giving it out as a Christmas gift to all of my friends. I am sure one can find fault with it but it is simply powerful.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really liked the first book in this series, but this one was just not as good. The first book was almost too similar to 50 Shades, but this one was barely in the same genre. I am going to reread it and maybe I will like it more.

0547884591|5.0|I've really enjoyed this book.  I love to cook (and that includes making my own cheese from scratch and canning vegetables.)I still have learned quite a bit - tips, tricks, technique & helpful items to try or use.  I've read some of the other reviews, and yes, this book does move about from topic to topic - but it's supposed to.  It's a cookbook with, let's say, bookmarks, in between the cooking parts that help to explain something about the cooking part in that area of the book.  It may be a bit of information about an ingredient, tool, or something way out in left field, but all of this comes back to the subject.  (Some faster than others.)<br /><br />How often does one read a cookbook from front to back?  The fact this can be done with \\"The 4-Hour Chef,\\" tells you it's MORE than just a cookbook.<br /><br />The ONLY drawback I have is that I purchased this to read on my phone app.  Now I want the hard copy.  Cookbooks should be purchased as hard copies!
B000HVHM5S|5.0|I considered it a great example of how people can get together for a common cause. This was done using an action based thriller theme. The mask was what caught my attention first.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|I watched the show when it started on Showtime and was immediately immersed in the story. The idea behind the plot is frightening to think about but extremely interesting at the same time. I am currently watching the second season on Showtime right now and the show continues to deliver a great storyline and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to give anything away by explaining plot points so I will just say that if you enjoy government intrigue then I would highly recommend this show.

145470246X|5.0|As a decade-plus jewelry-maker, this is the first since Laura McCabe's &#34;Creating Crystal Jewelry With Swarovski&#34; that has really grabbed my attention...and it is by far an easier introduction than the former into the growing industry of high-fashion costume jewelry weaving.<br /><br />Lippert does a wonderful job of balancing frank, funny discussion of her own creative process of design development with fully understandable diagrammes of how to achieve the unusual and interesting patterns she creates.  She also goes a step further and demonstrates in a concise and accessible manner how to use multiple kinds of components (the instructions for each is included with step-by-step details and a materials list) to create a virtually infinite array of your own pieces.  The photography is extremely well-done (I have yet to see better) and the information included--whether it be how to design your own work using her ideas as a springboard, the designs themselves, or the sheer innovation of bezelling techniques for different sized/shaped crystals--is brilliant.  If you are even somewhat curious about crystal designs or an expert in your own right, this is a must-read book that will truly broaden your horizon of the subject in a fresh, interesting way.
B008602KQI|5.0|While the movie doesn't follow the book completely it retains enough of the book to be a great story. Thank you
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This was the first game I ever downloaded. It is a great game. You get hooked very quickly.  At first it's very simple when you play the 5x5 grids. But as you get to the 8x8 grids, it becomes quite challenging. Just connect the same color dots on the grid without crossing lines, while using the entire board. Very addictive game, and it's free!
034580404X|3.0|I have read the first book. Maybe my maturity level is different. The book is ok. I find myself reading other books while reading this series on the side. Can't imagine a movie being made due to the content. It's a fun read however not my favorite
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is another great version of the game angry birds. New scenarios and set ups and hours of laughing levels to make it through. Can you earn three stars on each level? Try it and see. Works on old and new kindle Fire.
0312330537|3.0|I found myself drifting during this book. It rambled around page 500....so I found myself skipping several, yes,iseveral pages so I could back into the story. I found the writer a little ADHD at times. It was a stuggle to finish. A good story, however I find it very hard to believe that it is based on true life. Glad I got through it...wouldn't read it again..too painful.. and boring in several spots.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the original anfry birds game but it only works on the original Kindle Fire and not on the new HD version.<br /><br />NEW NOTE - This has now been updated to work on the new Kindle Fire HD. Of course that did not happen until I bought the paid version, but non-the-less, it now works.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Troublesome police detective Harry Hole can't get anyone in Oslo to believe that an illegally imported rifle is important enough to warrant an investigation.<br /><br />This book is so complex that it nearly defies description.  There are multiple story lines, flashbacks, and numerous characters (each with a Norwegian name).  Surprisingly, the plot was fairly easy to follow and quite compelling.  I was more interested in the story that occurred in the past than in the present situation of detective Harry Hole, but Hole's story was fairly good as well.<br /><br />My main beef with the book was that the end left so many hanging threads that I nearly thought I'd somehow missed the final quarter of the book in the download process.  It just kind of...ends.  Also, I had a very hard time connecting with the main character.  I don't mind anti-social characters, but this one was so cold I couldn't properly care about him.<br /><br />There are a lot of parallels between The Redbreast and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  The Redbreast moved much more quickly than TGWTDT and it was also very tense.  Also, The Redbreast was not nearly as disturbing.  However, I wasn't drawn to the characters as I was in the other book.  Overall, I preferred TGWTDT.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the old kindle allowed you to connect to facebook like normal. The new kindle only allows you to connect via facebook mobile and the app never works correctly. If I delete the app and then re-install it it might work for an hour or two. Don't bother with the app. total waste of time. Just connect through the web. Takes longer but atleast you can scroll through your news feed.
6305212112|5.0|This is a movie for all time..great character studies and the acting/casting is spot on. Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker carry the wonderful story by Fannie Flagg to perfection..it is SOUTHERN, beautifully shot, of a lost time when character was KING and people rose to the occasion. Jessica Tandy shines...what a pleasure to watch her interact with Kathy Bates, narrating the long ago story of the Whistle Stop Cafe which became the heart of a tiny town. Charming and compelling, always a trip to a better time...nostalgic and true. You will never tire of watching it.The Secret is in the Sauce....

B000000XB9|5.0|This cd highlights many of the well-known and most popular songs by Creedence Clearwater Revival.  Of the 20 songs, I was familiar with 17 of them and enjoy this cd over and over and over again!  The louder the volume, the better John Fogerty and his swamp-rock band sound!!  You will be glad you have this one in your collection!!!
B00280LYHS|4.0|I chose four stars for this book because although it is not the best thing I've ever read (harry potter takes the cake) I really do love it.  It's fun and exciting and it will grip even the most reluctant of readers. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good read that goes surprisingly quickly. One of the best books series that I've read so far.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I have watched this movie several times since I was a kid and it never gets old.  Glad I could rent it on Amazon and share the experience with my kids.

I did not read the books, but thought I'd check out the movie. My husband and i both liked it and are excited for Catching Fire (number 2) to come out next year!

B009IHED0E|5.0|It would be difficult to imagine an album project more ambitious than \\"Beneath the Waves\\", a concept album sprung from the blood, sweat and tears of  Rob Reed, founder of welsh progressive-rock band Magenta. Not only has Reed spent three years concocting this gem, gathering leading prog talents, but he managed to finish it in the same year his regular band has already produced a very good album, [[ASIN:B005WRVC0I Chameleon]].  It is not unheard of -Gahalad for example has published two pretty good albums of new material in 2012- but it is still a tour de force.<br /><br />In addition to the sheer musical work involved, Reed has had to face production issues with a manufacturer that first pushed back the release date at the last moment, then presented a first pressing that Reed deemed unacceptable and sent back. Ironically in 2012, the only version of the album available for a while was the vinyl! The joys of entrepreneurship...<br /><br />The effort was worth it. Even though 2012 has turned out to be a banner year for progressive rock, the Kompendium project stands out. Magenta itself was created in 1999 to bring back the nostalgia of the original prog rock with its meandering risk taking and superior musicianship. Kompendium pushes the envelope further.<br /><br />At the core, Beneath the Waves spins a dark romantic sea-tale seemingly based on an early 20th century news item: Connor McGregor is a man broken with grief. His wife Lilly committed suicide shortly after the death of their first child, leaving him with an almost unbearable sense of guilt. Then, during a fishing trip, his ship encounters a storm and sinks. Connor is the only survivor but comes back believing that Lilly has reached out to him during the catastrophe and is longing to be reunited with him. Connor closes himself more and more and takes long strolls on the beach.  Eventually, one day, he does not come back....<br /><br />For all its gloom, the story is not treated musically as dark and depressing. It is soulful through and through. Fundamentally, it is reminiscent of Magenta, of course, and some songs, like Lost or Alone, could be straight out of a Magenta album. And band regulars Christina Booth, Chris Fry and Steve Reed participate in the project.<br /><br />But it veers away from Magenta, notably in using many voices, primarily two lead pop voices (Angharad Brinn and Steve Balsamo), two lead operatic voices (Shan Cothi and Rhys Meirion), and several choir configurations. On the instrument side, Reed has assembled the most impressive roster of major players this side of a tribute album: Nick Barrett, Mel Collins, Steve Hackett, Gavin Harrison, Jakko Jakszyk, John Mitchell, Dave Stewart, Neil Taylor and the omnipresent Troy Donockley, whose uilleann pipes and whistles give the whole production a distant Iona echo. In fact, the whole project has strong celtic overtones, from Donockley's sounds to a very strong presence of kymric artists. Yet it does not get trapped into celtic-rock. The title track, for example, is often dominated by guitar and sounds resolutely like a mix of rock and world music.<br /><br />This embarrassment of riches is put to good use. In some cases, the songs are terse and simple, like the beautiful Lily, carried by Steve Hackett. In others, it leads to dream collaborations like the longest and most ambitious construction of the album, the 11mn The Storm where no fewer than four musicians share guitar duty to good effect... In addition, this cross-pollination allows Reed to break the mold of modern prog-rock, often defined by modest audiences, limited profitability and do-it-yourself production, leading to products often a little too recognizable or repetitive. For example, the opening track -and second longest- Exordium, is accompanied by Nick Barret's guitar. For better or for worse, Barrett's Pendragon sound is very recognizable and sometimes goes into same'ol same'ol mode. But here, even though it is as identifiable, it is perfect and fresh, in the company of Harrison's drumming and Donockley's piping. By the same token, even the most Magenta-sounding moments come at you from a different angle since they are not accompanied by Christina Booth's otherwise beautiful voice. It makes me think of Mark Jansen's 2011 project [[ASIN:B004SKI77Q Quarterpast]] from his side band MaYaN. With his regular symphonic metal band Epica, Jansen has created a sound defined primarily by lead singer Simone Simons' voice. With MaYan, Jansen could explore variations on a theme with an expanded roster of collaborators, with excellent result. Rob Reed does the same here.<br /><br />This may be a once-in-a-career album. And it is a towering success. Don't miss it.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|(Spoilers!)<br /><br />Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were great films but The Dark Knight Rises was not on par. It's full of holes in an already weak plot.<br />- No one notices that batman and Bruce both disappear at the exact same time for the same amount of time then return at the same time.<br />- An already half crippled Bruce gets his ass beat nearly to death but manages to escape prison by climbing and jumping.<br />- All it took to turn everyone in Gotham into a post apocalyptic nut job was telling them that batman wasn't the bad guy.<br />- Bane holds the city hostage with a nuke for three months for no reason.<br />- Bane and Ra's al Ghul's daughter are going to blow them selves up for no reason.<br />- Thousands of cops survived under ground for three months.<br />- Cops armed with hand guns and sticks attack terrorist with assault rifle and some how win.<br />- Batman manages to take a bomb more than 60 miles(the blast radius of the nuke) in only 1 minute.<br />- In that same minute, he manages to get out of the batwing without stopping even though we see him in the cockpit seconds before the nuke goes off.<br />- He lets Alfred think he's dead which was just a real a-hole move.<br />- He leaves all his bat gear to Blake who doesn't know how to use it, has no one to teach him, and wasn't trained by a league of assassins.<br />- And he thinks that no one will notice that both batman and Bruce Wayne died on the same day.<br /><br />There wasn't a part of this movie that wasn't filled with retarded plot holes. This was easily the worst batman movie ever made, and that's including the ones with Val Kilmer and George Clooney.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|I enjoy Christan themes whenever I watch movies, and I usually don't see that in secular movies. I would never have thought Disney would make such a serious religious graphic movie. I own this in 3D and found it to be outstanding. Don't let little children see it but it does scare the \\"bejesus\\" out of me. There is a decision to be made in your life where you want to go after you go die.<br />  The graphics are very clear and there is the falling out of the sky and flying through the trees for those who like the roller coaster effects. I give it 5 stars!

B008K8VDPU|4.0|I like this because you can play a melody on your own or you can follow the light for a large number of preprogrammed songs. It is easy even without instructions. I like it, my 9 year old grand likes it and my 80+ aunt likes it.  My only complaint is I can't understand how to play a second preprogrammed song. I end up going out of the program and then back in.
1608871517|5.0|This book by Michael Jackson's dresser, designer, Michael Bush is just exquisite!

Thank you so much for the time and detail you put into this beautiful book. The behind the scenes true stories about MJ are treasures. So meaningful coming from someone who knew and worked with MJ and was also his close friend for over 25 years. Thank you for sharing these stories and amazing details about making MJ's clothes/costumes with the world. God bless you Michael Bush.

B008LY9AWG|5.0|Pro:  it's Michael Connelly.  Con:  it's not enough Michael Connelly.  Pro:  it's three by Michael Connelly.  Con:  it's still not enough Michael Connelly.  Oh, wait!  There's also a preview of The Black Box.  What am I doing writing this?  I should be ordering The Black Box.  Why are you reading this review when you could be reading Michael Connelly?  Well, three Connelly gems:  Cahoots has more twists than the road in the title, and, by the way, that title is not a typo but rather a small splash of story.  You'll finish Cahoots with a smile, and plunge into the next one.  Mulholland Dive is rich in detail and overflowing with irony.  You will find yourself totally immersed in the protagonist's process and finish with a belly-laugh as you swing into the final of the trio.  All I can say is that Two Bagger is a walk-off hit.  Read this as you're waiting for The Black Box to arrive.  I have to go order mine now.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have always loved this musical and like this anniversary edition a lot. Made me smile that the Jonas kid started out years ago on Broadway as Gavoche. Not the strongest voice-but passable.

1451695195|4.0|This is not proof of heaven but more a failure of science. I found this book to be a good read, well written, and fast-paced. But, the author did not spend much time on his out of body experience, which led me to believe it was a short rather fleeting visit. Most of the book is his personal family life and how it related to the NDE. While Alexander did not \\"prove\\" his NDE scientifically, I am convinced he did indeed have a deep experience in the God realm. More than anything else, he did show (convincingly) how science/medical explanations for NDEs didn't hold water in this case. It appears that because his neocortex was not functioning at all, the usual claims of serotonin/drugs interacting with receptors infusing images, dreams, hallucinogens, voices, etc. that might create his experience, couldn't have happened. It's more complicated than I'm stating here. The Appendix B disputes any and all scientific/medical explanations or hypotheses for his experience, which is a fascinating read. If a person has no auditory or visual brain capability, and yet has this profound experience and memory of God and angels, it does lead one to believe that consciousness indeed does not lie in the brain or even inside the body. Perhaps our consciousness resides immediately outside the body, as a field of energy? At any rate, this book is certainly worthy for thought. I would recommend it highly. In a nutshell: Alexander illustrates how science fails to validate/explain how he could have this experience in his disfunctioning brain state. But the spirit/consciousness does validate it.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|It's not what I was expecting but it's a good movie. There are a few areas that could have been expanded on but all in all, it's good!
1847879071|3.0|Perfect transaction. The book it self its decent. The author is rather crude in the examples he uses and sometimes is unclear on telling the reader how to interpret results. Though for a how to on using SPSS its great, just not the best at explaining the concept behind the statistical analysis. Unless your running the exact same test with the exact same data & specifications used in the text. Its hard to relate to other data sets.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|l like the book fine other than the spelling errors and the questions the charictors had that they already knew the answer to but for some reason didn't. For instance, could zed helpRichard instead of the sisters? He knew but somehow didn't. True Seeker? IDK

0547884591|5.0|Tim this one is for you. Great book. I am obsessed with survival at the moment and once again you have created a book that seems to be written about my passions. You are always a step ahead of me. Also, I was learning to juggle yesterday, thanks to you. The kids loved it.<br /><br />If you don't get any of this then just buy the book. You won't regret it.

B005I64U5C|5.0|Yeah the Ultraviolet thing is a bummer if you are someone who wants to watch a movie anywhere... anytime...  anyway... (not for me) but what does that have to do with the actual quality of the audio/video or story of the movie? Blasting it with 175 one star reviews stating over and over that UV is a scam, etc., isn't really helpful. But I can offer this to aid you in your decision to buy or not to buy, as that is the question...<br /><br />No, you will not feel smarter after having watched it. It isn't a documentary or Non-Fiction story. It isn't based on real life or actual historic events.<br /><br />No, it will not solve any of the world's problems, save any lives, cure any diseases or stop any wars.<br /><br />No, you will not feel the need to send money to a charity, weep, wail or even hug the wife and say \\"oh, how lucky we are...\\".<br /><br />It will, however, entertain you in a big screen flashy action kind of way... and that is all it was meant to do.<br /><br />'nuff said... or whatever the DC guy would say instead. :P
0307593525|4.0|I got these after seeing the Julie Julia movie. Someday I hope to work my way through!

B002P5XXR0|3.0|I remember buying this CD here at Amazon based solely on it having a lot of five star reviews. I think that I listened to it just one time and stuck it on a shelf. At least one reviewer has written something like &#34;James Horner, love him or hate him&#34;- I don't hate the music, it's just better as subtle background accompaniment  than go it alone enjoyment.<br /><br />Try listening to samples before you buy it.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel, and the following Abhorsen books, are some of my favourite reads of this genre.<br /><br />The titular protagonist from the first book is a strong female character, who can be identified as a sort of a predetermined heroine through inheritance. Fate has left her with all the cards, and as such a great deal of pressure and responsibility. Sabriel is by no means a 'girls' story. It's a passionately written, dark and tragic tale which separates the building blocks of life from the never-ending constructs of death, and whatever mysteries lie beyond.<br /><br />In 2008, I introduced the Abhorsen Trilogy into my college library. They were a huge success straight away, and more copies were ordered in. When I found them a few years prior to that in my local bookshop, I noticed they were in the teen read section. They definitely branch out to a much wider audience. I'm still enjoying them in my 20's, as are many friends of mine who are 30+.<br /><br />Growing up with intense reads such as the work of Tolkien, and thinking there can be no competition for likes of The Hobbit, I was proven somewhat mistaken. My commendations go out to Nix for the Abhorsen stories. I think he's on the right track for more modern and younger audiences (although I will never tell someone not to read Tolkien!).<br /><br />Sabriel is a unique and imaginative tale about a rational soul who at her own expense, selflessly travels the many roads of danger and peril. She commits her life to conquering death, for the sake of the world around her. It left me appreciating what we have, while we have it. And who knows who's watching our backs out there?<br /><br />I can only hope it can offer the same sense of gratification to anyone who reads Sabriel, and the others in the series.
1250027624|5.0|I bought the series companion book &#34;The World of Downton  Abbey&#34; and loved it so when I learned that this book was coming as a follow up/advanced look at season 3 I knew I &#34;had to&#34; get it too.<br />This book has the same sort of beautiful photography and level of detail as its predecessor but seems to be divided into character sections complete with series related details and historical detail/background information.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series there will perhaps be a little spoiler detail but few will mind that because this book is such a fantastic series companion. Those with no series interest but interested in historical details or just in quality photography should also take a look. The book is well worth owning.

B002WJI66C|4.0|There are some pretty generic knock-offs of Mario out there in the wild, so you want to be careful.  Beware of anything that says import - often these are bootleg products very cheaply made (case in point, [[ASIN:B001L1TXA0 Super Mario Brothers : Bowser Plush - 10\\"]]).  However, I am relieved to say that this particular Boo is no such rip off.<br /><br />He is soft and looks identical to the Boos of the Mario video games.  You can stick his tongue back in his mouth, and when you squeeze his body his tongue pops back out.  He is comparable in size to other similiar Mario plush toys.  I've ran him through the wash a few times, and he has come through unscathed.  Yes, this is an import, but the key difference here is I believe this is a legitimate Nintendo product, which makes all the difference in the world.  They have excellent quality control.<br /><br />For those looking for a good ghost plush toy, this is the one to get!

B009X00E18|2.0|This case is sort of adequate, in that I believe that my Kindle is probably more secure in it than it would be out of it.  Pros: Sturdy back is lightweight and simple, easy to fit kindle into it.  Cons: There is very little (read: virtually none) protection if you drop your kindle.  This is not a padded/bumpered otterbox style case.  It is designed to be form fitting and not add much to the size factor, and if that is the most important thing to you, then this is fine.  But if you are more interested in protecting your investment, I think that one good drop to the ground from your night stand and I'd be worried about my screen.<br /><br />On the subject of the screen, let's discuss that lid flap.  In a word, virtually useless.  There is no closure to it, so while it does lay flat over your screen while your device is level, if you tilt the device, the screen cover will slide down.  There is an elastic band on the back that you can use to close it, which is fine, but I find my lid slipping a little even with the band in place, exposing the edge of the glass--exactly what I do not want.  The stand feature is a \\"one size fits all\\" type--the lid bends up and attaches to a groove in the back of the case. There is only one setting, so I hope that does it for you.<br /><br />I don't care too much about style, but if you are into style, then this takes \\"simple\\" to a new level.  There is essentially no additional pizazz added to your device.  That might be important for some, so I mention it.<br /><br />This is a no-frills case.  It is functional, and it is lightweight.  I'm not sure if it is going to do much to really protect my Kindle from a drop, and it certainly won't help with a spill, so I guess I'm going to need to invest in a case for my case.

During the course of his journalism career, he has been a successful writer, and has published many articles in National Geographic, Esquire, The New York Times, and Slate. His article for Slate is what brought him to his first ever memory competition. During his time at the event he was intrigued by the men that were participating. He was so impressed that he labeled the participants as savants, or masters of memory. The title of the book, Moonwalking with Einstein creates an interesting picture in your head which is one of the mnemonic devices that makes memorizing vast amounts of information possible. Foer believed that the title would invoke an image of Einstein doing the moonwalk, while wearing a sparkled silver glove on one hand. He believes that the human memory has a better time remembering items when they are attached with a crazy mental image.<br /> Foer's book is a self-help book unlike any other book in the genre.  His book takes a systematic approach to becoming a memory \\"savant.\\" He allows for the reader to take the journey along with him, by taking the year of training he went through and breaking it down into smaller amounts of information. Foer includes examples that the reader can use to better understand the basic concepts of memorization. Along with his step-by-step methodology, he also gives an entire chapter on what he believes is the beginning of the art of memorization. It seems like Foer and his mentors are inviting us into this secret club of people that are seen as super-human in most aspects. Foer himself believed them to be incredibly intelligent upon first glance. As we get to know the characters through their interactions with Foer, we see that they are just normal people that have had some training in a specific area of expertise. This normalization of these examples of superhuman memory, allow for the reader to become motivated to train and be like them.I would not be surprised, if at the end of this book, the reader undertook the training to become a memory champion.<br /> Moonwalking with Einstein was, in a many ways, a really easy read. While Foer could have gotten technical with how the brain works, he chose to keep it at a level that allows for the reader to understand. He begins the book with an emotionally traumatic event that Foer believed to be the birth of the art of memory. From there he shows the two extremes of memorization, using a man who remembered everything, and a man who forgets something as soon as he gets distracted. I believe that Foer chose to use the two extremes to better show the range that is seen with human memory. Foer uses them to help explain the way we remember, and the different brain structures responsible for our memory capabilities. During his visit to the United States Memory Championship, Foer met with a group of participants. These men are considered by Foer to be some of the most intelligent people in the world. During the rest of the book, Foer meets with these men frequently and they help him on his journey to becoming the champion of the United States Memory Competition. These men become teachers to Foer in the art of memorization, and they give him instructions on how to memorize the many things that are gauged in the championship. While Foer was learning how to memorize the numbers, dates, poems and pictures of people that are used in the contest to gauge his memory capabilities, he shared with the reader the tricks that the European men were teaching him. After one year of training, the book comes to an end with Foer in the U.S. Memory Championship using all of the methods that he learned to test his memorization skills against other people who have decided to participate in the championship.<br /> While reading Moonwalking with Einstein, I came across a section of the book that gave me some sense of how honing your memory can be used in a more practical goal than winning a championship. One of the European men, named Lukas, partied the night before an exam. The morning after his night out, he woke up at noon, and then learned everything he needed to in a memory blitz and passed his exam. The practical ramifications of being able to remember anything you wanted to, are almost endless. It does not just stop at passing any exam with very minimal effort, remembering names of the people you meet, or just keeping records of everything you do are all possible if you have training in memorization. Foer's other European friend Ed shows him how to master his to-do list, which is something that most people have trouble keeping up with. While this is not a self-help book in the normal terms, I found that I was learning tidbits of information that I could string along into a way to improve my memory exponentially.<br /> I would give this book a 4.5 out of 5 star point rating because; it was interesting to read, easy to understand, and an interesting topic to read about, however, there were some chapters that were a little drawn out and it took a while to get going. Overall, Moonwalking with Einstein was an enjoyable book featuring an average Joe's dedication to becoming a champion in what seems to be a near impossible-to-win championship. Foer's writing style was easy to read, and the examples given during the chapters were very helpful in the reader's overall understanding of the book. It seemed that Foer wanted to take his readers on the adventure of becoming a memory \\"savant,\\" instead of just giving the reader a list of things to do to improve their memory. His approach allows for the reader to have a guide through the challenging art of memorization, and overall makes the book more interesting and understandable.

B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie<br />Would recommend to any one to see this movie. Lots of action and the stars are all gteat
0446580848|3.0|I have been a Nelson de Mille and John Corey fan for years but I must say, they are slowly but surely loosing their mojo. John is as funny as always but over the length of this book one would look for a little more. The information on Yemen is also interesting but somehow I could not shake the feeling that the story was constructed around the main character more with the goal to give him another appearance than to tell a story, really. It was still above average entertaining and lots of good chuckles but it left me somehow missing something.
6305428042|5.0|some! Great price! Arrived on time! Perfect condition! And it's an awesome family movie to watch during Halloween or whenever! I would recommend the movie, item and seller. Two thumbs up.
0385344333|4.0|Lee Child and Jack Reacher stick to what they do best. A very tight story with great twists and an action packed finale. The story is very dialogue driven which makes it an easy and quick read. I like the first person narrative that Child occasionally employs a little better and maybe the conspiracy is a little far fetched but if you are looking for a good action read that also tickles your brain, you came to the right place. The only shame is that this book reads like the script for a movie which would be cool if one would not know that it will be Tom Cruise playing Reacher.
B00002SSKI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, so you understand why I would be so excited to find it at such a quality price. My ordered arrived early, in perfect condition and of course I watch it right away. I would certainly recommend this movie, product and seller.

B004PVKFR8|3.0|I was disappointed.  The only song I love is Sail, mainly because I was diganosed with ADD.  The rest of the album leaves something to be desired.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock is great. It is really easy to use. I can have different times for the week days and weekends.<br />I like the different tones and that I can pick music.<br />I suck at math so having to do a math problem to turn it off really works.

B006YXTRHY|3.0|Not impressed.  The movie was slow with little action.  If it was a set up for the Part 2 installment then I was glad I did not see it when it first came out.  It did make me want to see part 2 now.

B001GCUER0|5.0|Best show around! All the characters are so well developed and as for someone who was born in 1960, I can remember my parents acting just like the adults in this series (well, not like all of them)! Great cast of characters and attention to detail for the sets, the clothes, the hair and the attitudes.
