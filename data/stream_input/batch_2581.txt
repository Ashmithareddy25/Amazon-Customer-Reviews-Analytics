B00D6BN9NK|1.0|The more I think about this movie the angrier I get. To think of the money the studio wasted on this piece of trash... All those responsible for this production, from those who approved the horrible screenplay/script, to the producers and directors should be fired. Make room for some people who actually do have a modicum of creativity and talent.
B000O77QD8|4.0|I have learned that Eastwood learned must from his acting about how to well direct great films. This is pretty much a true story but probably not entirely accurate. My uncle was in Guadalcanal and has told me some but this tell all it can. See it just for history.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A quick but intellectual game for escape the room genre. Can't wait for the additional levels to be released.  Hey it's free, why not pick it up and give this game a try.  You won't be disappointed. I certainly wasn't.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I have an issue with the permissions it asks for.  There is no reason for this game to need access to gps to find my location.  That is ridiculous.  The game itself is pretty fun.  Simple but a good game.
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|I just finished the novel, and wanted to see the movie, but to be fair, a movie just can't match up to the written word.<br />The actors were good, the movie just didn't flow for me.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|This is a highly addictive little game.  it has a nice balance of strategy and luck.  fun to come back to if you want to waste time.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Thank goodness I have the 4th book already so I can start it NOW! The story is fabulous and I'm hooked!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Fun family movie - our son loves it! Love that Disney makes movies entertaining for both kids and parents. Loved it.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|The  story line was very interesting. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next, enjoyed it thoroughly. Would recommend it  to everyone.
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|This is simply the best box set ever.  The archive deluxe version has so much to offer it is almost impossible to describe.  The books, the memorabilia, the photos, the tickets, on and on. And the keepsake box is worthy of what may be the best live album of all-time.  The music explodes with the opening medley and reveals why this was the concert event of the 70s.  I am so glad I was there in Seattle and so glad I can relive this with this product.  Paul, thank you for putting this out there.
B000HX4ZF6|3.0|Moving with a lot of action. The drawbacks were some vulgarity and nudity. Mel Gibson shows stellar acting, The made for TV version is cleaner and better
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Thank you Mrs. Cain for shining the light on the introverts plight. I could relate to this book so well. If I wasn't afraid of rejection I'd loved to share it with those who need to know.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Fear, the trimuph over it. Learning to trust enough to let your gaurd down and fall in love again.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I really liked Gideon and Eva, they were very damaged people who found each other and seemed to be the answer to the others needs.  Let me recap this book:<br />Hot Sex<br />Eve describing Gideon as gorgeous with a big dick<br />Jealous incident (either character)<br />Hot Sex<br />Describe clothes<br />Eva describing Gideon as gorgeous with a big dick<br />Hot Sex<br />Deep meaningless heart to heart talks<br />Hot Sex<br />Coffee<br />Jealous incident<br />Hot Sex<br />Rinse and repeat.<br />It was truly the first time I found hot sex boring.<br />And it was about that tiresome reading it.  And now 2 more books to find out anything important about the story (thin as it is).  I loved the first book, enjoyed the second and just felt ripped off by the third.  And the sad part is I will probably buy 4 and 5 in the hopes that something (anything) will be resolved.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Why did I wait so long to watch?  On the other hand what fun to have so much watching pleasure in front of me.  Well acted and highly engaging.
B000QQRXF8|5.0|Now he is one cool cat cause he heard the guitar of Buddy Guy. This music is what the Blues are all about.
B00866JL96|5.0|I wish the movie wouldve went over the war part more but all and all I did really enjoy the movie. Learning to love again and to forgive to start a new life.
B001ACY8D2|3.0|This is very peaceful, ambient style music. I was hoping for something with some real instruments, but if these are real instruments, they worked really hard to sound like synthesizers.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book shows that life isn't always good. In this case the three kids lost there parents and home in a fire, then had to later live with a nasty man named count Olfe. The one person that almost saved them from more terror is a woman of law named justice. But in the end she was not allowed to adopt the children and count and his accomplices escaped and didn't go to jail.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a charming book.  Funny, historical and a great tale.  I have recommended it to all my friends.<br />Read it and enjoy.
B0014DCTCY|4.0|Great album buy a band that has been coming on strong in the past few years.  Also comes with a CD.  I recommend if you like the Black Keys and do not already own it.
B004LRNYJW|3.0|Chloe Moretz drew me to this version of the film. Let Me In is unlike modern vampire plots and remains captivating throughout. It leaves plenty of room for thought afterwards, too. However, I prefer the modern vampire movies with more action.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|My kids enjoyed this movie very much.  The action was great the story was very clever.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle season 5 is great. Love the show.  Would watch it on any device.  Great to have it on My Kindle for watching it anywhere.
B0002O06NA|4.0|This one along with Magic Potion, Attack and Release, and Brothers, I haven't exactly wore out on the turn table.  But it's a solid album and I recommend it to any one who enjoys The Black Keys and doesn't already own it.  This one came with a digital down load card, which I always appreciate.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you liked/loved the first JJ movie having something to do with \\"Star Trek,\\" then you're going to fall head over heels in love with this one.  The first JJ effort (Star Trek 2009, Star Trek 11 or whatever), did well at the box office, though perhaps not as much as JJ and Paramount INC liked, so yeah, warp speed and we get a sequel.<br /><br />Considering how absolutely great the first JJ Star Trek flick was/is, I wondered before I saw a frame of this instant masterpiece, could JJ ever come even close to giving us a great sequel?  Well, the answer is yes, yes, and an extra yes!  All the regulars from the first JJ film are back, and more!  Yet, of course, one of the keys to the success and long-livety of the very first original Star Trek TV show, was in the writing.  The direction an afterthought (until JJ).  Here, JJ and crew live up to not only the almost sacredness of the original show, and the first few big screen flix and spinoff series, but go beyond that.<br /><br />Fortunately, JJ Abrams has already proven his worth in \\"Hollywood\\" time and time again, as not only a man of great creativity and vision generally, but the guy who brought back the Star Trek franchise back to life.  Not that it was ever broken, but it had \\"been\\" a few years...<br /><br />The first movie by JJ was just so perfect, imho, but this one ups the bet.  JJ and Paramount have wagered that those misguided souls who bought into the first film's wonderful cosmic vision of humankind's near future, might let down with the sequel.  But, judging from the box office and acceptance among ST drones, hope lives inside and outside this clearly five-star effort based upon characters created by Gene Roddenberry...<br /><br />I will leave breakdowns of the various pro's and con's of this sequel to 2009's brilliant original to others for the meantime, but the first film was such a ground-breaking tribute to all that is good and decent in the Star Trek universe, (JJ's first, startrek 11, st2009, zzzzz), that this is just icing on the cake.  The first offered lens flares?  They are here, in spades.  Jittery and zoomiee phony director techniques?  JJ drenches us in them, praise the Lord.  And all our favorites are back.  Obnoxious Kirk, goofy Spock, interpretations of others, i.e., McCoy, Scotty, Uhuruh (Spock's \\"lover\\" oops spoiler alert), and good impressions of Sulu and Chekov.  All give oscar award consideration performances, and if JJ doesn't win best picture for this, then there just ain't no justice in the whole dang universe...<br /><br />This is great cinema.  This is \\"art.\\"  And while this review is based upon seeing just a few minutes of this, that was more than enough.  And I really, really, really mean that a few minutes of this is way more than enough, just like it was with JJ's original.  Extra DVD/Blu-Ray versions have tons of extra features and all go to make you just worship this JJ effort.  The JJ \\"lens-flare\\" discussion, is for gold.  As is the featurette, \\"JJ and ST 2013: Further spoiling a worn-out franchise.\\"  There are other DVD/Blu-Ray features which JJ and Paramount have included, like \\"JJ: What's this Star Trek all about?\\"  Extra stuff like this is included.  Much more than I can go into here.<br /><br />Since the original JJ Abram's Star Trek first came out, there has been a somewhat muted debate of what JJ had actually done, with his \\"rebooting\\" of the ST brand.  Some have seen it as heaven-sent, some otherwise, but let me just end this by saying that, and I almost choke when I write this, Star Trek 2009 is absolutely nothing.  I mean, St2K9 is old news and nowhere as good as this first JJ sequel.  So, rush right out and see it or buy this product, to joyfully, blissfully, enjoy one of the greatest filmmaker's of all time, JJ Abrams, and his brilliant, much better than the original, artwork, called (appropriately), \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness.\\"  The split second, but so totally filmic comfort food special effects shots, alone make this a mustbuy!<br /><br />Hats off, lens flare off, steady-cam on, steady-cam off, lens flare on, 3d on and off and who cares, and two thumbs up for the obvious talent employed in the making of this, this ageless epic for all times.  This is, nuff said, the greatest motion picture of all times, and yay, JJ gets to bring similar glorious renewal to Star Wars,...<br /><br />If our pal JJ does for Star Wars what he did for Star Trek, I can't wait!<br /><br />JJ Abrams rules.  He just rules, that's all.  This is not a film, but a work of art.  Thank you JJ, thank you...<br /><br />Sarcasm off...buy!<br /><br />Hats off, lens flare off, steady-cam on, steady-cam off, lens flare on, 3d on and off and who cares, and two thumbs up for the obvious talent employed in the making of this, this ageless epic for all times.

B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Classic base quality star trek music with new action, next &#34;generation&#34; upbeat feel!  This is a &#34;must have&#34; album for any Star Trek Fan.!
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I liked it. It is a stand alone movie so one hasn't had to have seen the old one first.
B000HN3340|4.0|I purchased this Black Keys LP along with a few others at the same time.  None are as good as El Camino IMO but it's still enjoyable.  I'm not sure if this one came with a download card or not.  But most of their albums either come with one or a CD.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I would ask how much longer until the next installment, but I hear that every time someone asks, he kills a Stark.<br />O.o
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|We were looking for something to watch one night and chose this movie because it stars Julianne Hough.  I think it helps if your expectations are low to begin with (it seems whenever I'm expecting a movie to be great I'm disappointed).  Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie very much.  The ending caught me by surprise.  I like movies with twists and turns--that I can understand :)
B009439HEY|4.0|It is a very good followup to the previous one,, i am a growing Steve Hackett fan and this is a welcome addition to his music.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I do not have a twenty word summary for this show, but I guess I will try my best to think of a few.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|It might b a great app if I could figure out how to use it.The help section needs to be improved.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|AN AWESOME GAME. I would rated it five stars with the exception that it took forever to down load. But it was worth the the wait space it took. Just a side note to the developers you need give longer time to status updates before the games starts under the mission statements.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|So I got this game yesterday and I've been playing online play like crazy I'm hooked on this game also I'm unstoppable no one can kill me they try but I'm a monster at this game nice job gameloft this is a fun game if you make a 2nd version I'm so getting it.
B000T433CO|4.0|This is a really good movie. It shows that one can get out of a bad situation and a clean start is possible. It isn't just one feel good stories, it is two in one movie
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The book was ok, but more than anything I was really bothered by the gender roles that this book put forth. Why do these romances always have to be about a woman who needs a man to \\"take care of\\" and \\"provide for\\" her? Megan was supposed to be a smart, strong and independent woman (she's a free-lance software engineer!), but when she meets Conner, she drops her whole life and moves to basically become Connor's trophy wife \\"to fulfill his business obligations\\" (i.e. attending business dinners and such). The entire novel was frustrating to me as Connor was the typical powerful, domineering, rich man and Megan was made to look like the vulnerable, weak woman whose life needed a man to revolve around. Why can't smart and strong women ever be featured in these kind of novels?!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great season with surprising twists to the story!! Amazing acting by everyone!! Must watch ... I didn't know period drama can be that interesting!!
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Just started watching. Like what I see so far. I like watching the British shows. Looking forward to watching more.
B000FC12C8|5.0|This book is a must read for all serious investors. Like the Millionaire Next Door, you almost can't afford not to buy this book. The money you will make and accumulate with the information this book contains offers a return on investment that you can't refuse. This book costs $15 for the Kindle version. That's nothing for the investing knowledge and guidance that it imparts.<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is that the \\"updated\\" commentary isn't really that recent. The most recent examples from the commentary date only to 2003. It would be nice to see it updated to discuss the Great Recession and its impact on investing, though of course the basic assumption is that the GR provided one of the greatest opportunities to buy undervalued stocks in American financial history.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I never liked killing games but this game Is my favorite.The only thing I don't like about it is the pop ups
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My family and I loved this movie.  I wasn't too sure about it at first.  It was one weekend when there was nothing to really rent that we hadn't already seen.  So we decided to watch this and I'm glad we did.  Excellent movie. Will watch again.
0307341577|4.0|I've read Sharp Objects and loved the dark twists in, Dark places does the same thing however I wish they could have talked about all the family members and not just two or three. It'll keep you interested until the end.<br />Great read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books so much<br />They are very action packed and have a little romance but also has some sadness
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Just like that u can be a ranger in no time, just think of the things u will do and it's free have fun
B0088TG252|5.0|We Love the movie, love the actors.  And of course anything Denzel Washington is in is probably a great movie.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|I'd like to put something worse there in the title but won't. I have never seen more of a huge load of crap ever for a series that was once so good. When in the heck did it going from a smartly written series to something you'd find on the back of a cereal box. Wait! That is an insult to cereal boxes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|What a great and beautiful book . .......the relationship Charlie has with his parents and friends is wonderful ........ love the book
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was an amazing book about a country I knew very little about.  I have read all three books by this author and will continue to read anything he writes.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I've been wanting to see this for awhile.  I heard mixed reviews.  Some people said they hate it, some said they loved it.  But we loved it.  Good actors, good direction, will watch again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totally awesome.I play this game every day of the year. Hope the everybody loves this game if you don't u r s claim I think that they can improve but it is still fun
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Wow so much more than I assumed and not what I assumed......it was something I watched with landlady 20 years my senior and we were both brought into conversation on current topics as well as loving movie including the ending.....I hate a great movie with a suck ending or no ending specifically to set up sequal..feel so taken....this movie was great and I am picky!!!!
B009UZLRJE|1.0|After reading the reviews for this product, I decided not to purchase it. I'm surprised Amazon would even be willing to continue advertising it on their website after reading that customers who have purchased this set claim the discs have been pirated. It looked like such a great deal, but I'm glad I read the reviews first.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|If you are a liberal you will probably like this better than a conservative.  It is a movie about how shady politics are used to initiate governmental change that is not in the constitution.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, loved solving clues plus that add of the creepy music made it even better. Download app, guarantee you'll love it ^_^
0525425772|5.0|I bought this for my own personal pleasure.  I love John Grisham books and I can't wait to start reading this one.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This movie is adorable and funny.  I don't even mind watching it over and over with my kids.  I love how my daughters will point out how mean the emperor was in the beginning and how he changed during the movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of the best games ever.you bread and hatch dragon eggs like right now I am getting the limited spring dragon.
B001DE29SS|5.0|Movie was based on this man's life.  It was great to watch the silent scenes.  All the persons in this movie did a great job of  acting
B005NPCBI6|5.0|For what Pink Floyd had become, this is a very good Pink Floyd album. Very solid from beginning to end, with a refreshing and uplifting take to the music, as if bursting forth with a lot of energy from the group that had been bottled by Waters. It's their last great album. As good as it is, I puzzle at the end ...  the last cut 'Sorrow', a great song ... but it just fades out. It just seems like such a great album would end more precisely or with some great execution or statement.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you cannot relate to this movie in every way, you have not lived .  All of this fits into your life
0553573411|1.0|Repeatedly the character didn't see the easy way out and just did stupid stuff.<br /><br />For example in the end when he was in jail, why didn't he convey to the other lords what he knew would happen.  Or when it started happening he had multiple avenues to let them know what was going on.<br /><br />This book was slow moving and tedious.
0143119680|5.0|Not sure why this isnt more mainstream. I could see a ton of people (read:  people who enjoy books that women enjoy) loving this book.
B0050JN88M|5.0|I've been a Deep Purple fan for years and always found it a challenge trying to find music or video from the MK IV period. This pretty much has it all! Although the story of Tommy Bolin is tragic, he did leave us with some great music. It's just too bad his arm was screwed up when they took the quality video of him. The concert footage is pretty bad by today's standards, but it is fun to watch. The documentary is fantastic. It's nice to hear Glenn Hughes and Jon Lord (may God rest his soul) tell first hand accounts of the various tribulations that the band went through. If you are a Deep Purple or Tommy Bolin fan, you will love the whole thing. If you are a music fan, skip the concert footage and watch the documentary - it will still be worth it.
B00957T6X6|4.0|The GoT book series is awesome. Great story, characters, etc. I'm just starting to read the series after watching the first three seasons on HBO. However, this compilation of books is poorly executed on the Kindle. You need to save your location constantly or you'll lose your place. If you click on a link in the index, it takes you to the chapter in the very last book.<br /><br />It's frustrating, but I deal with it by saving my spot constantly. Someone else more articulately explained this above, but I thought I'd throw my review out there as well.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Definitely one of the coolest games I've played in a long time.  It's hard to put down and harder to master.  I think I'm going to play it again right now.
0811875040|1.0|I am a very experienced baker. This is one of the most poorly edited and poorly thought out cookbooks, I have ever seen. It boggles the mind that someone let this go to print.<br /><br />My concerns with the crazy measurements and mistakes have been addressed by other reviewers. I won't go into those. I simply want my disappointment to be known. I don't expect like every recipe. I do expect the recipes to be accurate.
B0014ERKO0|2.0|rank low in action, sci-fic list. well, it feels like cheap movies trying to make money but i wouldn't pay money for this type of boring generic movie that has no creativiity
145160713X|5.0|Lewin (from MIT) is a consomate educator of science. He will make you love science if you don't already. Read it and then watch his  MIT free course
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Absolutely love it! The story is great and the acting and singing are outstanding! Very sad that show was cancelled after season 2.
B0047E9TRA|2.0|acting is good; the story line is just sad and not what i expected. the movie is slow and can be boring. well, if you looking for something entertaining. stay away from this
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Works well and has a lot of icons to pump up the 'cute' factor. A slight edit issue makes you jump through a few hoops but overall a nice calendar.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|I had seen this movie before and liked it.  I wanted to see it again and couldn't find it anywhere until I checked on Amazon.<br />It is a very interesting movie about a Russian Dancer  who has defected and whose plane goes down over Russia and he is captured and not allowed to leave.  Very eerie scenes of Russia and Siberia.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Like everyone I had my doubts when I heard Alice in Chains had a new front man but I must give credit where credit is due.  They sound better than ever and although different still relevant.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|Just one long battle if that is what you like.  Where was the humor and love and story for that matter?  I didn't think the ending of the battle made sense either.  I had reread all of the books leading up to this last one I was so excited.  Also I was hoping there would be a little about everyone picking up their lives afterward.  I was really disappointed.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Cool look and feel. Very nice real estate management. I use it on my kindle and the display looked amazing. It pulls information and pictures and video from facebook, twitter and linkedin. Very comforting to see everything at one place in nicely organized way.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|this new version was well worth the wait! All the favorite features are there plus new ones! I love it!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I love this version of Persuasion. The acting is subtle and beautiful. Casting is perfect. Feels true to the authors intention of the book.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Wonderful product.  Easy start, no smelly fluid.  Can be used to add extra coals with a minimum<br />of time and effort.  Highly recommend.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|best game ever but you need to be a level 7 to do multiplayer on it.other than that its like ice age but you battle bad guys but parents there is no blood or violence
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a really super fun game! We like it so much that I've bought this game for friends and family, who all love it, too!
1932735410|5.0|Passed it with the help of this book! It was a great study aid in my preparation for the exam the second time around!
B001EC3JME|3.0|It seems rugged enough, and has a very sturdy clip.  The clip is a little hard to use - which is probably good because I can't imagine it coming loose or sliding off of a belt.  I used it for a MagLite XL50 with lens pointing down and although it held it securely, only time will tell if it would maintain its elasticity.  It also was very difficult to re-holster the light without really looking at the case to see what was going on, and my light is small.  The case is open on top and bottom, so with the XL50 I had to be conscious that the lens was not sticking through the open side to get scratched or possibly fall out.  If it did stick through the case, there is no protection for the lens.<br /><br />I used this case while wild boar hunting, and it did work ok.  I'm just not sure I'll continue to use it because it didn't cover the lens, it was difficult to re-holster (not because it was too tight, but the way the opening is made) and it doesn't seem like it will hold the XL50 securely for me over time.  With a bigger flashlight, or one that is not all the same diameter (larger part sticking out the top), it should be ok.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|well, i was born into &quot;the media age&quot; and so decided to get a twitter, i couldn't get it to work on my computer, but it worked on kindle fire. i now have a fully functional twitter, and i'm very happy about it. after setting it up on here, it started working on the computer, but not nearly as well... follow me: @orange_clay
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book!  I'm so glad the final book is out!  I can't wait to read it and can't imagine it being anything but wonderful!  This is a wonderful book written by a wonderful author.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Very exiting book from first page to the last. Looking forward to the next sequel, Highly recommended and start with no 1
B008Q0D32S|5.0|The acting, writing, and cinematics are all great! This western is on my top three list!! It easily ranks up there with \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\".
B003H6KRIE|2.0|I like the movie in bluray.  The problem is the same with most Universal Studios blurays, that screen saver that comes on if you pause for a short period of time that freezes up the player.  I like to walk around during movies, but with many you cant do that.  Depending on your blu ray player, it may be very inconvenient.  Wish the Blu Ray format didnt have so many kinks.<br /><br />Also, too many movies are coming out on sale for a week, then being offered at a lower price a week later.  Makes me wonder what is happening with the blu ray industry.
1932100660|5.0|This book is incredible! One of the best I have ever read on how what we eat reflects on our health and why Americans are so confused about what to eat since we seem to always get such conflicting advice. Everyone should read this book!
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book when I was a kid. Now that I am an adult with kids of my own they love it as well. Not only is it an entertaining book for kids but we have used it to help with fear of &#34;monsters&#34; - seems to work great.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Assuming you have an IQ of above 85 and a mental capacity to sit still for 3 hours then you will enjoy this movie. Wasnt what I expected but the switching between the time periods and the sudden starts and stops would make William Faulkner proud.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Its great for day to day or hour by hour,  recommended for everyone and accurate. I would recommend this to everyone.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|again this book was also a very good read.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I love these types of books.  Very interesting.
B0027MJU00|5.0|It was a little dark at times - and intense - but so well written that I couldn't put it down. If you love Flynn's writing style you will love this book.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I liked the movie tremendously, but so full of historical inaccuracies it was hard to stomach. Does not take into account what SEVERAL countries did to aid in this matter including the Brits and NZ. Great acting by Arkin and Goodman. They stole the movie.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|First, \\"Maps With Me\\" is not a sat-nav, that would cost more than 25 times what the pro version of this app costs, if you need a sat-nav then buy one.<br />Or<br />It's not a replacement for those hi-detailed maps that cost more than the pro version of app does for a small area, if you want or need these then buy them.<br /><br />If you need offline maps of anywhere in the world and have the facility to have them with you wherever you are, then this is a good choice, is quick, uncomplicated and does the job, the basic (free) version just gives you access to the maps, upgrading to the pro (at cost) gives you access to the GPS facilities and map pins.<br />Is the pro version worth the cost? Yes, if only to reward the company for the constant updates to the maps (update every 2 or 3 weeks). There is a new building development near where I live, it's not on Garmin sat-nav (I own one), or Tom-Tom sat-nav, yet! It's been on Maps With Me for 6 months.<br />The maps are easy to read and can be zoomed into street level, if you need to see individual buildings then look elsewhere, the maps also take space on either your device or memory card, I have a big chunk of western Europe taking less than 2 GB.<br />I seem to be using the app every week to plan trips, excursions and holidays.<br />And this is the only paid for app I have.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I chose to read this book because of the title and the pictures. It turned out to be quite different than I expected, but I found it to be a fun read.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It has so many different stories it is hard to put them together. I expected more of this author. Just an average read.
0446693804|5.0|Nicholas sparks is one of those authors who can make take you very easily to his own world through his wonderful heart touching stories and characters!! Nice book to read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SUFFER BUT IT SCHOULD BE EASIER TO GET MONEY AND CHARACTER'S ALSO BOARD'S THE LAST THING U SHOULD UPDATE IT TO CALIFORNIA LIKE L.A. OR SOMETHING
B0095P31L6|4.0|The times my grandson comes to visit he always wants to see Rango, it seems to keep him throughly entertained.
B003498SDA|5.0|Someone once said 'you could tune a piano to this movie', and I completely agree. Every moment, every look, every line, every shot are all perfectly thought out and move to build the relationship between these two characters and push them on their terrifying journey. Every character, be it Lenny (Max's dispatcher) or the gang member who tries to steal Vincent's suitcase, feels like a complete and wholly realized character who we are now only seeing for a brief moment. Periods of quiet are punctuated by extreme outburst of violence, but unlike in the film 'Drive', it all feels earned here. These characters are real people, and their journey is awe-inspiring.
1781162646|5.0|Coming of age.  What does this really mean?  With craftsmanship unlike any author I know, King is able to capture the seemingly crushing weight of youth and then move his readers through the transformation of an individual's hurt to an understanding of worldwide suffering.  And though our years may be surrounded by struggle, there are days to be treasured above all others.  This is his gift to us.  To express joy despite sadness, hope despite loss, and good despite evil.  To miss this book would be to miss an experience well worth remembering.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was AWESOME! I was so happy when the book became available because I knew I would love it. I could not put it down because it was so intense. The sexual encounters were so hot and steamy until they made my toes curl. I just love Eva and Gideon as a couple. He is type kind of man some women about. It's going to be hard waiting for the next book. Sylvia Day has become one of my favorite authors. I would recommend this book and read it over and over again.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|I waited til the DVD/BRD came out to see this. I was kind of disappointed, after the long wait. I heard good things about this movie but it was not original at all. It follow's the same pattern as the Wizard of Oz, and it should have given more considering that movie was made over 50 years ago. I mean the part at the end where he gives them each something. Come on, couldn't you think of anything original. I bought this to have, and thought that I would enjoy watching it again, now I wish I would have just rented it on Vudu, or Amazon, instead of buying it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After reading Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I periodically checked for any new novels by Khaled Hosseini.  He is a gifted writer.  I was a little disappointed in this book however.  Though it had some poignant moments, it just didn't grab me like the other 2 novels did.  I will ready more of his books though as I really like his writing style.
030758836X|3.0|Flynn is obviously a talented writer, but this book took me to a place I would rather not have gone. This book reminded me of an episode of 'Seinfeld' or 'Always Sunny' in that our protagonists are horrible people who do horrible things and life goes on. Problem is, this formula doesn't work as well packaged as a thriller novel.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Not sure about the other ratings I got the book for my husband based on those ratings and he didn't care for the book
0143119680|4.0|A surprisingly good read, even for those of us who cringe at the idea of a witch-vampire romance. Good plot, good characters, and I learned some things (the author's day job is history professor). Second book is even better, but you need to read this one first for context.
B000FBJF3M|4.0|Fun book to read if you would like to know how life under Roman rule and how the elite Romans lived at the time. Getting a glimpse of the incredible engineering that took place to develop the aqueduct system was really amazing. The love story that tied everything together was acceptable but not great, but one shouldn't let this mild weakness get in the way of the bigger picture, i.e., the Roman Empire. The description of the Vesuvius eruption was very good and I hope based on records of surviving eye witnesses. Good read, highly recommend it.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Guess his still finding his groove on this album.<br />Hase all his albums and this is the one I lysten to least of all.<br />A few gems here and there.
0143036238|5.0|I just love this version of a wonderful Austin classic.<br />Matthey Macfadyen is great as Darcy and Keira Knightley is great as well.<br />I have watched it more than 20 times.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Obviously his best.<br />Had heard a lot of these tracks live and on the radio previously buteven better on an album all together.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Very entertaining. Some of our kids are studying Greece and mythology in school so it was fun to watch this fictitious but entertaining movie.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Intelligent, fascinating story taking the reader onto a historical journey. Couldn't put it down and enjoyed the characters throughout. Looking forward to the completion of the trilogy and hopefully more to come from this author in the future.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I have enjoyed this show from day one! This is so interesting and keeps me wondering what could happen next love it!
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie Raitt has not softened a bit with Slipstream. Each piece makes me listen harder. Sit down, shut up and turn it on.
B008133MDK|5.0|I didn't know how they could get better than season one but they managed it.  The finally is truly amazing.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book gives great insight to how the presidents inneract.  Very informative and a great history book that fills in the gaps.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I am very impressed with their adaptation of Sherlock Holmes into the current day.  I cannot say enough except i really wish they would of made more seasons besides one and two.
B00699SDR8|1.0|I'm hoping it was just a poor translation - but while the content was good the writing was most appropriate for a fifth or sixth grader.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|It is too easy because you are able to keep buying letters. On Ipad you can only buy a word once....I'd like it more if it was more like the Ipad version.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This was a very colorful and creative movie, I loved all the neat scenes, very bright and beautiful, especially in HD. As for the movie itself, it was good, not amazing. But I would still rent again.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|A western with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara always plays well together. there is a lot of humor and battle of the sexes.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|It's worth a skim if only to finally see the end of this bloated series.  I wished I stopped after the first three or four books.  The final book doesn't leave you wishing for more but does give an adequate if not mediocre end to a very drawn out series.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|some of the hidden object puzzles were too dark and a little more mystery would be nice but still fun.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Blah is the way I would describe this installment.  The author seemed to be reaching.  I know this is a &#34;Fantasy&#34; novel, but the previous books had a certain &#34;realness&#34; lacking here.  The characters seemed more farcical and &#34;soap operaish&#34; than before (especially Cersei).  As interesting as she has been before, she couldn't come up with a better scheme?......<br /><br />The secondary characters were trite and boring, which made for a somewhat plodding &#34;I can't wait to be done&#34; reading experience.
B00BEYYEE4|2.0|Broken City<br /><br /> I didn't like the movie.<br />It was dark & depressing<br />I wouldn't recommed this movie to anyone<br />I will not watch this movie again
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent to pass the time on an airplane....and had person next to me ask me what game it was so that he could download it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Recommending to anyone who wants to take a peek behind the veil.  And to those who want to curb their appetite.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|The whole CD is killer!!  Quality, timeliness on delivery....very pleased customer!  I wasn't a fan of Hailstorm until we jammed to it on the patio with some cold beverages
B0091THRCU|5.0|Horrible stitching and glue work! Scratches the glass bottom of the phone! Returned it and got a different case instead!<br /><br />Update 6/18/13 : I was contacted by a customer service person. They were very friendly and explained that they wanted to make things right and send me out a replacement. Very rare these days for a company to contact you about a complaint and make it right. I will recommend them in the future their customer services in second to none!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Decent app but when you record a program to listen to later the audio only plays in the left channel.  No good.  Please fix!!!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I started watching the show a few weeks ago and now I have my wife and daughter hooked. They love it.
1475143389|5.0|I'll be brief with this, I enjoy my life. Enjoying life, to me, isn't defined by spending hours each day in the gym. Fortunately I'm neither a model or porn star but I still wanted to lose weight (for overall health), get into better shape, and replace some fat with muscle. This book filled the bill precisely. Mike tells you everything you need to know from diet & supplements right down to the specific training plans. The best part is that while it takes some work it is completely DO-ABLE. Mike has a down to Earth and reverent writing style that helped me blaze through the book in a day flat. You'll be off and applying the new things you learned in the book immediately. Further, Mike makes himself available on his Facebook Muscle for Life) page AND even takes the time to email you to ask how things are going. As a matter of fact, he was so kind as to answer a question for me before I even purchased the book. If you value efficiency, looking good, feeling better, and proper non-excessive supplementation this is the book for you!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER has always been one of the old school power hero's. For along time he and SYLVESTER STALLONE were the go to guys when it comes to the action packed 'shoot em up' type of movie. But as the years have gone buy new faces like Farrell, Vin Decil, Will Smith, etc. have filled the theaters. But Arnold comes roaring back after a decade of hiatus to pull off a very decent movie! It was like he'd never left. Maybe a little less physical (which Is understandable at his age) but you hardly notice. Small town sheriff with a few good deputies ( Johnny Knoxville pulls the side kick off with his usual quircky humor) fights off an army of drug runners, great!' would recommend this movie to all. Oh, and he always comes away with a new catch phrase: I'll be back, or the like....this time it's: This is my town!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love watching this show. My daughter-in-law got me hooked on it a few months ago and I have watched the first 2 seasons so far. Can not wait to get started on season 3.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Its ok but my mom thought I was watching pork SOOO MANY PORN ADDS if ur 13 like I am don't download this crape PLZZZ TAKE THE PORN ADDS OFF I GOT GROUNDED
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was hoping to see how this story ended, instead I was left hanging. I too was under the impression that this was the last book in the TRILOGY! I am angry that this book ended as it did. I waited for Entwined to be released, but I will NOT wait for another book to come out. I am done with this series. I also don't think it is worth what I have paid so far & I will not be buying any more. Sorry Ms. Day, I am very disappointed in the way you are stringing us along. Eva & Gideon's story will have to end here for me.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great, I now can download from my library and read books from my Kindle Fire HD.  I was never much of a reader before I purchased my device.
B00005JM02|5.0|Disney movies are a favorite in our family. They get watched over and over again. We can't wait to see the new one that they're planning.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game once u start u find urself not able to put ur kindle down. I played once and haven't stopped. My kid wants to play but no way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This version may not be the current version, but it's still really awesome and being able to play it everywhere you go is awesome to. Buy it! It's worth the 7 dollars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very fun and addicitive I love it and hope everyone who reads this installs  this game...... I really hop e everyone loves this game.!
0062215507|5.0|I'm a really big Harry Potter  fan. It was amazing to read some interviews to get closer to the film making process. I would suggest this book to people that like Harry Potter movies and would like to know a  little more about it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 games is the most addicting game or should I say games I've ever played. FUN but beware these games are very addicting!
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Simple Plan continues to make awesome music with this gold mine here. Every song is very listenable and worth the attention.  Anyone who thinks I'm wrong might need to read this review, and listen to it once more to see if it will actually change their mind:<br /><br />Another time, every single song is a 5/5. WOW!!! I must really enjoy reviewing excellent albums.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is very good.I just wish that there were more places and cars.I wish there was a mountain climb one. I still love the game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Could not put it down so mysterious and interesting. I recommend this if you're looking for a creepy mystery game, takes some thinking and has hinted just in case you get stuck
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Many question what happens when we die....or where we go.  This book offers a beautiful perspective on how to imagine heaven and posits the possibility that what we may pass off as a premonition, deja vu or a strange cluster of coincidences could be more than we perceive at a Human level.  The bittersweet tone seems appropriate as the tragedy is overlayed with the authors imagination of how those who have died may still hold an ethereal presence in our lives.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The shadow hunters signature ability make me want more tattoos. The vision I have of these marked ninjas of death rises far above what I expected from a romance novel
B00D41H2PS|2.0|This game is one of the most annoying games I've ever played. I like these types of games, but the correct puzzle solutions either have to be executed repeatedly before they work, or the tools do not move into their correct places. Had I known this game was so riddled with technical problems I would not have purchased it. Execution needs much work.  A hint guide would be a plus as well. Very disappointing.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I lost my mother at the age of 14 to cancer and can so relate to the hole left behind and the need to grow on your own to fill it. Beautiful words. Wonderful story. A great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a knitter and was drawn by the titles, but knitting really has nothing to do with the story.... no matter, the premise of the story is clever.  I can't wait to read more.  No spoilers here... lots of other folks have done that already. =)
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I stumbled into Bigger Leaner Stronger after a year of searching through the internet for a workout plan that I could stick to, not cost me hundreds of dollars, and didn't contradict itself.<br /><br /> I immediately became hooked to this book after noticing that Michael Matthews does not encourage you to buy fancy supplements or try the latest and most effective plan that will cost you hundreds of dollars. You can instantly see how valuable the info in the book really is, as if he were just laying it out there and keeping no secrets, unlike any other fitness coaches.<br /><br /> Best of all, even after finishing the book I decided to send an email to the author with some questions I still had, and they were all answered, which is greatly appreciated.<br /><br /> In short, I have nothing but good things to say about this book, and I'm pretty sure everyone who has read it will agree with me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the most creative, suspenseful and entertaining show on TV.  I don't have cable or satellite but stream from my blue ray player and its nice to be able to get caught up on my favorite show!
0060545682|5.0|Me encantó, describe a su gente, sus anécdotas, se describe ella misma.<br />Lo mas que me gustó fue la similaridad con mi país, me sentí muy identificada.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I enjoyed this game about as much as &#34;Cut the Rope&#34;. It was challenging enough that I needed to find a walkthrough to complete certain levels with 3 stars.
0385721234|5.0|Me encantó!!!<br /><br />Percibes los olores, las sensaciones, el amor... en fin todo. Cada detalle es esencial, perfectamente entendible a través de la escritura.<br /><br />Altamente recomendada. Para aquellos que les gusta sentir a través de la lectura.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|I admit it, I was intrigued by the premise and the cast.  The idea of Hansel and Gretel growing up and going after witches made me think this film, absurd as it sounded, could actually get some things right the terrible Van Helsing film didn't, or at least be amusing as it failed.  I was very wrong...<br /><br />First of all, the effects are terrible.  It looks like something you would see in a cheap Sci Fi channel flick.  At least there you aren't paying for it and know what you're getting going in.  From the troll to the witches 'flying' on their tree branches, it had the look of a student film.<br /><br />Second, the acting.  I have liked Renner's work in the past, same for Famke Janssen.  Arterton has always been nice to look at.  There was nothing to show any of them had looked at the lines until five seconds before the cameras rolled.  Decent actors trying to make the best of what they had to work with, which leads us to...<br /><br />The writing.  This story is so lame it would be laughable except for all of the above.  Hansel and Gretel get separated at one point.  When he regains consciousness does he try to find his sister or at least figure out if she's alive?  No, instead he takes a roll in the hay with the local wench who turns out to be (wait for it...) a good witch!  A witch who can't do magic or anything else you would really associate with being a witch, but a witch.  How she knows I'm not sure.<br /><br />Seriously, if you are looking for over the top funny horror, go back to the classics like Evil Dead (the original) films or Shaun of the Dead.  You'll thank me for it later.
1432794426|5.0|If you think your love for Michael is deep.You must read this book to find just how deep it truly runs.You will find much more than the performer. It's Michael the Father, Son, Friend and Human. Thank you Dr.Karen Moriarty for this beautiful insight on getting to know Michael Jackson &#34;The Man&#34;. My favorite Michael Jackson book to date.
B00BD07SGU|5.0|Just when you think Amorphis can't get any better - this is some of the best music I have ever heard and the more you listen to each and every song you really appreciate that there is music like this when there is so much worthless music in the world - again, Tomi Joutsen is the best singer that ever was - everyone should get a chance to see Amorphis perform live and see Tomi and how amazing he is
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great  movie classic - All movies old to new plus bonuses, my 7yr old loves it.....well worth the money !!  A+
1583334386|5.0|Exceeded my expectations. Though, while not a prude, and while I know its main audience is undergraduate students, I could have done without some of the language. Still the content was excellent. Clearly written and very interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I ❤ this book so much the ending was kind of sad but the rest was amazing If you haven't already I'd get it if I where u
0765325950|5.0|Love this series grateful to Robert Jordan's foresight to have notes that another author used brilliantly to end the series. If your a fan of Jordan you will not be disappointed.<br />Amazon as always did a great job fulfilling my order and quickly shipping me the package.
B00992CF6W|5.0|worth seven dollar's. playit all the time. but if you have the computer or xbox you now it has more stuff but at least mojang just added buckets.just by it or you are a noob.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Just having visited Paris, I really enjoyed reading this and could put myself in the places she mentions in the book. I bought this for my granddaughter to read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and would recommend others to read it.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This was a great movie that really showed you what went  into the chase against osama bin laden.  only reason i did not give it 5 stars was bc I was not a fan of the ending.  but i would definitly reccomend seeing it and deciding for yourself what you think about the ending!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was fast moving and very interesting.  Kept my attention to the end.  It was right up there in quality with his other books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I appreciated the author's point of view, as a Medical Doctor:  Sure you had an intense experience that was very real to you.  But, he never really believed his patients' experiences were true events that actually took place, until he had his own NDE.  His insight first as a Doctor and second as a person who experienced an NDE made reading what he went through difficult to put the book down.  I enjoyed the Doctor's recollections and descriptions of what he experienced a great deal.  He helped me to have a different/clearer picture of what exists beyond our conscious life.  I would heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in a revealing insight into how we can anticipate that the afterlife will accept us.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|fun game alot of out fits and makeup to chose from :)) also fun for all ages and prettiest dresses get this app and I'm picky so u no what I mean lolz :-)
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|But, if you know the Conan franchise, you will see quite a few differences. This was good but the original was better. There are a few highlights here that make it worth watching. The young Conan was portrayed by Leo Howard, who has a bright future in acting. And Jason Momoa has already established himself as a powerhouse in his portrayal of Khal Drago from Game of Thrones. Watch this for the action and don't tread too hard on the story line.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|This was another great hit from Michael Buble. It had a different feel to it than his other albums. I definitely enjoyed it! My wife and I listened to it several times while driving in my convertible.
1781162646|5.0|I just started reading King a couple of months ago and I was very excited to hear about this new book coming out from him. At first glance I expected this book to be a straight up mystery novel about a murder. It is but to a much smaller extent. Joyland is mostly a coming of age book with a mystery twist to round it out. This is not a bad thing though since this book is great. It is not a non stop action story full of mystery but It has it's twists and turns that keeps it very interesting. I will admit that there were some slower parts that dragged a little but Joyland still kept my attention very well. Joyland is a coming of age mystery with a lot of heart and some drama. Overall it is a great King novel and if you are a fan of his other books that are not leaning on horror you will find this one to be a great addition.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I love this CD - my daughter loves this CD - we love to listen to it together.  The CD is clean, honest lyrics, and appropriate for a 9 year old girl to listen to - much better than some of the radio junk out there.  Not only that, but the songs are creative, catchy and young but mature enough for older audiences such as myself to enjoy!
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|How do I get this off of my Kindle? Not at all what I thought it was supposed to be.
B008IGP8QE|4.0|I thought I would get annoyed with the CD, but I actually find myself singing along and recognizing the songs from the show - it's kid appropriate, and something as a mom I can tolerate.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|No breakthrough here. Does what a clock app should. Free version may be adequate if, you don't need additional alarm sounds.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had no interest in reading this, but a friend gave me her copy. I picked it up to skim and never put it down.
B009X01FJS|5.0|This Marware Kindle Fire cover is great. The color is wonderful. It is sturdy and works so well for use as an easel for no hands use.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Ehh, I admire Sheryl Sandberg for her smarts and rise to the top but I found the book to be not very well written and often suggests she got chance after chance  - her examples have got to be enhanced. I mean if I were 18 I would think this was somewhat inspiring but as a women leaning in way before Sheryl said it was cool, I found it just ehh.
B00D3V97DO|5.0|I was in the US Navy when Mr. Crowley was released and you could hear it being played loudly all over Pearl Harbor; it was a major event.  The release of Sabbath 13 is like this.  I have listened to the album from beginning to end 5 times and I have not tired of it at all.  Ozzy sounds great and I hope to see him in concert.  Hopefully there will be one more after this, but this could be the last recording.  If it is the last, they go out with a bang.
159463176X|5.0|There is an old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. That's what seems to be the case of the people in this novel. They all really want to do the right thing but some just fail miserably at it. The book is small stories of two different characters bound together by love. There are two sisters, two brothers, two cousins, and then people just bound together because they care. They are connected to a tree in a tiny town in Afghanistan. Although the action spreads throughout the world including Greece and the U.S., the heart remains in Afghanistan.<br /><br />  There is really only one person I ended up not liking. Most of them I felt sorry for. They all wanted to do well but their actions caused devastation that rippled through generations. We've all been in tricky situations where we must make moral choices. We hope and pray we make the right ones but what happens when we don't. To me, that is what this book is about. It's sad in so many places and I grieve for so many lost chances.<br /><br />  I had the pleasure of hearing this author speak and he discussed the book so movingly that I was anxious to read it. Kite Runner is one of my favorite books of all time but this one goes to a different level. It's like peeling the layers of an onion to get to the heart of the matter. I found it beautifully conceived and executed and couldn't recommend it more highly.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is a must have app. Kills apps not being used. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Would highly recommend. Worth having on any tablet or phone.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has equaled the quality of his first two books with an intricate story and beautifully constructed sentences.<br />He again uses his homeland to set an emotional family saga with universal themes of loss and knowing oneself. His characters are flawed, fully human, unique, but in many ways identifiable as ourselves.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun driving game.<br />Could become very addicting. Nice to play and everything is as it states.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|First, let's get the obvious out of the way...Bill Ward is not on the album and Ozzy does not sound like he did 35 years ago.  It's unfortunate that many people are so hung up on those two topics, because this album deserves more credit for what it is than criticism for what it's not.  Brad Wilk (drummer from Rage Against The Machine) does an EXCELLENT job on this album and has been described as a \\"Godsend\\" by bassist Geezer Butler.  Ozzy is definitely sounding a bit worn and weathered at this point in his career, but I think his vocals on this album are superior to any of his solo albums since his 1995 release \\"Ozzmosis\\".<br /><br />Moving on, I got the Deluxe Edition because I wanted to have as much new music from these guys as possible considering it very well could be their Swan Song.  Tony Iommi is the real deal, and his performance on this album and determination to push through his medical condition show just how important this album was to him, as it was to Geezer and Ozzy.  I hope that Tony is able to stay strong and keep going for many years and if that leads to more new music that would be great.  As a standalone effort, '13' is a great album but even more exciting as a springboard to take their renewed chemistry and build on it.<br /><br />I think this is the kind of album that will earn appreciation over time from classic Sabbath fans who are very picky and will compare it to every album in their catalog.  I strongly suggest playing this on a system that has some quality to it.  Upon first impression, based solely on the music itself, it's unmistakably Sabbath and it's dark and heavy.  I'm not sure I agree with the strategy of opening the album with the two longest tracks back to back, as it could test people's patience for anything more instantly gratifying.  However, the opener definitely shows that these guys haven't lost their sound and luckily God is Dead? does pickup at the 6-minute mark before the first up-tempo rocker \\"Loner\\".  On a good stereo you can really hear Geezer tearing into his bass on that one over a great Iommi riff.  Let's call \\"Zeitgeist\\" what it is right from the start, \\"Planet Caravan 2\\", and there's nothing wrong with that.  Acoustic guitar with a heavy bass undertone and very spacey vocals, and it works.  The album picks right back up again with \\"Age of Reason\\", beginning with a great drum intro by Brad Wilk and some of my favorite guitar on the album.  The faster pace continues with \\"Live Forever\\" before going into what I feel is one of the most signature Sabbath tunes on the album, the swinging, bluesy \\"Damaged Soul\\".  The last track of the official (non-bonus) album, \\"Dear Father\\", is solid but an odd song to end the album with.  I think Zeitgeist would have closed the album out better.<br /><br />As far as the bonus tracks, I really don't see any of them to be inferior to what's on the album at all which makes me wonder why they're bonus tracks.  Methademic is definitely the fastest out of the whole set so maybe they felt it was too fast for the rest, but it's a great track.  Peace of Mind just kinds of prods along but features some great playing by Geezer and Tony, and Pariah showcases some fierce bass by Geezer like \\"Loner\\" did.<br /><br />Each time I listen, I hear different parts that stand out and if you listen to each track focusing on one player, you'll start really appreciating the individual performances.  Honestly, I don't think they could have made a better album, especially considering what they had to overcome to make it happen.  As for producer Rick Rubin, who received high praise from Ozzy in the liner notes, I wish he would have had more respect for what could be Sabbath's final album when it came to the mixing process.  Compromising the dynamics of a recording for the sake of making it louder serves no purpose.  Can't wait to see the vinyl/CD comparisons to see just how compressed this album is...shameful.you can really hear Geezer tearing into his bass on that one over a great Iommi riff.

B008XG1X18|1.0|The reviews stated this program would be a nice match for me, but it wasn't. Just didn't work out I guess.<br />Nice program if it applies to you. Can't say anything too bad because I found it not to my liking. Someone else may find this app great.
B00CBRADU2|1.0|If you are looking for a ridiculous B movie which is funny when not trying to be due to its utter ridiculousness and predictable, corny lines, and lame story line, then The Last Stand is for you. The story line is contrived - and corny. The acting and characters are contrived - and corny. The pacing is awkward and choppy.  The premise is completely absurd (you will see, don't want to be a spoiler). It doesn't know when to be a spoof (which it is and should stay throughout) and when to try to be an action thriller - which it failed at pretty miserably in its few feeble attempts. Sorry Arnold, tried way too hard here.  There is a reason why he only had three words in his most successful movie of his career . . . &#34;I'll be back.&#34;
B005HED11Y|5.0|Enjoyed this classic series.  Keep it on Prime. Great action and suspense all in one.  It is really great because no commercial interruptions.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|&#34;Gideon and Eva's story CONCLUDES in the powerfully sensual third novel in the Crossfire Series Entwined with You.  This was an outright lie by Ms. Day.<br /><br />Now she say's &#34;Yes, dear reader, you're right.  This can't possibly be the end.  Gideon and Eva's journey isn't quite finished yet.  I look foward to seeing where they'll take us next&#34;.<br /><br />In addition to the outright lie, the book was horrible.  There was approximately a chaper worth any substance.

B007JNR518|5.0|I love Robert Redford in this love story, great message to our youngsters, and that  Wyoming countyside is beautiful, just great!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I felt it sort of plodded and lurched along (pun intended). I was eager to pick it up once put down. I would have liked to have known more about the zombies and I felt the horrorificness ,is that a word,? of having to kill ones fellows might have been played up more. But then I couldn't have written anything like this. So kudos. It did make me want to see the movie.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was recommended to me , great story! Had never read Paulo Coelho before. I'm definitely reading more from him.

B004BCT2HU|5.0|I first saw David Garrett playing the violin on WHY Channel 12 during a promotional fund raiser where he was a guest after the showing of him playing in Berlin at a concert.  It was wonderful to see a musician so talented and playing classical and rock and roll for an audience that was enraptured by his playing and his personality.  I ordered the dvd from Amazon but was disppointed that Metallica and another rock song he played was omitted from the disc.  I am hoping to get another disc that will include the whole concert.  I would recommend this disc to any music lover as he covers music from all realms.  His personality and interaction with the audience was splendid.  Made me love the violin all over again.  Very enjoyable.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Some things are different than the movie and it kept me wanting to find out what would happen next, seeing movie first thought I would already know the book really well. But that wasn't the case.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|A well thought out war story with various families coming together in an epic novel. Like all Follett books - a very good read
B004SOR4H6|3.0|As an official twitter client, this app got its advantage: streaming of your timeline, real time notification, etc. However, I do think there are room for improvement such as allow pictures to be uploaded to third party website like twitpic instead of twitter.com. I'm currently use falcon pro instead of this app, and I do believe falcon pro is much better than this.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a beautifully written book.  The characters became a part of me and I felt all that they were feeling.  I cried and laughed when something good happened and, at the end, was just about inconsolable.  I immediately read her other book, and pre ordered her future novel.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The previous book said this one was suppose to conclude their story.<br />This was a waste of money, story didn't conclude and didn't was not very interesting.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Even though there's a lot of fighting in this episode, I love it because it has my favorite songs of glee in it. I think its some of the most intense and emotional music in the series. I wanted to say that its really nice that Amazon lets me buy individual episodes which I like without paying for the whole series. Thanks!
098478280X|5.0|It is a very useful book before preparing technical interview. it will not be useful to apply any senior positions. It is most like cookbook for new grads. However, i will encourage to read that in cased you will be embarrassed by those college exam questions after you have left school for a while.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Started a bit slow but I love Mila K., Oz the Great and Powerful somehow manages to be both slavish to its hallowed template (when convenient) and completely tone-deaf to the magic that made it a one-of-a-kind cultural milestone.<br /><br />Good movie overall.

B00CISC2DA|5.0|I pre-orderd harvest and was delivered a day before release date in NA. CD packaging art was great, I felt like the brothers went out of their way to put together something of quality. Since my expectation for boards is so high I felt it would be asking too much to live up to. Takes a while to get the hang of but after a few listens things start to gel. It's a desert wasteland classic.

B001HPP2XW|5.0|This movie was a gift for my sister.  She really liked it.  It is a classis, so I'll give it five stars.

B005JABSB6|5.0|I recently bought the Sharp 60 inch 3D TV, and I love it! The TV came with a pair of the 3D glasses that are great and work awesome! I was so happy to find the exact model # on amazon, and a great price too. I wanted to have a set of 4 so I ordered two additional and can't wait to get them in the mail. The glasses fit nicely on your nose and are very comfortable to wear, even over your eye glasses. If you have a Sharp 3D TV I totally recommend getting these glasses before any other. WONDERFUL AND GREAT QUALITY!

0307887448|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s and loves science fiction books should really invest their time in this one. There are a lot of incredible one-liners and nostalgic pokes that made me laugh out loud (which is not something that happens often while reading.)

1449410243|4.0|I like The Oatmeal, I think he has wonderful observations and a creative writing style. However, *thirty* pages of this book (or about a quarter of the entire book's contents) is consumed with one of his comics, that you have probably seen before. And this doesn't happen just once.<br /><br />It was a lot of fun to read through this book, both my fiancee and I love reading it from time to time, but I felt a little ripped off expecting more new content just to have so much padding.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the Omnibus Edition and did not want it to be over. The way the characters and plot were patiently and carefully crafted really made this series special. It was wonderful to truly not know what was going to happen next as Hugh found a very clever way of keeping me guessing. I hope he returns to this universe very soon to continue the saga!!!<br /><br />Highly recommend to fans of great fiction.

1579128955|1.0|I really like the idea of this book and wish i had it when i was studying the periodic table of elements in high school, it could use more information and facts about the elements and less about the liberal agenda and opinions based from uninformed political views and disproven global warming. If i wanted to hear lies and false information i would watch CNN, this book is not about the elements from a real scientist but pictures from a liberal photographer.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is a really fun game. My whole family passes it around and plays a different version. It is great for kids to learn  hand and eye coordination.
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm a lifelong Sci-Fi junkie; sorry!  But, as for the show, it's written okay, softly,...  the rottting corpses that would be everywhere, and other atrocities, if and/or when events actually like this happen, are not shown;  What I'm saying is it's okay for family viewing!  I think, it depends on your family though.  Could be some teachable moments in there.  Mortal Life, hangs by a thread.  It's best that none of us ever forget that.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My daughter ordered this  first and  sent it to me. We both enjoyed it better than the movie. Please read it and see for yourself.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is similar to Tetris. I ordered it for my younger grandkids to play. So far I<br />have done really well conceding things they like to play.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Let me start by saying this is not Megadeth's best work. This is not even in the top three. But it is still very much a Megadeth album, more in the vein of &#34;Youthanasia,&#34; or &#34;Countdown to Extinction.&#34; This is a more melodic Megadeth, but they still bring out riffs that evidence their thrash metal roots, like the changing time signatures in the verse riff to &#34;Built for War.&#34; The guitars are predictably heavy, and the very  first track, &#34;Kingmaker,&#34; sets an aggressive tone right from the beginning. One of the things I like about this album is that this is not Megadeth chasing their tails--they're still making heavy music, but it's not a caricature of who they used to be. They're still experimenting with the genre: the track &#34;The Blackest Crow&#34; introduces Bluegrass (yes, you read that right--BLUEGRASS) instruments and melodies into a heavy metal song. And it works.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this album very much. Dave Mustaine is becoming a better vocalist with every album, and the songwriting shows maturity. Well worth the purchase price.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|I grew up watching Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies. Each one was fun, fast paced and exciting. The plots were simple, but I was a kid, so they made sense. The underdog fights back against the mob, or defends the honor of his family. I'm not a big fan of wire-fu, but &#34;Man with the Iron Fists&#34; does it very well. The action sequences and fight scenes are fun and well done. Choreography was noticeable, but not often.<br />I'm sure the writer and director wanted to capture the feel of those great Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan classics. He did a great job. Watch or buy this movie, or both.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I wish that they would have more things to collect. Once you get to a certain level it's like your waiting around for more things to happen in the game.
B00BQ83TMG|4.0|Like the author, I have read the Saxon Chronicles.  The available historical information is limited, usually coming from surviving writings of monks, although some information can be found in Danish sagas and such.  The author has filled in the gaps with historical fiction based on known battles, births and deaths of kings and other leaders, and known details of society during that period.  The action is carried forward by the fictional character Uhtred.  The series started with his support of Alfred the Great, who has now died and been followed in succession by his son, Edward.  This novel extends into the beginning of the 10th century.<br /><br />The novel departs somewhat into various side issues involving Uhtred, who seems to survive in various battles and other actions (including a confrontation with a supposed seeress who could tell fortunes).  There are various confrontations with the Catholic church (Uhtred is a pagan who believes in Norse gods).  The status of women during that time period seems to be accurate - they married young and often died young.  The lifespan of men was also much shorter than now.  Uhtred describes himself as an old man of 45 in the shield wall during a battle.<br /><br />The Danes will obviously outlast Uhtred.  Battles between Saxons and Danes continued into the 11th century before the Danish power was broken in both Ireland (by Brian) and in England.  The Saxons and Danes would eventually battle each other into exhaustion, and the Normans would move in and take over (the Normans being descended from Vikings who settled in Normandy).<br /><br />Depiction of Saxon life in England seems to be accurate.  White slavery flourished in England and the rest of Europe, and white slaves were a major commodity in trade.  That would continue for several more centuries.  Many of us undoubtedly had ancestors who were slaves.

B00CFYD682|5.0|[[ASIN:B000ANVP74 Voice]], [[ASIN:B0019FOC4K The Turn (US Version Only)]], and [[ASIN:B00006IR5U Hometime]] all were exceptional sets, each one different but great.  \\"The Minutes\\" is such a strong return to her classic form that it is startling how consistently good it is.  The two tracks that have popped off the set are \\"Right As Rain\\" with its driving beat, upbeat melody, and Alison's voice all tease with the darker lyric, \\"If you can't find rest in my bed, then don't bother your head, lie awake there instead.\\"  \\"Changeling\\" twists like an electronic rock tango with Alison's voice alternately ripping through the lyric then playing cat & mouse, \\"I remember when the world was a little girl, every corner turned leading back to her flowing like a stream on a rolling stone.\\"  It's insanely addictive.  Other tracks like \\"When I Was Your Girl,\\" \\"Love Reign Supreme\\" & \\"All Signs Of Life\\" are crazy good.  This is a set not to miss, surely on many \\"best of\\" lists at year's end.  Enjoy!

I can take ~1000 photos on a full charge in my EOS 20D with at least 1/3 of them being flash.<br />The charger that came with the camera works great and the 2 identical batteries I had which are ~8 years old still hold a pretty good charge, though one occasionally flips out and drops to no charge. Highly recommended.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|96l reviews!  Are you kidding me?  After the first dozen or so reviews, do the other 949 of you actually think you had something worthwhile to add?  Once any item...book, movie, CD, whatever, has a dozen or so reviews...and a range of ratings from folks with a variety of opinions about it...any more reviews are just ego-indulgence on the part of the writers.  The number of reviews that turn up on for items on amazon.com are stark staring ridiculous.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it's not great cinema...or a great movie musical...but if you don't much care if Brosnan can sing or not, and you like ABBA songs, and you're in the mood for a beautiful island and some simple fun...this is one for you.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|A brilliant, captive book. I read this book in my youth and just finished it for the second time some 25 years later. The honesty in the writing had me glued till the end.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|When I read the description of the book I thought it would be a great read. Once I started reading I was disappointed and the more I read the worse it got. Who makes a book about dying kids with cancer? What type of sick person writes about this? True, it is a love story but the concept is horrible. The entire read I kept thinking about someone I loved getting this disease or even me! That's not what I want to picture when I read a novel. If this wasn't a book club selection I would have gotten my money back!
B007Y2W44W|5.0|After a 10 year layoff from buying new Nile material (I own the 3 98-02 releases) I decided to give Nile another try.  While I like Nile, I didn't like them enough to keep buying every new album they released.  So, after a 10 year gap I can hear some big improvements from Nile on At The Gate of Sethu.  The new vocalist is the best the band has had and actually sings the words it sounds like instead of the groan/growl/grrrr of early releases.  The song structure seems similar to all Nile releases a mix of slow and fast death metal with some really nice lead guitar work and drumming.  I really like the cleaner more modern production, the instruments come through with more power even if Nile loses some of there former muddy/heavy sound.  Maybe some of the old Nile fans won't be a huge fan of the new work, but maybe it will gain them some new fans turned away by that old style.

B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Songs are very good and upbeat. Some love songs make me feel sad. But that's what a great singer is suppose to do to you. Love her music.
B00BPA2PEI|5.0|If you have well calibrated your equipment, color improvement works! Great color and contrast, perfect definition, but no extras at all.
B00BN3EE1O|1.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater so I was excited when I was able to pre order it through Amazon. But when I received it the case was bent and looked like it had been through the ringer. Amazon if it looks like something you wouldn't want to own don't send it to your customers.
B00BPA2PBG|4.0|I expected a bit more from these. Yes, it has been improved. More definition and contrast, but.... What happened to red??? Everything is reddish. But dont worry too much, maybe you dont appreciate it as I do. And no extras.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this book from the beginning to the end.  Much better then the movie.  If you saw the movie and did not read the book you missed a lot!!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It wasn't what I thought it would be. It's okay, but not thrilled with it. Don't play it t hat often.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Thought this movie was pretty decent, however, the progression of the movie was slightly weird. It was almost like they met then it was essentially over.  However,  it was definitely entertaining and worth the watch.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|I haven't stopped talking about it around my friends. I've recommended it to all and even bought it as a gift.
B002RI9UBS|1.0|I thought I had already reviewed this book. I just couldn't get into it especially the religious bits. The movie may be worth watching but I will wait till it on TV.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I wish I could rate this game  1000000000000000000000000 stars because this game is so amazingly amazing! I think I want to play this game almost every day because it's so cool!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app and the ability to stay communicated on the go. this is just what I was waiting for.
0440237688|4.0|As the years from middle school to the end of high school are marked by conformity and confusion for most kids, The Giver is an excellent contribution to their literary library during this time. Jonas is 12, on the cusp of puberty, and entering the next stage of life in his \\"utopian\\" society. This is a place where choices are made for you, mistakes are not made, and when they are, they are quickly and secretly taken care of. There is no color, your career and your spouse are chosen for you, your children are \\"assigned\\", not born to you, and those who break the rules or have outlived their usefulness are \\"released\\" - a terrifying euphemism.<br /><br />Jonas, like his peers, knows nothing of this in the beginning. But as his journey begins into becoming his community's Receiver of Memories, the horror of his surroundings forces him to make moral choices many tweens and teens today face in their own way: should he go along with things \\"as they are\\" knowing what he knows? Should he stand up for what is right or close his eyes?<br /><br />The Giver is a powerful book written in simple but profound prose. It offers young readers the opportunity to consider not only the blessings of freedom, but its responsibilities as well. And it does this without the need to spell things out or preach. Perhaps this is what makes it one of the more thought-provoking and intelligent novels written for young people in the last 30 years.
B00973902K|5.0|this was the song of the year. everyone used it to draw attention to one cause to the next. Everyone did and it was contagious. people respond and everybody smiles when they hear this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|VERY GOOD BOOK,  LOVED IT, COULDNT STOP READING ...<br />LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT ALL THE BOOKS<br />WOULD HAVE FRENS READ THEM ALL

B007IXWL2C|5.0|VERY GOOD BOOK, LOVED IT COULDNT STOP READING IT.<br />LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM ALL. VERY INTERESTING..<br />WOULD HAVE FRENDS READ THEM ALL
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This one doesn't even come close to any previous Die Hard. So don't waste your time watching it. I want my money back
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVED IT ,  BUT ME I STARTED  WITH BOOK 3  AND 1 AND 2.  SO I HAD TO THINK ABOUT THINGS..  DIDNT PAY ATTENTION TO THE NUMBER OF BOOKS, THOUGHT IT WAS ALL TOGETHER WHEN I SAW FIFTY SHADES TRILOGY 3. I MISS READ IT.  THOUGHT ALL 3 BOOKS WERE IN THE PURCHASE.<br />I LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM. WOULD READ THEM OVER AGAIN.<br />TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO READ THE BOOK.
B0080Y93H4|5.0|I have not opened this yet as I am out of town at this time.  As soon as I get home I will really test and listen to this audio CD.  Please post more audio CDs of this sort.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is an assortment of many configurations of tiles. Loads of fun, especially if you try to beat your time when you replay a game. I like it! ☺
B009ANP4F4|5.0|My 15 yr. old has all the STEP UP movies......She is continuously watching these movies......She watches these movies as inspiration as she dances and wants to do it professionally in the future....KEEP THEM COMING......
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series of books very well written. Great plot, great action, easy read, have recommended it to friends. Great
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It is a long drawn out game that you have to depend on your friends on a lot or spend real money on.  It is cute though.
0679805273|5.0|I bought one of these for each of my kids. I started in PreK getting their teachers to write in it and plan to give it to them when they graduate. I saw this on Pinterest and loved the idea!
1608871452|5.0|Very nice. I like all the pics and all the details I didn't know about. I like all the post cards inside and have sent a couple to Supernatural fan friends of mine.
B008Q08580|4.0|This movie was sad and it shows us how life can change in a second. You never fully understand what a person is thinking or capable of. I would watch this movie again.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I surprisingly enjoyed this movie very much. I think I laughed almost the whole time between the twins, the bear, and the antics of the men! The animation is done well; the facial expressions are priceless! Definitely a movie to watch!
B0064MGU98|3.0|Competent direction and acting, but lacks the kind of dramatic development that one expects in a legal drama in this area.
B00A2YAY3C|5.0|While not quite on par with Blackhawk Down, this is an excellent recounting of a tragedy stemming from pride, carelessness, and political maneuvering.  Obviously, there will never be a movie that conveys weeks of battlefield history in a truly accurate manner, but this was one of the better efforts from that era.  In the spirit of, &#34;The Longest Day,&#34; and &#34;The Big Red One,&#34; this is a classic movie that is well above average.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|This is a movie about ideas. And even though it's ostensibly about the power of love, the movie comes off as a bit cold emotionally. The performances are solid. The production is terrific. The scenes on their own are good. But put it all together and this feels more like a thematic cinematic experience and less like a great epic yarn. (And I do love avant garde cinema. It's not that I need a Campbell-esque hero's journey kind of movie to enjoy.)<br /><br />The Blu-ray is fine quality. I was unable to see this movie in the theaters, and maybe I missed out on that, but the Blu-ray is very clean. You get a good visual experience if you have a decently large screen. And thankfully the subtitles are available. I don't think I would've understood half the pidgin slang English dialog without subtitles.<br /><br />To sum up: It's an interesting movie and I'm glad I saw it. It didn't move me or haunt me, but I have no regrets buying it.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|It followed the book really well. It also had Peter Jackson's flare for telling a great story with amazing visuals, music and interesting developments.
B00BX3KZAS|4.0|Children of Bodom have definitely Americanized their sound over the last several albums.  For about ten years they indulged their inner Pantera and Metallica not to mention their affinity for the L.A Glam bands, and did so through the scope of a veteran European Death metal band. It was tasteful but left some people wanting the band that is often brought up when someone discusses Melodic Death Metal to relapse to their roots and embrace their snow covered forest dwelling beginnings. Well just look at the cover. Wish granted! Sure there is some American sounding stomp and stammer here and there to punctuate highly melodic songs, but it serves as a much more refined part of COB's sound. This release seems to pick up where Hate Crew Deathtroll left off. The songs are excellent and lend themselves to repeat listens, as Alexi Laiho's serpentine riffs are so meticulously penned, that it defies initial comprehension. There are definite returns to the past and longtime fans will hear a good amount of Hatebreeder like material on certain tracks. Laiho's vocals are also much harsher, never touching anything as melodic as \\"Needled 24/7\\", with exception of a soft almost spoken intro. Longtime fans will love this and what's cooler is that new fans (like one of the other reviewers) can jump right on board with this release and then immediately be able to embrace the classics like Follow The Reaper, as well as the newer stuff! While the actual stars I gave are four, I like the other reviewers I assume, are merely holding COB to a rating against themselves. Excellent job by a veteran crew not even close to being done.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille always entertains.  Good plot and charachter development.  Like his style.  Have read a number of his series and will continue to do so.
1451695187|4.0|An interesting human interest story especially coming from such a thoughtful and educated person on a universally interesting topic. Pretty quick read too.
193700788X|3.0|I was hoping for a more exciting finish to this series, although I suppose Sam was probably the best choice for Sookie, I kept hoping for a union or reunion for Sookie and Bill.
B001DSNEJM|3.0|I could not figure out how he could just walk away and not be accounted for if it was something authorized by the government, but other than that it was a different movie to watch.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Very good quality, good protection for the Bluetooth a very ! very ! good  price, I will purchase another and tell Family & Friends about it.
B002AT4KA0|3.0|I have seen so many of these movies I can not remember what this one was about (lol) but each movie that comes out gets better.  If this is the first one it was okay.  Paul Walker is finer than the law allows.  The acting is as expected and the storyline is silly but it is all about the cars so focus on that.  ;-)
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is amazing, I love it, It Is Something ! !  I will purchase it over and over again, charger and carry all in one, just simply Amazing. It is something I will tell Family & Friends.
B00AEBB8QK|3.0|Great acting but it seemed a little bit on the cheesy, cheap side of production to me.  All of the actors did the best that could in my opinion.  It fell short of impressive just a bit.  I gave it three stars because the actors are good.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I just doing this so that I don't have to look at the would h you like to do a earring for this game .so here it is . It a good game to p<br />lady I'm a gamer so I have a lot of games that I play in a day. This is one of them
B000MCH5P4|3.0|This movie was different.  I understood the whole Babel thing but it was still just okay to me.  It did not really seem to build to a climax for me.  It was just flat.  The acting was fine.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I like Tarantino movies because they are unusual and unpredictable. Django was no different. You have to be in a certain frame of mind to watch his movies.<br /><br />Pure entertainment. Even though there may be some historical facts his movies, you best believe he will put his own twisted fantasy to it and have you guessing on what's coming next.<br /><br />Bunch of great actors in the movie, loved it.
B000M4RG4C|4.0|The acting and the production of this movie is so good.  The directing was great too.  It was obviously violent but I was able to stick through it.  A good buy.  Too bad men go through this kind of thing in war.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Started of a bit slow for me but I loved the story and the and ending. Liked the book much better than the movie
B00007BKVC|4.0|My mother can not stand to watch this movie because she hates the end.  It makes her sad. So, I had to watch it myself and I really enjoyed watching it again.  It has been so long since I first saw it. Man does everyone look so young-especially Brad! A little humor here and there.  Good actors.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The whole Sookie series is just a fun read.  I am not into &#34;vamps&#34; and so forth, but these are fun.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Doesn't work, a waste of $$, doesn't want to load, don't know what it's doing.  Wish I hadn't got it!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A lot of sex and violence. But really interesting character development. Games of thrones is addicting. Now all we need is amazon to partner with apple so we can watch on the apple tv
B001KWZ796|5.0|I love this movie!<br /><br />I saw it several years ago and just bought it for my daughter's Kindle.<br /><br />Drew Barrymore is lovely and gracious & brilliant in her role. The stroyline expands greatly and makes it all so real & believable.  I always knew fairytales were base on some fact.  Though I never would have guessed who the Fairy Godmother was.<br /><br />I highly recommend for ages 5 & beyond!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This was an excellent copy and I was transported right back to the 80's. Can't wait to buy more! YAY<br /><br />Favorite movie of all time
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My favorite game ever. I have played a lot of building games, but this is my favorite game ever. 5 out of5
0525425772|5.0|I have always liked the adult authorship of JG but he is doing great with his Theodore Boone series  for younger readers.  He explores the problems of young people by using the problems of Theodore.
B00D3V5V7U|2.0|I am normally a huge Sabbath fan, of both the Ozzy and Dio years. I own all the cds, and they are on heavy rotation. Heavy. That said, this is just an unfortunate release. This doesn't sound like Sabbath, except for the occasional fine soloing by Tony Iommi. The songs are poorly written, overly long, and not memorable. Sludge factory product, with an Ozzy past his prime laid over the top. I'm not even sure the non-allowed reverb (producer Shirley allegedly said no) would have helped. Save your money. Check out the original six and the first two Sab releases with Dio. All set.<br /><br />Shebby
B0030M3SBI|5.0|The last year of Jimi Hendrix's life was one of many contradictions.  Against the advice of his handlers, he fired Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, formed Band of Gypsys with Electric Flag & Express drummer Buddy Miles(who also appeared on Electric Ladyland) and air force buddy/bass player Billy Cox, and finally wound up with a reformed Experience(after a fashion) with Cox on bass and Mitchell back on drums.  Contradictions and frustrations all around.  But here is the best Hendrix live album.  Certainly the best recorded of his concert albums.  It almost resembles what later became known as &#34;soundboard&#34; live recordings.<br />Who Knows dances lightly into Jazz territory, even allowing Miles a little scat solo.  Machine Gun is Hendrix's most effective anti-war song, and features a finale of feedback and noise that rivals those of his Woodstock performance of &#34;The Star Spangled Banner&#34;.  Buddy Miles' &#34;Them Changes&#34; signals Hendrix's reconnecting to his soul/R&B roots, as do the album's three remaining songs.  His experience with Little Richard and the Isley Brothers served him well here, and on Cry of Love, his last fully realized album, released the following year, posthumously.  Cry of Love was eventually reissued as part of the First Rays of the New Rising Sun CD, but Cry...stands well enough on its own.  If you don't already have that one, get hold of it as soon as you are finished listening to this masterpiece, Band of Gypsys.
B00932A4XE|4.0|This is a great movie that shows every different type of pregnancy. I think every girl should see this if they plan to have a child some day! Very insightful and funny!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Engaging with great animation and plot. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended. I can't wait for the next one!
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|This is really an excellent Children's movie. My two year old son is obcessed with cars and I was really impressed with the moral value of a story told completely in cars.
B005M5XCZ8|5.0|in the last stand they show an older not completely old Charles (walking) and Erik on same side going to meet with Jean Grey about school for mutants but in the end of first class Charles is paralyzed and he and Erik split ways. also wolverine isn't with victor which in origins during that time period they would of still been together seeing as though it was pre Vietnam.. so those things about first class completely almost contradict the first 4 even in origins wolverine Xavier is still walking
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book. It was a page-turner and kept me intrigued. However, the main character was not convincingly black. His thoughts, actions, etc. did not seem to be from a black person's perspective. Loved the story, but the main character did not ring true.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Completely unrealistic but very entertaining.  Good chemistry between Harvey Specter and Mike Ross.  Lewis Lit is funny and witty. Highly recommend!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this all the time! It's very customizable customizable which I love. The only thing I don't like is it keeps telling me there is an update but I can't find it anywhere.My other app updates are really easy.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|MILD SPOILERS ALERT. First of all this movie was amazing. I'll keep this review short. This movie has a lot of action in it and I guess it does have too much in it but they are cool scenes. All of the acting are great. This movie has a lot of emotional depth to it, one is because of a scene involving Jonathan Kent, the other at the end of the fight with Superman and Zod. All in all great movie, one of the best movie of the year along with star trek and I am looking forward to Justice League!!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|This book is a  futuristic, fantasy, fairytale that relates to past historical events.  It has some not so subtle moral and ethical messages wrapped into the story.

B00D6OV57O|5.0|Hans Zimmer shows us again that he is this generation's film composer. He shows control of evoking the exact emotion with his music needed for the events on film. Take this or nearly any of his scores from the film and watch them without it and it would be like taking off your glasses or contacts to visit an art gallery.
B00846REIS|1.0|Good book but whoever typed this on kindle made me very disappointed that I spent my money LEARN TO SPELL

B00CKOYVG8|3.0|this game is just ok kind of hard to play dont think it would be a game for younger kids
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a touching movie and one I wish all Dad's understood.  God Bless Dad's that raise their children in the Lord and know that children are our responsibility and God will hold us accountable for teaching them in the way they must go.  Time with family is never a waste.

B0014DQSG2|3.0|A cute and fun movie for tweens and teens.  A modern take on the age old Cinderella story.  My 12 year old loved it.

0345803493|5.0|They say that two is always better and I have to agree because book two in the Fifty Shades Trilogy was better than the first. This needs more than 5 stars it needs about hundred and fifty.<br /><br />Ana walked out on Christian at the end of the first book. She could not take what was given and left not even given her mind a chance to think what she was doing. I wanted to yell at her shake her even and tell her to go back. I couldn't believe she just walked out. He was pleading with her to stay and that was not Christian at all.<br /><br />It has only been three days when Fifty Shades Darker starts and the first day of Ana's new job. She is trying to deal with not being with Christian, but she is not doing well at all. She has not really eaten, is surviving only on caffeine and loosing weight. Wake, work, cry sleep is mostly what her day consists of. Her heart is broken and she wants him back.<br /><br />Christian is not doing well at all either, he has managed to eat and not fall away into a 'shell'. However, he's having nightmares and is wanting Ana to come back as well. It is Christian that makes the first contact with her. The showing at José's showing and she agrees to go with him.<br /><br />I was so thrilled when she agreed and I was also happy that he scowled her for not eating right. The way that Christian takes care of her is a special kind of love. He begs her to start eating and after the showing he takes her and makes her eat.<br /><br />He wants to start a different kind of relationship with her, but it is hard because of his past. However, he is willing to give it a try and so is Ana. There are some things still with standing and he is actually scared to go back into his playroom with her. He doesn't want her to walk out like she did before.<br /><br />Ana agrees to try the new relationship and things start working out more or less. They just have to deal with her Boss, some of his control issues, one of his ex-sub's and Elena, the biggest problem that Ana has.<br /><br />It is easy to tell that Christian wants her to be safe by all the things he does. It might get on Ana's nerves but it is how he shows his love for her. He also proves it more over by finally letting her touch him in the places he's never let another person touch.<br /><br />I loved this book and I was actually glad when his mom found out 'most' of the truth about Elena. When she slapped her I was jumping up down almost with joy. I couldn't stand her and now hopefully she gets the picture that Christian is not hers and never really was hers.<br /><br />The emails are back and even better in Fifty Shades Darker. I love how Christian is slowly understanding that he can be that guy. It just took Ana walking out on him to bring him to his 'knees' (and once not just figuratively). Loved the presents that Ana gave to him and his birthday party was something else.<br /><br />Excellent book and E L James has done it again. The second book is deeper and darker. Near misses with death not once but a couple of times if not three. Glad that Fifty is coming out of his 'shell'.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|What to Expect when you're Expecting hits a home run from the title on.  Like Sex and the Single Girl in the 1960s, Hollywood can't resist a self help book of any kind--that's nearly all they read there--so they buy the rights to the title and then invent a plot or narrative to give moviegoers perhaps more of a treat.  Woody Allen made Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) into a sort of Laugh-In of brief sight gags and sketches.  Even Mean Girls started out as a self=help book.  So, it's a whole genre filled with built-in history.  We speculated that the screenwriters of Expecting originally envisioned the whole movie initially as the full length story of Cameron Diaz and Matthew Morrison's characters, a reality TV trainer and a professional dancer, but actually as the movie wore on I got to dislike it every time they showed up with their story about whether or not their son should get circumcized.  Mr. Shoe wanted it, but Cameron Diaz no way.  It was a story that never made sense, well maybe it made sense but it is executed as though it were a heavy issue, like the passion of Christ in an Ingmar Bergman film.  Anyhow, Mr. Shoe had enough scenes so he must have felt like he was still playing Shue in the old days when he was married to that deceptive lying wife of his on Glee.<br /><br />We did notice a lot of gay leading men in this movie!  Most of them were able to play heterosexuals more or less adequately.  Maybe when the Cameron Diaz plot was getting too grim, producers thought they might as well have a second string to their bow and they asked Elizabeth Banks to come on and play a gorgeous woman with a schlubby dentist husband (Ben Falcone).  She is a heavily conflicted character, just like Cameron Diaz, and maybe the only reason why her story is a little lighter than Cameron Diaz' is that it's not a  debate about circumcision.  She is the daughter in law of elderly Dennis Quaid, a wealthy and famous race car driver with more money than sense.  Quaid himself is about to have twins with his young wife, played by model Brooklyn Decker.  The joke is that Banks, carrying only one child and heavily invested in the myth that pregnancy is a sacred state of being, looks infinitely heavier and more bedraggled than the one having twins who wears six inch heels and is still horny for Dennis Quaid.  Banks is an especially good actress, but I found Ben Falcone trying, like if you really wished for a new, chubby version of Hank Azaria really hard every night and made sacrifices to Pan, you might open your front door one day and there Ben Falcone would stand with a bacon wrapped hot dog in each hand.<br /><br />Those who read my reviews will already know my next sentence, which would have been something to the effect of, \\"Despite her reputation as a bad or indifferent actress, Jennifer Lopez delivers the best performance in the movie.\\"  I say this every time around, but it never stops offending some people who can't see the forest (Ethel Barrymore-like greatness as an actress) for the trees (her image and her allegedly awful personality).  But there you go.  Paired not so much with Rodrigo Santoro as her selfish husband as with Wendi McClendon Covey as Kara, her boss at the aquarium.  Do I believe Jennifer Lopez as a struggling photographer?  She is one who makes tangible the drive people have to photograph others and dolphins.  Very much so, and her trip to Ethiopia, while not really fitting in with the rest of the movie, should have been an IMAX travelogue all by itself.  It is more stirring than, what was that movie with Klaus Kinski pulling an opera house over a mountain with vines and native labor?<br /><br />Let's see, who else--Chace Crawford and Anna Kendrick.  I'm looking at that name \\"Chace Crawford\\" and wondering what part of it I got wrong because it just looks wrong.  As a pair of food truck entrepreneurs who once tried dating in high school, the two try to act serious but the gravity ofthe situation seems beyond either of them.  They have chemistry, but shopping chemistry, like they'd rather go to Uniqlo and see what's new on the racks, than fall in love and get unexpectedly pregnant,  All in all, a good movie, well directed y Kirk Jones, with plenty of appealing side characters, including the amazing Chris Rock, probably the funniest part of the movie, well, him and his little son \\"Jordan,\\" a hapless sort of cute little kid drawn from silent film, never says anything, just falls down repeatedly, and some mean little part of one's id laughs its ass off every time.the situation seems beyond either of them.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I WAS LEFT HANGING AND WAITING FOR AN ENDING. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED I WAITED 6 MONTHS FOR THIS BOOK AND REGRET IT I ACTUALLY WANT A REFUND AND I'VE NEVER RETURNED A BOOK. I NOW HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THEN ANSWERS BOO HOO
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The game is addictive. I spend way too much time playing it at night but I love the immediate gains after a set. Great game!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Amazing read. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to finish the series. Would recommend this book to everyone.<br /><br />Loved the incorporated love story.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Very good workout video paced so that anyone can do it, highly recommend for anyone who wants a good at home workout
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Good book. I enjoyed reading it and if you like smutty smut (like I do) then you will enjoy it too. Sometimes the constant \\"angels\\" were a bit much.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am having fun playing this. Works well on the kindle fire. Has enough going for it that I'm interested.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|From home movie clips and photos to great music, this picture of George Harrison was well worth the small price. His friends discuss his impact on their lives. This gives a glimpse into the real man and his music. I especially loved the Monty Python connection.
B005OK721G|5.0|I have never really been the action movie type of person,  but I LOVE this movie. It is my FAVORITE movie and Zoe does a great job. Would recommend this movie too anyone.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  I was not expecting to like it at all but was very pleasantly surprised.  I expected a lot of blood and gore and it was so nice to watch a action movie that left all that to one's imagination.  I dont need to see blood spurting everywhere to know someone has been killed; it was very refreshing to see the violence handled in this way.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I kept my kindle with me during our last storm to see where the storm was going and when it would hit us.  Fortunately,  it missed us but we were glad to be able to follow it.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Outstanding series.....enjoyed the storyline....was a quick read.Could not put it down.Was enthralled with the concept that the world could be like this.
B005HEE60E|5.0|Star Trek (remastered) makes it bran'new all over again. Absolutly fantastic. Please don't miss these episodes. Allow yourself<br />to enjoy it all over again
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love Thus author's  writing. However, this book didn't quite blow me away the way his two previous works did.  All in all, it is worth the read.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|If you are addicted to the series this is a must to complete the story.  The characters are full of angst, the story line twists and turns and great eye candy!!  What more could you ask for?
B00933JL0A|4.0|It is very laid back and I am not sure you could &#34;lose&#34; unless you intentionally tried to.  Still it is fun to build your little town.  Some o the last scenarios are actually a little challenging.  Too bad that more of them don't have time limits to accomplish certain tasks.
030758836X|5.0|I can't add much to the glowing praise for this book but it was one of my favorite reads of the past year.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|First off let me start by saying there shouldn't be any sort of hesitation when considering to add this to your Bluray collection. Tarantino does it again. One of the best films if not the best of last year. There's a beautiful balance here that isn't quite found in movies as of late. Violence, Humor and Great Writing. Tarantino puts together a visual masterpiece and at $13.00 dollars this movie is a steal!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|streaming of this movie through amazon was weird and unlike other streamers. Just redbox it. faster and you know it will play.
B000NY12CI|4.0|This is a well-written, sometimes shocking story of a strong-willed woman who was brought up in a war-torn area of the world.... Somalia, Saudia Arabia, Ethiopia, Kenya..  Her journey to a political life in Europe could never have been predicted given her childhood experiences.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Do not buy this app. I had it before and both of my anti virus software said that this app is Malicious. I deleted it and my kindle fire was freezing more often and get more ads on different app I was finally able to get rid of the virus but I don't want any more people to get a virus.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Jack Reacher keeps you on the edge of your seat with a plot that twists and turns. Far better than most movies like this recently. Tom Cruise is awesome and pulls off the role perfectly. Can't wait to read the books now!
B00005V9IL|1.0|as others have pointed out, this DVD is wide screen, but in a 4x3 format.  so playing on a HD tv adds black bars on the left and right.<br />the dvd is made for old 4x3 TVs and not modern 16x9 TVs.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really l like this puzzle app, especially picking out the number of pieces you want. Definitely would recommend to friends. You las have several puzzles to choose from.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome book. On the edge of my seat waiting for the next one. I may have to start  over with the first book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awsome after a wile u get an upgrade its awsome i just cant stop playing it ITS AWSOME thank u
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely ADORE this book!!  I have read it about 5 times in 2 months. Travis Maddox is my HEART!  The flawed characters give this book all of its heart and soul.  There's love, friendship, heartache, suspense and excitement. Will never get enough!
0385344228|3.0|Interesting format of story telling that leaves you uncertain about what exactly is going on and builds the suspense. However, it took a REALLY long time to get to the meat of the story. Extremely detailed about everything. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that nothing is 100% revealed, but you can draw your own conclusions as to the \\"who done it\\".
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I didn't expect to love this story like I did.  The characters are so young that I didn't feel like I would embrace them passionately, but I was wrong.  I'm in love with Will and Lake. Eddie, Caulder, Kel and ADORE GRANDPAUL!!! The idea of a poetry slam isn't something I believe I would enjoy going to so that fact that this book knocked my socks off was such a lovely surprise!
B003XVYLDU|3.0|This is one of those books that I finished and just didn't know what to think. Not what I expected at all. It was definitely an original piece of work, I just wasn't quite sure if there really were supposed to be aliens in this book, of if he was just delusional. The flashbooks were creative and always triggered by something related to it, but I was still a little confused by it. Eh, maybe I'll read it again another time.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I love this game! Super Mario Brothers + Little Big Planet - Costume Budget = Paper Monsters! It's adorable and fun to play. Good graphics, smooth game play, well thought out maps. I approve! Definitely worth it!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is an interesting book which follows the lives of members of several families in North Korea.  I never had a clear picture of the devastation from the famine till I read this powerful story.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|And I love this game too! Same fast paced game play and same grumpy customers (Poor Flo!) I find it's much easier to play on a touch screen than playing with a mouse. Or maybe I just haven't reached the harder levels since last time I played a Cooking Dash game. We shall see! I got this as a free app of the day, but I would gladly pay full price for it. If you enjoy Diner/Cooking Dash, (Or any of PlayFirst's games for that matter) This game is worth downloading!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book is easy to read.  The life Shin led is disturbing but his journey to where he is now is miraculous.  I learned about the history of North Korea and Harden opened my eyes to the conditions that exist in the labor camps.  I was disturbed and yet mesmerized.  I I couldn't put the book down because I longed to know that Shin would escape and be safe.
B007V65R54|4.0|I am actually still reading/using this book as part of a research study. This book was recommended to me by an MD after discussing my dissertation topic.  There are many different topics within this book, and that's ok.  I found much of the information about really understanding data to be useful.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is totally awesome people who submit bad reviews are crazy.Now who is dumb enough to say minecraft is better than this? Well I'm so smart I wouldn't do that this game has good graphics and wayyyyy more things than Minecraft I downloaded minecraft and my brother and I hated it  . Now suvivalcraft is very exceptional. So like I said great game.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|Not written very well, but an interesting story with some great vegan recipes.  I realize he is not a writer, but it shows.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Better than I thought it would be. Gratuitous violence, fun script. Decent special effects, but tons of<br /> blood. And exploding witches.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson is an awesome writer.  This was factual, research based, interesting, and very well written.  Loved the book. Highly recommend if you want to learn about Steve Jobs.
B001NA6096|5.0|I believe that Before Sunrise will increase your enjoyment of Before Midnight, background is often important to set the scene.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This just reinforced my philosophy of work and life.  This is a great book for the general population, especially women of all ages.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I have always and always will love Black Sabbath and especially bringing most of the original members back together again.
030746363X|5.0|Wonderful insight to transform your body. I love it!!!!!!! I am already done 10 pounds in 2 weeks - quick results!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The first two books in this series were amazing and I totally fell in love with Gideon Cross.  I would take him over Christian Grey any day of the week.  Like everyone else who was hooked on this series, I was ready for the third book to come out. I might as well have re-read the first two and saved money.  I'm at a little over halfway through the book and there is no progress in this story! We are still dealing with the Nathan issue, Brett, Corinne, mommy issues, Carey's being a commitment phobe and Eva's constant meltdowns.  I agree with someone else who said they don't know why Gideon puts up with Eva. Its gotten old.  The only good thing so far is her boss gets engaged! That's it!! I'm sure I'll slog through the rest of it but I doubt I buy the next book unless it gets some incredible reviews.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love Hayao Miyazaki's work. But I think one of my favorites is Spirited Away. This movie is one of his originals that he himself wrote. It is a wonderful story about a girl trying to get her parents back from a witch while trapped inside a world of Spirits. She learns the value of hard work and the importance of remembering who we are. If you like Hayao Miyazaki, you'll love this movie. No doubt!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Not much to say about this one. It was easy to install, and with the thermal paste already on the heat sink, it's basically fool proof. I'm using it in an office computer, so I haven't really had a chance to test its performance, but it works great in multitasking situations. Overall, it suits my needs and I would definitely recommend the whole line of amd FX processors. All three I've installed have functioned beautifully.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like the app a lot good job its very handy to disengage only thing I would like to see would be some type of auto warning
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|my son loves this game along with all the other Angry Birds games out there. He does not have a facebook account so he uses mine and plays with my friends that play this game, most of are cousins and know it is my son.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|bought for our drummer, he is a happy camper.<br />headset has great quality and the reviews don't disappoint. I will probably replace my mixer monitor headsets with this too in the future.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Many classic phrases were born from this movie.<br /><br />Don't know about &#34;critical&#34; reviews but it was always a winner since the first time I saw it!
B000P0J09W|5.0|this is an old movie and its so funny to watch again as an adult lookin at the outfits and hearing the music, but the story of adventure and being silly kids is good and even my kids like it now.
0061743526|5.0|One of the greatest books of the 20th Century.  I have reread this book a dozen times and always learn something new.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm old as dirt. Back in the day I used to listen to almost all my music with headphones - decent headphones. Then I moved out of my parents house and bought serious speakers.  Since then, I've forgotten how truly great music can sound through a good set of headphones and these Sony's are AMAZING!<br /><br />I'm hearing my music again with all the rich warm sounds, thumping bass, screaming highs......ahhhhh. What a relief.<br /><br />Buy these and hear what you've been missing.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|If you like the hidden object part of these type of games this is a great game. I myself like more of the mystery adventure and puzzles. The puzzles that they do have are fun. It was just a little too much hidden object for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book. I could  not put  it down.  My only wish is that the book was longer, I hope the next one goes over 400 pages.  Can't wait for the next book!!
B008OOYALE|2.0|It glitches too much. If my coins didn't keep disappearing or the game going blue all the time maybe I'd like it.
0316236535|5.0|It's a fun, &#34;interactive book,&#34; and my son loves it. Granted, it has not single-handedly helped him with his fear of the dark/monsters, but it's improving. It's worth the pick-up, for sure!
B000E8EUJ0|4.0|This movie can be a little sappy and predictable at some points but in general, it is a good movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author tells such wonderful stories. He pulls me in on the first page and I find it so hard to put down!
B000002LRX|5.0|I can never get enough of Faith No More.  It is one of my favorite bands and this album definitely did not disappoint me.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this book at the book store. Usually I buy kindle versions but I was at the mall and saw it and had been wanting to read it. So I bought the paperback version. I loved this book. I hated to have to put it down but couldn't find the time to just read straight through. I don't want to give any spoilers away so I won't say much about the story. But I can't wait for the movie to come out this summer.<br /><br />I am now on book  5 of this series and each one is great. They won't disappoint.
B000002NG7|5.0|I can never get enough of Faith No More.  It is one of my favorite bands and this album definitely did not disappoint me.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|It was not the quality of film i have seen Tom Hanks play . At times the backgound music is so load it hides the dialog of the scene you are viewing. It is similar to the movie &#34;Babel&#34; which is more climatic than this movie. This was very confusing at times very mediocre at best.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I liked the action and the ties to the original Wizard of Oz.  Keeps you interested through the whole movie
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This is a great series for kids of all ages.  I've been a fan of Grisham since his first novel and bought these for my grandson.  Of course, I had to read them first.  Good job - youngsters need much more than video games to expand and engage their minds.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Anything by Nicholas Sparks is great!  The storyline was great, made me cry, that's what &#34;girlie movies&#34; are for. My husband even enjoyed it.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|I was expecting a lot as he is such a fine singer/tenor but apart from a few good songs the rest were a very poor<br />choice to record ... and ... no .. not happy .. a waste of money!
B0028OF7TA|3.0|I don't own this and wouldn't buy it because it is missing CDs. It is a good price for 5 CDs, but it is missing his early solo CDs:<br /><br />- Got To Be There<br />- Ben<br />- Music & Me<br />- Forever, Michael<br /><br />It is also missing one of his very best CDs:<br /><br />- History: Past, Present & Future (Disc 1): A Greatest Hits CD<br />- History: Past, Present & Future (Disc 2): A CD of all new and incredible material. An official studio album in his discography (one of his top 2 or 3 albums along with Off The Wall & Thriller).<br /><br />It is also missing his half new material/half remix CD:<br /><br />- Blood on the Dance Floor<br /><br />They need to come out with a REAL full box set!!!
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I have a number of Rod Stewart's CDs and videos and the latest promised to be something good.  The songs were good<br />as were the arrangements but I am afraid it was more of the same ... nothing original like in years gone by.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I rated this app great, not because its feature rich (it isn't), but because it works as advertised. If, like me, you're looking for a basic calculator, look no further; you've found it!
1250012570|5.0|When Eleanor gets on the school bus her first day in a new school, no one wants to let her sit down. No one, that is, except Park, but he's not exactly happy about gaining a seat partner. They don't touch, they don't talk, and they hardly even look at each other at first...but then slowly they open up. They connect over comics and music, and begin to fall in love, despite all of the odds against them.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park is one of the best YA romances I've read in ages, although defining the story as a \\"YA romance\\" seems awfully limiting. It's difficult to define just what this book is. It's a story about first love and misfits, about being brave and being afraid, about holding on and knowing when you have to let go. Eleanor is such a strong character, and is easily admired for her wit, integrity, and her resolve. Park is just as wonderful, with his capacity to love, his courage to stand up for Eleanor and their relationship, and his never-ending attempts to make sense out of a very messed up world. The chemistry between these two characters is incredible as they fall in love--Rowell makes hand holding and late-night conversations incredibly hot. Everything about this story is so magnetic, with an appropriate balance of life's harsh realities and all of the wonder and excitement of love. This near-perfect YA book will resonate with readers of all ages.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I bought this to play Draw Something on my iPad. While I like the three different sizes, the rubber is really poor and doesn't glide - it kind of sticks. Makes it very difficult to draw with. If you aren't buying this to draw, it might work well for you, but if you're using it to draw, look at the other stylus that I reviewed, THAT one is cheaper, and amazing for drawing.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci has written a real winner in The Innocent.  It is exciting throughout and leaves you guessing until the end.  Highly recommended.
B006UG90RM|5.0|After the first run through of this master piece, I felt a rush of tranquility through my soul. I'm a die hard Van Halen fan. This beauty of an album goes back to the roots of the brown sound. Eddie's got so much going on through out every song! I've listened to this not less than 200 times and still find myself catching a hidden riff here and there. Lots going on! Great sound. Great to have Dave back. That's Van Halen. Great lyrics too. I'm old school. I like to listen to the whole thing a few times, while working my way though a 12 pack, then bust out the lyrics and follow along. Give it a try with this. You'll enjoy the ride! Be sure and rewind the solo in The trouble with never a few times. Mind blowing. Hell the whole thing is mind boggling. Eddie freakin' kills it! Kills it I said. If you have taste in music you're gonna love this.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|The phone has taken a number of falls and it is good.  Granted they were not 20 feet falls onto cement, but generally speaking good.
0307592731|1.0|From the opening passage where she discards a boot because the other is lost saying that one boot is worthless without the other, she proves not only how inept a hiker she is, but how simplistic and disingenuous she is as a writer. A great story idea hijacked by a moron, a bike with one flat tire is worthless, a story of individual achievement written by an idiot is much the same.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I am amazed at the people who reviewed this movie as terrible. Did they really think that this was intended to be a real life serious drama. People get a life this is an action pact fantasy that is far from boring. My one caution as others have said is that it is too intense and bloody for small children. I guess my best description of the movie is that it is a comical, yet bloody romp through a fantasy world of witches.<br />I bought the movie mainly for my 3D collection.  The 3D effects are some of the best I have seen.  The 3D quality is equal to that of Avatar, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Strange Tides, and Alice in Wonderland.<br />Forget about reality, get the 3D version and sit back and enjoy this nonsensical romp through fantasy land.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Please only read this book if you have large chunks of time to devote to reading.  This is not one of those books you can read a little of every night before you go to bed.  The writing is fantastic and it's really impressive how the author changes viewpoints and tone freuquently.  I'd recommend this book with the caveat that it's a journey!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My children and I LOVE this CD. We have listened to it over and over. My kids love the Cello Wars and Mission Impossible the most and I love them all.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this book, but for any of you lawyers out there, it is riddled with procedural and ethical mistakes.  However, it's entertaining and nonfiction.  A good page turner!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|It's exactly what I ordered, plays great; it's a great movie to watch with a big surround sound system :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show!  I recommend everyone sit down and watch.  I never thought it would grab my interest like it has!
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love to browse the site for ideas on products and ideas! it is great you can save the ideas to your board to look at when you are ready to use the idea.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Great watch! Keeps good time and looks good. I would recommend it as a no frills watch, although it is stylish.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|It was enjoyable - acting was great.  Quite a departure from the original Wizard of OZ so you had to sort of put that in the back of your head.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Fantastic wrap up to one of my favorite series!  Pretty sad it's over, but have a feeling an additional &#34;fan service&#34; book would be overkill.<br /><br />Sorry.......  kind of babbling because the review wants more words.  I mean, let's be honest:  anyone who has already invested this series is going to get the last book no matter what the hell a review says!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've heard a lot of people, including good friends of mine say this book helped their marriage and made things hot in bed for them again...quite the opposite for me. It angered me to think that there are relationships out there like the one in this book, and how deep people can fall into people who are so wrong for them. Bless Ana' s heart. I hope she is able to stay strong after the broken, messed up Christian has taken from her the independent, vibrant woman she could have been. Questioning reading the others, unless of course in books two and three she tell him where to stick it!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|works great! exactly what i was looking for! allows me to charge in the case as well. it was a great buy
B00992CF6W|5.0|First, the update freezes a lot but me and my cuz worked through it.<br />Second, minecraft is awesome. All of the people who prefer survivalcraft, survival craft is nothing compared to minecraft. Minecraft is awesome!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXDD|1.0|The DVD was scratched beyond repair. Even with the industrial repairs, the DVD hung up in several places and could only be avoided by selecting scenes.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|says free.....but.....two ads stay locked on ur video....one is a random ad N the other is saying upgrade... they should just tell u from the start to buy it....its that simple... uninstalling.... waste of time.. btw its 1.99
B00D41H2PS|5.0|This was a good game. Mainly three buildings so didn't have to run all over. I solved this in one evening and it usually takes me a long time (weeks and longer :) There were a couple of times when it took a moment to load so it appeared that nothing happened or I couldn't pick the item. Other times I picked up things without realizing how. I had to think about connections at times. Definitely worth it.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Fun adventurous read. This one was definitely a lot darker and more testing of the series. A great read for anyone into the genre of action and adventure.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|love that it can be used for phone and computer also love that it is so easy to access and use
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Intriguing idea about time travel. Like Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. A little gruesome and a nice twist at the end. Definately enjoyable syfi flick.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I've read all her books & waiting for more. You can't guess the ending and her content is more than interesting.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Big fan of the books. Thought casting Cruise as Reacher was a mistake, ut it turned out okay. A crime mystery with a fair amount of action and a nasty bad guy.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun game to keep the kids entertained .  Fun game looked like everyone likes it. Very good rating earlier. Very Fun!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I thought the title was odd. Had never heard of it  but thought I'd give it a look. A little romance a lot of action, and an interesting concept. Certainly left room for a sequeal.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I like this app. The only problem I had was  it only had few options compared to some of them. Beyond that it was great.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|As a long-time fan of ABB, the Retrospective was a set I eagerly awaited.  I knew Duane recorded with numerous other musicians but I did not realize the breadth and depth of that music.  The set moves from his earliest recordings through studio time and up to ABB songs just prior to his death.  My first listen of the 7 discs was in their numerical order.  Since, I listen randomly, but over and over. The text included adds to the Skydog story as only those closest to Duane could do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most addicting game I have exempt for the Sims .it so much fun and you will play it for hours
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This is the best Google Reader replacement I've found.  Freely is doing a fantastic job of making me forget I ever used anything else to follow my favorite blogs and news feeds.<br /><br />Great app.  I use it every day!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|There was nothing I didn't like about it. I would compare it to human history. I would say that people should know that if you are a citizen of the United States who believes their government to be infallible and would like to continue to do so then do not watch this movie.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Back in the day when my middle son and I were much younger, we would make breakfast on a Saturday morning and watch the old War of the Worlds television series starring Jared Martin [[ASIN:B003YJFALS War of the Worlds: The Complete Series]]. It was a fun series and a great bonding time for both of us. Falling Skies starring Noah Wiley is very reminiscent of that old series, a little cheesy at times, a bit derivative, but with mostly likeable and interesting characters, cool aliens, and a pretty decent story line. Good to see Noah Wiley back in a regular role (go Dr Carter), always happy to see the great Will Patton, and the dastardly Colin Cunningham turns in a kind-of-like-ya, mostly-don't, menacing performance. Falling Skies Season One is fun, Falling Skies Season Two is even better [[ASIN:B00BN0WQ5I Falling Skies: The Complete Second Season]].
6305428352|4.0|loved it way back when, had it on vhs- needed to switch to dvd, watch it over and over again with friends
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful graphics and just challenging enough!  I loved it and I can't wait for the next Room.  It's well worth the price!
B00000IQV7|5.0|loved the movie, and more so when I found out it is based on a real life &#34;patch&#34; Adams, and his hospital he started
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Ok, layne's dead, it does not mean this guys have to stop making music, jerry is a great talent and you are wrong if you think he should not be writing. It is different but every record has to be, you cant expect the same sound always. Buy it, beats the hell out of fall out boy or all that indie crap that,s being released
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Gritty, gripping and compelling.  One of the best anti-hero TV shows ever made.  Great character development. Fantastic acting from a diverse cast and storylines.
B008Y212PI|4.0|really enjoy figuring out the puzzles to reveal &aacute;ll of the items in each scene.  the scenes are pretty and cute and interesting.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|No description or review can prepare you for this story. It's innovative and fresh. It starts slow and winding. It took me about an hour before I could really tell what was going on, who was who, and care about any of it. Give it time to hook you. It's worth the ride.<br /><br />What also makes it so creative is that you can't really classify this as one thing. It's sort of a sci-i flick, semi-comedy, kind of a love story, a little bit of a mystery, and a touch of spiritual/message movie. It's completely a story about life. I think that no matter where you are in life, there is a message here for you that can be deeply personal. I suspect it will grow as you grow.<br /><br />The international cast is SUPERB! Seeing Hugo Weaving as a woman alone is worth the almost 3 hours of viewing. Well done.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is the greatest. All you have to do is set your location so that it can tell you what the temperature at the time. It also rotates so you can have it on what ever angle.that you want it. This app is awesome. If you are looking for an app that tells you the weather and the time, I would suggest getting this app. Take my word for it. Also please read the description on the app so you know everything that you need to know about the app. Okay so if you read this review you are doing a good job in life, so keep it up.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Dan Brown has found a very successful formula, with these &#34;Robert Langdon&#34; books. On the one hand, there is the easy familiarity with a well-established character, on the other a challenging new adventure in a new context. The twists in the plot are there, many quite unexpected despite one watching out for them. The final outcome surprised me, which is very unusual!<br /><br />This is a gripping yarn, likely to appeal to a wide audience. All of the required background is supplied within the story, and although some knowledge of the location would add richness to the reader's imagination, not having visited them would not undermine one's reading pleasure.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is an artist.....He paints a vivid picture with his words.  His characters come alive, each of their<br /><br />lives, a separate story.  He shows us the resilency of the human spirit through his novels.
B00C2AXDAU|5.0|Love, love, love this album, I just can't say enough about. If you like KV you will not be disappointed  I promise
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Well, let me first say that I was born in the 90's so I can't really say anything about the old times, but the movie was still pretty good.<br /><br />It wasn't that scary to me because of the fact that it was made in the 70's and there weren't a lot of resources in those times.<br /><br />There's the scene in which Regan (Linda Blair) goes down the stairs walking with both hands and feet and back down (if you've seen the Youtube video you know what I mean) which WAS NOT here.<br /><br />The graphics look nice to be a movie from the 70's. I saw it in 1080p!<br /><br />Overall, if you like old school horror movies, there it is, and if you were born in the 60's or before and you remember this, it'll make you go back in the days.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|some puzzles took a while to figure out but that's what I've been looking for. kept my intention for quite some time!!!!!
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I really can't afford to pay anyone to uploads it for me.  About 2 months ago, I tried to follow the instructions for approximately 3 weeks to upload it myself.  i am just geting ready to start again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is really good game and very fun too play!also its a good time passer onlong trips to play its a good game for kids to
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun I love it when I'm sick I'll play this all day my brother loves it to lol so does my mom
B0095MVOMC|3.0|Very good game, but for a paid version there should be NO ads.<br />Unfortunately for the unsuspecting,  this is embedded with Admob.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update is awesome I like that you can spawn animals and use buckets to carry milk water and lava
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is a great mind game to pull up quick and play a couple levels when you're on the go!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I always like a game that has the matching boxes. Several levels to make it interesting. I would recommend this game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is your typical Solitaire game. I love the classics. The app works wonderful and you can rotate the screen however you want to play the game. Either way the cards are nice and big and easy to read.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This app was just the basic google search engine. Why?  Any device that uses apps anymore is most likely capable of using the net and, therefore, can access google without an app. And in doing so, get far more of the google services. Waste of time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love these books but was left hanging at the end. There HAS to be another book! So hot and happy!
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Light, fun, with humor and depth. So witty, I wish I knew of another such book to order right now, which would be as good. The perfect read for a long airplane ride, or commute.
B005CWRB44|4.0|This stays on my keychain. Compared to my old 10 lumen Fenix E01, it may be larger in circumference but it's such a small thing length wise it actually feels smaller in my pocket. And it is much brighter! only downside is the twisty cap for on off functions isn't perfect, but it does it's job. overall worth the price for me.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|Sure I kind of had an idea of where the story would be heading but man... what a horrid way to end the series.<br />That ending is so lazy and full of character inconsistencies, its like their brains dissolved over the course of the season.<br /><br />Umm... Arthur is injured and I have to take him to the island of Avalon.<br />Maybe I'll just trudge through these open fields with enemies about and take my time camping in forests along the way to get us there.<br />Oh and I'll come out to Arthur because its appropriate and all with him dying.<br />And another thing, I have the abilitiy to call on the Dragon to carry me and Arthur to the island but I won't do that until Arthur is dead and I am left crying on the shoreline looking at said mythical island three days from now!<br /><br />Merlin... you moron!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|just like the boat  in  Chicago.  Used to be able to wander thru it in the old days. great movie
B004WE01YA|3.0|Never saw this and I can't say I enjoyed it as immensely as other Disney fair.<br />Still, the animation is beautiful as is the use of some computer generated segments.<br />I've never been a fan of the music but It serves its purpose.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved it .KEpt<br /> me interested .Graphics an overall game was fun an KEpt me guessing.would definitely recommend if you like hidden objects an mystery games
B009NY43NY|3.0|i did not like this book as well as the others. it could have taken a better turn. definitely not her best work.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this is awsome but slendy looks like he runs when you are close and i saw him real high up walking. that is cool
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game makes you write one of these in order to get resources so here it is. It's early days yet but so far pretty good but the constant need to update Facebook,Twitter or post reviews like this get a little irritating.<br /><br />Mart
1451695195|5.0|A very thought-provoking book---a brilliant neuroscientist  sees heaven---a brilliant description.. being a retired R.N. from a skilled nursing care facility for many years,  I identified with much that was written from listening to my patients that had similar experiences.  Faye P.Nasworthy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A really great game I love it!!! Super features and qualities!! Buy now!!! Great use and its free so go get it now!!!:)
B007IK44CK|4.0|Great watch with stunning action scence and impressive storyline.<br />I like the way story revolves around the world covering 5 different countries
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I expected something like \\"True Blood\\" and at the beginning it seemed as though I was right. After about 15 minutes I knew I was wrong. The movie is fascinating and very well acted. I had not heard of the books before and I now intend to correct that deficit.  I recommend this movie highly. It is much more thoughtful and clever than anticipated.<br />*edit= I got the book and was very disappointed. It reads like a blog. I did a separate review of it but the bottom line is I was very let down after seeing this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game this is the best game u could ever play my little sister loves it this message is by gwenee
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|I got this for my kids and they live it. Simple game to use and move around with. Planes are good.
B00942G4UA|5.0|...this documentary showed me that our food industry is far worse than I already thought!  Disgusting - and disheartening - to learn some of the techniques that are used and the shenanigans that go on &#34;regulating&#34; our food supply.  EVERYONE should watch this movie.
B0095P31L6|3.0|very slow going movie, but cute<br /><br />It was something to do on a rainy afternoon.  I was not a see again movie
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|She watches it over and over again.  I guess you have to really like opera like she does.  As for me, I liked it the first time, but that was enough for me.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|the movie was just average.  the weapons were good....the quality of the playback was very poor... all teal and grey... and i had to<br />refresh it quite often.. very dissappointing experience.. usually i like the new amazon player.. i love the closed captions A+ on that.
B0007TKNII|5.0|She watches it over and over again.  I guess you have to really like opera.  I saw an off-Broadway production.  There's nothing like a live production.
B004X1D3TC|3.0|It's ok but not a must-buy book. The content sometime distract readers from the main topic- agile estimating and planing
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game. I have played it before on the computer and was delighted to find it on my Kindle Fire.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a very fun addicting little casual game. Has some cool gadgets and is to me much mote enjoyable then similiar games like temple run.
0767817664|5.0|Good Humour in the Scary movie. Seen this movie ages ago, and has always been one of my favorite vampire movies. Great sound track too !!
1939416019|1.0|I mainly purchased this book because it was 2.99 for the kindle edition and the star reviews were decent.  Well that was a waste of 2.99!  As other reviews have said, the writing is incredible juvenile.  I got bored to the point of where I just began scanning pages because reading them closely wasn't necessary.  There wasn't a single plot event that wasn't anticipated, and not because of clever foreshadowing, but because the story so obviously pulls from the genre.  There wasn't really an original thought in this book.  The &#34;mysterious&#34; druid is just annoying and the lack of effective dialogue is plain boring.<br /><br />Could my feeling toward this book be so slanted because my most recent foray into the genre was GRR Martin?  Maybe, but I think it is more just the fact that this is a poorly written book.  My suggestion would be to take out the references to homosexuality and alcohol and market this as a book for intermediate (3rd-5th) grades.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is very addictive and I love it. I sometimes have dreams playing this game. There's just one thing that gets me. Occasionally for some strange reason a keyboard pops up out of nowhere . This happens when I press the house button to go to a different app and return to the game.<br />Other than that, this is a great game and I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a good competition game and it is fun leisure time.I love to play it the only problem is it is hard to get characters and it takes so long but I love it.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Wonderful material, with lots of vocals, though Eliane's all around skills as a musician still come through. She's the best, and this CD offers a wonderful slight change of pace. A lot of these songs are wonderful old standards, yet Eliane gives them a great new twist, with her own interpretations. This showcases a wonderful entertainer and musician in a way that makes you realize her amazing versatility. If you've any hesitations about buying this, you won't have once you own it.<br />Oddly, I was in Sao Paulo, recently...Eliane is a Paulistana, and yet few people seem to know of her.<br />Stop reading this, and just buy it. You won't be sorry.
0486282147|4.0|I have always loved detective and crime mysteries.  In fact, westerns and detective stories are probably the most popular genre in literature today.  This one (The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conon Doyle) has been one of the most read Sherlock Holmes stories ever written.  This story begins with Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson being hired to protect Sir Henry from the legendary curse of the Baskerville family.  The death of several members of the Baskervilles came about because of a mystical hound like creature who goes for the throat to kill members of the family.  This all takes place on the ghostly and spooky moors of Devonshire.<br /><br />I had seen the Sherlock Holmes movie on The Hound of the Baskervilles but the book goes into much greater detail than the movie.  If you like Sherlock Holmes you will enjoy reading this tale.  My only complaint is that is the writting was a little small in this text and the style of English writing by Arthur Conan Doyle takes a little getting used to; nevertheless, once you are into the story it all becomes clear through the expert eyes of Detective Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a very good mystery story that keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir).
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the sheep is lots of fun to watch for both adults and little ones! We thoroughly enjoyed watching the entire season.
B008OOYALE|1.0|When I first got this game, I loved it.  I have it on my kindle and played it daily. However, now that I am a higher level, I am extremely frustrated with it. There are many things that you can't get on the Kindle version that you can get on the iPad, it crashes every third friend that I visit and the costs for the higher level habitats are astronomically higher than the starting one's. I would've given it 5 stars except for those things. The crashing alone makes game play nearly impossible. I wouldn't bother with this game until they fix that. Will update my review if game designers get on the ball and fix these issues.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Love Darius Rucker and this one is fantastic! If he doesn't win an award for this album, I will be so disappointed!
B004UPAN6W|5.0|This is the X-Men movie I'd been waiting for. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber light it up! The story line was well paced, and the action kept coming from the get go. I have enjoyed the other X-Men movies immensely, but Wolverine's story was what I expected, a fast and furious, special effects laden roller coaster ride.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Lady A is a fantastic group. Love the sound and love what they stand for. They are so great together.!
B00351ZUHY|5.0|Good acting, good story line, and a little morality check to boot. John Lithgow as his usual pitch perfect character makes a great preacher with a slightly skewed sense of morality. It does teach a good lesson though, with the Bible at the center of the controversy (anybody surprised?).
B005ZUR724|4.0|great one of the best mmos on tablet.  good graphics  good atmosphere  good controls very enjoyable  great fun highly recommended
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game it amazing is user friendly for both many users<br /><br />However this game requires many friends to move quickly to open more rooms<br />thats the only drawback<br /><br />I love to play this game it gets me ready for bingo evening
B007HUD6OS|3.0|The entire Theodore Boone series should be required reading for middle school.  They are great motivational book. Young people can overcome adult bias.
B000002N3N|3.0|I started my Enya collection with The Celts, and quickly added Shepherd Moons and Watermark, and I really liked those.<br /><br />A few years later I got The Memory of Trees, and I was disappointed.  Although there were some good pieces on this, it really wasn't as good as those first three.  It seems that this just lacks originality.<br /><br />That might seem a bit unfair, because 'lack of originality' may be attributed primarily to my familiarity with Enya's music, so that anything she does is going to start sounding just like her previous work.  However, some of the selections on this release seemed weak.<br /><br />Another way of putting this is that this release was too commercial.  It just appeared to have been cranked out for the money.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|As expected a great collection to have for my new blu ray player, all with wonderful quality and in great condition
0800141601|3.0|I read a lot of the critical reviews and have to agree with many of them for many reasons.<br /><br />But I still enjoyed the movie.  Why?  Because it's a love story, a story of a man who will take any risk to save the woman he loves. And I enjoy a decent love story. It also has horses, and I like movies with horses.<br /><br />I think if the movie hadn't used the Camelot angle and had just been presented as a medieval romance, the critical reviews might have been less harsh.<br /><br />Watch it with a glass of wine and ignore the flaws.
B000PMG16U|5.0|As expected a wonderful collection to have for my new blu ray player, all with wonderful quality and in great condition
B005UKJX4E|2.0|Unless you thought 2001: A Space Odessy or A River Runs Through It were riveting films, you will probably be too bored during Tree of Life to care much for their artsy treatment of the philosophical subject matter. The movie addresses the individual's struggle to manage his relationship with God, his family, and himself while accepting the inevitability of death and freedom of forgiveness.  While that sounds fascinating, the film progressed at a snail's pace losing my interest entirely by the end.
B006AN78XS|5.0|I find Woody Allen fascinating and I appreciate a lot of his movies, but I don't often love his movies.<br /><br />I loved Midnight in Paris. You can certainly hear Woody's signature style through Gil, played by Owen Wilson. It is a charming story about nostalgia for the past and disatisfaction in the present. Who can't relate to a romanticized notion of where you aren't? The characters you run into include F Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, etc etc. Not to mention you get Marion Cotillard being as charming as ever.<br /><br />It is just a lovely film. Definitely recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfers because it is so cool and fun that I play it ever time I have time to play it.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|If you are into Science Fiction stories this is a great show for you. It seems like it could've been a YA series that blew up and would have a face like Jennifer Lawrence raking in millions.<br /><br />The storyline is intriguing and Tatiana Maslany delivers. She plays many characters but you would never have to question who she is in a given scene. That does not come down to just wardrobe, but the little details she and the director have given each character.<br /><br />It is brilliant.
0786958731|5.0|There is a bit of a learning curve involved in this game, but once you learn the system, it goes quickly<br /><br />It's a completely different system than D&D. You draw either new encounters or environment changes on every turn. It's much more about combat and tactics than role-playing. It's worth a try.
B005544V6A|4.0|I had heard nothing but good things about Suits and saw that it was on Amazon Prime so I wanted to give it a shot.<br /><br />It is in fact a really good show! I don't think USA gets enough credit for their line-up, but I think the fact that most of their shows last multiple seasons is a good indicator.<br /><br />You would think it would get old seeing the protagonists get ending they want, but Suits writers manage to make the storylines interesting and with enough twists to keep you engaged. Beyond that, each character is someone you want to see on the screen. There is no doubt that Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter and Patrick Adams as Mike Ross deliver a good performance but the cast surrounding them are awesome too. I love a good a Louis scene, Rachel is smart, beautiful and well rounded, Donna is brilliant, Jessica can be a scene stealer and a great female in a power position to boot!<br /><br />Suits, watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius has done it again.Not a so-so song in the group. I listen to this cd nonstop. Keep the great music coming!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It is amazing to learn the different decisions two parents reach over the same child. A lot of twists and turns.
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm a SyFy fan and there's so little quality SyFy available anymore I had to like this show and would highly recommend to any SCI-FI fan.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|This movie would do great on the science fiction channel.  It is really well done and look a whole lot better than I anticipated.  Would recommend a one time watch for anyone who likes Halo
B002RVCD6O|3.0|It was well done and all. Good stuff with the plot twist... But it seemed they were just jamming alot of raw (plot) info into this film to set up the final two films.<br />A must see obviously if your watching the whole set films.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|It is a good movie.  Was not what I expected but it is definitely a movie that I would watch again.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|It streamed great on my Vizio tv, yo. This movie is good, yo. If you like historical movies this one might be a good one for you to watch.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I love golem so when he was back in action I had to see it.  It is a good movie and I anticipate the next two will be just as entertaining.
B00992CF6W|1.0|When i create a level and my friend joins on wifi we look a two different worlds i am below ground on hos and he is floating in mine please fix this problem
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Elegantly written. Loved the story. The intertwining of characters and time was masterfully done. Found myself thinking about visiting...and then maybe not.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book has made me realize that, there are many possibilities in the world. Believe what you want to believe. But know that many things can be believable.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Liam Neeson's greatest role, and one of Ralph Fiennes' best as well. My favorite of Spielberg's excellent historical epics. Just an incredibly detailed and meticulously told story of one selfish man's complete character transformation over the course of the 6 most brutal years in German history. Seeing the truth of what happened in Krakow wrecked me as an impressionable young person and still wrecks me when I see this film today. Oskar Schindler's redemption saved 1100 people and, in the process, saves us as he saves himself. The most powerful film I have ever seen.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this all the time. I make all different types of melodies with this. A example is, say it's Halloween and you want your haunted house to be scarier. So, you take your Kindle make a scary tune, such as Melody,Piano,Thunderstorm, as loud as possible,and a low sound of the River.<br />After making a tune touch the '...' at the top right corner of the screen and then press the 'Favorites' button (It may crash so you'll have to restart,but it usually  saves where you put the sound notch for that noise)and then once you get there,press 'Add' in the top right corner of the screen. Then just plug in a beat box  or headphones to your Kindle and hit play on main screen. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Suffers is the best run away game I have ever played.It is. Awesome. I can not wait till the next update.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Leps world 2 is just like one of those old Mario games and its FREE. I'm so glad I got this game because it is so fun.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Amazon has GREAT customer service!  Had a problem with charging my kindle and the person who<br />worked with me was fantastic!  Sent out the replacement cable and even called to make sure I received it.  Thank you Amazon!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|A great retrospective of one of the greatest groups of songwriters of any generation. You can feel the music....long live the Bee Gees!
B004HO6HWA|5.0|One of the best movies with Statham.. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, like always..but just when you think you know what's going to happen.....your wrong  honestly if you don't mind a little violence, you'll freakin love this movie!!
B001HDWKMA|5.0|Pretty eclectic; soulful and at the same time, folksy. My weekend music....Ray expresses the many perspectives we all have as we encounter life. Excellent!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book! Easy read, straight to the point, real world. This book goes behind the media coverage and reveals how much the American Warrior and his family actually sacrifice for our country.
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|This album is a work of pure genius. I wasn't sure how Stone Sour could have followed up on such a masterpiece like part 1, happily, my expectations were superceded. Thank you Stone Sour for bringing us albums of the caliber of what I would expect of a band like Rush. Awesome stuff guys! Keep it up!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The movie was good but not great!  It did end understanding how Oz and the witches came to be in the Wizard of Oz.  I love James Franco and Michelle Williams.  They did a great job!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I loved this film! If you are a fan of Miyazaki, this movie should be on your list. It's also a great movie for older kids who enjoy Japanese animations or just something different or out of the ordinary.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Given the authors background and recognizing that this book could harm his professional reputation, I found it most persuasive. I have always felt that the argument that hypoxia could account for the near death experiences was a good one. But the fact that the author is himself a neurosurgeon and had no brain activity in the pre-frontal cortex overcomes the hypoxia explanation. I'm glad that I read it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This Alarm Clock Xtreme (Free) App has everything! From an alarm clock, to a stop watch to a timer!!!! It works wonderful!!!! I don't wake up to an awful buzzing drone sound. I now wake up to a gentle melody!!!! Thanks, Angle Labs!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kept me wanting more !!! Can't wait to read the rest of the series !!<br />An to see the movie and their twist of the story!
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Decent addition to the series, but it is time to change the premise and move on. It even looks as though the actors that have been with the other movies are tired. Either way, something to eat popcorn with.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Feel like I must have been hiding under a rock not to have heard of these guys before this album.<br /><br />When I'm looking for new music to listen to I often look through the latest releases at Amazon and saw this album pop up with glowing reviews.<br /><br />As soon as I had a listen I was absolutely blown away - that was weeks ago now and I've since bought all their albums and listened to nothing but these guys - to be honest I probably prefer some of their previous albums over this one, but this is still a definite 5-star for me.<br /><br />Highlights for me on this album are:<br /><br />Pearl Hart, despite some long-time, hardcore fans not being over the moon about it as an album opener, I reckon it is an awesome track - more so for the verses than the chorus. Cool solo too.<br /><br />Dead But Rising - one of the big things this band does that few, if any others can do as well (for me), is somehow make a song mega-heavy but still have melodic sections, and without the need to resort to screaming or death metal vocals. The section in the middle of this song, which starts around the 2.10-minute mark still gives me goosebumps with Poulson's voice. One of my favourite individual sections of the whole album.<br /><br />The cover of My Body, Lola Montez and Black Bart are other highlights on an album I can honestly say that I at least like every single song and love most of them. Worth twice what I paid - it's that good.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|Bought it so I could try and play a FPS game on my galaxy S4 but didn't work. The triggers arent mapped for some reason. So I use it for emulators on the phone and it works perfect. The app that you have to get with the controller is in \\"beta\\" and doesnt work.
B00D6OV57O|4.0|Great but not as good as the original. Very energetic and ethereal. Definitely worth listening to, But not a must-have.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|boy meets girl, boy doesn't get it, boy get it, is he too late? good cast, enjoyable movie. glad i watched it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy hidden object games, but this one requires you to make in app purchases. I'm not enthusiastic about that.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|but i guess i will have to do this in pieces. i liked the movie, this is, though, a calmer bilbo baggins than LOTR, we did enjoy it, glad to have it in our collection.
B004LWZW42|1.0|I can't even watch a scene it keeps cutting off have to turn it on and off. It will start playing then it starts to cut off again. ugh
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A good mix of &quot;simple&quot; solutions blended with levels that are frustrating for those who want three stars on each level.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I first saw this movie as a young boy in the 1970s.  I remember watching Charlie Chan with my grand parents on frequent occasions, I remember other characters from Agatha Christie movies.  This was truly a funny movie that really makes your sides ache.  I don't really recommend this movie for the younger generation for they may not really understand the characters.  This was the 1st parody movie I ever saw and truly laughed all the way thru.  If you like old school Hollywood than you will love this movie.  The premise of the movie is that the world's greatest detectives have been invited to a party to solve a murder of Lionel Twain and during their exploits and mishaps pure chaos erupts in comedic laughter.
B0087WRGVY|5.0|Buy this CD. This is one of the best written, produced ever.  Sound is awesome, playing is stellar.  Hard Rock done.  Melodic rock done.  Song writing done.  10/10.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really well done! Great writing and acting. We've finished the season in a week. Addictingly good. I can't wait to start season 2. And 3 after that.
B0077EBWVI|2.0|Nearly the same storyline, line for line, as the original. Can't top a classic, though. The lead had nothing on Kevin Bacon, who played a much more believable character.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|The utensils are bulky to store, but I love the bright colors and the shapes of the utensils. I bought a second set for a wedding gift.
B000SZNET6|5.0|I chose this rating because this movie is awesome.  I like the quality of the movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies.
044042321X|5.0|I just loved it! The graphic novel have excellent illustrations and it is so beautiful.<br />I recommend for all Game of Thrones' fans.
B001D09OAI|5.0|We watch Major League at least once a year, usually about the time the Indians start to tank for the season!
B00992CF6W|5.0|When Is the new update, this is the greatest game ever made!<br />I WISH there was horses and cars in mine craft that would make want to play minecraft or tell people<br />.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Loved the book but I think the end is a little cheesy.  Not every book must end happily ever after...
B00594XOZU|4.0|It's a great way to connect and get in touch with friends. You can have a conversation with more than one person so everyone everyone knows what everyone is saying, a great app
B004DLPXAO|3.0|A lot of my content won't work on the device I am on (S4) (magazines, movies, etc), and it keeps saying do an update, but there is no update to run on this platform (I even called customer support to confirm)...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it the action, romance and most important the twists!!!<br />I will definitely buy the next book and finish the series.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|As someone who has played the original Nintendo DS version, this product works as expected.  The controls are still wonky, and the lack of a stylus makes selecting the correct items a bit tougher, but it's still a fun game.  For maximum enjoyment, don't fall into the trap of using the same few tools for every level.  It's tempting, but that defeats the purpose!
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Awesome Movie !!! Denzel, is The Man !!! Ethan Hawke, is A Great Actor, As Well. A Must See, & A Classic.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|These guys put together such a brilliant and cohesive album.  The songs and instruments have expanded greatly compared to their previous releases.  This album will easily be one of the top albums to come out this year.  The growth the band has shown is truly stunning.  Don't expect another &#34;Rated R&#34; or &#34;Songs For The Deaf&#34;, it's a different approach.  More mellow, but still has a strong impact.  Definitely for those who like to enjoy listening to entire albums and not just selected tracks here and there.  Just buy it, you won't be disappointed.  If you were a fan before, you'll appreciate how the band has evolved.  If you weren't a fan before, you will likely now become one.  Every track is great on its own, but a few of my favorites are &#34;If I Had A Tail&#34;, &#34;Fairweather Friends&#34; and &#34;Smooth Sailing&#34;.  But that can change each time I'm listening to the album.  Highly recommended.
0123694965|5.0|A good starting point for an absolute beginner and I will definitely use this with the cards for years and recommend the set for anyone interested in game/process design.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|This sticker book was bought for my granddaughters.  They love the fact that they can dress the dolls over and over again and change the scenes as they like.<br /><br />Lovely colourful clothes and hard wearing stickers.  This should last them a long time.<br /><br />Thanks
B000UJCALI|5.0|Awesome film and worth having to add to my Stephen King Collection as it is a great Classic Horror film. :)
B00AOQ8IZE|5.0|This is a great  action movie with a stellar cast!  I always think if it came out a year, or even 6 months later, it would have had an awesome grunge music score to fit with the surfing theme.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was using Yahoo! radio before and it never worked.  This app does just what I wanted - listening to AM and FM stations.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Great movie for different age kids would recommend it for the family, the kids wanted to watch it twice, very entertaining
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is a very quiet and beautifiul production of Jane Eyre.  The acting is superb as is the direction, sets & costumes.  I am so happy to have it as part of my DVD collection.  Once again, Amazon.com is the &#34;go to&#34; source for finding items I want.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Quite impressed with this game. I have a pc version and I like the kindle version better. Keep up the great work
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Having collected every Harry Potter DVD and book since they hit the planet causing the sensation they did, I had to complete that collection with this DVD.  I liked it a lot and am happy to have it.
B008AWBQGM|5.0|This CD rock's. Goes to show Rock N Roll never dies. This one is a keeper in my car's CD player. Thanks for being a living legend. Rock On!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great game.  Love the timed version. I really like the tiles. To me it is a very relaxing game. Love  any Mahjong game intend to get more!
B00821OX98|4.0|THIS SI A GREAT SHOW I'M A SI-FI NUT AND THIS ONE KEEPS YOU INTERESTED FROM START TO FINISH.  GOOD WORK
0425263924|5.0|I loved this book. I'm glad that this is not the end. I love these characters and am anxious to see what happens.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|Archer is a favorite author of mine.  Excellent reading, My other favorites are the three Clifton Chronicle series.  Archer weaves several story lines into each novel which makes for exciting reading.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I love being able to see the numbers in inputted as I go. Really helps to see if I missed an numbers when I double check my work.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|This movie is awesome! Great special effects! The story really keeps you interested. The plot is definitely good and enjoyable. I admit I am sad it is the end of the Twilight Saga but this film did not disappoint.
B00422LESE|4.0|It explains most of the known stuff with some amount of clarity, analogies and wry humour.  However, the m-theory is currently not explained well enough for me to understand it.  It takes &#34;time&#34; & many other dimensions to prove it right ;-)
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I've seen complaints about the lack of a 2D/3D combo and other such comments about the media under which this movie is offered.  My comment to that -- you sound as greedy to get more for less as Disney is to offer less for more!  Just live with it!<br /><br />I've also seen some complaints about character development.  It's basically a children's story and it is barely 2 hours long (without opening/closing credits).  Again - live with it.<br /><br />For the story itself.  I thought it was very good.  The points added to make the witch match the description and look we all know from the classic \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was very well done.<br /><br />It's cute and bright and colorful.  That's what you want from a Disney movie.  The story may not be the greatest but it has the typical definite good guys and bad guys with a Disney movie and works with the original movie very well.<br /><br />I enjoyed it completely.  I had not seen it and was unbiased.  I found the story cute and the changes in Oz touching.  I think it works very well as a prequel to the classic story.<br /><br />In general -- the movie was just fun to watch.  That's why I buy a movie.  To relax and enjoy myself - not look for errors and reasons to tear it down.<br /><br />I did have a few problems with the \\"digital copy\\".  Disney's code for Amazon Unbox did not show the whole code with Firefox and so failed.  I used IE to get the whole code.  Then, even though the Disney site told me that Unbox was ONLY the standard version, it tried to make me take the HD version and then wouldn't let me have that.  A few calls to Amazon's Unbox Customer Service and a bit of a wait resolved all issues and I do have my digital copy (that plays with Windows Media Player)
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I really liked all three of the fifty shades books the first time I read them but reading them a second time.... It's deffenetly not a repeat book. Good love story, though very unrealistic. But isn't that why ppl like books.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great little game that you can unfortunately spend hours playing. This  game  challenges your ability to remember where you last saw something and then have the hand eye coordination to get to it quickly. and remove it from the cube.  People who have short term memory problems could greatly benefit from this game or  similar games.
B004N622EY|3.0|I came upon Sanderson as the completer of the Wheel of Time.  He did an excellent job of completing Jordan's work. I found Final Empire to be an interesting concept (allomancy etc.).  The action sequences were good but the characterisations seemed a bit shallow.  However I will give the next one a go before a definite conclusion.
0670026603|5.0|Very heart warming, a story of a unique woman with a gift for bringing out the best in everyone she met.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|The acting was well done and as soon as I saw the heavy military aspect in the beginning I knew a lot of people wouldn't understand. Just like they didn't understand the acting in the Star Wars prequals and Prometheus. So let me clue you in. These people exist in a very different reality than you do and thier societies are just as foriegn. They are acting the way they were intended to act. That's the point of those kinds of sci-fi movies. Everything is different and if you had even a hint of imagination you would get that. Dont be insulted just think about watching another genre of movie because sci-fi may not be for you!<br /><br />Mr. Shyamlan follows a more direct format than in his previus outings and I enjoyed every minute of it! Will Smith plays a well known military commander who is \\"distant\\" from his son going any and everywhere the military sends him which is anywhere but home. His son is driven to attain his fathers status in spite of his fathers long absences. He also has issues with PTSD after watching his big sister die a brutal death at the hands of a bizzare creature. I dont remember the backstory on the monster. I'll have to watch again to see if it was there. When an accident goes down on the transport all of the sons' \\"issues\\" eventually come out loud and in your face. The commanders' face that is.<br /><br />Cant wait to add this flick to my collection...
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This is a great read, and a fun way to relearn all your history lessons from school days, each with a new slant!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|This was a great way to spend the day last winter when I was snowed in. I watch Castle everyday.
B0047T86G0|5.0|Yes it is a dictionary, but I needed one for a law essay i wrote earlier this year. Once I got used to the navigating format I was able to use the dictionary quite easily. I am happy I put in the money for it as I know I will be needing a quality dictionary for the next few years. I have had no issues since purchasing it and recommend the format as it does not physically take up the room a physical copy would.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was a great way to spend the day last winter when I was snowed in. I watch Castle everyday.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this game. it is great. giving a review can get more guns. good graphics. totaly worth buying. get it. trust me. worth one roller.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|it has a good story. the controls are a bit hard to figure out. it lags a bit and spider mans voice kinda sounds like a little kid. and just so you don't have too much troble you run in the direction you want and then hold the jump button.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This is a great CD I listen to it all the time from the first song to the last song.  Its not often that I like a every single song on a CD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love getting hold of books that get hold of you!  The whole Hunger Games trilogy does that.  It's the best book vacation I've had in a while.

034580404X|4.0|Was not what I was expecting.  Started slow and grew on me.  The Mystery was intriguing and kept me going.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This just goes to show what parents will do to protect their children.  Sometimes the rose-colored glasses need to come off to see the truth.  Sad story.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this book for my friends who are dog lovers.  They thought it was great.  They keep it as a coffee table book and show everyone who visits.  It is an interesting concept and quite entertaining.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am getting to the Downton party later than some, and I am enjoying every episode. It is a wonderful little treat for me to be able to pull out my wireless device and catch up when I have a free moment or after a long day. Every episode has a new twist or turn that keeps you coming back for more. Wonderful series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the books. I felt Katniss could of been developed better, and so could Gale in the last book. I felt Collins spent to much time trying with trying to be descriptive of the battle and the Capital and ended up with to repeating herself.<br /><br />The ending of the book felt rushed, and I felt could she could of expanded upon the outcome.
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva's voice is magical, ephemeral.  What a loss to the world that she is no longer on the Earth to produce more albums.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|It may not be just ike the book in a lot of ways but it is still a good movie.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|There are half songs on CD that are great.. think the best she has done. The lyrics are exceptional..love it..
0439023491|5.0|the book was in a very good condition. I enjoyed reading it, and  could not put it down until finished. Thank you.
B007V4530A|4.0|This is a concise and to the point reference for speakers and those wanting to learn to give a talk. I recommend it.
0439023513|5.0|This book came in without a cover,but was in a very good condition. I enjoyed reading it, and  could not put it down until finished. Thank you.
0670024813|4.0|JD is one of my favorites. Seen him lecture, gotten him to autograph his various books I own (Third Chimpanzee, Guns, Germs, Steel...) I love his work. Collapse was probably the best written (edited?). The World Until Yesterday is good but not my favorite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it done... read it in one afternoon. Very enjoyable. Great<br />I can't wait for the next one
1451695195|2.0|I picked this up at an airport, based on reading the epilogue.  That for me, was the best part of the book.  I found myself skipping pages here and there, once I started reading the whole book.  It is well written and no doubt a truthful account of one man's NDE.  His story also has some credibility based on the authors vast medical knowledge of the brain.  However, it pulls at the heart strings too much for my taste.  Recounting in detail how harrowing the experience was for his children and family.  Also, he talks alot about an underworld and darkness.  Personally,  I was hoping for a bit more heaven and bit less hell!  Anita Moorjani's Dying to be me is a much more uplifting NDE story.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I love Blake Shelton and have since his mullet days.  He is a GREAT artist, he has a smooth voice and seems like just an all around nice guy.  This album is awesome!  There's not a song on it that isn't GREAT!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|If you enjoy games like Puzzle Quest, Gyromancer, or Bookworm Adventures, you'll probably like this game. The interesting hook to this one is that it is also sort of a fast-run game, with your character quickly running through a dungeon and encountering enemies, chests and locked doors. You need to match  appropriate &quot;gems&quot; to attack or boost defense against enemies, and to unlock chests or doors. You also pick up items along the way to help. The RPG element really comes in as you gain experience, money, and resources to improve your character, equipment and the shops. I got this while it was the free app, but it is well worth paying for.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|As I think about how bad this movie was I ask myself, &#34;Why did you watch the whole thing, you fool?&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great puzzle, but not very long. There need to be more rooms. I think if it were a longer game, i would have given it 5 stars.
B005EGXTL2|1.0|It had a good ending but, it seemed quite rushed and hard to understand. It was just sentence by sentence by sentence. None of it made much sense.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Getting to the theatre an hour early, I was ready. Its too bad I had to wait an extra fifteen minutes for the midnight premier to start. So, being a little restless, I was disappointed when the movie started with no exciting opening credits.The film jumps right into the origin story and the visuals are arresting. As the movie progressed I felt it slipped into some overly long moments, moments that the audience is smart enough to figure out without a rehash. Once the major action scenes kick in, about an hour into the film, Superman is poised to tear up the place, and he does just that. Henry Cavill plays Superman with a ton of humility. But he's a humble guy that has been restraining the usage of his powers that once released brings out two Hulks in one. Most of the effects are great. Some are only good because I've seen the blotchy and bubbly silver stuff a hundred times over in Terminator 2.<br /><br />  Also needed and done to good effect are more than a few genuine moments of sentiment. Clark's childhood tells you why he is the man he is. All the big actors turn on their talents which definitely gives a credible gelling feel to it all. There are also some rightly timed chuckle inducing pieces of verbiage aimed at the name \\"Superman\\". Those moments are quickly and willingly sucked up due to the generally sullen nature of the characters.<br /><br />Lets talk FAORA (the incredible Antje Traue). She's a scene stealer, and can steal as many scenes as she wants as far as I'm concerned. Her presence pushed \\"Man Of Steel\\" into the statosphere. With her scary otherworldly vocals, unrestrained brutality and pure sex appeal, the sci fi lover gets a true villainess to be blown away by. I think she could hold a film of her own and would love to see her somehow brought back in future installments of the franchise. Her evil far exceeded Zods (Michael Shannon)with his slow-burn approach.<br /><br /> Amy Adams (Lois Lane) by contrast embodies the most accurate portrayal of a professional woman for a change. The action between Faora and Lane is tremendous and well thought out. Two females from different worlds colliding without all the beauty and affection type banter. I loved that angle. I feel this film was simply an \\"establish who Superman is\\" film, only waiting for the real everyday occurrences of Earth and a friendly alien, Kal El, to unfold. Toward the close as a lighter tone emerges, I saw exactly what was happening as the Daily Planet becomes a focal point. A nice transition and very welcomed after a mostly somber Clark/Superman did what he had to do. You will see a few easter eggs. It's a ride that takes you through a very interesting and introspective tale about the greatest superhero ever. Multiple viewings may be required and is recommended at least at this stage for full absorption.<br /><br />At my showing, the audience clapped. Should be a staggering blu ray disc.
B00197POXG|5.0|My wife and I watch this, pretty much every night. We are really are enjoying it. Thanks, Have a good day!!!
B008KP6ENE|2.0|This game is a good time killer. With a few upgrades it would be great. First, the controls. They are often unresponsive and jumpy. Next, and most important to me, there is no way to exit the game. Even pressing the back arrow on my kindle fire HD doesn't work.  In fact, the back arrow tries to take you to the start menu of the game. And recently, the button to pull up the back arrow and home button is missing. I had to restart my kindle to exit the game. If this is not fixed soon I will have to delete this game. There is no reason not to have a way to exit a game. With these upgrades I would be happy to give this game a couple of extra stars.
159463176X|5.0|Like Hosseini's first two novels (The Kite Runner; A Thousand Splendid Suns), And the Mountains Echoed delivers unmatched sensitivity, poignancy, and subtlety. Pari is the unifying thread connecting the many subplots flowing throughout this incredible book. Literally wrested from her older sibling's arms as a toddler and sold to a wealthy Kabul couple, she quickly forgets her early years with her father and brother and grows up in the lap of luxury. Eventually raised in Paris and given every material comfort by a beautiful and manipulative mother--and spared an almost certain, senseless death from the bitter-cold winter in her small Afghan village, Pari retains a gnawing, vague sense that she does not know who she is or her true place in the world. Through Pari, Hosseini poses the first of many unanswerable riddles: Which is more important to a happy and meaningful life--a stable upbringing free from want, or the irreplaceable love of one's biological family of origin?<br /><br />Fast-forward fifty years or so, and Hosseini hits us with another impossible moral dilemma: How do we help those facing incredible, tragic, and limitless need in far-flung places when we are so thoroughly mired in (and continually seduced by) our own \\"first-world\\" lives of luxury? Dr. Idris Bashiri (who as a child lived across the street from Pari's adoptive father in Kabul) returns to Afghanistan with his coarse but well-to-do cousin, Timur, to reclaim his father's property (lost during the Russian invasion). Idris is deeply moved when he meets a tragically disfigured young girl living in a Kabul hospital (Roshi was attacked by her axe-wielding madman of an uncle over a petty property dispute). While Idris badly yearns--and genuinely intends--to use his medical connections to help this girl, once he leaves Kabul and returns to his cushy California lifestyle, more pressing (if less important) concerns (a demanding work schedule, a home renovation project) gradually steal his focus: \\"Talking about Afghanistan--and he is astonished at how quickly and imperceptibly this has happened--suddenly feels like discussing a recently watched, emotionally drenching film whose effects are beginning to wane.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, cousin Timur (a bawdy, womanizing real estate investor who cheats on both his wife and his taxes) swoops in to play the hero and snatch the glory. Through these two opposing characters, Hosseini subtly and cleverly poses yet another vexing question: Which is the better man--the one who can easily and grandiosely throw money around to garner popularity and admiration (and as a secondary byproduct, help a few people out along the way)? Or the one whose authentic, feeling heart is in the right place, but who (like so many of us) is paralyzed by his own carefully-crafted, hard-won sense of wellbeing and cannot (or will not) follow through on his well-intentioned promises?<br /><br />As if this were not enough to ponder, And the Mountains Echoed poses yet another universal dilemma in its portrayal of Pari's conflicted relationship with Nila (her adoptive mother); Markos's relationship with his mother (Odelia); and the relationship between Pari's niece (and namesake) and her father, Abdullah (the original Pari's long-lost brother): How do we reconcile our wish to remain loyal to family with our instinctive need to pursue our own dreams and fulfill our destinies? Odelia makes an apt and wise observation about this most irksome of life's realities: \\"It's a funny thing, Markos, but people have it mostly backward. They think they live by what they want. But really what guides them is what they're afraid of. What they don't want.\\" Besides being a brilliant writer, Mr. Hosseini is--as all good writers must be--a keen observer of human nature.<br /><br />Several readers have complained that And the Mountains Echoed contains too many characters and confusing story lines, but Mr. Hosseini is an unimpeachable talent who has more than earned the right to experiment with characters and settings. And while his third novel can be a bit \\"tell-y\\" in places (Pari's abbreviated recounting of her married life and the raising of her children, for example; Mr. Markos's ruminations of his years in Tinos, Greece and his exodus to the far corners of the earth to escape his stifling young life), we should not punish Mr. Hosseini for having set the bar so high with his two prior books. Despite these minor flaws, Hosseini pulls this epic third novel off the ground and launches it through time and space with unequaled skill; his male characters in particular--Nabi (Pari's step-uncle), Suleiman Wahdati (her adoptive father), Saboor (her biological father), and Abdullah (her brother) are each nuanced, complex, and deserving of compassion. Yes, this is a big story, and Hosseini uses numerous interdependent characters and subplots to deal with such unpleasant topics as the far-reaching consequences of war, separation, and disfigurement. Along the way, he handles--with his trademark sensitivity and grace--the various sacrifices we humans sometimes make balancing survival against our principles and beliefs.<br /><br />But what really knocks this novel out of the ballpark is its ending. The scenes between Abdullah and his grown daughter (whom he named Pari after his missing sister)--and the powerful messages of hope and connection that the concluding scenes evoke--make this work deserving of five stars and render it a classic in its own right.xperiment with characters and settings.

B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Gangster Squad supposedly tells the story of a group of cops who became vigilantes and supposedly ended the reign of crime boss Mickey Cohen, portrayed by Sean Penn channeling Stallone as a tough guy. The thing is that there have been other films which also purport to be &#34;based on a true story&#34; which tell the history much differently. And i don't know which version of the story to believe. So take it for what it is, an action film with lots of gunfights and senseless violence, throwing around famous names willy nilly, worth one viewing on a rainy night with a bucket of popcorn.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show and recommend it to EVERYONE, except kids.  I've seen all the current seasons and can't wait for the newest one to start on F/X in September.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I couldn't get fifteen minutes into the movie. I would only watch this to the end if I was being paid about the same amount as it would cost for me to let you kick me in the scrotum. A lot
1575666286|5.0|I only wish we lived in a country where this book would be common knowledge and suffering from disease would be a thing of the past.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|too much detail and repetition.  I've read some of this author's books before and enjoyed them but this one is not one i would recommend to nyone
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A lovely picture into life back then in England. I love those English based flms and tv series.<br />Watch and see
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game for kids , adults , for any age person it fun something that u get bored and keeps you going back to play and a game you will love
B0094KTAEY|5.0|What can I say when a movie hits on all cylinders. Characters are clear and crisp. Dialogue is funny. Heck with it. Watch this movie. I don't care who you are, you will enjoy it on some level.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Could not put it down.  I felt that the way we went from one era to the next was great.
B0094K1P2Y|5.0|The movie moves from improbable situation to the sublime to the truly ridiculous seamlessly. The dialogue and characters are HILARIOUS. Be sure to pay attention to the &#34;movie trailers&#34; at the beginning as they are an integral part of the story.<br />I love this movie, but it can be a little weird. The characters are great caricatures of many of our modern day stars.<br />Try it, I think you will like it.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I picked up Jump Desktop as the free app of the day a while ago. What I found most amazing about this app is it supports Apple Remote Desktop authentication! Outside of Apple Remote Desktop itself, it's hard to find any software that can do an ARD login without installing any software on the remote server. Beyond that, the rest of this app seems pretty solid too. I probably won't use the tablet much to work on remote servers but it is useful to be able to log in now and then to check on something.
B00AHH0XOY|4.0|This movie is very good, but never gets over the hump into the excellent category. Funny in some parts and the totally shallow hero is very interestingly played by Brad Pitt. The main character, made evil by circumstances, is very engaging and the movie IS quite entertaining. I recommend this movie if you don't have something you are pining to watch. It is very good
B004SRWW0C|3.0|I got this app over a year ago during an app sale. It's good as a general-purpose file manager and is also useful if you have rooted your device. However, for me, it has long since been superseded by ES File Explorer, which also has features for rooted devices. Has Root Explorer been updated to keep up with the competition? I would not know because Amazon hasn't published an update since this app was introduced in Amazon App Store in March 2011! So I can't really give it too many stars and I would suggest checking it out on Google Play Store instead.
B00AALUFFY|5.0|This movie is a must for any and all animated film buffs. Even folks who do not love animated films will enjoy this little trip to China and the world of Kung Fu.. Told through the hilarious antics and adventures of Po, the kung fu loving panda, that fate has tapped to save ALL of China for the forces of EVIL.. Truly, great fun, lots of &#34;belly laughs&#34; and a very good story.<br />Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I picked up Genius Scan as the free app of the day a while ago. My usual Android scanner utility is MDScan and I'm afraid Genius Scan does not compare favorably. Genius Scan is a lot slower and failed to recognize the corners of the sheet of paper, selecting the entire image instead. I hope the developers will continue working on the app to bring it up to par.
B00A7I6MCU|5.0|This remake of the 30's classic is excellent. Animation and action is high power and constant. The characters and some of the new twists actually add to the story of our beloved and misunderstood Kong, who is only searching for his true love. This movie is a million times better than the huge and ostentatious remake in the late seventies. Highly recommend this movies.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I'd been using Office Calculator Free for a while, so I was happy to be able to upgrade to Office Calculator Pro when it was free app of the day.<br /><br />This is really just a basic arithmetic calculator. Functionality is quite limited. However, calculator apps that are more advanced usually lack this calculator's virtual tape and that is why I continue to use this one. The virtual tape is handier than one might think at first. I sometimes make typos when entering numbers and so it's good to be able to see what I've done. This app also makes good use of landscape mode on a tablet by putting the tape on one side and keypad on the other. And finally, being able to edit values by long-pressing them in the tape is pretty nifty and something I don't see implemented everywhere.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|It is an eerie read regardless of the author's medical knowlege.  Biblically speaking, it omits the fact that we need a personal relationship with Jesus Christ in order to partake of the wonders of heaven, which take place after death, and not during our lifetime.<br />I do not recommend this book, but would refer to the reading of the last book in the Bible, the book of Revelation.
1939416019|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series, from beginning to end. I've heard some people say that the plot wasn't intricate or thick enough, but I found that it was a very enjoyable light and easy fast-paced adventurous read. I loved the characters, and the story really came to life. 5 stars!
1936608898|5.0|This book explains everything about food.. so you can stop relying on marketing.  It gives you the science, the tips, the shopping list, the recipes... everything.. is like a food bible to me!  LOVE IT!!!
B008M4MB8K|5.0|The result of Fritz Langs classic Metropolis. A perfectly crafted story of the dark part of the future. Beautifully done by Ridley Scott.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very addictive i stayed up all night playing it..............some of the levels can be very hard but i guarantee if you stick with it you will get it....
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I got it for free as the app of the day, but would have gladly paid for it. Much more accurate look at battery life on my Kindle Fire that lets me ration my battery usage on trips and the commute.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Funny, quirky, Teen Monsters doing their thing.  If you like Coraline, you'll like this one.  And for the price it's worth buying. Great for summer fun entertainment.<br /><br />JRM
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|This album is fantastic. All of the songs are great and if you are a fan of the show, you should definitely buy this.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer is a great story teller who grabs his reader from first to last page. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a very long time.  Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good read.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|You can never go wrong with the Bubel! Excellent cd, every song a gem. I can hardly wait for his next c.d.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love having Facebook on my Kindle ,so handy to use and great for catching up with others. Facebook Rocks
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i love this app its great .its fun and creative and you can do llmost anything with you photos you should get it
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I must get too much sex because book 1 and 2 are yet to get me hot and bothered and the relationship is a little sappy, oh well Ill finish the series and be happy that my husband makes me hotter than  book 1 and 2.
B001EJIMUG|4.0|Well-acted rendition of Jane Austen's novel. Nice movie to watch on a rainy night. Just goes to show that true love conquers all.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is a beautiful story and helped me to see my path more clearly!  I could not put it down!
B008Y79IUE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. It's unforgettable and amazing; hectic and just...yeah!  Everyone should watch this movie at least one time. One of my top 10.
B00D78J7SI|5.0|Since I was in the 6th grade I was strictly Metallica/MegaDeth fan, But in 2008 at the Gigantour I was hooked Children of Bodom is Awesome and they come out with better and better music. Oh yeah and Alexi Laiho is #1 Again Nice work guys keep rockin it.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|In a year of exceptional movies, &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; makes the rest of the field seem stale and pedestrian. Groundbreaking.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed this book so so much.  It reiterated my own beliefs.  It was very inspiring to read about a doctor/scientist that had such a great experience and had his faith come in to light.  He did a great job telling his story of believing but at the same time questioning all of it because of science.  He did a great job bringing the story full circle.  I had just finished reading &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; before reading this book.  I truly enjoyed reading this book.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|This album epitomizes everything great about the Boards of Canada; the sonic textures, synthesized nostalgia, and apocalyptic theme are prime examples of went they're still amazing.
B00479SVBU|2.0|not practical when you are driving and trying to figure it how it works. then that means that you have to stop or pull aside to work with it. I like the simple cheaper version much better. also it does not work with my samsung galaxy 2, or my old ipod or usb flash.
B002VX0A40|5.0|My 5 month old daughter loves this dragon.  She loves the textues and the crinkel noises the wings make. The tail is really easy for her to grab.
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Very unhappy,video keeps freezing,then goes back to beginning and<br />then repeats the cycle. Once I am able to view movie, I will give better answer<br />.
1781162646|5.0|This might just be my favorite thing King has written, certainly in the top five. Having read a good chunk of King's body of work, I can honestly say that this story has moved me like no other. There are so many things to love. For starters, the writing is incredible. Not a single word wasted, the sentences that King creates are works of art in themselves. Also, do not be fooled by the page count; this book has more depth than most twice its size. There is a story within the story, and even more stories within that one. As with most of King's work, the characters are more like people you know, and it's hard not to get emotionally invested in them. \\"Joyland\\" is a story of love, loss, and self-discovery. You might just discover something about yourself, too, while reading it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's not just about zombies attacking...it's about the psychological,sociological,political fall out that happens from a world wide zombie apocalypse. Read this now!
B005HSL626|5.0|You can get your flustrations and stress of the day out by trying to slice the fruit but being careful not to slice the bomb. My grandchildren and my grown children actually like this game.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|Watched this AFTER watching FF6.  Liked the tie in.  But would have liked to have seen a lot more of racing and the whole Tokyo &#34;scene&#34; around drift racing.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I FELT REALLY CONNECTED, AMAZING ROLLERCOASTER OF LOVE! COULDN'T STOP READING ALONG WITH THE 1ST BOOK! CANT WAIT TILL THE FINALE IS REVEALED.
B0083GOVLW|4.0|Good movie didn't care for black snd white throughout movie. Watched for English class; liked that the main character is a teenager to young lady.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very addicting app. When I first downloaded it, it was day. When I finally put it down it was night. I highly suggest downloading it. It is very fun.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Well at first i wasn´t sure about this album but you really have to listen the album a lot of times to like it<br />it´s really strange it´s like you can´t take it off o and that guitar sound is really something.So people stop complaining an listen<br />to the album many times and you will be rewarded.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great  and fun but how do you update this game or any game on a Kindle fire
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A great app.  Wakes me up on time. Several choices for alarm sounds. Multiple alarms are also programmable to wake up to.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I had a bit of difficulty in understanding why the tangential stories received so much attention.  At first they seemed to take me away from the thread of the story.  But in the end I must say that he did develop the characters and the back stories in a way that leant support to the main thread.  This book is more like a collection of short stories attached to a thread held by Pari and Abdollah.  Each story is interesting in its own right.  The collection of them speaks to the varied connections that make up our lives.  Great book!
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|Another world entirely, the author bought you there so well.  A real page turner near the end, with some twists I didn't see coming.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this movie! This movie blew me away in SO many ways. First of all, the acting was the best I have seen in a LONG time! I was surprised that Bradley didn't win more awards and I was SO happy that Jennifer won the Oscar. I could go on and on and on about this film. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone and everyone!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Love it! Love it!  They have out done their selves, I love every song on this album. Afraid I will wear it out.  LOL
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie so much. I listen to the music in my car all the time and I sing the music in the shower :) It made me laugh and just feel so good! It's a feel good, wonderful movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this season as much as the past seasons. Got tired of waiting to watch it on netflix and bought the season instead. Was worth every penny.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery writing and this is probably her best novel.  It is a classic story!
B006JRY0Q8|5.0|This show is very addicting and I never want to stop once I start. Defintely my favorite show now. It is so wonderful being able to watch the episodes witout commercials and being able to watch them back to back without having to wait a week until the next episode. RECOMMENDED!!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love to play this game it is very addictive and fun, it just doesn't last long enough. The timer in the game goes to fast, there for you want to play another game really quick witch makes you go through your lives very fast. And there is no relaxed time. For a free game I give 4 stars because it is a lot of fun,and I do play it every day.  It just really leaves me anyways wanting when all my time and life's run out and I'm NOT paying to waist money to lose my life's just as fast again. Over all though, I WOULD GET IT AGAIN, IT ROCKS AND I DO, PLAY IT EVERY DAY.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|I wasn't that excited before watching this show but once I started I could not stop. I watched all of season 1 and half of season 2 in one day (staying up until 4am the next day). This show is very addicting and I never want to stop once I start. It is so wonderful being able to watch the episodes witout commercials and being able to watch them back to back without having to wait a week until the next episode. RECOMMENDED!!
B003XYE7R2|5.0|Excellent book. Very well written and exciting. I love reading Sherlock Holmes. Some of the best literature I have read.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Ahead of her time, with respect for women, everyone should read this great novel, which at the very least is a story of great love.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I watched this by myself on a quiet Friday night, and had the following thoughts:<br /><br />\\"Wow, this isn't really any fun past the first act.\\"<br /><br />\\"It takes a minor plot and turns it into an entire movie--the return of the dwarves to their homeland is almost a footnote, and perhaps Tolkien meant it to be that way.\\"<br /><br />\\"Incoherent, but beautiful.  Very pretty.\\"<br /><br />and last, but not least,<br /><br />\\"Peter Jackson is not Tolkien\\"<br /><br />It's like Jackson tried to re-write \\"The Hobbit\\".<br /><br />Worth watching if you're a Tolkien completist.  It's also visually incredible.  It's just not much fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. I love it. Very realistic and fun I feel like this a real game. Like having a real horse
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This series is so much fun, it transports you to another time with it's close attention to detail from costumes to furnishings
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a kindle and my entire family has kindles under me. This just helps me carry my books with me even more when I want to have my Android Touch pad instead of my Kindle with me. Very easy to navigate.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I truly  enjoyed reading about this boy.  I do valued our freedom very much.  I hope that we will always be a free thinking nation.  I am afraid with this president who wants to take so many of our founding fathers'rights away.
0060527986|5.0|it changed my life, really, there are no other words to describe what it meant for me. I keep it right beside my bed
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very fun game and u get to play different games on one app.it does not lag or freeze.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|I didn't try using it to play music from a USB drive.  I used just to update the firmware on my MDI and for that it worked perfectly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. the update is awesome u get to spawn chicken cows sheep and pigs.  u get cake and buckets lava and water bye love this game ir u well die jk
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|good game but don't like that once I logged into face book I got stuck in there also wish I ciuldngo in as more than 1 profile since my little boy spent all of my jewels or whatever they are called
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love this game. But it has come to my attention that others who play on their phones have a power up option that I don't. The  &quot;super cube&quot; is what i think it was named. I have looked for updates but I don't think there is one for the kindle fire hd. I am kind of upset.
1936608898|5.0|I love this book so far. I understand that people have problems with the way the material is presented, but it makes it easy for anyone to understand. I'll edit my review when I'm finished!
0896762173|2.0|Not much to go by.  I do hope to try and see if I could go through it again so that I can be convinced of its information.  As at now, I am not quite in there!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I never saw this movie until I saw it on here and thought what the heck. So I bought it on bluray and I got to say very impressed with the picture quality, sound, and delivery time. Great Job amazon!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The movie was okay, the acting was so so but the books were way better. I know it's the movie version of a book but I was just so disappointed at all the stuff they changed. BUY THE BOOKS!!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Once again the master at work creating a piece of a world we never see, or hope to never see
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Great depiction of Oz and its characters. Great acting, effects, and storyline.  I would definitely recommend for adults and children.
B002V092M4|5.0|The master at his craft, no pens firing bullets no fast cars no buffed heroes, just the dirty slightly frayed at the edges world of espionage
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is awesome you get to infect the world even though the goal is creepy<br />Definitely worth the 99 cents ! ! !
B005I4JG80|5.0|Loved this book! It certainly was helpful as a new parent to learn about other parenting styles. I found after finishing the book it was very simple to apply what I had learned to our child's routines. I was also pleased that I naturally had been parenting in much of the same manner.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Definitely makes the mind work but was a pretty short game.  I think the puzzles should be more difficult as the game progresses but I will be buying the next chapter when it comes out! Not bad for the price! Totally reminds me of Myst.
B007NVIB5U|4.0|I watched the American version.  Loved it so thought I would watch the original British version.  The acting is good and the dialogue is funny.  It deals with a touchy subject in an entertaining way.
B00D3V5V7U|3.0|I am a die hard Black Sabbath fan. Then I bought and listened to the album I almost did die. I was very disappointed. I hope the next album will be better
B003ODIZL6|5.0|When I found this I thought it was great. I love how you can go right to it when your reading. I gave it 5 stars because it is really easy to use and understand. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially if your a reader.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Literally sat down and watched the entire season in two days. Its so addictive and the ending is crazy! I hope they never cancel this series...
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Fun and entertaining to watch. Good writers and a some funny one liners. Good chemistry between the cast, can watch over and over again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Literally sat down and watched this season in two days. Its so interesting to see how things probably were during that time in history from two different points of view. Would definitely recommend!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin IS BACK&#62;&#62;&#62; to all fans this is a must!!!!! every song is great,,you can tell alot of time and work went into this
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The songs from the movie are catchy as I enjoy acapella music. The dry humor in this film was perfect for me! I could watch this movie over and over!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|been a fan of hers for years...this cd covers all the songs I loved and then some  she has a great voice..
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next book. I would love to see it in to a movie.
B0083Z614S|4.0|As a free book, it's well worth reading if someone is not looking for something complex, romantic, historical etc.<br /> An easy-read story for  children and adults.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|The music puts one back into the movie. Makes for good memories. Represents the atmosphere of the movie despite its modern musical version.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|I really liked this movie. The actors were good and the story kept you guessing and really delivered a surprise ending.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is perfect for anyone who likes to know how much time is left on the battery when it's going dead (like me). I have kindle fire hd, and the app has not had a noticeable effect on my battery life (like some of the other reviews complain about). The best feature is the tests you can run on your device to personalize how much time is really left for whatever your doing. This seems like a paid app feature, but it's available on the free version. Definitely worth trying for yourself.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|I think it was overall, a really good wrap up to a different view of an American Icon. It was never supposed to be about Superman...but instead,  Clark Kent's life, as an average American teenager, who just happens to be fated to become the greatest superhero ever...he has to cope with things ever teenager has to face..being accepted, finding his place in the world, unrequited love...heart break..personal responsibility...as well as being a demi god among men. Having so of the stars involved with previous visions of The Man of Steel, added a nice blending of several of the Superman legend....The people portraying the characters...those we know, and the new comers, such as Allison Mack's &#34;Chloe Sullivan&#34; did an incredible job, in my opinion. Having Christopher Reeve (God rest his soul) doing a recurring role up until his unfortunate passing was a major feather in the cap of everyone involved in the production...not to mention Terrance Stamp, who went from being Krypton's greatest villain, to the voice of Jor-el...and so many others...<br />A series I watch again and again...
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Love this movie, like Valentine's Day, I like movies that have several groups of people going at once and somehow at the end they all are intertwined! One I can watch over and over again!
B009EHDU7U|2.0|Decided to give up on this one . .would be a good read for some but just didn't grab me. Usually I struggle through and finish but I got about s quarter of the way through and decided my time was better spent elsewhere
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Always loved the band Garbage! This is a great CD! Covers all their good music! Would definately recommend, especially to those Garbage fans!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What the headline says... I loved this season, the show is beautifully produced. The only thing I can say about it negatively is that I want more!!
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Great title for this Ritenour work. Lee really cooks up a storm with the help of some fantastic sidemen and is welcome change from some of his other CD's. Lots of talent and lots of Rhythm here...
B005BCE7II|5.0|The children purchased this for the Grandchildren as they did with the rest of the franchise . After the first I just thought they cute but did not hit me the same. Well now we also have Great Grandchildren so we purchased the 3-D versions available . Different experience entirely , me and our cats were really drawn into the show. We watched The Life of pI the night before which they pretty much lost interest in after the opening nature scenes but we were transfixed during this entire film.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I started this book with great anticipation but must admit that around Chapters 3 and 4, I was thinking that I would put it down and not finish.  Toward the end of Chapter 4 and into Chapter 5, the stories got better and I found myself thinking that maybe this wasn't such a bad book after after all.  By the time I was reading the 7th and 8th Chapters, I was wishing that the book would never end.  I only give books that I honestly believe have earned it a 5 Star Rating and in spite of my not liking the stories of Chapters 4 and 5, they were very important to the book as a whole, so I have given Mr. Hosseini's 3rd Book a 5 Star Rating, as I did with his other two.  He has a way of writing that captures the true spirit of the person telling the tale, so much so that it almost seems like an actual person talking, not simply a character in a book.  I would be happy to recommend this to anyone and to remind them that while they might not like all the chapters, they will love the whole.  Pick it up, read it from start to finish, and you'll be happy you did.
B009R659L8|4.0|This novel was a quick read and a lot of fun. Mary Higgins Clark always does a great job of creating mysteries that draws the reader in immediately. The only criticism I have of this book is that it is wrapped up a little too neatly at the end. However it is overall great fun and an ideal beach or vacation book.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|My kids found out about this show from a friend and they like the Sci-Fi action and fantasy.  My kids are tween-teenagers.  It may be scary for younger kids.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it only messes up if you have a lot going on at one tme!! i recommend this to people who just want to play the game
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Emotion and thought provoking inspirational images. Calming and stirring all at the same time. The earth and it's people are a phenomenon.
B005544V6A|5.0|Loved the series and wish it would return.  I stream many videos and it is so easy and I love the choices.<br />Thank you Amazon
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|If you loved Baraka, buy this one too! Ron Fricke always makes visually stunning films. I love having it play in the background if I'm studying.
030758836X|3.0|A very short review, I loved this book...up until the ending. Everything about this book up until the end is just amazing! I found myself hating a character only to later on feel bad for them,then eventually rooting for them. This book had amazing twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed this book leading up to the end and could not put it down. And then it just ended, it was extremely unsatisfying but I would still recommend it. Someone has to like that ending, I'm just not that someone.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The new Black Sabbath album, 13, shows that the boys still do this kind of thing better than any of their imitators and disciples ever did.<br /><br />Surprisingly (well, maybe not), Tony Iommi's low-slung riffs and tasty power chords are the highlight of the CD, since Ozzy can't quite wail in the upper registers the way he used to... which, by the way, is not to say he doesn't deliver a performance worthy of his diva status in this category.<br /><br />The band has commendably avoided dressing up the brand in unnecessary frills and embellishments, delivering a stripped-down retro machine that crushes anything that smacks of hair bands or other forms of metal modernism in its path.<br /><br />Coming from the generation that originally launched the band (I was an awestruck 14 when their first album was released) , I should note the music is a medically significant  \\"man therapy\\" product, since it definitely gets hormones more commonly found in 14-year olds flowing again, and causes involuntary air-guitar spasms, which we all know have proven exercise value.<br /><br />Well worth the fun.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app is pretty good for quickly checking the forecast but it crashes often if you use it for any length of time. You can only watch a couple of videos before it crashes or becomes unresponsive. I only use it on rare occasions because of this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Character study, costuming, and performances are so well done in this series! Wish season 3 were available to Prime Customers!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I love this movie. There are so many scenes that remind me of when my relatives use to visit when I was a kid. The hillbilly relatives, the snooty inlaws, the uninvited guest pets, and most of all, the bickering. This movie is a little to the extreme but not by much. This is what Christmas means to me. It's too bad they don't make more movies like this. It'll always be a favorite in my collection.

B002RXHW6S|1.0|I got this for my little boys 3rd birthday party and it was awesome at first. He loved it for a couple of weeks.Then he walks into the room and saw it was flat. The seams came apart. He probably played in it 8 times. He was devastated. I was disgusted. Not worth the money or my childs disappointment.DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE TO THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|So far so good. I like the auto start option and I the option to turn on the screen and change the color and brightness

B00D2K40WY|4.0|I really like this game. It's nice how they combined a spa, makeup, and dress game into one game. And even though quite a few things are locked, I still have a lot ot fun without them. I definitely recommend this game to girly girls who like salon games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Almost every thing in that game u need and some u even have to put together and memorize very good game and not bad graphics it's actually pretty good but they should add more like every week or so
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|you know that kind of reaction that's a blend of sorrow AND joy? this evokes it for me. I doubt if there is a single emotion this musical did not arouse, through the story, the wonderful music, the great acting, the costuming - everything! from the very beginning this film transported the watcher to paris and immersed him in the suffering and sorrows, but also the joys of love and the laughter of the barroom carousing (and brazen theft). through all of it the steadfast love of freedom of the rebels shines clearly.<br />it takes a few minutes after the film ends to come back to the here and now - and to me that is the sign of a great film. that &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34; that can make a fictional world so very real is alive and well and living in this film! watch it or you will regret it for the rest of your life.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A long read but very enjoyable. It is interesting how it all intertwines from section to section and year by year as the tale unfolds. Some sections are tedious but do add to the whole. It really shows how men can be so hurtful to other men.

B00BQI4AU6|3.0|I'm a huge Cinderella fan, and was anticipating the release of this material.  If you're hoping for a return to the sound we heard from Cinderella, you will be disappointed.  There are a few tracks that are great, but overall, this release does not portray a &#34;hungry&#34; artist, which is too bad, because Keifer can deliver the goods when he is on.  Still a great live show....
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Once again, Alice Munro is painfully honest with her short stories.  Not for anyone who wants a happy ending , but for those who want beautifully crafted stories of seemingly real life.  It's also always great to read about another country (Canada) and a different time  (mainly before and right after World War II). Also, Ms Munro gives a some glimpses into herself  and her childhood in the last 4 stories which was a real plus.
0812983459|4.0|Harold 's pilgrimage was one of getting away as much as going to. He and his wife are intereting characters. The suscincct description of the countryside lets one appreciate the trave through England yet does not bog down the story. By the end of the book you understand how the pieces fit. Is it likely that one would set off to mail at letter and decide to walk 700 miles to deliver the message. It is a story about separating and discovering what has been missed and then having the opportunity to fix it in the future. It is a hopeful book.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|Keeps focused on what's important and what the participants were thinking.  It integrates interesting tidbits from many sources.  Also, it includes more of what happened in parts of the world that traditional U.S. histories are blind to.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I just can't put my finger on why I was less than thrilled by this book. The premise was good, the characters were well drawn, perhaps it was the pacing - I found it difficult to get into the story, my ease of immersion was low. I read this one over several weeks instead of days, and really struggled to finish. I must say that the finish was satisfying and I don't regret hanging in for the ending.<br />Every once in awhile I fail to connect with a writer, and i think this was just one of those times.<br />I rated the book 3 stars because it wasn't a bad book, just not my cup of tea this time.<br />*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.
B0042KA5EK|5.0|Great acting, fast moving, wonderful character development, feels relevant to the turbulent times we live in, one episodes flows in the next seamlessly, hard to stop watching
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I dearly love this app!! Before I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire HD, I was constantly wondering how much battery power I had left since the lil battery icon wasn't always in view when I was playing/using certain apps, which would cause me to exit the app sooner than I wanted to, find out that I only had 5-15% of my battery left at a crucial point, or I'd end up going dead all together! Now, I am ALWAYS on top of my battery because of all the different ways u can set the app to inform u of your battery level! My favorite part is the fact that I can set it to verbally tell me how full/low my battery is, whether it's charging or in use, at my predetermined levels (example..when my Kindle is charging I can set it to announce when the battery is 5% - 100% full, or when it's in use that the battery is 5% - 99% low). Of course, there's a lot more you can do with the app & I would recommend it to everyone!!

B000002IRL|5.0|Metal fans were understandably a bit worried when Overkill's founding guitarist/major songwriter Bobby Gustafson left the fold in 1990. But these worries soon proved to be all for not, as the New Jersey-based thrashers weathered the storm by expanding to a two-guitar line-up (thus helping to beef up and brutalize their sound even more). And soon thereafter, they then kicked out album number five, 1991's \\"Horrorscope,\\" which was (at the time) quite possibly the best and most influential effort of their studded career, and remains so even to this day.<br /><br />Opener \\"Coma\\" gets underway with a dreamy acoustic intro before becoming a no-holds-barred ripper of a song with fiery thrash picking, thudding double bass drumming, rhythmically chugging rhythms, and four -- count `em, four! -- fiery yet kind of melodic solos. Next comes the Kreator-meets-Anthrax-esque assault of \\"Infectious,\\" which is another track where deft drum fills, fiery, crunching speedster riffs, and shredding soloing tear throughout. And \\"Blood Money\\" continues in this same blood-pumping, pure thrash vein, with abrasive buzzsaw riffing, soaring, Judas Priest-y choruses, and a noteworthy little bass interlude.<br /><br />But as good as the riffs might be, it is solos that are the name of the game on the fourth track, \\"Thanx For Nothin'.\\" It features solos of all kinds, including a fast introductory drum solo, a fairly long and technical bass solo, and some shredding (yet still ripping) guitar solos. Next up, a well-placed, cool-sounding piano intro breaks up the album's monotony in \\"Bar Bones.\\" But fear not, the song soon slams into being another really chunky and bullying riff-fest complete with a winding, screaming guitar solo and forceful double bass'ing. \\"Horrorscope\\"'s title song also does a pretty good job at breaking up the monotony, as it is an ominous, brooding mid-tempo chugger.<br /><br />Moving along, \\"New Machine\\" continues in this same relatively mid-tempo pace. But this song is noteworthy for being highlighted by some Metallica-esque chugging riffs, and really catchy choruses that will get seared into your old memory bank after giving them only one listen. But the subsequent \\"Frankenstein\\" (which is a completely instrumental piece) rivals this song in terms of catchiness, as it is a really infectious number with rhythmic, toe-tappable hooks. And it is all topped off by melodic, wah-pedal-drenched guitar leads and memorable, whammy bar-inflected solos. And, finally, the record concludes with \\"Live Young,\\" \\"Die Free,\\" and \\"Soulitude,\\" three more blistering and in-your-face riff-fests which combine together to form one fairly epic finale to an already very fine album.<br /><br />Blistering, powerful, impeccably well-played, and extremely solid/consistent (as there is not a single stinker to be found, here), \\"Horrorscope\\" provides one heckuva very enjoyable, thrilling, and certainly satisfying thrill-ride of a listen for all heavy music fans. Even though it is twenty-some years old (as it was originally released in 1991), it is, again, Overkill's finest hour to date, and also easily one of finest pure thrash metal releases of the decade.thy for being highlighted by some Metallica-esque chugging riffs, and really catchy choruses that will get seared into your old memory bank after giving them only one listen.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|The twelfth studio album from California-bred thrash natives Megadeth is the first one to debut co-lead and rhythm guitarist Chris Broderick (who is of Nevermore and Jag Panzer fame). That may or may not come into the equation, here, but the fact of the matter is that 2009's \\"Endgame\\" is a heavier, faster, and livelier effort than 2007's \\"United Abominations.\\" It is also the finest piece of work that 'Deth frontman Dave Mustaine has attached his name to in the new millennium (and yes, that includes \\"The System Has Failed,\\" because this is definitely catchier than that 2004 release.) And it is also one of the band's finest hours this side of their career-defining 1990 masterpiece, \\"Rust In Peace.\\"<br /><br />\\"Endgame\\" is, like most of Megadeth's more recent works, a peeved-off, politically-charged affair. It takes shots at Wall Street, George W. Bush, war, the sad state of the current economy, and the police (among other things). But this fact is almost overshadowed by the musical prowess present throughout this record's forty-five minute playing  time. It is a lively thrash/speed metal album that pounds and thrashes intelligently and intensely, with inventive razorwire riffing and guitar solos that are, quite simply, ones for the ages. (Some of the best solos that Mustaine has ever wriiten abound, here.)<br /><br />\\"Endgame\\" begins on a startlingly heavy note, with \\"Dialetic Chaos\\" beginning with a booming, towering opening riff before gradually picking up speed and momentum by adopting melodic leads, deft, fast drumming, and numerous blazing, mazy solos that give the opener an undeniably epic feel, even if the whole thing only clocks in at less than two and a half minutes. This then slams into \\"This Day We Fight,\\" which, with its inventive, bullying, rip-roaring thrash riffage, and Dave's patentedly angry, phlegm-throated vocal snarl, makes for one fairly brutal speedster. And a bunch of fiery, screaming solos top it all off (there are too many of them to count, but they are all really quite excellent!) \\"44 Minutes\\" is another standout, as it opens with a familiar-sounding clip of a 911 call, before segueing into ominous, meaty, darkly-grumbling bass lines and crunching rhythms. The song's main highlight, however, is its epic soloing, as it finds Mustaine and Broderick trading off one ripping melodic solo after another. \\"1,320'\\" continues in a similar fashion, beginning with a sample (this one is of a motor gunning) before, fittingly, taking flight and flowing into catchy, galloping guitar licks, deft drum fills, and a lengthy (and very emphatic) soloing section.<br /><br />This is then followed-up by a monotony breaker in \\"Bite The Hand,\\" which begins with an ominously heavy and doomy-sounding guitar and bass intro. The song soon evolves into usual thrashy territory, though, with chugging, reverberating, lock-step-unison riffing and equally as hooky (galloping) beats. And a lengthy and wailing guitar solo brightens up the arrangements  a tad bit, though, \\"Hand\\" is also of note from a lyrical standpoint, as it deals with such topics as suicide and the U.S.A.'s economy. (Some sample lines include \\"worldwide suicide for the economy\\" and \\"Wall Street took 'We The People' for a ride.\\") And the song concludes with another deliciously epic solo that sounds dare I say almost like a homage/final goodbye to Pantera (and \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell). Next up, \\"Bodies\\" is driven by prominently strong, grumbling bass lines, and more hooky, galloping rhythms, chugging guitars, and catchy vocal patterns. It all makes for a somewhat mid-tempo (or, if nothing else, at least in-control) speed/traditional metal song, and a heavily groove-oriented one at that. And sure, it might be a bit predictable in the sense that it has more clean solo flights, but it also features some really fast and blistering shred solos, as well. The epic \\"Endgame\\" (the song) furthers this \\"faster than most but mid-tempo by old-school thrash standards\\" approach, as it is an aggressive yet simultaneously kind of restrained modern thrasher with fiery, crunching guitar hooks, and ripping, screaming solos. But the track's main attraction has got to be its choruses, which are so good, potent, and catchy that they nearly rival anything  heard on Deth's aforementioned 1990 opus, \\"Rust In Peace.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go...Sealed With A Kiss\\" is first-and-foremost a minor-key piece comprised of a nice (and very colorful) acoustic melody, some atmospheric backing sound effects, and Dave's decent crooning voice. It does make room for some metallic crunch (thus establishing an excellent contrast between it and its surroundings), but for the most part, this is a piece of full-on power balladry. But immediately following it comes \\"Head Crusher,\\" which greets the listener like a brick wall. Indeed, this is one uncompromising, and all-out brutal and breakneck thrash blitzkrieg that rivals the kind of stuff put out by, say, Slayer. But back on the slower side of the line, the next song, \\"How The Story Ends,\\" is a decent, groovy, and industrial-strength chugger. (Although, granted, aside from featuring some brisk double bass drumming, it does not present anything new into the equation.) And neither does the subsequent album closer, \\"The Right To Go Insane,\\" for that matter. But this song is much better and harder rocking than its predecessor, as it is a heavy and  propulsive thrasher with plenty of solid riffing and catchy, addicting choruses. (And yes, it also tacks on another batch of stellar guitar soloing, natch.)<br /><br />\\"Endgame\\" cements Megadeth's status as one of the best and most consistent thrash bands of their generation (the Eighties). And it is further proof of the fact that although they never made it as big as Metallica, Slayer, or even Anthrax, they are definitely capable of playing right there alongside anybody else in the \\"Big Four.\\" It is a relevant,thrilling, and front-to-back very good (and often bordering on great) album that should satisfy just about all thrash/speed metallists the world over.essive yet simultaneously kind of restrained modern thrasher with fiery, crunching guitar hooks, and ripping, screaming solos.

B00AIBZM40|4.0|Very glad I made the decision to buy this and sit through it again because the first time I watched it, I completely missed the point. I was disappointed with what I felt was a lackluster nonsensical ending after a pretty good ride. On second watching i realized that 4 little words at the start of the film make the ending work.<br /><br />It has it's weak points yes but the kids are awesome and carry the film right to the end it definitely had me thinking about what's under the bed for the first time since I was 10.<br /><br />Great flick. Turn the lights out and the volume up. Oh... and watch it with someone ; )
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is pretty fun. But when you start to get a lot of coins in that round it starts to go uncontrollably fast. And it sometimes crashes for no reason. Otherwise I love this app. It is so addicting!:) I really am into it no matter what. It is really handy how this game helps you along with instructions right on the screen as you play for the first time. I got this game for free and you can earn pretty much everything for free. You should definitely consider getting this game!!:)

B00705GEO4|5.0|I've listened to Sabaton for over a year now, and Carolus Rex has not failed to impress. As Sabaton's only album that entirely compasses a particular event (except for one cover), in this case the 30 year war, it is a work of absolute musical genius yet also, dare I say it, educational. I have learned more spending an hour with this band than a few weeks in History class.<br /><br />5/5, cannot go wrong with Carolus Rex. It was chosen by Heaven.
B002UZCJP2|4.0|Very good movie. Good acting and a very different plot. It is a good reason not to try this with real people.
B00C7607FS|4.0|To all who collect movies like this then you will be pleased to know that it is coming out October 10th of this year,<br />So now it is on Blue ray and that is cool.<br />I wish some of the other Disney movies were not so expensive and even harder to find now they are on blue ray but no longer at any store.<br />Well good luck and a cool movie
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is a great piece of art work. Nice blend of Cornel's vocals with the grunge power and the Rage boys throwing down on the instruments with awesomeness.
B001ILFUDM|4.0|Well to me this is another great movie, The price for it is way out of this World really come on, now over $90 to get this blue ray really, someone must have a lower price for this movie,<br />ALso BD Live is no good if your Blue ray player is not up to date and also not hooked up to the internet and how do i now this simple i got a movie that was blue ray called StarShip Troopers and it did not work at all, So<br />when an item say Blue Ray with BD Live and you do not have a real fancy Blue Ray pLayers then forget about it, yes forget about it.<br />To the fact that this movie still rocks after all these years tells you something about the love for Disney movies and people who really like Disney movies and cool for Fans<br />When you get or look for Blue Ray just look on the box to make sure it can be good for your Blue Ray player or the shop you buy it from will not take it back once it is opened

B00C061I3K|5.0|People ask me always: why do you love so much the music from the 80's. And specially the younger generation is wondering why the 80s music was so great. And now you hear them listening to songs like 'Get lucky' of Daft Punk. From a CD that really goes back to the music as it was made in the 80s. Great to listen to!

B000002JSN|4.0|To be honest, I'm not a huge Zeppelin fan, but I really enjoy listening to this album.  It's the only one I own and probably always will be.  Disc 1 features their best heavy rock, and disc 2 adds some interesting songs not characteristic of typical Zeppelin fare.  A solid addition to my rock cd collection...

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Like Season 1, Season 2  has an excellent storyline that keeps you riveted - always inventive and surprising.  And then there are the technical aspects:  superb picture quality and sound - great fun to watch...highly recommended!
B0067LY4WG|4.0|If you like him you will like this. Not a rousing collection but good just the same. Have fun with it
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I need a book that grabs me right from the start, but this book just drowned me in too much technical knowledge, and not enough story line.  I enjoyed reading his previous books, so I thought that this book would be a good summer read.  I read a little, put it down, picked it up again, put it down, picked it up again...it took me FOREVER, to finish it...
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This isn't what I expected. Instead WW Z is just a compilation of short stories that paint a pop picture of the world if a disease of zombies were to become an epidemic. Max Brooks unique way describing  the world with insightful look into society's psyche made the read at times enjoyable but other times slow and hats to follow. Overall a decent read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a challenging game.  I have had to figure out certain aspects of the game myself but that's ok.
0525425772|5.0|Keep his books coming. I like his story.  It is good reading. The young man is good. Love the books.  Thank u Grisham .
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I know this movie is not &#34;politically correct&#34; but I watch movies because I want to be entertained.  I can always watch the history channel if I'm looking for information.
B004NS710C|5.0|good story line acting and action.... i was thoroughly anticipating what would happen even if i thought i knew what the ending would be....
0375413405|5.0|I loved reading through the narrative by Julia Child.  This was a gift but I would love to have a copy also!
B00CWVFVUE|5.0|I wasn't sure if we would like this movie or not but it is a definite keeper! Wanna watch it over again soon!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Loved it when I saw it years ago and wanted to have my young adult child see it before seeing the new release.
B00514HDNW|4.0|First off, if you saw the movie... forget everything.  The movie was changed so much from the book.  I saw the movie first and was shocked how different the book was... and I mean completely different.  The book tells about Robert Neville and how he survived the 'virus'.  It tells about how he lost his family, but the entire book is just him.  Except for at night when the vampires try to get in.  In  the end, he gets a visitor who he goes with.  He eventually learns that the vampires are adapting and are able to be out in the sun for periods of time.<br />In the book, we see Neville 'unravel'.  He is alone and drinks a lot because he is depressed.  It's one of those books that you just must read.
034580404X|3.0|I bought the set since there was so much talk.  The first book was very good and had me hanging at the end; rushing to start the next.  Books two and three were not nearly as good.  I only read the third to finish the series.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I liked the 15 day screen before. now you have tried to get so much on one screen that it is hard to read and visually baffling. change it back... it was<br />better.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  My grandparents rescued me so it has a special meaning for me.  It makes you want to help other people .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! It's not too easy but not too hard either. Plus you can get it for free:) it is solo much fun!!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A good, easy read with adventure and information.  Loved traveling the ridges with her and becoming one with the trek.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|I am currently reading Vonnegut's entire body of work.  Though this one seems to be, arguably, the best known (possibly thanks to many high school English classes) I would put it near the bottom of the list in terms of impact.  Read Cat's Cradle instead.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am disappointed to say that the movie trailer looks nothing like the book reads.  I'll wait and see - let's hope I'm wrong.
0393345084|1.0|Krugman supports creating bubbles and then letting them pop.  He likes the idea of spending beyond your means and he hates the idea that people should save. Yep he is right....the dotcom bubble and crash was great.  Then the housing bubble and crash was great.  Millions of lives destroyed, countless retirement funds annihilated, he thinks it was all great.  He wants more of the same now.  Print!!!! Krugman says, Print!!!!  This will solve all our problems.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|Starts as free game, but u end up having to pay for needed upgrades to complete levels. Special effects are good, but could be better.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great read from the front cover to the last page! An easy read, as well as it touches deep subjects that the young adults inevitably have to deal with. Highly recommended!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I enjoy it and if you are a fan so will you. I would suggest you buy it right now. XD
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is, a veery good game but anyway, its too expensive for me so, i wont play it for a long time :)
B00COH0W00|4.0|One rainy night I was looking for a non-chaotic, non-violent, non-vulgar sweet tale and found this romantic<br />comedy. It was a perfect fit, especially with Cusack, who has never, in my view,<br />made a bad movie. It's no heavy weight--nobody's wrestling their deep demons, true, but I was in the mood for a story<br />that would, in the moment, deliver some smiles and move me to believe in magic. Serendipity was a good match.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I found Oz TGP an entertaining fun film with impressive visuals and an uplifting plot.  Sure James Franco is not the best but he certainly dose not ruin the movie, Rachel Weiss is great and Mila Kunis holds her own.  If you like the world of OZ you will enjoy this movie.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|David Lynch's INLAND EMPIRE is the best film ever made by anyone. Let it wash over you like the ocean.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great! The only thing that could have been better was the ending. I was really happy that Katniss ended up with who she ended up with but I think it could have been a lot more detailed instead of just summarizing it up in one paragraph. I'm just hoping the movie goes into more detail. But if you loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire you will love this.
0767827902|5.0|The Last Picture Show is the most heartwrenching, most gutwrenching and most beautiful film I've ever seen. There is no other film like it.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|We have been watching Doctor for a while now.  Would recommend this season and every other season Dr. Who. A++
1897299214|5.0|If you don't think this scares people, check out the one-star reviews; it made the targeted people drag out all their polemics (which make the rest of us wonder if they have a Tardis to 1956?). It's a great book, with fabulous, clean illustrations, and observation of human nature. You have to at least ask your library to get this.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Tudors is great, very interesting to see the plot twist through out the season.  Would highly recommend this to anyone
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have always loved this game. Now I can take it along. It is so entertaining and fun. Good game.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I have used this chip for 5 months now and know how it will perform under most conditions. This is an excellent chip for the price. It has very good overclock ability and will run cool with a descent liquid cooling rig. I use the Corsair H80, (not H80i) and have had a very good experience with stable overclocks up to 4675  mghz. It would go much higher if I wanted to push it and maybe fiddle with voltage on my P9X79 Deluxe, but I think I would have to build a more powerful custom liquid cooling rig and the price for these parts has gone to the moon since I built my last one.<br />The H80 performs well for now even OC'd and running extreme gaming graphics with my Nvidia GTX 680. This chip performs without any problems, and runs anything you might want to throw at it without being OC'd, but it's always nice to know you have that Xtra speed if ya need it, or just want it. I have a friend that has pushed his 3820 to 5070 mghz without any problems, but he did take the time to build a custom water cooling rig first. He reported it stable on the Asus P9X79 Deluxe board.<br />I recommend this product.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The novel was well written, many great characters, though not as good as his previous two. Well worth your time!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It's a little spooky but great fun! I love this game and I want the sequel. This is my favorite game.
159463176X|5.0|I love Hosseini's work, yet much of it is very hard to read because of the subject matter being extreme and graphic.  This novel, while it contains elements of raw emotion and some harsh content, has a milder general tone.  Don't start reading it if you have other things to do because you will not want to pause in e story.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|If you are watching the tv series,you may not want to read these books.  As usual,, tv tells the story differently.  I don't  have a problem with either.  This is a really good read. I like that books let you go into much more detail.  Mr. Johnson does very well painting with words.  I'll read all of them.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The detail concerning everyday life brought history I have read in other sources to life in a very powerful way.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Totally unbelievable and silly, but had some humorous moments, was not full of sexual themes and the moral of the story was the timeless adage: &#34;Love Conquers All&#34;.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies!  It is so funny and entertaining even tho I wasn't a huge Pitt fan he was perfect in this movie, loved the way he said Nazi!
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have always enjoyed Star Trek every since I was 6 years old, and it keep getting better with each pasting year
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My kids love this game. It's easy for them to play and understand. Wish their were more games like this out there for little kids. :)
B00322PKAI|5.0|I got this watch b/c of the light weight material it is made of. I have weak wrists and my fancy jewelry store watch leaves my wrists sore after wearing but this one does not. Very durable and the watch looks exactly like the photo.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|I tried this on my 2009 Audi Q7 and it didn't work at all. The size of adapter was to small to attach to the piece in my car.
1426308469|5.0|I gave this to my second grade son and he loves it. It is a thick, very nice hard covered book. The illustrations and layout of the pages flows very well and doesn't contain too much information. If you wanted to read this to a child before bed you could cover several pages in less than ten minutes. Sometimes these books have too much information squeezed in, but that is not the case with this one. Get it for any dinosaur lover and they won't be disappointed!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome and he new update is here its so cool thier even coming out with a new minecraft update plus with the new update u get to chat to other ppl who are in the same world as u too!!!!! its awesome and if i could rate this more than 5 stars i would rate it the largest number known on earth!!!!!!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Was pleasantly surprised by this book. Very interesting read that kept the pages turning. Looking forward to seeing how they put it together on the movie screen.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Thought the whole series was great fun. Had innovative plot twists the casting was great bringing in people from other sci fi shows, I really enjoyed Ronan. A great show all around.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Best song for Summer 2013!  I downloaded the extended version and listen to it continously. Will have to listen to more songs by Daft Punk.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|dragged on the drama more than expected, had some funny parts. may hit very close to home for some people!
B000QCTNIW|5.0|A fascinating tour of the evidence developing about brain plasticity, learning and a new approach to boot-camp fitness for a flabby brain.  A useful and timely reminder about the importance of continually challenging the brain to build new neural connections, it takes aim at the common wisdoms about adaptability, growth and overcoming handicaps and even redefines our notions of what constitutes mental disability.  A great read and calisthenics for the mind.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Horses, a really good and young animal, is very popular with the kids and the world.they are very nice and the world's most popular animal.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|If you even remotely like any of Hans Zimmer previous soundtracks, you definite need to add this to your collection
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works just as advertised, and has a decent range of alarm sounds to fit those who need an abrupt wake-up and those who like relaxed music to wake them up.
0062020889|4.0|I enjoyed triple a lot only problem was it was too complex for a follett work and at times I had trouble keeping up with all that was happening and who was who. It took a while to get into for me as well, which is rare for a follett book. But Overall it was a great story.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Everything about black veil brides is in my taste. I love all of their music, from We Stitch These Wounds and Wretched And Divine. This album is amazing. Every song is flawless. I like how in The Legacy, Ashley had a little bass solo. I love this album more than I love myself!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game all the time.  It's one of my favorites.  It's also one that I can win at a lot.  You have to move cards of the same suit (in fact they are all the same suit ) from king to ace then they disappear.  There are lots of sets to wok with.  you almost have to play it in order to know how.  Sorry i can't give directions.  But as I've said.... It's one of my favorites.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I really love this album. I love how every album they make, the more mature and amazing the music gets. This particular album was very deep and had a great way to it. When I saw them live, they played \\"In The End\\" last. This cd never gets old. I was a big fan of We stitch these wounds and Set the world on fire, and now Wretched and divine has joined my ipod playlist. Rock on BVB <3
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a complete Bible. Easy to use, Easy to read and it's handy having it at my finger tips for easy access. It's comforting to have Gods word with me all the time.
0544002318|5.0|This book tells a great story about running and eating. The recipes at the end of each chapter are just a bonus.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This was a &#34;free download of the day&#34; and it was cute.  But not cute enough to keep.  I will be deleting it.  Just not to my liking.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is a realistic story about flaws and potential in people, even lawyers!  The dialogue was realistic and the story flowed evenly.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Although I normally love Hidden object games I discovered they are not so much fun on a small screen.  I couldn't find the objects. Therefore if i find it for my computer it will probably get a higher rating but for small screen tablets or Kindels it's not good at all.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. Not the best. But very good.<br /><br />Give it a try.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I suppose this calculator is ok but i found a simpler one that i really like.  I have no need for extra options.  Might be good if i was still in school but I use mine for everyday purposes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love pinterest. such a great way to find new ideas on food clothes crafts and more. i recomend it to everyone. super easy to use as well. follow your friends from facebook and twitter too.
B009LDD22U|5.0|This year, TBBT became a ratings phenomenon, reaching the 20 million viewer mark when \\"The Bakersfield Expedition\\" first aired. That was one of my top episodes. Now, with all the nerdy stuff that STILL is in the show, I don't understand why people still have such a problem with it. Amy and Bernadette are STAYING. The girls have given the show new life and the show would've dropped off and tanked at the end of season 3. At least, unlike season 5, Amy stopped with her \\"lesbian\\" comments towards Penny. There's still plenty of nerd stuff. And people still complain. They are never satisfied. Also, Amy and Bernadette are female SCIENTISTS.<br /><br />The season started off kind of subpar with Howard floating around in space, apparently miserable and the butt of the other astronauts jokes. There were a few funny moments but glad they didn't stretch it out too long. Sheldon says \\"He went to space a boy and returns a boy-sized hero,\\" followed by Howard screaming like a little girl as they plunge back down to Earth. Poor guy didn't get the welcome back that he really wanted, and also, wouldn't shut up about being in space either. The show picked up again in that very episode with a guys vs. girls game night which was hysterical. We had a stretch of superb episodes after that, like Stuart's Halloween party, (and Leonard showing Penny an awesome hologram in the lab) Sheldon and Howard fighting over Sheldon's parking space that he never uses, Penny teaching Howard how to fish and put a worm on a hook, Howard and Raj trying to figure out Sheldon's secret routine in a room in the university basement, and of course, the guys going to a comic convention in Bakersfield, and stopping in the same field that they shot the original Star Trek TV series--dressed as the principal characters, and getting their car stolen. And the Bob Newhart episode, where he plays Sheldon and Leonard's childhood TV idol \\"Professor Proton.\\" And in 2 episodes, we are introduced to the university's human resources lady, Mrs. Davis, who's African American, and Sheldon makes a few racist comments and gives her a few very inappropriate gifts (he's obviously unaware of how bad these things are) while buttering her up to get picked for the open tenure position. And of course, there were many other great episodes, but those are my top season 6 ones.<br /><br />Also, Amy and Sheldon's \\"relationship\\" starts to open up a bit more, and Sheldon makes a very shocking statement, that it's a possibility that he'll sleep with Amy someday. Penny's reaction is priceless. Howard finally moves out of his mutha's house, and Raj meets a girl who's also socially awkward. And Penny goes back to community college, to prove to Leonard that she's not stupid.<br /><br />All in all, this season has been EXCELLENT. Many people agree it's been the best one since season 2 or 3. The show recently cleaned up pretty good at the Critics Choice Awards, and hopefully will win even more awards in the future. After what was season 6, they definitely will.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|Once again Tribeplay did it=) my 3 year old daughter loves it! It's fun for her to make silly cars or trucks and then take em out for a spin=) great app for boys and girls! &amp; even fun for mom or dad to play=)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is horrible I can't believe how stupid it is. I've can't even sign up for this app don't waste your time okay
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Tons of stuff to fix! Kept my three year old daughter busy for awhile. Had no trouble with the fish tank part of it, but did have a bit of trouble getting the chair to fix. Overall, it's still a great game! Awesome for boys and girls. I would recommend this game to anyone with children 3-6 years old
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app is AWESOME. As soon as you get the hang of it it seems really FUN. I'm really old an I still enjoy it. So I think this app is AWESOME and I think you should too.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used AVG for years and have never had a problem.  This is a must on any android tablet.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|`The Doors' was a stunning debut early in 1967 before the Summer of Love would epitomize the Sixties. However, much of the music on this landmark record would be an anathema to the `peace/love' era. Ray Manzarek (recently deceased), Robby Krieger, John Densmore and the late Jim Morrison would shatter most of the hippie conventions of the mid to late `60s by releasing a strange and surreally beautiful record that was at once celebrating the licentious of the era while at the same time speaking as prophets of doom and paving the way for the gritty realization of the `me decade'.  Morrison was unique among rock idols as he almost postured himself as a modern day shaman whose Blake inspired poetry and oedipal imagery fueled many of the band's legendary compositions. Besides, very few acts could take a blues standard like \\"Back Door Man\\" or a relic from Weimar Germany (\\"The Alabama Song\\") and make them sound like completely original songs. \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Break  On Through\\" were the big hits and \\"Crystal Ship\\", \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" were the popular album cuts but no song crystallized the Armageddon-ish quality of the Doors as \\"The End\\" which came to symbolize the end of the Sixties though the decade still had three plus years to roll. If you don't already own this timeless LP then as a true rock fan you owe it to yourself to have `The Doors'. Heavy Metal was not a sound that one associates with the Doors but what they may have lacked in sheer volume, the Los Angeles quartet made up with a devastating emotional impact that would signal the nihilism of future acts such as Black  Sabbath who provided the doomy riffs to go along with the apocalyptic imagery of Jim and his cohorts - he took a face from the ancient gallery and HE WALKED ON DOWN THE HALL....
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|If you like dark, edgy crime dramas, The Shield fits the bill.  Episodes are gripping and have you walking a blurry line between justice and legality.  I really like this show and recommend it for crime drama junkies looking for something that is anything but black and white.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|Awesome movie even better in 4K colors just seem alot better. I didnt think  it would make much of a difference but it was enough to make it worth the purchase
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This record is great through and through. Back to their roots, this album holds up to their strongest releases. Rick Rubin did a great job at capturing the essence of Black Sabbath. Rock N' Roll is not dead.
B00CDCIQX6|4.0|Love conquers all again. A bit of underdog wins.<br /><br />Movie starts off intriguing, builds sub plots to a pretty good crescendo, ties up the ending with a nice twist. Great SciFi special effects not over used. I'm happy I bought it.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I was very excited to read the last book of the crossfire trilogy, had been expecting the release date to finally know how the story ended. I was really disappointed to read the last page saying it will continue with 2 more books. What the hell? A trilogy is made of 3 books, not 5.  I suppose the success of the serie has made Sylvia Day want more and instead of satisfying her readers and give them what they want, she prefered aiming for more money. Good luck selling the 4th book of the serie....
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I love Mr. Browns books and this was no exception - but there was a point in the book I simply shook my head in disbelief of the 'twist' which unfolded much too quickly; almost with indifference to the engrossed reader. It took me a few weeks to get back to the book and complete the read. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it as a 'unique' Dan Brown book.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I've seen some reviews of the actual game, and it appears to be okay. It just refused to work on my Kindle fire. Good thing it was free then.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book was great - dog lovers will cherish it, but even non-dog people will enjoy the spirit of the book and the life lessons to be gained.  It became an added book on our book club list -
B007HACDLK|5.0|Yet another great Mitch Rabb book. Vince Flynn does it again with this book. I am a big fan of Mitch Rabb and this book adds to the legend of this superhero. The book is fast moving and filled with action. A worthy addition to the series.
B0095P33IW|5.0|A really good movie that I would recommend to anyone that love action. It is a true little guy to hero show.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Have to listen a few times, but it's a great album. The writing really has a nice sequence. Worth the listen.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|This is a great site for kids. It makes them use their brains while playing and as a Grandma I am all about using them. The kids can both play at the same time so they learn sharing too.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Good teenage movie.  Watched it with my son and daughter...we all liked it.  Who would think that a zombie love story would be good, but it was.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|I wasn't picturing myself enjoying a book that covers such a timespan, but it's actually excellent.  Rutherfurd does a good job creating characters that are captivating in a scene that is, for the most part, historically accurate.  I only wish we had closure on some of the characters - but then you couldn't cover such a time frame in one book.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Bruno's diversity shines through on this album, as usual.  It actually feels reminiscent of MJ's Off the Wall album - the beats are old school but fresh.  Bruno rocks - he has SOOOO much potential.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It's one of the best weather apps I've used. Gives you everything you need to know & easy to use.
1593272200|5.0|The amount of detail in this book is godsend. This book is very well organised and presenting history of standards and naming makes learning much more easier. Instead of jumping right in and having to remember mystical looking names, the history gives the reader an understanding of where the names come from and one can derive and piece together information from there.<br /><br />I am a newbie to linux. I learned C from Deitels How to Program (AWESOME BOOK ALSO) and wanted to take my knowledge further. I did not know where to start really until picking up TCP/IP sockets in C. after getting through 25% percent of that I realized that I need a book on OS API because there were so many holes in the TCP/IP book. I was left wondering why this and why that. THIS BOOK, my friends is THE BOOK with the answers to your &#34;whys&#34;. Great Book!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|they put pictures over the video. dumb right. I was excited but now... not so much. it id free so yeah
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|.Too much going into other details, somewhat a a lot of repeating. Have a nice day. Did show living conditions in PK
B004OC07F8|3.0|I found very usefull to have a deep dive into the success of business like Cirque du Solei very practical
B000T060TG|5.0|I hadn't heard this album for so long, and it has some great songs! Some of which I had forgotten about. My room-mate, years ago, used to listen to the title song over and over again. So listening now is like a time machine to my past. Love it.
1400063736|5.0|Using the high wire walk between the World Trade Center towers in 1974 as thread to stitch his stories together, Let the Great World Spin author Colum McCann has written a tapestry of a book.  The social economic and cultural s boundaries are torn away to reveal how very alike we all are.  It was a wonderful read.
B008CO1DPM|5.0|This replaced my older Shuttle PC.  This one is half the size and 4 time the performance.  Low power and extremely quiet.  Used an i5 low power processor, 8G ram and 128GB SSD, with no DVD drive.  Works like a charm and only took 20 minutes to build.  Spent more time getting it out of the box and reading the directions.  Nice little box.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie has a very complex plot. Though the acting, make-up and special effects are great, the story and dialog leave a bit to be desired. That being said, if you can sit through the whole thing with enough patience for the plot to take shape, it is worth it in the end.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|Excellent album. It's definitely one of my 2013 faves so far. Keep it, Mr. Chameleon Dude. The stars are out tonight is the obvious hit single on this one.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|May not be the very top but is consistently very good. I would say is a dependable long series evening companion.
1451627297|4.0|and that is usually no the case when I read Stephen King, for you who hasn't read anything written by King, I recddomend him. I've read about 25 King novels and theyre mostly all GREAT
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series gets more interesting each year!  I have to admit though I wish Matthew hadn't been killed off.  I love it!
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I read this when I was a little girl growing up in Holland ( The Netherlands), it was a must for everyone to read the diary of Anne Frank.<br />Still to this day I remember it well.<br />Now I told my youngest daughter to read this and she just could not put it down.<br />She was telling me every now and then what she was reading.<br />And would say that she really likes this book.<br />Now she wants me to take her to Holland next time that I go so she can go to the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, we will see...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I look forward to &#34;movie night&#34; with Downton Abbey Season 3.  Rarely do we find any shows that engross both of us so completely!  We LOVE it and tell all our friends about it!
B0053O89JM|5.0|That was exactly what I was looking for. That was perfect! I love watching House! Now I have all of the seasons of House.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched Downton Abbey Season 2 with great expectations, and it came through.  I looked forward to every episode, and I could hardly wait to get Season 3.  I tell all my friends and family about it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This edition of the Sookie saga is better than some of the recent ones.  I did have the feeling that this could be the end of the series, however.  Still a fun read!
B003G4W49C|5.0|A defiant book that u should read. I loved it, so I pretty much didn't put the book down. Well written
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Worth seeing if you liked the original. It is in no way related to wicked so don't expect it. Just enjoy it as something different.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I found the premise and Bradley Cooper's character to be intriguing.  Same can be said for Jennifer Lawerence's character.  However, the second half of the movie, while producing some laughs, lacked credibility.  While the movie initially addressed some weighty issues of personality, mental health, family and relationships, they were sort of shrugged off with childish humor as the movie drew to a close. The transformation of Cooper's character was not believable.  Overrated movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm at level 5. Still not sure what's going on or how to play. I've only been in two rooms so far. Don't know how to keg into other parts of the manor..<br />I got to level 21and was really enjoying it. Now I get to start all over again. Maybe I'll get better at it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Some of the songs from this album are mesmerizing.  The music of Nashville for Volumes I and II are some of my favorite CDs!!!
0374533571|5.0|This book is a must read! The way that Quick is able to identify with the characters and make you feel like you are in the room with them creates an amazing atmosphere for the reader. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am very eager to watch the movie now. Being able to must faces to names in the book by knowing who they are casted as in the movie made my experience that much better.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book delivers what it promises, it tells the stories of how people have made tons of startups from basically scratch, and it tells their stories well.  It is a succinct, easy, and informative read.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the field of solo entrepreneurship in particular, entrepreneurship in general.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie! great story, lessons and music all presented in a very entertaining way. would recommend for all ages.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|From the very first show of Season 1, this series had me completely hooked.  Just wonderful stories and something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.  Wish they made more series like this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|if I deleted all my games but dragonvale I would play both of those games and this is the basically the same game as dragonvale sort of.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Excellent feel for the life of a line infantry man in the Pacific theater.  Focus is on the action, thoughts, and realities of combat.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This carrying case is just what I was trying to find.  My Kindle Fire fits perfectly. I can think of two things<br />that would make it just a bit better - a loop to hold my stylus and a pocket in one side (inside) for notes.<br />Other that it is absolutely perfect; so lightweight and easy to carry.
B003WJ81MA|5.0|Loved this movie growing up and just watched it with my husband and 6-1/2 year old son. The boy really liked it! It's visually gorgeous and the music is fantastic. I'd recommend this if you liked Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Love all the connections to the other series. It's long enough to have enough info and short enough to keep me interested! Great read :)
B000NVIXFK|5.0|\\"When the f--- did Rush become cool?\\" Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters pondered in his speech inducting Rush into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. It's a valid question as the kings of geek rock back in the 70s and 80s have witnessed a stunning change in perception amongst the population.<br /><br />Appearing on The Colbert Report, being idealized on screen in I Love You, Man and having the kids in South Park play Tom Sawyer definitely challenged the idea that to be a Rush fans you must be a straight A student who might fit in as a cast member on The Big Bang Theory. But when looking at the bands' musical legacy, their cool status probably came into being with the release of Snakes & Arrows.<br /><br />Before Snakes & Arrows Rush records consistently showcased a playful quality to them. Whether they were writing 20 minute songs in the 70s or playing around with synthesizers in the 80s Rush, despite Neil Peart's serious lyrics and brooding personality, actually sounded like three guys in a lab stretching, challenging and just plan exploring music with a gleeful energy. All one has to do is listen to Xanadu to understand the bands penchant for borderline goofy experiments in music. Also, if one attends a Rush concert, just watch Geddy Lee bounce around the stage with little attempts at coolness and you see this is a group of musical geeks.<br /><br />On Snakes & Arrows, the gleeful geeky energy of earlier Rush records is gone. Instead a serious, dare I suggest grown-up sound, which immediately smashes early perceptions of the band is allowed to flourish. The first sound you hear on Snakes & Arrows establishes this isn't just another Rush record as Peart smashes his drum along with a gnarly bass and guitar riff that wouldn't seem out of place on an early Pearl Jam record on Far Cry, a wake-up call of a song that immediately makes Rush less geek and more alternative rock cool. The rest of the record showcases a raw, hard rock approach that dabbles into modern day metal territory. Armour and Sword is another example of the heavy tone set with Alex Lifeson's guitar sounding as if he's committed to outdoing Alice N Chains with a raw riffing performance that elevates this epic rocker. Lee's vocal performance also adds to this new approach as his high pitched shriek that defined the bands early sound is gone, replaced by a weathered veteran rock vocal that doesn't overwhelm the ear. He's finally learned how to use his voice as part of the bands' sound not just lay it on top.<br /><br />More of an embrace of modern day metal and hard rock then a return to their 70s progressive rock Rush on Snakes & Arrows redefined themselves as a modern rock act with aggressive riffs and playing.  Six years later when Grohl inducted them into the Rock Hall one wonders if this was the record that started the process.tory.

B00D611UMM|4.0|Alison Moyet's \\"The Minutes\\" is a strong, hypnotic album that showcases the strengths of her husky, beautiful voice, which is the best part of this album. When The Minutes at times, threatens to get bogged down in it's own slick electronica, Moyet's voice rises above it, and allows the songs to breathe. I would have given this record 5 stars, except for the fact that at times I felt that the electronic sound, while slick, strong and clever, was a little overbearing at times. I think the closer \\"Rung By The Tide\\" is a perfect example. The song starts out gorgeous and slick, which sounds like Moyet's voice is singing over a dark, strange sea. But as the song moves on, it's gets taken over by the overpowering sound effects. \\"Rung by The Tide\\" would have been a much better song if it ended with Moyet's voice, instead of with the haunting synths, and bell tolls.<br /><br />But other than those criticisms, I think this album is her best work since \\"Alf\\", and her voice has not changed one bit in terms of it's strong, purring beauty. This album is a winner, and would have been perfect, if it had eased up on the electronic effects a bit, and brought out Alison Moyet's dynamic voice more.<br /><br />Having said that, I can't wait for her next album! I know her tour is mostly limited to the UK, but I hope she changes her mind, and does some touring here in the U.S., I'd love to see her here!<br /><br />My favorite tracks are: Apple Kisses<br />  Horizon Flame<br />  Changeling, A Place To Stay<br />  All signs of Life, and<br />  Rung By The Tide
0374533571|5.0|I liked  the movie so I wanted the book, this one was a beautiful edition and a very good price.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|Which made for a fairly boring read.  Honestly, I'd probably just skip it and try and figure out what's going on from reading Part One of A Dance With Dragons.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|I thought it was ok. I went in with high expectations because I loved Knocked Up. It didn't live up to my expectations, but it was alright.
B008220BLG|5.0|Had to own it once I walked out of the theater. A very funny movie that I know will be a classic.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|great app for watching and downloading videos problem is that their always erorrs during the video so you have to reboot the video
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I choose this rating because I loved the first season and I am loving the second season. Looking forward to third season. But, would really be happy if they had it OnDemand with my TV...so that I wouldn't have to pay for it.
B0051E9JNE|5.0|With a powerful soundtrack by queen, Who wants to live forever I mean? I sure do highlander brings the action and the 80s to life in an amazingly fun film.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Its a awesome cd. It has almost all good songs on it.it was shipped fast and in great condition. Its worth the money and came at a great price.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|the reason why I Love this product extremely easy install the easiest frackin install I've ever done and the sound quality damn good and it interfaces with my daw recording software really well and most awesomely and it looks fantastic thus far great buy and more bang for the buck
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The plot of the story was intriguing which is why I gave it two stars. That where the positivity ends. The author could not have passed the 5th grade. The style of writing was horrendous. It was too adult of a theme to be targeted towards young adults/teens but written too simply for adults to enjoy. So who was supposed to enjoy this book. And the erotic nature of the novel was not bothersome but the way the female character pretty much allowed a man to get her to do things she really was apprehensive toward was slightly nauseating at times. I won't be reading the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is pretty fun. Handful of unlocks, power ups, and characters. Can't seem to link it to my Facebook account however.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome Series. Read all three. Avoid the movie until you read the book. The book definitely gives you the background you need to enjoy the movie.
0151008116|5.0|This book did not make me believe in God as advertised, but it is a fascinating story and an example of storytelling at its best.
1564148793|5.0|After trying out a couple of the magick spells rhymes in the book,even though I don't have all the various ingriedients to complete these type of magick spells to completely cast these spells.Through the two spells I said out loud verbally,plus also some hard praying.I have begun to notice since I received the book and since I prayed so hard.I have started this week noticing I am now begining to enjoy the changes spiritually and physically I so desperately wanted to come back in my life and today Thursday June 13,2013 I spiritually realized I have started living the way I had been wanting for,for such a long time again.I give the AllMighty and Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit and the awesome Powers of Nature all the deserved praise and worthy Thanks for the new changes and answers to Prayer.It is Believeing by Faith and Believeing Nature Powers and Nature Magick is real with your heart and your mind willing to believe that the Supernatural is possible by faith.Then Prayer and White Witchcraft simply does work.I even found out Wishcraft thinking works very fast,and quick results within a few days to a week results always appears.Sincerely:Tim Kemp

1439190275|5.0|I was looking for a very well structured plan, and one that was clear and concise to facilitate the rough road ahead.  I am ADHD, and really need structure.  This book leads you in &#34;structured&#34; manner.  For example, as I began reading with a &#34;get started quick and eat this or eat that&#34; mentality, I found I could get started like that, but, it wasn't the best approach.  By time I finished the &#34;Induction Phase&#34; reading, I was into my fourth week.  There are comments to SUGGEST the book be read completely before starting, but, I was under medical orders to lose 30lbs in three months...that was a month earlier.  So, there I was one month into a three month period in which I was to lose 30lbs, but I started anyway.  I am an adult male, so the first week I lost 12 lbs.  GREAT!  but then I started to &#34;plateau&#34;, along with other issues surfacing.  I HAD to read the book to figure things out!  I am down 18 lbs, starting my 5th week, and though I thought it would be hard, it is very manageable with the Atkins bars and shakes as well as a sugar-free chocolate once in a while.<br />There is really nothing to say negative about the program.  I have learned greatly about nutrition, healthy eating habits, that doesn't have to be as intense as what you see on TV shows, and how others near me approach it.  Just do it!  Do something...somewhere...on a routine!  The online tools are very helpful, don't be timid, take the plunge...ask for help if you don't know...no body knows you, except by your writing.<br />I am recommending this to ALL of my overweight family members.  When folks ask about my weight loss, ATKINS!!! that is the way to go!!!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Really great movie! I'm usually not into 'little kid' movies but this one is a winner! Great story and love the characters!
B000I0QKDS|5.0|He is the original Jeff Beck and I am happy to say I can still listen the genius of his music today with this album.  Keep offering these classics from the 60's.  More brilliant music from this era than ever before.
B00ARZLDHM|4.0|The record plays great on the first side, though the previous owner certainly seemed to listen to side two way more than side one.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Haven't figured out how to use it!  I have to wonder if it's worth the effort effort to keep trying to figure it out.  There must be an easier easier way.
B00004R99U|5.0|Whoohoo, man she's seen this so many times, it has to be great! She is 6 years old, and told me it's her new &#34;favorite&#34;!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has even got my husband hooked.  We wait and watch the whole series at once because once you start you don't want it to end.
1609611543|5.0|I have suffered from diabetes for years. Tack on high blood pressure and several other conditions. I  blindly followed the AHA and ADA guidelines.  Eat plenty of whole grains.  Seemed like forever that I battled the belly, battled blood sugar, battled the bad numbers.  As I read the book I found myself identifying with everything Dr. Davis was saying....it all made sense.  The light came on! I started my wheat free lifestyle (I avoid the using the word diet...diet is something we do on the short term....this is a lifestyle change.)  It has been a month...25 pounds gone, inches off the belly, less appetite, numbers failing rapidly, more energy...I could go on and on.  Bottom line....I am the book!  I have encouraged several others (40 - 60 year old's) to buy the book, read the book, live the book.  Everyone is losing....everyone is winning!
0061564893|3.0|Menzies theory has been discredited six ways till Sunday but it's still very interesting. I was looking for history, not historical fiction.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Nice story about perseverance and get to understand life and oneself.  Good easy reading.  I would recommend it.  Cannot stand the crazy requirements to voluntarily write a review...just let a person write what they want.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|If you're not willing to spend the money, this game moves slowly. If you're looking for something that needs to be checked a few times a day, then this is great! But for high action, I'm bored and I need something to keep me awake, not so much. Still, it is cool to have your own dino theme park.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I got hooked on this show - you don't have to have seen prior seasons to follow the plot. Full of surprises.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard app. I do wish I had the option to have row of separate numbers,  but it makes up for it with the arrow buttons, which makes edits much simpler.
B002KKCVVO|5.0|PURCHASED THESE FOR HUSBAND AFTER BUYING SIMILAR WOMENS SHOES FOR MYSELF AND LOVED THEM.  THEY ARE GREAT FOR SUMMER CAMPING, BOATING WHATEVER.  THEY ARE TRUE TO SIZE AND VERY ADJUSTABLE.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|THIS game is really fun. It's fun to male you're own style on someone that won't berate you for messing up.
B003THHIEM|5.0|This is my favorite American show.  Castle started out as more of a smart-ass, but the character improved quickly. All of the actors are great in their roles and I like the interaction of the characters. Hey, what's not to like about a guy that buys his own Kevlar vest with WRITER across the front?
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have been very happy so far. It seems to work as promised.  The item is small, simple to use and inexpensive.
0062238868|5.0|After seeing Chris' widow do interviews I wanted to read his story.No matter what your politics,we still have to support our troops,who<br />put their lives on the line everyday.To survive all he went through and to die how he did,something isn't right.To be shot and killed<br />by a veteran at a gun range in Texas,it draws attention to the need of the troubles our vets have and it raises questions,is there<br />more to this story??
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I found this a predictably wonderful Michael Pollan story of cooking food.  Full of fascinating people and experiences of the author in his own experiments with cooking.  Actually, for me it was a &#34; page-turner&#34;, hard to put down.  I think it is especially for people already fascinated with cooking and food.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Who doesn't like him in the movies?To play a character that you dislike is a tip of the hat to Denzels gift.As in Training Day-another<br />must see movie!
B009MYARIK|1.0|Not what I thought it would be.  Was interested in location of story, no real description of place, Harlequin structure with no imagination. Characters shallow and undeveloped.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Well, if you like a fantasy/adventure mix, then this is the greatest choice for you!!! You'll love it...Alot!!!!!  Believe me!
B003NX75B8|5.0|I loved this book. All the characters were detailed and amazing. I loved how they met and how they all have their flaws, but all were likeable. Great job.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it can't believed it ended so abruptly. Can't wait for the next book. To see what Gideon and Eva are up too next
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really like this app. It has really helped make texting and overall typing faster. Especially since it learns what you type and everything else.
B005S1Y44Y|5.0|I love this recording of Queen perhaps the best.  But I like many other ones that they did also.  This is a great sounding CD.  There is great dynamics in this one.
1469984202|5.0|I really liked this book. I am partial to the post apocalyptic genre, however, I believe anyone would like this book. I am going to be reading other work by this author. I elected to buy the used version, and it had no major problems. It was a little worn, but I expected that. All pages were intact and clean. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app cause it is Awesome. SO plz download this app. You will love it. So please download this app cause u will love it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It is fine for checking the weather on my kindle when I am out and about. I out it.have not had a chance to use it much so i cnnot really say much ab
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is like SO hard to use and flip through. I thought getting a new kindle HD would at least upgrade the dictionary. Terrible.
B002QZ399G|3.0|Although the events were a bit disjointed with a few plot holes, the story was quite compelling. I appreciated that it underscored the influence of business interests in shaping and framing US foreign relations. It's hard to believe that American democracy and idealism actually is what we're taught to passively accept from childhood.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I loved Beautiful Creatures, but this book was a bit of let down.  It was very slow until the last few chapters, but it has an excellent ending, which is why I give it 3 stars.
B002JIEYKS|5.0|Every time I see Black Sabbath live I am always disappointed that nothing is ever played from this album. The album is incredible. Black Sabbath matured incredibly throughout the 1970's both in their musicianship and songwriting. Sabotage, Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die are definitely overlooked masterpieces. Sabbath had so much more to offer than Iron Man and War Pigs.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Awesome movie!!!I don't know how people can give this movie a bad review.  It was an awesome 2 hours of butt-kickin' action.  An original story line to a classic fairy tale.  A regular fun romp through the woods!!!
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie not only moves you emotionally and spiritually but the visual effects are spectacular.  This was more than just a movie it was a quest for enlightenment.  The trials and tribulations that you see Pi go through are heartfelt and you will find yourself cheering for him and cursing the heavens when things go wrong.  This movie is definitely worth seeing multiple times.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Couldn't wait to get to the end. Interesting portrayal of women's versus men's emotions.<br />I kept changing allegiances. Good read.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|&#34;A Delicate Truth&#34; is an overly simplistic morality play that le Carre could have avoided writing.  His style and depictions of the typical British civil service character continue to be one of his signature strengths.  In this he has always excelled, and readers will be pleased that he remains true to his excellent form.  Nonetheless, his attempt to portray what he conceives as the now mercenary self-interest inherent in the war against terror misses its mark.  It is patently simplistic to the point that those of us who are used to reading his typically well-woven plots and character assignments could be well disappointed.  I hope his next novel returns to the complex and riveting stories that we so admire.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked the game.  the only complaint I have is that the game was a little short for my liking.  but it was a good game. I would play it again and probably will.  I wish the games costs less.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Best gaming pad out there. My brother got me one a few years ago. It lasted 2 years then broke but I was able to fix it. I opened it and cleaned it then it worked for a few more weeks then died. I liked it so much I bought another one. This was a few years ago now I believe and I still got it. Love this game pad and it helps me kick ass.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game! I got it whenever it was the Free App of the Day. And lemme tell you, I was grateful it was free!!! This game has awesome oldie graphics and cool powerups. I seriously suggest purchasing this!
