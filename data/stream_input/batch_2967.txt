B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a really fun game. It is easy but also difficult. I also like that this game is free.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|I am a big fan of Amanda Seyfried. This is the main reason I watched the movie. It is a well made film. It was sad and depressing to see a woman treated this way.
B00EVLU2F2|5.0|The haunting melody and minor chords in this song are excellently organized.  The first thing I thought of upon hearing it was &#34;this song would make a great super hero movie theme&#34;.<br />Crazy as that may seem, I still love this song, and can't wait to hear the rest of this Goldfrapp album.

083357910X|3.0|The the story but the book is a reprint from original or poor quality printing was utilized; the images are not crisp. Also,  the book is smaller than anticipated. Make sure not to get the book from Annick publisher.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I enjoyed the book and thought that the way Cheryl wrote about her growth and maturation was done very well.  There was a slow, subtle shift in her attitude and thought process from beginning to end; which strikes me that that is how growth generally is.  Somewhat imperceptible, and only seen in retrospect or when viewed in relation to something else.  However, the last 1/3 of the book was getting a little bit monotonous to me.  I ended up skimming and skipping pages and only stopped to read dialogue.  Worthwhile to read, but dragged a little towards the end.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|Love this. Easy to hook up & sounds great with our stereo system. I would highly recommend this product for anyone.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is an enjoyable puzzle game. I find it moderately challenging and love playing it to just pass the time.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Or at least not the typical knight-in-shining armour type! You know it's a good book when you catch yourself trying to figure out how it'll end (or who the mole is) even though you're doing something else, such as washing dishes! I can't wait to get started on reading Tripwire =0)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this series and book 3 was not a disappointment! I loved how every page, no, every line kept you intrigued. It was hard to not continue to read on into the new chapters because there was always so much anticipation for me to see what was going to happen next. My only thing with the series, this book in particular, was that the author seemed to draw out some of the situations and at times, it even seemed a little hasty. But overall, this is on the top of my list for favorite books and i can't wait to see how the 2nd and 3rd movie installments compare.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Although the action and story are interesting, the quality of the image on this video was so poor, pixelated as if it was a copy and not the original material

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Absolutely love this game! It's slower advancing so I can leave it and have a life without having to check on it constantly. Very addicting too! Seriously cannot wait until I'm leveled up high enough to get my glacier attraction!
0394818237|5.0|A great book that shares a story with lots of details - something new to discover every time you read through it.
081297381X|4.0|This is a tough book to read sometimes - not in a bad way, just that there's so much there. It probably also helps to have a background in philosophy, forecasting and analytics - which I don't - but that just means you have to pay a little closer attention. I'm going to re-read this again in a year and I expect I'll get a lot more out of it next time.<br /><br />Taleb sure doesn't like prognosticators - or economists. He has no use for the Bell curve. He comes across as a bit arrogant sometimes and takes on a few of his critics by saying, \\"They misunderstood my point.\\" That may well be the case, I'm not really qualified to argue otherwise, but it smacked a bit of *every* author basically implying, \\"You just weren't smart enough to 'get it'.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book holds the same sort of pleasure that reading Malcolm Gladwell holds - like you're getting an insider's very different perspective on things that now make a little more sense, if uncertainty can ever be said to make sense.<br /><br />It's also helpful that he made it so the reader could skip the really technical chapters (15-17) without missing anything, if they weren't inclined to all the higher-level math and more granular analysis of uncertainty and the Bell curve.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I Love it. FLIPPIX ART-SIMPE PKEASURES IS SIMPLY GREAT. It is a very good game with no operational problems. I would highly recommend this game.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love, love, love the Downton Abbey series, however, I do wish they would stop killing off all the good characters.  Very disappointed with the way Season 3 ended!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I was beyond blown away by the first season of this television. show.  Although I have now read the 5 published books, at the time I watched season 1 I knew absolutely nothing about the story. With that said, the show perfectly conveyed the story of the first book in a very faithful way that is truly unusual for a television series.  I loved the following things, but this is by no means an exhaustive list: the strong themes about the high-cost of living by one's limiting moral code in the face of scrupulous adversaries; the fact that characters are always in genuine mortal danger; the high amounts of intrigue; the realistic-feeling feudal society; the fact that seemingly strong friendships with powerful people can be broken down by the realistic temptations of greed, ego, and a lust for power; and the countless, completely fleshed out and three dimensional, characters.  I have been waiting for something this good ad this immersible to be put on a television for a long time.<br /><br />I was also quite pleased by the subtle foreshadowing, the deep and dense of history conveyed through exposition and incomplete statements, and the suspenseful tone of even seemingly innocence interactions in the capital city contributing to a very addictive television watching experience.  Although I think in later seasons the \\"sexposition\\" deserves more criticism, I think it was effectively enough done in this first season and I won't use my review characters here to criticize it.<br /><br />I truly loved this season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|And the saga continues.  I could do with less of the meanness of the O'Brien and Barrow characters, but otherwise, great season of Downton Abbey.
B005FISBV2|3.0|This is probably the most formulaic of Dexter's 8 season run, and while still enjoyable on an episode-to-episode basis, the overall story of this season is somewhat weak and unsatisfying.  The Trinity Killer is a tough act to follow, and introducing another \\"gimmick\\" killer this soon after Trinity was a bad idea.  Trinity was psychologically grounded, realistic, unpredictable, unstable, and terrifying.  The Doomsday Killer however felt like a contrived attempt to go back to the ice-truck killer story line (down to the exact sort of music and camerawork every time Dexter came upon the next tableau).  This killer's convoluted plan and crime scene was just a little too far fetched.  Besides, there was absolutely no suspense because the audience, unlike the religious doomsday killer, knew 100% that butchering a few dozen Miami citizens would NOT lead to the end of the world.  His ultimately thread was without any bite whatsoever.<br /><br />Moreover, I just don't buy that Dexter got this invested in spiritual exploration. I could see his friendship with Brother Sam being realistic enough, because Dexter does want to lose his Dark Passenger and be a normal human being. and Sam represents the opportunity for real and persisting redemption.  I could see Dexter connecting to him.  I suppose its possible Dexter, as a person who can't appreciate some of the \\"soft\\" beliefs humans in the world use, might be intrigued by this external belief system if he thought it could lead him to redemption, but I don't know - even if there was potential for the idea it just wasn't executed very well.<br /><br />My biggest gripe, however, is that the show just stopped advancing.  As long as you know that Deb gets promoted to Sgt., and you see the last 2 minutes of the season, then you know everything you need to know to understand season 7.  Although Dexter has always been more isolated from episode to episode than a lot of other premium cable series, I think at 6 seasons the audience wants the show to start addressing the central conflicts of the show (will Dexter get found out / will we see some ACTUAL AND PERMANENT change in Dexter).  Well, there is woefully little of that this season.<br /><br />I will say that Deb was a more likable and relatable character than ever before in this season, and I genuinely did enjoy her arc.  All and all, this is the weakest season of the show, mostly because it tries to copy-cat elements of past seasons that were successful rather than try to push the show towards a satisfying ending.  It feels contrived at times, and while still enjoyable, this show is absolutely not necessary viewing anymore.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Mike and Sully are back in \\"Monsters University,\\" prequel to the Oscar-nominated original \\"Monsters Inc.\\" Newcomers can enjoy \\"Monsters University\\" as a stand-alone film, an engaging and funny comedy-drama about friendship, but most viewers would watch the new film in order to meet the two beloved green-colored monsters in their younger days.<br /><br />In \\"MU, because of their blunders during the test, Mike and Sully, two opposites fiercely competing each other, are both kicked out of Monsters University's Scaring Program. To re-enter the school's most prestigious program, Mike and Sully join \\"Scare Games\\" with the school's misfit monsters.<br /><br />\\"Monsters University\\" is for the most part a formulaic but entertaining college comedy. As a comedy the film generally keeps a good pace with a good amount of effective visual jokes, while struggling to deal with one story element: that is, Mike is not very scary. Perhaps because of this, \\"Monsters University\\" wraps up in an unusual way.<br /><br />I was not impressed with the conclusion, the \\"bridge\\" part that connects \\"University\\" and \\"Inc.\\" After all, seen as a stand-alone piece, \\"Monsters University\\" doesn't have to be about Mike and Sully. This is not the case with \\"Monsters Inc.\\" where their characters (and a little girl) are integral part of the film's universe.<br /><br />This is not to say that \\"Monsters University\\" is bad. It is only that the prequel, enjoyable as it is, only reminds us of the thrills we got from \\"Monsters Inc.,\\" thrills of watching something very unique and original.
B00AZ5AO1U|5.0|Probably the best Patricia Barber album in SACD. Everything is right with this album; the song selections, the presentation and also the sonic quality. Five stars all the way.
B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|It seemed like it took way longer than it should have, and Warner Brothers in their infinite wisdom delayed the release date on more than one occasion.  At last almost 12 years after the excellent Living Proof we have some new Cher music.  Aside from the already heard Woman's World all of the tracks are quite good,  Cher is working with Mark Taylor again and several other producers here.  Her vocals are in great shape and the ballads mix in well with the uptempo numbers.  My only gripe is that even the deluxe edition comes in at a mere 54 minutes.  I certainly do not know how many albums are left on her Warner's contract but it seems doubtful at 67 that another 12 years is feasible in between the next record...but this is Cher after all.

B006JPS1OM|2.0|I'm stuck. I have had no troubles so far in saving and coming back, but I'm on I think Chapter3 or 4 in the cabin to get lamp parts. I have everything but one piece, but when I click it, it won't do anything. I know it's the right piece, because I even used a hint to make sure.  I can't continue with the game until I pick up that silly piece, so I guess I wasted my time and money on this.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Frankly, I was incredibly disappointed by the blatant old fashioned sexism (that women have been spending decades to undo) in this book. The author seems to want to convince the reader it's not pure male dominance since Ana resists him at times and behaves like a sassy little girl. This plot is weak and the interest by the masses speaks to how little women have progressed in terms of being turned on for the right reasons. Yuk!
B00FAVRFXE|3.0|Novemeber is going to be a great month. PS4, Thor- The Dark World and this episode of Dr Who.<br />Seeing Smith, Tennant, Coleman and Piper as well as John Hurt, its just going to be awesome.<br />I really liked Tennant when he first started his stint in the role but in his later years he just got too shouty and bug eyed for me.<br />For me, Smith and T Baker are the best incarnations of this amazing character

B0012DIQ5U|4.0|the story and animation are very good, as usual, but also as usual the dubbing is not.  the voice overs are very flat leaving out any potential of adding emotion to the actions in the cartoon.  It might have been better to leave the original dialog with subtitles, but without having heard that I do not know if the original voicing was done any better.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved reading this beautiful and heartbreaking story. While the story telling seamlessly weaves between past and present, it shines a powerful light on past and present efforts of child fostering systems in the United States. It encompasses the emotional impact of the lives of children, begging the question of how to make the world a better place for those in need of a safe and happy home to become a part of. Definitely a good book that will stir the desire to learn more about the history of Orphan Trains and the children who rode them!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|While it's definitely it's own superb story, it is also full of connections to the first book that make a lot of sense. If you've only seen the movie, do yourself a favor and go read The Shining before picking up Doctor Sleep. Regardless, nice cast of characters and a welcome consideration of the dangers of anger and alcohol.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Don't think about it too much, just marvel at a pre-''Batman'' Christian Bale fighting with his emotions, fighting the system from within and fight with samurai swords and the frenetic ''gun-kata''. Kurt Wimmer re-booted the premise or formula with ''Ultraviolet'', but this is a much better movie. If u have a soft-spot for Bernese mountain dogs, ur in for a sweet treat.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|After hearing so much about this book, I decided to give it a try. This is my first novel I read from this author. Before starting, I kept having “Gone Girl” by Gillian Flynn as a reference. Even though it deals with marriage issues and struggle, it’s not only completely different but the intensity is different as well.<br />To be honest, it took me a while to finish this novel. I had to leave it 3 times before picking it up again. It’s a slow paced narrative because one becomes a spectator through the consciences of the characters. The crudity of their thoughts can be shocking, egotistical but nonetheless real. However, it has unexpected turns and the end really make up for the slowness of the plot for the first half. At the end of the day, the author was able to succeed in connecting all the dots and left us with a powerful message:<br /><br />“None of us ever know all the possible courses our lives could have and maybe should have taken. It’s probably just as well. Some secrets are meant to stay secret forever. Just ask Pandora.”<br />Moriarty, Liane (2013-07-30). The Husband's Secret (p. 394). Penguin Group US. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />It all starts from 2 main families, marriages to be exact, that comes from the same village where they attended the same private Catholic school. It all evolves, simultaneously around Rachel’s daughter’s death, which alludes to the title. I must say, I encountered some difficulties in remembering all the names. It was until I reached half of the book that I was able to easily identify the characters.<br />The title does not only refers to a specific “Husband’s Secret” but to secrets in general that looms in our lives without our acknowledgement. Once revealed, it can creates other sets of consequences unforeseen by our pride and ego.<br />It is a complex novel enriched with many messages that portrayed the egos and selfishness of the main characters. This novel is also about frustration, locked up anger, and impotence in the face of events out of our control. It's also about our misconstrued, erroneous beliefs and the ill-full influence they could have on our actions. It makes you ponder: what would you have done in Rachel's shoes?, taking into consideration all the logistics. Sometimes, the obvious, easy thing to do, it's not the correct solution. We are not in a better position to judge : the rage of our egos makes us as guilty as the authors, as the instigators and even blinds us. The novel ends with Rachel’s unresolved decision whether to report her daughter’s assassin or not.<br /><br />“She would make her final decision about what needed to be done, what price needed to be paid, or if, in fact, it had already been paid.”<br />Moriarty, Liane (2013-07-30). The Husband's Secret (p. 383). Penguin Group US. Kindle Edition.and impotence in the face of events out of our control.

B008JFUO36|5.0|I really liked this film in many ways. The cinematography and special effects were spectacular and the acting was very good. Tom Cruise doesn't alway impress me in films with his acting but in this film he did a good job. I just love Morgan Freeman and he helped this movie with a strong performance. The entire cast actually did a good job. I actually liked the plot of the film and it made for an interesting storyline that was entertaining.  It had enough twists and turns to keep you thinking.<br /><br />I think the film was much better than many people give it credit. I won't go into any spoilers but the film is worth watching at least once and for the special effects maybe even twice. It is an interesting Sci-Fi story.  This is the reason I watch movies.<br /><br />I do wish that there was more interaction with the invading aliens and that part of the storyline could had been enhanced and it would had made the film even better. For me the film was about a 4.5 but since that rating is not allowed I will make if a 5 star. I would watch it again.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Okay, but not great. I think there was a great idea behind the movie, it just wasn't strongly executed. .
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought my first set and have used them heavily. They still sound great! I bought 2 more pairs so I would have them at work, home, and for travel. Sony makes great audio products.

I have used the paid version of this app as an alarm for a year now and it has always been great. in the last month I have had problems with alarms not going off, and when the do somehow the volume is all the way down when I know it was up before I went to sleep. at this point in time I am back to using the free app because I tried to delete the paid version to try a reinstall, and now it's stuck saying I still have the app and will not get rid of the Icon. I really wish I wouldn't have updated. word to the wise, if it ain't broke done fix it, if an app works never update it.

B001QB5S3G|4.0|I watch the film when it first came out, then a few time times thereafter.  Just recently I watched it again for a college course and did a critical review of the film. The movie moves at a good pace with a few times the viewer has to make assumptions of whats going on.  A few scenes don't have any dialogue, and the viewer has to guess on what's really going on.  I like the story line and the message it has. I felt that De Nero's character, Mendoza, was a bit short, and could have had a more explosive or bigger impact that he gives us today 20+ years later. Jeremy Irons character also give a brilliant depiction of a Jesuit Priest upholding his order to the end. Overall, the movie has the right feel for 1750's, the clothing, historical accounts and the scenery is spot on. I rate this movie as four stars due to it's lack of spotted information to the viewer.

B00DQC2FPM|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo26CCLYHF9XATE]]Visually, this Lego set is a cross between a Lego City and a Lego Creator set. It does a great job of emulating the look of the time-travelling DeLorean, even without windows, but it is a VERY flimsy set and will snap and fall apart if you play with it. I can't imagine this set being a bit hit with kids though. It comes with a minifigure versions of Doc and Marty, and they can fit in with your City. However the DeLorean is too large to fit into any other Lego environment and can only really exist on its own. Cuusoo have plans for further BTTF sets, most of which CAN be integrated into a City environment. I look forward to these, but be prepared to pay top dollar.

B0084IHVC0|3.0|In 1920s France an eccentric Duchess plans to leave her estate to her privileged kitties (Cattingtons?). Her nefarious, Prince Charles-lookalike butler overhears her plans and schemes to have the cats disappeared. He drugs them, for some reason, and dumps them in the countryside. Surely a quick warm up in the oven would have been a more foolproof plan. And why even bother disposing of the cats? Surely getting rid of the Duchess should be his first priority. I mean she could potentially live for another 25 years.<br /><br />Once out in the French countryside they meet up with jiving, self-confident stray Tom (that's an original name for an animated cat) who makes it his mission to take them back to Paris. He's basically a feline Baloo. He's even voiced by Phil Harris. Along the way they meet various characters and eventually confront the Butler who plotted against them.<br /><br />If it sounds familiar that's because it's basically a rewritten version of [[ASIN:B00EFYGX5S Disney's Jungle Book]]. It even has King Louie type of jazz cat. This isn't really a bad thing, but it lacks the necessary spark to make it a classic. The animation is colorful and the period French setting provides some lovely backgrounds. It's just not anything too special, sadly.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks great in 1.66:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a good amount of extras including classic Disney short \\"Bath Day\\", in HD, featuring Minnie and Figaro the Cat. Worth getting, even if you don't insist on collecting all Disney animated features.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Movie was not what I expected, very boring. Do not waste your time watching it<br />Acting was really bad also
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Tense drama with lots of twists and turns--as soon as one episode ends, we want to watch the next one!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great movie however it's always the same. &#34;oh no the worlds ending&#34; *insert super power's here* *insert tons of CGI explosions*.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's easy to use. The lessons engage you in a variety of ways. There are a lot of lessons so you don't run out of material quickly. And it encourages you to refresh previous lessons you may have forgotten. This is great!

B001GUXJQA|4.0|There are plenty of plot twists and turns, but all tied together. Excellent writing. I just skip the cursing, sex,and the graphic descriptions of violence and bodies, enjoying the character development with the story line.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|This is so far their best live album by far. I have not seen the movie yet, i will when i have a chance but for me it is all about the music & it's all here on this CD. First i have to say compared to Live S**t,Binge & purge this is a tighter better sounding Metallica. James's voice sound's so much better now then it used to & with the add of Robert Trujillo they seem to have a new found energy. Production & mix wise they nailed the tone & sound on this album.The set list is also amazing & carer spanning.Since this is a soundtrack to their new movie i think it is safe to say that Metallica has just made their Song Remains The Same.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies, Tom Hanks did an excellent job on this one.  Certainly will entertain the whole family
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Even fantasy cops aren't this good.  Yes, it's SciFi, but where was the central story theme in all the gore and action?  No doubt tossed out with the dishwater!
B009MYAQK4|3.0|The preface mentions much earlier writings (papyruses) and leads you to believe this book may be a translation of one of those old papyruses.  Then it jumps to a writing discovered much later, not one of those old papyruses, and you discover this particular writing was carbon-dated to the 14th century AD, and THAT'S what this author translated.  While the translation is interesting, I find myself wondering if it's an actual translation, or if the author paraphrased his own interpretation of what was originally written.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|This movie addresses the Believe Santa exists, for children as they get past the 6 - 7 age group.<br />Nicely done and entertaining.

B000JMKNZQ|5.0|This is the third Coelho book I've read in a matter of a month! This is particularly beautiful as each page offers insight to take with you everyday.

B00ECU2SGS|4.0|The kid steals the show, M.M. does a great job as usual.  I suggest you put it in your list of movies to see.
B00F4IF57Q|5.0|I didn't have any idea of what to expect before this album came out, but I was hoping for some similarity to Congratulations. When I first listened to it, I needed to listen to it a second time. Now that I've listened to it about 5 times, I can definitely say I'm hooked to MGMT. Their songs are so wonderfully psychedelic with a hefty mixture of pop and electronica. It's similar to Congratulations in that it once again manages to detach itself somewhat from the sounds of their previous albums, forming it's own sound which is at the same time new and still unmistakably MGMT. Cool Song No. 2 is my favorite song on the album, so much darker than anything they've done before with a great MGMT vibe resonating through it. Mystery Disease struck me also as a great dark electronic track. I had listened to Alien Days when the audio first came out on YouTube, it has a more classic MGMT feel to it and is a beautiful intro track for the album. Their cover of Faine Jade's Introspection was very well done and brings a simple yet intelligent psychedelic song into the modern era. Your Life is a Lie speaks to me, I don't quite get what it's saying yet, still, it's superb and is the closest song this album gets to pop, without the superficial, contrived sound pop music so often contains. The album seems to taper out after A Good Sadness, with Astro-Mancy being the low point of the album. That said, there is not one song on this album I dislike, Astro-Mancy was a nice psychedelic song but just couldn't compare to the first half of the album. Plenty of Girls in the Sea was a well-written song and had some of my favorite verses out of the entire album, apart from Alien Days. As always, their lyrics are fantastically abstract and combine and flow so well with the feel of the songs.<br /><br />MGMT has evolved yet again, introducing a refreshingly distinct album that once again reaffirms my belief that they will be known as one of the most original and talented bands in the current generation of music. They have quickly shown themselves to be adept musicians and songwriters capable of varying their style while retaining what makes them unique. By far my favorite band to have come out in the last decade, I will remain an avid listener to their music as long as they continue to release such interesting and original albums.

1469000431|3.0|The content on the cd's is interesting but the narrators voice is irritating.  I found out about this book/cd through a website I visited and thought it would be a good idea to check it out.  I am going to sell the cd's and buy the book since I believe the information could be of use to me.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|We love the Iron Man Series and feel Robert Downey portrays Iron Man perfectly!  Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as Pepper too!
B00BT70J6S|5.0|The music is beautifully performed, and the quality of recording is quite up to date. I'm surprised Sony has not imprinted metadata into the CD nor is it available on line as yet.<br /><br />I have found that new releases take time for the metadata to become available.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Take a classic book that's familiar to most folks, hire some A-list actors, max out the special effects budget, and put the asses in the seats.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, DiCaprio's performance is memorable, the sets are gorgeous, and the story is compelling. But while the scenes are packed with detail, the camera cuts quickly, and the music changes as many times as the camera does. Instead of flowing through the ups and downs of the story, we're constantly told how to feel with 1-minute sample arrangements of pop songs. Even Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue gets the treatment. It all feels more like spectacle than substance.
B00D0Z2J10|5.0|This new DBZ movie is an incredible addition to the series.  It can't come out in English fast enough.  Classic Dragon Ball with better effects and third dimension fighting.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Download it it's a value. Gameloft level of accomplishement. Gyro well used. Bright gameplay. No cooldown to play. Perfect for S4. Nice game

1781162646|3.0|I've avoided Mr. King's works for some time (I made an exception for 11.22.63) due to their increasingly graphic nature. They also tend to be quite long and then he just tacks on an ending which don't often make sense. The description of this book intrigued me, so before I went on vacation I checked it out from my public library. It was an interesting book. I don't quite understand the promo about it being a love story. It's about a young man who solves a murder mystery from long ago. It wasn't graphic, and the typical King profanity wasn't as pervasive as in most of his books. It was a good vacation read and was just a mystery novel.
B003M70O5O|4.0|I really like the show, wished it was toned down a little, but understand that it can not be.  t
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|So much spoken without a word!  Loved the fluidity of this movie.  If you like Cirque Du Soleil, you'll like this movie!
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I've always been skeptical of modernizations of Shakespeare's plays, like O, Romeo + Juliet, The Lion King and 10 Things I hate About You, but this one absolutely blew me away. I saw it twice in theaters (it makes a great date movie), and both times, I completely forgot that this movie takes place in the present day. The minimal, but tasteful use of modern technology fits in perfectly, and is even good for a few laughs (the use of the MP3 player, limo \\"chariots\\").<br /><br />One of the more interesting parts of this movie is that it was filmed at Joss Whedon's own house over a period of two weeks, and that it started because he held weekly Shakespeare readings there, and figured \\"Let's just film it\\".<br /><br />The music is fantastic, and was partially composed by Jed Whedon and his wife (one of the catchiest songs, \\"Sigh No More\\" is heard twice).<br /><br />Bottom line, it's an excellent movie with excellent actors, an excellent director, and an excellent soundtrack. The only con that I can think of is that they didn't stick with the movie poster that they used while it was in theaters for the cover of this blu-ray.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I liked Vapor Trails (2002) from the first listen, but came to understand that complaints from audiophiles about distortion and \\"audio clipping\\" were justified.  Enter this remixed and remastered version of the album, which far exceeds the original in every possible way.  Thanks to David Bottrill's fresh ears approaching the recorded material as if for the first time, the CD is now cleaner overall and we can also hear parts of each song we previously hadn't heard!  It almost sounds like the band has rerecorded the songs (\\"Wait, I never noticed that drum fill in the 2002 version!  That must be new!\\"), but they haven't added a thing; Bottrill just got the noise out of the way and increased the volume on certain instruments at certain times.  Dozens of things are entirely new to my years, including a bass bit at the beginning of \\"One Little Victory,\\" a guitar solo on \\"Ceiling Unlimited,\\" and some songs which now sound like they're sung in a different key altogether, thanks to Bottrill highlighting a different layer of vocals than (original producer) Paul Northfield did, and making THAT the lead vocal melody.  It's like a whole new album!<br /><br />I can't say enough about this remix.  The great songs Rush wrote for their comeback album can now be heard and appreciated the way they were intended - without the dynamic instrumentation being buried beneath a wall of noise.

1477600477|5.0|Twelve Months of a Soviet Childhood: Short Stories by Author Julia Gousseva<br /><br />What a delightful treat to read and enjoy this compilation of short stories by talented Author Julia Gousseva. This book is written in retrospect as this author fondly recalls true stories from her own childhood. The memories each story evoke are very touching and sure to stir a few of our own childhood memories and also pull at a few heartstrings.<br /><br />The Author's Note at the beginning of each story helps the reader understand the time, the place, the season, as well as some of the Soviet history behind them and the era in which they actually occurred.  Each note personalizes these true tales and makes them all the more enjoyable. Different countries with different customs...yet founded on many of the same or similar beliefs. Christmas stories, whether celebrated on December 25th or January 7th or whether it be Father Frost or Santa Claus bringing seasonal good cheer, are sure to bring pleasure to a wide range of reading audience.<br /><br />Stories with morals such as Dmitry's lack of obedience and consideration when he disappears at the Kremlin after the annual New Year's Day celebration. His defiant actions cause his concerned father some worry and grief. This well-written story is bound to teach a lesson or two. Dmitry's father is not about to reinforce such unacceptable behaviour and Julia, his younger cousin soon benefits from it with the gift of unexpected tickets from her uncle. Yet...being the thoughtful girl that she is, Julia still feels sad for her cousin.<br /><br />Twelve delightful stories...spanning a calendar year but not necessarily occurring in the same year....one story per month on a touching event that left an indelible memory on the heart and mind of this talented author who is so willing to share her past with her readers. Some history, some humor, and definitely some well-told and enjoyable events...such as an unintentional swim in Gorky Park with her friend by the same name under the watchful eye of Babushka. This one will bring a smile to many a face just picturing Julia sitting on a bench in her wet underwear while her dress air dries beside her. It surely brought a smile to mine...or memories of the wonderful summer fun at the dacha when Uncle Gena dropped by on a regular basis.  Such fond and memorable events to be enjoyed by all!<br /><br />Thank you to this talented author for sharing her childhood experiences with her readers and a little Russian history as well.  \\"Twelve red roses\\"...such a beautiful gift, however, it does not mean the same in all countries. You will definitely want to check out the reason for giving this gift in Russia.<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]her friend by the same name under the watchful eye of Babushka.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|A truly revealing book about two of the final battles in the Pacific theater that often get too little attention in the greater scope of WWII history.  The reality of combat was presented in all its gore and reality.  A truly eye-opening text.  Life as a Marine was realistically portrayed, and the human cost of war was raw and real.  It was hard to put the book down.  I have learned to truly appreciate what these men went through to secure the victory over imperial Japan.  Once one has read this book, the necessity for dropping the atomic bomb will be understood.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|I was mesmerized from \\"Honky Chateau,\\" and remember being a Freshman in high school voraciously saving my allowance to \\"catch up\\" with everything that came before it.  I have been a diehard Elton John fanatic ever since.  \\"The Diving Board\\" is not \\"Madman\\" or \\"Tumbleweed\\" or \\"Captain Fantastic.\\"  It is \\"The Diving Board,\\" and like all those great masterworks, it stands on its own merit as yet another complete, intact masterwork from Elton John and Bernie Taupin.  If it sounds a little like those earlier records, it isn't because Elton and Bernie tried to remake any of them...it's because it's Elton John and Bernie Taupin, and their indelible, brilliant imprint is all over it.  No, Elton doesn't sound like he's 26...he isn't.  He's 66 and sounds damn good for his age.  \\"The Diving Board\\" is elegant, diverse, subtle, spare and age appropriate.  For everyone looking for the Elton John of the so called glory days, he's alive and very well in 2013...it isn't 1973 for us or for him.  With all due respect, he's grown up and grown older and so many of us grew up  and grew older with him.  There is one thing that has never changed though. From the opening note of \\"Your Song\\" to the closing note of \\"The Diving Board,\\" Elton John is, and always has been, a cut above the rest.  The view from the diving board is simply awesome. Period.

B00BEOYPKW|4.0|I really enjoyed Kurt Vile's previous album, \\"Smoke Ring for My Halo,\\" so I was looking forward to this new offering. I like it, but I feel like I should have been blown away more than I actually was. I keep waffling: one day I think it's brilliant, a timeless work of musical genius. And the next time I play it, I find it hard to stay awake, thinking perhaps this is nothing more than a bunch of over-hyped aimless jams.<br /><br />I've played this CD a full 20 times now, and I'm still not QUITE sure what to think of it all. Certainly, Vile is a great guitar player, and the seeds for some memorable music are lurking in there, but too many of these tracks drag on for far too long. It's great that you get nearly 70 minutes of music on this CD, but I think this is one of those cases where less might have equaled more. At least I wouldn't nod off so often if the songs were shorter!<br /><br />So, is this a great album or an overrated one? I'm still sitting on the fence. But I'll keep playing it --- that alone should serve as some sort of endorsement --- and think about it all again 3 months from now.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Very addicting game. But sucks that you can't earn gold coins and have to pay. That's why four stars... but great game otherwise!!
B00633W614|4.0|I had forgotten about Jeffrey Archer. I used to read all of his books years ago. This summer, after reading Girl Gone, ugh, I got this on a recommendation from a friend. What a change of pace! Good guys, selfish buggers, struggling, independent and hard-working women wronged, a little Horatio Algerism and a reclusive, enigmatic hero -- all the players and more on a stage set in early 20th Century Bristol. You will love to hate and love to admire these vivid personas who are helped and thwarted by their friends and enemies. Just a good tale that balances high and lows and throws in enough intrigue and adventure to keep you hooked. I'm on the third one in the series now. It's a pleasure like munching popcorn while watching a rom com in the cinema, no brooding themes or existential statements on humanity here. What a relief!

B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I remember when N Sync broke up and Justin Timberlake was starting his solo career. Many thought he was just going to be another bubblegum pop singer. Then he wowed us with his debut \\"Justified\\" which contained mature pop and R&B songs. It was even nominated for Album of the Year. Then he released \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" and changed pop music forever. It was the perfect genre bending pop album thanks to his dynamic singing abilities and Timbalands eclectic producing skills. Another Album of the Year nomination followed and the album sold better than his debut. He showcased his great falsetto, his dancing, and his innovation. After that he seemed to jump off the music radar and venture into a pretty successful acting career. Many people were craving another JT album. He only released 2 albums and he was already given a legendary status in the music industry. Then surprisingly nearly 7 years later he made his big comeback with \\"Suit and Tie\\" and his long awaited third album \\"The 20/20 Experience\\". The album was yet again produced with the help of his longtime friend Timbaland. It was a very refreshing and epic album. Some people were turned off by the progressively long songs as opposed to the more straightforward music they were used to. It experimented even further than \\"Futuresex\\" did and it succeeded. I was content with it and couldn't wait for another album. Then what do you know? Justin announced a second part to the 20/20 experience to be released. I was ecstatic. After what seemed like another long wait, the second album is here. This album is another reason why Justin Timberlake and Timbaland are one of the best dynamic duos of music. Though many think it isn't as adventurous as part 1, I think this was the better of the two for me personally. For those who wanted more of the \\"FutureSex\\" sound, this is it! Here is a track by track review.<br /><br />1. Gimme What I Don't Know(I Want): This opening song sounds like a return to the sound of \\"Futuresex\\". Think \\"Sexy Ladies\\" and \\"Sexy Back\\" in comparison to style. Around 3 minutes into the song it breaks down in perfect Timberlake/Timbaland fashion. Great production and futuristic sexual singing from Justin. Nice way to open the album! 9.5/10<br />2. True Blood: The song starts out with a dancing pump up beat right away with more of JT's \\"Futuresex\\" type beats and vocals. This really sounds like a sequel to \\"Sexy Back\\". The song has a sexy Halloween feel to it, which is perfect since the album came out during the Halloween season. Justin gives us this weird laugh during the chorus sounding like a male Lady Gaga, but it works. There is a Thriller-like narrative that goes on in the middle of this dance epic. There are nice guitar moments in the song as well. The chorus will make you wanna dance through a Halloween costume party in pursuit of a sexy vixen. The last 3 minutes of course contain a progressive change in tempo a bit that ends the song well. This song is over 9 minutes but it goes by so fast each time. 10/10<br />3. Cabaret Feat. Drake: Imagine the sound of Drake and Timberlake/Timbaland combined. That is what this song sounds like right off the bat. It works so great. Drakes guest appearance doesn't take away from the album at all. In fact it shows how modern Justin can be. I did however wish Drake should've sang the chorus along with Timberlake in his unique voice. He does showcase his robotic singing voice for a few seconds though. The 4 minute length of the song makes it a good single candidate probably. Great pop rap song. 9.5/10<br />4. TKO: This song is amazing. The song transitions well from the previous song. Many will find the sound and lyrical contents similar to \\"Cry Me a River\\". The song took me a few listens to get into, but when I did, I couldn't get it out of my head. The chorus is so infectious. The Timbaland production is infectious as always. Perfect song for how you feel when a girl betrays you. The chorus will sink its teeth into you and infect you so good you will be singing it in the shower. Of course the final 2 minutes end the song so well with a perfect breakdown of the chorus and a tasty hip hop beat. The ending is emotionally intense. One of JT's best. 10/10<br />5. Take Back The Night: Justin showcases his Michael Jackson like singing/falsetto. Seriously, he sounds like MJ more than ever and it's great. This really is a good homage to the late legend. Though not as good of a lead single as \\"Suit and Tie\\" and \\"Sexy Back\\", it is impossible not to get grooving to this song. Nice disco comeback. The horns will blow you away. Get on the dance floor for this one! 9.5/10<br />6. Murder Feat. Jay Z: The transition into this song is perfect. The beat is pumping. Justin uses his sing rap style nicely. Jay Z makes his second guest appearance. Its nicely executed, but not as good as his appearance in part 1. Again, the song takes another route within the last 2 minutes. This part of the song reminds me of Outkast! Great song, but not one of his best. It does get better with multiple listens of course. 9/10<br />7. Drink You Away: The guitars that open the song have a slight country feel to it. I'm glad the song isn't country at all. But it does sound like a classy futuristic western soul song. The chorus is a new sound for Justin, but it works. At first I didn't really like the song, but it gets better with repetition. The last 2 and a half minutes save the song for me. Not one of my favorites though. I'll still have to get used to it. 8.5/10<br />8. You Got It On: There is a sexy futuristic yet 90s feel to this one. Justin sings sweetly on this song. Very relaxing song to play while you're with that special someone. The chorus brings back memories of N Sync beautifully. He sings so swiftly in this song its hard not feel good listening to this song, no matter how corny it is. He makes it feel classy! Like the song states, this song sounds like falling in love. 10/10<br />9. Amnesia: This one starts out orchestral before turning into a pulsing and infectious beat. The chorus is another slight throwback to younger Justin! The last 2 minutes again are very beautiful. I don't know how else to explain how epic and emotional the ending of this song is! Justin really is the only one who can succeed in making 7 minute pop songs go by so fast. One of my favorites. 10/10<br />10. Only When I Walk Away: The chorus of this song has a dance rock feel to it. It does get repetitive as it implants its melody into your mind. Great memorable guitars are featured as well. The song changes direction at the halfway point with a groovy beat until again changing pace with a minute left in the song. Another nice song! 9.5/10<br />11. Not a Bad Thing/Pair of Wings: Be prepared to be hit with nostalgia. This song brings back the N Sync sound in full scale albeit some explicit lyrics. Another great feelgood song. Around the halfway point the second song/hidden track begins. It is an acoustic song in vein of \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Another Song\\". This song was solely produced by Timberlake. Its a really nice calm song to relax to after the pumping dance album that preceded it. Nice ending to the experience. 10/10<br /><br />So the critics are giving this album negative reviews in comparison to part 1. I think they are being too hard on it. A lot of people just had expectations too big for this album. Part 1 set the bar so high that they didn't welcome this more approachable album. Despite being longer than part 1, this one is more accessible. It is more catchy and poppy. Honestly, this is what I wanted the first 20/20 experience to sound like. I love that album, but this one is better for me. This album is funner too. Many think this album is a disappointment because it lacks the experimentation that made part 1 so groundbreaking. This does however sound more like a sequel to \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" with some of the \\"20/20\\" sound sprinkled on top and I love that. I think this album is more of a treat to Justins fans who wanted more of the \\"FutureSex\\" vibe. Part 1 was more of a personal album. This one is having more fun and you can hear it a lot throughout. When it comes to musical growth and artistic experimentation, part 1 wins. When it comes to making a album that is just fun to listen to with catchy long songs and decent lyrics, this one wins. Either way this one has a lot more replay value. I will definitely have this on repeat longer than the first experience. Truly a great modern musical experience. If you like Justins other albums, you'll love this. It's a great combination of all of the sounds he's tried. If you need some good fun dance music then you'll also love this. It's worth the money.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow, indeed. Just loved this book!  It was like stepping through my childhood. Ataris, Dungeons & Dragons, Tempest, Monty Python...and to know how lucky I was my dad was as anxious to try out the newest technology with me; even to play Pong!  I read this book on an iPad -  look how far I've come. Love you, Daddy (wish you were here to enjoy this with me!).
B006M4F67A|5.0|Loved this game!! Love all the different designs!! You have got to try this. A wonderful way to play dominoes!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Ok so I read the rateings looks good but try the driffents ones besides theirs a another one that's good but grade is below<br /><br />A plus plus plus plus plus<br /><br />So that's my grade<br /><br />Ps I have a kindle fire hd so I don't have a plus sign<br />Pps love cars watch it
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game and very addictive.  You have  to solve the puzzles to see what the pic looks like.
030759565X|5.0|Great cookbook, with simple explanations. Everyday meals as well as fancy dishes.<br />I wish this book existed when I first started cooking (hum..30 some years ago) but it's<br />never too late, I can still learn from it, and my children certainly will!<br />It also shows that knowledge can be acquired from having a passion and following your instincts.<br />Kudos to Deb!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy understanding law of attraction, it keeps me positive thinking during the day, I highly recommended it. love this book.
B003KRLKHC|3.0|Denzel Washington is phenomenal and saves the movie.<br />Great acting on his part, but Hollywood got carried away.....too bad.<br />The female partner is very pretty but not a wonderful actress.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is so freaking addicting!! I always tell myself &quot;ill put it down after the next game&quot; &amp; I never do!!! Wowzers!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really enjoy this series! Wish I could watch it everyday! I love the characters and absolutely love Gran! She really makes the show!
B0035LJZ1Q|3.0|movie okay but Johnny Depp always easy on the eyes. Worth watching  nice movie scenery good for Halloween nicely done
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|If you are on a budget and can not afford to go wireless just yet, or there are just other pieces of equipment much hire on the priority list. You cannot go wrong with this little jewel. The cord is quite long and has never present itself to be a problem. Most importantly though, the sound quality is excellent! I would highly recommend this microphone at twice the price.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is th  best app EVER you can see if someone has read your message something I would suggest is to fix the log in because sometimes it has problems log in in other then that it great for keeping in touch
B00821BLX4|4.0|The Tough series of Olympus underwater camera that I have does not have a lens cover (other models have automatic closure but mine accepts telephoto lens, wide angle lens and has special anti-spotting lens coating) so this was a good way to provide my own lens cap. Easy to install and remove and works with adapter lenses.<br /><br />Note: Although I also purchased a lens cap the adapter came with one so I now have a spare.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is awesome for keeping your 5 year old busy while waiting in line or when you need a quick distraction for them.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Bought it,,,had to wait almost 2 months to get because it was out of stock, When I finally got it it was easy to set up...<br />Cons: no reset button,,,like the Roku you have to unplug it...limited apps
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was a good book and made me want to find out more about the kids on that train. It is amazing what the human spirit can endure. I love the way the author took two very similar yet different childhoods and melded them to one story. I am going to look for another title by this author and see if I enjoy it as much
B00E0SX118|4.0|My kids loved it...me too...Already watched it at the movie theater...rented it to watch it again, Too bad the Amazon Prime free trial does not include the recent movies.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So many problems but a woman trying to be everything to everfyone until one<br /><br />A story that seems the same old tale of a woman trying to be everything to everyone until a HUGE mistake causes problems in the whole community. Intresting , suspenseful and sad.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Costs too much to get credits, free ones don't always get applied. But fun when it does work. I enjoy playing most of the time
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|I'm giving it 1 star because the player failed to operate. I was billed for them, but couldn't view it.<br />I'm giving it 1 star because the player failed to operate. I was billed for them, but couldn't view it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is very retarded needs to be fixed badly! My kindle fire HD looks glitchy as f*** while i run this app.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|Still Paramore, but a more mature sound. Most songs still about love, but what else can you expect? I like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed playing this game. I love puzzle games like this and was sad when I got to the end. I can't wait for the next installment.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|It has been a while now since this DVD has been out and I still have not picked it up.  I have all of the original show and movies on blu ray and the prequel to this movie on blu ray.  So why not this.  It was Kahn. This first Kahn made sense.  An older latin man to be used in genetic experiments in present times to make a super soldier in America is more plausible than using a skinny English white guy.  I think the obvious choice for the role would have been Antonio Banderas, He is Latin, older, a better actor, that kind of thing.<br /><br />Sadly that is my only complaint. I liked the story well enough and the directing, effects and performances buy the crew was amazing.  I'll get this later I'm sure.  I can always click the mute button and pretend the bad guy in the film is one of Kahn's henchmen.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I am addicted to all the books by this author. Such an individual style of writing. Can't wait to get home and finish another of her books!
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|Great acting!  Beautiful story line!  Rich characters!  Great story about coming of age.  Keeps your interest til the very end!
B0029ZA49Q|4.0|I use this harness to secure a [[ASIN:B0027JM35M Toploader Pro 75 AW]]. As a 6' male I could adjust it so that it holds the bag steadily against my chest.<br />The resulting height for the opening is just a tad high to comfortably get the camera and put it back but this was expected..<br />The build quality and perceived safety are good although I would have preferred metallic anchor points at the bottom, similar to those on the top.<br />Now, this is for sports or traveling in hard conditions (cycling, skying, roller-skating), it will not do as a fashion statement.<br />I would buy it again if I were to lose it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the third time reading this book. I just wish they were longer. I quickly read this in a few hours and always find myself wanting more even after I finish the other two.
B008Y212PI|3.0|App works flawlessly on my nexus 7.  Game has a good tutorial and progresses in hardness beautifully.  Pictures are of good quality and sound isn't annoying.  But it is missing one big feature for this type of game.  You should be able to put x's where you say nothing is.
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffery Archer is my favorite author.  I love the Clifton Chronicles...and needed to go back and re-read this book before reading the third book in the series.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is so different from the books I normally read. The story line is simple and suspense filled, the images are absolutely amazing! Read this one with your kindle fire or on your iPhone or iPad, because you'll want to see the detail.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book surprised me with depth and raw emotion.  It tells the story of a girl who has lived her life in foster care.  She feels abandoned and suffers from reactive attachment disorder.  At the beginning of the story, she is aging out of the system, and has no where to go, and few skills to help her to earn her way in the world.  Her tale of survival and learning to trust is touching.<br />This is a terrific book club selection, as there is much to talk about!
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|This book is good, I like long involved series and I am annoyed that I have to wait for the sequel
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Addictive! My kindle would love a rest break! Can't put it down! So much for reading any of my books, just don't see it happening today!
B005LLSZNM|3.0|Too often far fetched storylines and characters who are not believable to get into this series like other good series.  Not sure if this will be the last season I invest anytime into watching this show before moving on.  Instead of getting better, it's getting less appealing to me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just puzzling enough to challenge my brain each time, the previous levels seem to build up the difficulty. Much like a hidden object game but no story.
B001F3FUK6|5.0|I thought it was a great continuation of the story. Brandon Routh did a great job as the Man Of Steel
B000LXQVA4|5.0|This may be the best $100 i ever spent. Bought it for my daughter when she was 5 months old. She liked it straight away, but it took her a few goes before she started to jump. She's now 6 months and LOVES it. She jumps like crazy and smiles and laughs in it. I love that I can put her in it and for 10 minutes i know she can't go anywhere so I can get a couple of quick chores done (whilst checking in on her every couple of minutes of course). The only downside I suppose is that it's quite bulky and not really easy to move, so it has just stayed in the same place in our living room. But it's definitely worth it for how much she loves it. Would recommend.
B0084670FU|1.0|Did not even finish watching the film. jumping from one family to another and quite boring. not getting to the point of the plot.
B004EC5IV6|4.0|The one I purchased was different, then I received the red case (&#34;Directors Cut&#34;) edition<br />2.22 with all the extras. I was wondering why they have so many versions of the same anime. This cover<br />is a different disc and case. Anyway,<br />Unlike Neon-genesis Evangelion series, this is a total digital edited remake, with new CGI<br />upgraded & a new story line that is like a spin-off of the old series. Not as good as the original, but<br />well worth viewing.
B005XUC398|3.0|Decent fictional film but looks at the problems that is happening in today's market such as what happened with the fall of the home loan program etc. Have to keep up and have some understanding of the market to have an interest in the film.
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|Well written and compelling.  I felt sad for humanity as it kept reminding me that somewhere what I was reading was more than likely a reality for someone! The story illustrated humanity at its worst, its best and its most foolish.  I have often found books that have a mashup of time and place difficult to read on Kindle, but this book worked well. Brilliantly told.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|this was good, fairly interesting but i found that i never really got pulled in to any character.  in a great book there is some character who seems very compelling, in this one it seemed at first that the investigator was the main character, then all of a sudden he is out of the picture.  then the father becomes the main character but he is not that interesting.  overall, this is just ok.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|If you enjoy warmth and humor in your storylines, this is the best. They have made the mini-characters so endearing and Steve Carell was made for this part.  Great entertainment to make you laugh. It is a feel good for the psyche.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I bought this product when I started a new job and knew the signal strength was low within the building.  I had an old AT&T Skyrocket and the battery would drain quickly. I figured that it would be perfect to bring this battery along to plug in while sitting at meetings.  My phone would normally die before 11:00am.  Using this product, I could keep my phone running all day long and I could also share the USB port with co-workers to charge their iPhones.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great suspense novel. I was so used to reading James Patterson books, and this was a nice change in writing style and character dynamics.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Definitely is by far the best Iron Man of the three movies! Love the digital copy along with the blu-ray.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I've read all three novels and they are all very good reads. I wish this author had more novels for me to delve into.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is fun and easy to navigate. The graphics are clear and crisp.<br /><br />Worth the price and free was even better!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great read. A great story. A great suspense novel. Can't wait for more novels to read by this author.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I thought it was predictBle at times but he through in a zinger and totally amazed me  I enjoy reading his books
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Although this book is easy to read it will set its own pace for the individual. Leaving the reader with undeniable evidence that we are part of an infinite amount of abundance that listens to our every thought.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I think there might be something to this movie but everytime I turned it on me and my wife fall asleep....which I guess says something in and of itself.
B002RZZIXU|5.0|An outstanding read very fine narrative and excellent characters really moves forward with momentum and keep the attention and the tension well
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|They made bond out to be an old man in only the third installment with Craig as the lead. The whole plot was just plain silly and Bond walked around like a sad sack through the whole thing. He had a scruffy little chin beard and needed a shave as well. Bond was a dashing character, not a moping loser. All the costars were new and obviously made to appeal to a politically correct, multicultural audience. M is now a black woman in her early twenties..Q is a hipster barely out of high school who gives Bond a camera and a gun telling him 'we dont go in for all those exploding gadgets anymore..its all done with computers now'. Lame.
B009MYARIK|3.0|When you buy a Sophie Kinsella book it's because you want a fun, light read revolving around a likeable, if somewhat nutty, protagonist that will get into lots of scrapes but somehow come out winning. The formula here is somewhat the same, what changes is that we have to main characters, sisters Fliss and Lottie.<br /><br />Fliss is the older, supposedly mature one, while Lottie, despite having a great career, isn't the best at making decisions during difficult times. The two of them are equally immature, if you ask me. When Lottie's boyfriend refuses to commit, they break up and she, a day after, gets engaged to an old flame. Fliss, coming out of a nasty divorce, sets out to sabotage the wedding and ensuing honeymoon, meeting, and getting entangled with, in the process, the groom's best man. The situations are fairly ridiculous and some of them did make me laugh out loud, like Kinsella's books are prone to do. The plot wasn't exactly what bored me with the book, even if it was crazier an far more improbable than some of her other books, which is saying something. It was the character of Lottie that I couldn't quite like. I didn't understand why her boyfriend would go to such lengths to get her back after she marries some guy 2 weeks after they broke up.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed the book for what it is: a fun escape from reality, with some good jokes and a not-too-sound plot or characterization.
0553801473|4.0|After reading this book, the only downside is that now you have to wait for the next book in the series. Martins writing is such a high quality that he has spoiled me. I have been trying in vain to get into some other book/series but I find other writers just aren't as advanced. This guy is a real master of his craft.<br /><br />Some of the criticisms are that not enough happens, and that he drags it along and doesn't acknowledge some of the cliff hangers left in the last series. That is all true, but somehow you cant stop reading. I also think he is beginning to introduce too many characters and it becomes a bit hard to follow at points. Its not the best book in the series, but still a very good book and it will draw you in deep.
B003QSEYQY|1.0|I was running thrugh the list rather quickly.  I actually thought that I was buying the animated 101 dalmations movie.  THis movie is bad.  Not the sellers fault though.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I had only heard the song \\"Closer,\\" but the clips of the other songs sounded really good. I contemplated buying this album for about a week. Well, I finally got around to buying it today and, I have to say, each song is just as good as the next. Fun, upbeat music. I'm loving all of it. Best album purchase I've made in a while. Would recommend this album to everyone I know.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I wanted to give this movie five stars.  However, if I am going to be accurate in my review of this movie, it doesn't make my list of top movies of all time.  Nevertheless, it was a good movie and they seemed to spare no expense on the production.  The thought of humans hunting other humans was not appealing to me, but this was well done...given the subject matter.  They kept most of the grotesque stuff off the screen and leave it to your imagination what happened during the killings.<br />I will likely watch the sequel that comes to the theaters on November 22nd, but will wait until it comes out on Blu-ray before watching it.  I hate to spend money on a movie twice, so will wait and add this one in my collection.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My 3yo grandson loves this book. he laughs n laughs n laughs.  we got it when her was only 2
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|It came to me brand new, still wrapped and sealed with the sticker.<br />This is honestly one of August Burns Red's best albums and I connect to the lyrics on so many levels. 100% would recommend. Spirit Breaker is one of the best songs in my opinion. (Even though they're all so amazing) Great buy!
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|This book is about Camelot and the Lady of the Lake. It was a very good read and it kinda followed the movie.  But it had some info the movie didn't share.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna exploring her talents as a comeback kid. You will definitely enjoy her music made to work with the queen of disco!!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|What an AMAAAAZING cd! I super recommend this. The grooves, the style, its the perfect background music you'd like to have in a party.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is my favorite books in the series. It made me cry, laugh, and the book shocked me. It was truly amazing!!!!!!!
B009NH6JRE|3.0|SPOILER!<br /><br />It's a little slow, the story doesn't go anywere and there are no walkers to remember but Lori's, Merle's and T-dog's death are heart braking.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|For a of those who have been drawing and following Percy Jackson  from the beginning and are devoted to him and Annabeth,the ending is rough. Huge cliff hanger but with the next book coming out in just a few days i couldn't resist indulging in reading this book just one more time before finding out the fate if 2 of my favorite fictional characters ever!! Super excited for the next one to come out!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I loved it! I was sucked in and will have to finish all the rest of the series gee thanks! Its definitely an interesting concept for a story never thought of it before and I'm a big reader. I love how even the small things about daily life in the silo and how they make it possible were even thought out it makes it a lot more believable.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|the charger isn't charging plus the game diamond dash isn't working well plus this was a waste of good money
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I love this show. the Story line is entertaining and the characters well developed.  It,s always fun to see where their headed next!.
B00006674X|5.0|Love the music in this one.  How could you not fall in love with Elvis as your doctor.  Nice to see Mary Tyler Moore in a role different from her TV persona.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|I love all things grumpy cat! Just ordered the calendar too!  Stay grumpy :) love u tardar sauce, u rock!!
B00DCRE83S|1.0|Fairly boring album. Not much happening musically. It just sounds like a bunch of guys jamming. Not much in way of any memorable riffs. Mustaine, Newstead won't be.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|I can do almost every problem (equation) on this calculator.  It is a must have App. for everyone. I got this app for my math class and I am acing the cores.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|this book brings into horrific perpective how close we are to unimaginable destruction.  Only the madness of mutual assured detruction has prevented -so far- the obliveration of the human race.  A continuum of conflict through the XIX and XX centuries brought on by the decay of the Ottoman empire and the evolution of warfare technology
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|This could have been set anywhere, but this story takes place in the Europe. Jimùy, the main character wants to change his life but find himself making bad decisions, partly due to his unhappy past but mostly it's down to his drug habit. His development is great to read, and even as a tee-totaler, I enjoyed reading about him and Jason getting up to mischief, although it does get rather dark at times. I recommend this book without hesitation and will definitely read more of this author's work.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can see why Mr. Martin uses the double &#34;R's&#34; in his middle name--he is so Tolkeinesque. He has created a whole new world of knights, dragons, kings, queens and so much more.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I needed a good alarm clock so I bought this app. It is awesome and the best alarm clock app out there.
B005T9ZTSU|5.0|I love looking at great photographers pictures and I someday want to have a good camera and download pictures of my own.
B006LSZECO|3.0|There were so many glowing reviews of Gone Girl that I was really engaged when I began reading.  Told from an unusual perspective of first person in the alternating viewpoints of the husband and wife, it was interesting to get a peek at the beginning of this relationship.The first few chapters zipped along and then started a subtle shift.  The wife has gone missing and every outside indication is that the husband has killed her.<br />But that couldn't be true because we are in his viewpoint and he's as puzzled as we are.  So we trust the first person device and move on to see what really happened.<br />As secrets from their marriage are revealed, we start to lose faith in our hero and soon don't like him much.  But just when we almost decide he's guilty--the wife starts to reveal some nasty secrets of her own.  And back and forth it goes as we learn neither was anywhere near the kind of person they revealed in first person narrative, until after a while, I just don't care what happens to either of them.  He's selfish and lazy, she is psychotic and narcisstic.  The perfect couple.<br />But the book goes on.  And on.  Ultimately, they are reunited in a new kind of hell; one of the gets away with murder and their future together is assured--if horrifying.  The lack of consequence for the actions taken by this person and the fact that the other will be saddled in marriage with a killer leaves me very unsettled.  And feeling kind of like I need a bath.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I'm not sure if it is just my kindle. For some reason it won't let me move my<br />Suit :-(
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Tony Stark is back!  Dealing with PTSD, lack of sleep and an irritated Pepper, he's spending a ton of time in his lab building who-knows-what. This movie has a backstory that Tony tells as voice over so that we won't get lost in the story line...which is easy to do in the muddle of the middle of this movie.  There are a good performances by Ben Kingsley who, as the Mandarin, is not exactly what he appears and (SPOILER!) Guy Pearce, who literally burns up the scenery as this movie's Arch-Villian.  The Rhodie character, played by Don Cheadle (I liked Terrance Howard MUCH better in this role) is just a toss away character in this movie.  They could have written him out all together and no one would have missed him.  The battle at the end was satisfactorily explosive, shedding light on just how Tony spent all those sleepless nights in his lab. It culminated with a surprise for Pepper that leaves us wondering what's in store for her in future movies in the Marvel franchise. All in all, not a bad movie but not a great one either and certainly not as much fun as the first one.
B0028RXXE8|1.0|Dear all,<br />I gave a 'hate' rating because the item does not work in my player. I gave the item as a gift and was very disappointed to learn from my friend that it did not work in his player. He returned two discs to me and I tried them in my player: same result.

0802130208|5.0|Mr, Ignatius Reilly, esquire is the patron saint of all nerds, misfits and socially incompetent people. Of course, in my case, it was love at first sight. He lives in his own world, disconnected from reality, immersed in medieval phantasies and values. His english is perfect. His ideas completely wacked. Where in the US could such a story develop if not in New Orleans? My advice: this book is funny. Really funny. Highly recommended. Once you get to know Ignatius and his passion for Boethius, you will never be the same again. It is a great trip. Please do not miss it. (Hot Dog anyone?)
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|We own many Schleich toys, but this one is by far our favorite.  The details on this dragon are amazing, as with all Schleich toys.  What my daughter really loved most about it was that the wings really move and the rider sits on the saddle firmly, as magnets are used to keep the rider in the seat.  It's beautiful and high quality all the way!  Schleich toys last a long time, are durable and beautiful.  The toys are well worth the money.  I believe both boys and girls will be thrilled with this toy.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|A great film that further develops the character and story.  The acting, action and directing are top notch.  Very enjoyable.
B00633W614|5.0|I am a fan of Jeffery Archer's books. I am usually hooked by the first page. This book was no different!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a really good movie but the ending was kind of stupid.  Loved the tricks and special effects.  Cast was great too.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I think this is an excellent family film.  It has something for everyone on the family.  It has action but it is not violent and it moves fast enought to hold the viewer's attention.  The reenactment of a well know comic book character allows adults and children a subject with which  both are familiar.  I greatly enjoyed the film.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|A must see for any fan of Formula One, or any race fan. As long time F1 fan, it brought back the cars and drivers of the 70's and the fabulous tracks of the time. Remembering how shocked we were and how much we hoped for Nikki to recover from that horrific crash. Great movie by a great director.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet has written a great continuation of his first book of the Century Trilogy.  He very skilfully weaves the stories of the different families into the history of the period and keeps things moving.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is for readers who like character driven stories. Every character is real and the writing is crisp. You might even laugh and cry and be inspired.
B00BXLU1EU|3.0|it is a free app so it is not the best but it is better than the other free wifi apps that I can get.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The rating for me is equal to my all time favorites.  What a ending.  I can't wait for the next season to begin.  Quality show.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is like totally like the best game ever i just want to play it like every day for the rest of life
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonder why the Brits have a &#34;stiff upper lip&#34;?  You will learn why watching. Even if you don't like Historic novels or movies, you need to follow Downton Abbey. This was one thrilling season. Did not see the ending coming.  No spoilers here.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This is the second book in the Honor Harrington universe (Honorverse for those in the know).  It is as engrossing as the first book and I really enjoyed it.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|It is the X-Men 2 movie, I like it some prefer more along the comics. I like Wolverine played by Jackman, have all the movies now. They kill off characters and move to quick with the story in this one, but good movie over all.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Honor is back with a huge chip on her shoulder, and I am not talking about Nimitz.  Less space battle and more political maneuvering but still very engrossing.
B000AYELVA|4.0|Better than full screen in my opinion. It is the X-Men movie, I love it some prefer more along the comics. I like Wolverine played by Jackman, have all the movies now.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This album is yet another musical masterpiece.  The production and sonic quality is excellent, despite what the audiophiles say.  In my top 5 DT albums already, and it gets better with each listen.  The album gets 5 stars for Illumination Theory alone.  Bravo, Dream Theater.
B000I9U8VO|5.0|It is the X-Men 2 movie, I love it some prefer more along the comics. I like Wolverine played by Jackman, have all the movies now.
031623480X|5.0|I think Perlmutter is just great - I've seen him present at the ABIHM board certification conference and I was blown away by the information he provided, as well as amazing case examples he presented, pictures, patient testimonials and all. After that conference I purchased his previous book, Power up your brain,  and while I enjoyed it, it was written in a very dry style. My husband put that one down after only a few pages. This book is much different, very well written in an easy for anyone to understand conversational style. There is a critical review of the book claiming that his statements are unsubstantiated - this is just not true. The issue is that because this is for layman, he doesn't go citing and referencing every study or bit of evidence after each statement (that would be boring and painful for most readers). Look to his other books if you'd like to see more references, as they're written in more of that type of style.<br /><br />When reviewing a book it is important to take into consideration the prime audience - who the book is written for - and write the review based on that. This books is specifically for non-medically trained folks, and for that group it is written very well. I believe the questionnaires included are helpful for most folks, as it helps them to see how the information more directly applies to them.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very well written, easy to read book by a neurologist who is also board certified in holistic and integrative medicine that focuses on how to optimize your brain health (physically, emotionally, chemically) then this is the book to get. It will explain why sugar, carbs and modern grains are damaging to you in more ways than one. It will give you a plan to help prevent further damage and deterioration of your mental state and some times even reverse existing damage. The information he is basing his recommendations on is not voo-doo or otherwise sketchy science, but well established knowledge and facts that have been proven via functional MRI's and other direct measured testing as well as standard research methods.<br /><br />Great book - highly recommended. If you're trying to decide between this one and wheat belly [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]], go for this one. I found it to be better written, more informative and absolutely a more holistic (meaning looking at your overall health and wellness, versus focusing on one aspect of it) than the wheat belly, which is mostly focused solely on weight loss.hat have been proven via functional MRI's and other direct measured testing as well as standard research methods.<br /><br />Great book - highly recommended.

0307895505|5.0|This book really is a must have for any completion driven gamer. As you know, Skyrim is a HUGE game. If you want to find every secret and do every mission and find all secrets you will certainly need  this book. I suggest it to any Skyrim gamer.<br /><br />PC is best over console for Skyrim gaming, I have tested and tried both.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|His writing has improved from book-to-book, and this one is going to be tough to top.  An amazing, heartwrenching series of stories that intertwine in such an emotional and beautiful way.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|His books were reccommended by friend. So I decided to start with first on and do them in succession. I am now a Jack Reacher Fan! I really like the way that Lee tells a story and develops the characters. Can't wait to read the next one
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. And power ups. The numbers are large and the pay out is great. Definitely will recommend this to anyone
B001NHNG64|4.0|Can't wait to see what mess Jack gets in the the next book. Childs is a good story teller and keeps throwing curves with each new bad guy! They are really &#34;Bad&#34; and Dark too.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This app is okay but  there is one thing I dislike, some of the music didn't play!!! If that was fixed it would be a fantastic app..... other than that I love it
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|It's rare that the ending of a story (or in this case: movie) manages to surprise me even a little. But this one did. Bravo! An entertaining, hilarious, and gripping ride all around that will catch your brain right at the beginning and won't let go until it's good and ready.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) is married to the famous Nazi-Fighting Resistance Leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) who is caught by Nazis and sent to a concentration camp.  In time, Ilsa is informed that Victor is dead.  She is crushed, but eventually visits Paris for fresh outlooks on life.  There she meets Rick Blaine, a vacationing American sick of fighting with the resistance and owner of a nightclub near the Atlantic Ocean in Casablanca, Morocco, a center of French influence in North Africa.  Ilsa and Rick fall in love.  When Nazi forces invade Paris, Ilsa and Rick agree to meet in a railroad station.  Rick arrives alone, concludes that Ilsa has deserted him and returns to his nightclub in Casablanca.  Rick is shocked when Ilsa enters his nightclub with her husband Victor.  Ilsa was the victim of false information about her husband's death and creates a love triangle by showing deep affection for both men.  Not realizing that Ilsa had bad information about her husband's death, Rick is angry at Ilsa for abandoning him earlier at the railroad station in Paris, thus weakening the love triangle.  Ilsa explains the bad information, restoring the triangle to full strength.  Rick acquires papers for two people to avoid European conflict and fly to America.  He plans to use them to take himself and Ilsa to America, leaving Victor behind in Morocco.  Rick and Ilsa meet at the airport in Casablanca along with Victor who wants to say goodbye.  The routine meeting at the airport becomes a memorable blockbuster turning point in the movie.  The three triangle actors are perfect in their roles. Isla's Scandinavian beauty and strong accent help to give the movie a foreign feel.  Victor impresses audiences with his tall, imposing, courageous posture and brilliant lines while Rick's tart, lemony voice clearly brands him as an American.  The nightclub ambiance is perfect for the movie, being loaded with Nazi officers, resistance sympathizers and slippery deal-makers and opportunists.
B002HFJ77S|3.0|Witty writing, cute characters, I liked the ghost aspect of it.  It was a fun beachy read, but there was really nothing special about the book.  The ending was pretty predictable.  But it's nice for light reading.
B0025WG4SS|5.0|One of the bands making a lasting stamp on music.  They set trends, they were outstanding, the music is beyond great - what else is there to say?
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I knew it came on tv, but was not interested at the time.  But boy was I wrong.  I think I enjoyed it more by looking at it on amazon without commercials.  It was exquisite, fantastic, action. The end was so sentimental.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|My granddaughter and I have watched this movie many times.  We both could watch it over and over again.  I bought it as a Christmas present for her.
6301095294|5.0|The Beatles at their off-the-wall best.  For the hard-core fan, only, though:  the movie devoid of plot, script, direction, WHATEVER.  There's just the bus, the Beatles and the odd collection of people they rounded up for this, some pro, some semi-pro, some right off the street.<br /><br />Music of course .  . . .by the Beatles, with stunners like &#34;Blue Jay Way,&#34; &#34;I Am The Walrus,&#34; etc.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Yes, it is so.  Looking forward to the next one.  Makes me miss the west.  Glad he got a dog.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Talk about &#34;into darkness!&#34;  Try and find one bright spot in this monstrous, stupid, overdone obese slob of a movie.  Of course, I'm not the target audience, (brain-dead adolescents and zombie-like twenty-somethings) but STILL . . . the characters are cartoon versions of the originals, especially the puerile, celluloid-lipped Justin Bieber version of Kirk, who, let's face it, in the ORIGINAL version was nothing more than pure beefcake.  So, if low-budget male stripper-type was the goal, it was more than achieved.  The Spock character?  Just plain STUPID and ANNOYING, utterly lacking in any intellectual gifts (rather surprising,in a Vulcan) but--grotesquelyenough--amorous around  . . . Uhura.  Again, if stupid and annoying was the goal for this character:  wow, perfect success.<br /><br />McCoy, merely predictably dull, with lines indifferently culled from . . . morning meetings of some of the older staff of the this movie?  UHURA:  transformed from dignified African Queeen to hysterical cheerleader:  Hmmm, not good.  Ditto on Checkov:  how much hysteria can one actor produce?  Only Scotty seemed halfway close to the original, and that's because he WASN'T IN THE MOVIE for a good portion of it.  The Star Fleet uniforms are awfully reminiscent of the first Star Wars, except for the caps, which are straight out of present day North Korea.  UGH.  It doesn't get much uglier than that.  The plot has been done . . . oh, heavens who knows how many times before, but certainly Spock died in the old warp core on at least one other occasion.  Who the hell HASN'T died in the warp core  The love interest:  beyond tedious and predictable.Sigh.  The one bright spot:  Cumberbatch as the bad guy.  He was . . . . . almost interesting.<br /><br />Oh why go on?  I paid for it, so I sat through it!  My punishment is now complete!
B00B22ASUM|4.0|What a great story especially if you are a cat lover.  Pets bridge a gap that no human can.....I found it a bit slow the first few chapters but after that a good read.  So touching!!!
B0034EEE2E|4.0|I love the way the electric Hawaiian is incorporated into the songs.  The voice is indistinct  with the music and I cannot understand most of the words sung so will look for the lyrics.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I totally enjoy this app.  It's fun and keeps you on your toes.  When you get something right, it's time to celebrate.  It challenges you to use your brain to think and transpose Italian to English and English to Italian.  That's the best way to learn, I think.  I plan on spending a lot of time with this app and feel that Duolingo will help me learn Italian.
B0059M7YF8|5.0|I sold my long playing records on vinyl several years ago and bought a couple of Jarre's albums to satisfy my longing for his music.  I could no longer tolerate the hiss and pops of dust in the grooves and the CD delivers the music in pristine condition every time!
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I thought the movie was ok, but it was dark and hard to watch . the movie was a good ending

0439023513|2.0|This last book reads like a slap-dash effort.  Inconsistencies, incongruities and incomprehensibilities abound.  And it rambles...oh so badly.  Many of the critical issues simply...end...without any good reason or explanation.  I would guess this was written to the publisher's schedule rather than to the author's.  Very disappointing.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|Well, as I said before, I love the book, and when I see a movie from a book I expect it to be as good as the book. This movie is beautiful, loved the cast, it is a very good movie in deed and that's why I did buy it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Hilarity at its finest :). Do not watch when people are sleeping nearby :). You WILL LAUGH OUT LOUD. I promise :)

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this for my husband to use with the Sunday Ticket special offer and stream from his laptop to watch the Cowboys' game when we are in Florida...<br />Fairly easy to set up--didn't try to watch anything but Sunday Ticket since we have smart flatscreen/DVD player there and can get Netflix, Amazon Prime with them...<br />Signing on to the DirectTV site was hassle and there was some loss of image quality once the game was &#34;cast&#34; to the big screen...but way better than watching on the laptop and better than not seeing the game at all...<br />We left it there in case our daughter and SIL wanted to use it next week...
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It really surprised me. Keep an open mind and you will be surprised. I know I was.
B006S08RLU|5.0|#1. I love French movies. Their humor takes odd twists. This actress. Audrey Tautou has the most precious facial exspressions. I laughed out loud in several place. Naughtey but not vulgar like so many American movies. I.m sick of farts getting laughs B O R I N G . GROW UP!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft is already an incredible app in itself. The only reason I am not able to give it 5 stars is Amazon's update availability; my nieces have I phones and get the updates a month before all 4 boys in the household that downloaded their android versions from here, amazon app store.  This creates tension betweenst the youngsters because during this lapse of time difference they are unable to join one another because the boys version is not updated.  Give us our updates when they arrive an you'll establish peace in my home and earn your two missing stars  to it
B00A757EFW|5.0|Used to play this years ago with my son on his nintendo. Forgot  how much fun it was.  Good memories.
B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|This is probably the most important cd Ms.Netrebko has recorded so far!!!The pure sound of her voice,the coloration,the intelligent reading.The fact that for her first Verdi cd she chose arias that aren't like other normally sung arias in a first cd(no Aida's,Ballo,Forza,etc)Macbeth is an opera that I never imagined Ms.Netrebko would do!!!Her voice is so beautiful!!!In this case her voice is so beautiful that it make's Lady Macbeth even more scary!!My ultimate aria here is &#34;Tu che le vanita&#34;this is real theater!!basically(like MANY great Diva's)she told me the whole story,STUNNING!!even voice from the top to the lowest notes.You hear that new dark sound only Anna can make.You know what??JUST BUY IT AND LISTEN!!!You're going to love it!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband has been into playing solitare on his computer for years and I laughed at him because he couldn't give up until he won a game. Now I also play until I win one.
B000FCK42M|5.0|Book is very detailed and although fiction is very accurate in regards to the Mexican cartels and the ongoing situation with drugs going north into the USA  the river of iron(GUNS) flowing south into Mexico.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I got is to play with a grandchild.  She likes it. We challenge each other on who can do it faster.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Great sci-fi show from across the pond. Almost on par with Dr. Who, too bad it didn't last as long.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There isn't much else to say. This book takes you captive. You can't help but continue turning pages to find out what happens next!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I really like this mouse.  With all of the buttons, each of which is programmable, you can really customize your controls.  There are also two profiles so you can change the configuration depending on how you're using the mouse at any given time.  I use one profile for general web browsing and computer tasks and the other for gaming.  For the general profile, I have buttons mapped for play/pause, volume up, volume down, back, and forward.  The gaming profile changes depending on the game.  It's very easy to change the layout using Anker's software.<br /><br />The mouse comes with a nice braided cable rather than the cheap plastic cord that cheaper mice have.<br /><br />The weights that are included allow you to customize the feel of your mouse, but I honestly just installed about half of them when I first got the mouse and never really thought about it again.  The system works fine, and perhaps people who are more picky than me will appreciate the ability to vary the mouse's weight over such a large range.<br /><br />This mouse is a great value when it's on sale.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Modern day Poltergeist. Excellent movie. Great camera work and suspense. Well made. If you are a fan of haunted house movies, this is a must. Creepy and wonderfully frightful.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|This is the 2nd or 3th time I have come back to watch this series.  It really is the dream that many humans have when it comes to being able to explore the stars.  Also it is a great lesson in the conflict between the two emotions - situation control and exploration.  I really wish that this series would make a come back now as there isn't a good 1st run Sci-Fi series available.  Just the reruns.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|This is an outstanding movie!!! I love everything about it from the acting to the story and even where it was filmed. I highly recommend..
B008H7HE9S|5.0|We are big fans of Adam Levine and just had to have Maroon 5's latest...<br />We both enjoy listening to this one while running errands around town.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is one my least favorite games. Its fun but not as fun as some of the other games I have. I still recommended it...
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Very user friendly. The patterns for puzzles are very good multiple settings.you can play with different tiles, and different wallpapers for background.
B005LLX582|5.0|I got this because I love Brad Pitt and it was on my list to see.. I highly recommended. The acting is great and as well is the story..
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Easy to navigate from my kindle. The only thing I don't like cant play my games. The app. is ok.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Halle Berry is one of my favorite actress.. I loved her in The Call and this one ties it.. Great acting and very good..
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Elizabeth Gaskell is slowly emerging as one of my favorite authors of her era.  She strongly believed that women have specific and definite opinions and that expressing them in the proper venue should be appreciated and valued by all.  However, the reactions that young Miss Margaret Hale receives form those around her shows us just how unequal women were in former times.  Despite the fact that Ms. Hale didn't even recognize how much she admired the strong male lead character and took a long time to discover her real feelings for him, only added to the mystery of the times and the complexity of the female mind.  I love that these 2 had such a hard time connecting with each other thru communication, misjudgements, stereotypical thinking, etc. still there was something so attractive about each of them that made the other never give up hope of something more. Romance, maybe?  Even when they both thought they despised each other, they couldn't even commit to that.  This portrayal of Gaskell's work is so on target as far as the author's creative expression, that I truly see the clash between the sexes at these times as the back drop of all the failures of that era.This is one video I will see over and over as it has so much character textures.  Great!
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|It's a great game so far.  It Seems very deep in terms of gameplay with a fun storyline.  I'm only on level 7 but it's keeping me interested!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I like this series as the characters are so interesting and just like real people, they are unpredictable.  They seem to be trying to cooperate for the greater good of their clients and their firm but a lot of ego, personal values, core beliefs and personal agendas get in their way.  At first I did not like the title because I didn't understand what it meant to the story line.  But now I believe that Alicia, the main character is just a good woman and nothing else. The plots are so clever and well written.  I would give this the highest rating.  I never know what to expect from any of these characters, that I thought I knew.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a game I play all the time and my baby brother watches me play it. This is a five star game for sure. All ages welcome.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|My son told me about this program. I had never heard of it until its recent publicity and my sons encouragement to watch the series. We have only just started and are only up to chapter 3 of season 1. This is a great show in the ilk of The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire Ray Donovan and Homeland. We are looking forward to watching the entire five seasons!
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer is incredibly gifted.  This concert shows all of the musical personalities that make up John Mayer: the acoustic side that started his career; the \\"rock band\\" side that many have come to know and love; and his \\"let me see what else I can do and reinvent myself\\" side that will keep his career going for a long, long time.  I've always been big fans of Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn,and many amazing guitar players that no one's even heard of.  After seeing this concert \\"up close and personal\\" (from my living room), I think John Mayer has proven he is very worthy of the accolades he's received in his career.  He really is one of the \\"most influential\\" musicians of our time.  Buy this!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|The best film of its type ever made - its type being, films about big robots and big monsters. If you expect anything more than that, then maybe you don't know what the subject matter of this flick is. If big robots and big monsters is what you are after, nothing else even comes close to this.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Excellent series. The acting,  sets, and the costumes  are awesome. Very emotional, thrilling, and exciting story telling. My favorite show right now.
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|I was looking for Emperor's New Groove and got the bonus disc for the same price. My kids love it.
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|They tried to create another White collar kind of series and it was a good try. I enjoyed both seasons.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I never get tired of playing. Ability to choose deck design a plus.  Fun to watch auto return very entertaining. Different pattern every time.
B00BIPORC8|4.0|I like this series as it's gripping and interesting. I have watched 10 episode in one go. I would recommend it to my friends and family.
B00F2362IE|4.0|I really enjoyed the game for my child. It is a little difficult since the game is very fast paced, but I like that he can keep playing and rack up some coins to buy a new turtle. Some time the game gliches on my kindle but overall it is a great game.
B007AL48UK|4.0|It's not the first time I have played Mahjong game. It worked perfectly fine on my phone and I have wasted a lot of time on this game. It's kind of addictive.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies and I am 25!  I can't wait for the second one to come on DVD
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the most original and witty shows I have seen in a long time.  Also, doesn't put a lot of trashy things in their show.  They just rely on great actors and great scripts.  Keep it up!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My favorite super hero movie of all time!!!!  The action was great.  Perfect selections for the super heroes.  I can't see anyone ever being Iron Man than RDJ.
B009G41CG2|5.0|My friend told me about this game. I thought I would try it once WOW  I play it everyday. I like all the puzzles you get with this game. f I would recommend it
B008Y212PI|3.0|Not bad for a free game. Very nice graphics. Not much to the game: completed in less than an hour.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Any book that can bring you on an emotional roller coaster deserves your attention.  Read this book, you won't regret it!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Installed and ran with no problems. Helped me solve a WiFi error I was getting on my Samsung Galaxy tab 2. Highly recommend it to anyone with a wireless network.
B002SJ2ZTK|1.0|I never received my movie, so how can I give it a rating?  This is the first time that this has happened to an order that I have placed.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This has been a lot of fun for all the grandkids, and the adults also.  They will have a lot of fun playing with this game.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Everyone has scar tissue. Reading about someone who inspires you for them to tell the world of their own scar tissue just makes Anthony Kiedis all that much inspirational and then some. Read it, it is going to you get through the day.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|This is the third book I've read by this author. I keep coming back because he writes the kind of realistic fiction I love. Get Clean - Adventures in Cocaine (a crime & psychological thriller) by Jams N. Roses is possibly his best work yet - intense, gritty and authentic. Not for the faint of heart - violence, sex, drugs and language abound (just like real life). It's a fast and often wild read. Recommended.
B008Y212PI|3.0|I love these types of games. This app is good, easy but fun. If it had hard harder levels or actually looked like the photo then it would get more stars.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you haven't seen it yet, you probably aren't going to.  It's a super hero/action movie must.  Amazing all star cast and Marvel/Disney does the movie right.  Great chemistry and while the plot may seem to be slightly overboard (alien invasion) it is true to the comics and the cartoons so it nails it.
B001HC8516|3.0|Seemed sort of one dimensional.  And way too opinionated.  I realize it was written from the author's perspective, but it didn't really do all that much for me.  It was just okay.
B00821OX98|3.0|The show has potential- it really does...  The special effects are great and I love both dystopic themes and science fiction.  The down side here is that some of the acting is so forced.  If the sub par acting/writing on the mlitary side was replaced it could be a great show.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's fun and it does not have a lot of bugs. It never gets boring and it has lots of cool vehicles
B00A285OOW|5.0|It was a great sequel to The White Queen.  It does tend to move a bit slowly, but the detail and history Phillpa Gregory goes into makes it worth it!!! It made me want to read the next books in the history of the Tudors!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a very fun game to play on airplanes, your time run very fast, but buildings are a little bit expensive.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put it down. King has once again stuck true to form and delivered a timeless masterpiece. Like all of his books, King 's characters command attention as well as demanding that readers truly get to know them on an intimate level. Can't wait for a movie and will definitely read Doctor Sleep again.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Great way to pass the time. Not difficult and fun for the entire family. Get it while it's still free.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|had no problems with it worked really well for my kindle. i recommend it for other people who need an alarm in the morning.:)
B009P1WES6|5.0|It took a while to get into this book, but it is worth the effort because it is a great story that unfolds as you get deeper into the book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson did a good job of finishing the series.  The characters were done in a more mature and believable way that I very much appreciated.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|The good - some nicely challenging puzzles<br />The bad - once you complete it, there isn't another &#34;game&#34; to go to (?), or at least I haven't found a way to get to it.  Some of the puzzles are not well set up, making them a little frustrating to figure out, and since many of the puzzles have timers on them, this can be an issue<br />The ugly - I play this on my large Kindle Fire.  The touch screen is VERY VERY hard to get to work with some of the puzzles: what I touch with my finger is not what the game recognizes that I touch (I must have big fingers?)
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I love this game only thing i would say needs wrk is sometimes its hard to get the people to the tables but not to bad
B0064W667Y|5.0|Anybody who loves fables and fairy tales will love this graphic novel.  The colors are bright and vibrant and the story line is good.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love it! I think that this is one of her best songs yet.  I highly recommend downloading this one.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|You know the man! You know the content of the films! You know that it doesn't get much better than this!<br />A great set, currently offered by Amazon for $35, which is a steal! I bought the set back when it first came out for $55, and believe me, it was worth every penny at that price.<br />Besides superb transfers of all five films, with loads of extras, you get an extra DVD on Clint Eastwood, some movie art cards, an Inspector Callahan badge, a poster detailing Harry Callahan's grid search of San Francisco for Scorpio, and a small hardcover book containing numerous color stills from the films. Oh, and also a personal note from Clint Eastwood.<br />A beautifully packaged set, which looked like a real labor of love for whoever put it all together. I'd give it 10 stars if it was possible!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|What a great story with more twists and turns than any movie I've seen recently! GREAT screenplay! Great Acting (and actors)! What else can I say?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|SO addicting! Much more than I ever expected in a running game. I really can't believe it is a free game!I love it!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I loved the story dilemma of highly trained musicians using their art to help preserve the retirement community in which they lived.  The &#34;artiste&#34; personalities were wonderfully varied and believable--not a stereotype in sight.  Talented actors played flawed human beings but managed at the same time to make the characters sympathetic. A nice surprise was seeing the tribute paid to the artistic achievements of aged-but-living, highly gifted musicians.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This app has worked better than other FlipPix I have downloaded.  It's still not as detailed as I'd like to see.  I love this kind of puzzle and there are so few like it so I'll play as long as it works.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is a fun app to purchase, especially if you have a loved one in the service.  I would recommend this app.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Depend on Grisham for a good story and good characters!  The plot line turns and twists but comes out all right.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I use the Spider game nearly everyday.  I previously played this game on my computer and was happy to see it was available as an app for my Kindle.  I would recommend this app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I wondered why people rave about &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;.  I am on second season and understand the reason now.  This is a great show.
B00E8JZILA|1.0|This was a awful game spend your money on something that is good. I don't recommend this to anyone. Don't buy.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is really hysterical.  Tina doesn't take herself too seriously, but she also gets serious points across.  I loved reading this book and hearing about the female perspective of working in the corporate world, where there is still so much of a separation between genders.  Once again, she touches on this and shares her struggles in a funny and still impacting way.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I hate George R.R. Martin for what he has done to my emotions, that being said, all of the books of the Song of Ice and Fire have been life changing I can't wait for the rest, I hope they never stop coming.

B006TVQTHW|4.0|Being a lover of the original antec 300 case (did 4 different builds in them) I had to give the antec 302 a try.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />**Mini ITX, Micro ATX, Standard ATX Compatible<br />**Easily removeable side panels and front bezel<br />**Mounts for 6 x 120MM fans (2 front, 1 side, 1 rear, 1 behind mobo trey) and Mount for 1 x 140MM (top)<br />**Fan speed switches on back of case for included rear 120MM fan and top 140MM fan<br />**Watercooling Ready Rubber Gromet holes on top of case<br />**USB 3.0/USB 2.0 Ports, Mic Port, Headphone Port, all on front of case.<br />**8 expansion slot bays (most midtowers only have 7)<br />**Power Supply Filter at Bottom<br />**The Front 2 x 120MM fans mounts have a filter<br />**BIG BIG improvement on cable management (most of the wires can now be tucked behind the mobo trey<br />**Sideways Hardrive Bays (to allow up to 12.5\\" video cards)<br />**the 3.5\\" hardrive bays will hold up to 6 hardives and also use quick removeable rails (no more screws needed)<br />**the 3 x 5.25\\" Optical Drive bays are also screwless, simply slide them in and they snap into place.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />**1 of the SSD mounts is on the mobo trey (Really antec? Seriously? you have to remove the motherboard to change the SSD?)<br />**No cable management place to route a 8 pin motherboard plug for the cpu, this was the only cable I had to keep in front.<br />**120MM fan mount behind motherboard trey requires a low profile fan, if the fan frame is too thick it could hit the motherboard.<br />**8 expansion slot bay mounts are now on the outside of the case and requires removing a seperate bracket that covers all 8 slots before installing your cards. I found this to be big hassle.<br />**Included 120MM and 140MM fans are garbage, too weak, and only 2 speed. The 140MM fan actually started rattling on me after just a week of used as well. So I ended up using my 120MM and 140MM fans from my old antec 300 case that were 3 speed, they work better, andhave way better airflow.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Overall this is a nice case for the most part and I love that antec kept the classic 300 look and just did a redesign of the case frame. Just wish they included a 3.5\\" to 2.5\\" adapter for the SSD's instead of having a mount at the bottom and behind the motherboard trey, and also wish they kept the explansion slot mounts inside the case like they did on the antec 300.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This was a good movie. Do I believe that's was actually happened...HA...no. If you're into the, I didn't see that coming, action packed type movie....check this out....
B002RKSZS0|2.0|Not my favorite Jane Austen story.<br />I found it boring. Just not interesting enough to read or finish.<br />Do not recommend.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|Love it!!  This movie is one of my all time favorite. When ever I need a movie to watch this is the first one I go for!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Loved it although very sad I'm glad this was as predictable I saw the movie and everyone wants a happy ending!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Dixit Journey is a super fun game for all ages. I just received this as a birthday gift from a friend. I originally learned about Dixit from Geek & Sundry's Tabletop show. The big appeal of this game to me was how simple the gameplay was and the pretty illustrations on the cards. The concept is deceptively simple (a bit of a cross between Apples to Apples and Balderdash with pictures), but it presents the right amount of challenge because you have to think creatively about the clues you give. The object of the game is present a clue that is both vague and subtle because the active player receives no points if either everyone chooses the active player's card or no one chooses their card.<br /><br />I brought Dixit Journey to a game night where the age ranged from 20s-40s. I was a little weary if people would take to it easily because it is such a simple game with minimal stakes or instructions (it's just players voting on which pretty card they think matches the clue the active player gave), but everyone enjoyed the game immensely. Everyone admired the wonderful illustrations. From what I've gleamed, the illustrations on this set of cards is slightly darker in tone, but not terrifying or inappropriate for young children. There was seven of us, so there was one team of two. They murdered the rest of us. The collaboration and input of two minds probably helped their chances of coming up with great counter cards when it was someone else's active turn. Everyone was absolutely charmed by the game.<br /><br />The quality of the materials is also great. The box it comes in has this nice texture that makes it feel more sturdy. The cards are nice and big, so you can really examine the pictures. I noticed a lot of players during my game just staring intently at their cards while the active player chose their clue and card. I feel like I'm owning pieces of art, and I love possessing these sorts of interactive arts. The board is unlike your typical large square. It's a narrow rectangle. One half of the board has the point values for the little bunny tokens to stand on, and the other half explains the point system, which was incredibly helpful because point distribution is probably the most complicated element of the game (it's not convoluted, there are just a lot of points to go around).<br /><br />All in all, I feel this game is definitely worth its price tag. I can easily see how little kids could pick this up really easy, and how this would be a great game for speakers of any language (a picture is worth a thousand words in any language!). I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys board games and looking for something fresh and easy to bring to their game nights.
B00EPL4PBK|4.0|Great album, I enjoy most of the guitar solos and lyrics especially. I also like bonus track &#34;St. James&#34; as an addition.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Having lived in a small village when I was a little  girl,this show reminded me of all the<br />people,the eccentric ones,the two sisters who lived together,the person you went to<br />who had remedies for what ailed you., Once you got to know the characters it was<br />on to the next episode to find out what was going on in the lives and times of the people.<br />Great series  from BBC.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more in this series. I have really enjoyed all the books in this series thus far.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thank you so much for sending this so promptly. We enjoy having this in our library. Cannot wait until the new season!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Older people would appreciate the humor in this film.  The music was exceptional as was the directing and acting.  The script was not that compelling.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series continues to be very very good and well produced. Thank you for sending it so promptly. Will order again.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|When i'm feeling blah this movie makes me laugh. It's serious and funny. The combination of the two are my prescription for feel better!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I was inundated with advertisements so I purchased the $3.99 version which still shows ads!!! Letting me know someone who purchased this also purchased that ! On my kindle's home page, what is more. I have to find out how to delete it.
1932907009|5.0|Don't doubt picking this book up. You won't be disappointed. Best screen writing book you will ever read. Guarenteed! RIP Blake Snyder.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I dont like how it shows a criminal sex offender advertisment when playing this game. I dont need my 3 year old nephew staring at that and asking a bunch of questions.
B0010X758Q|5.0|This album will end up having a special place in my heart. First Vamp CD I ever bought. I needed to have it on vinyl and see how it hold up against the CD. And I am impressed. Sounds amazing. I recommend it more than the CD.<br /><br />Plus Ezra looks like an infant in the little polaroid picture where the lyrics are XD
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|Murakami describes the importance of running in his life, the balance it brings and the solitude.<br />It's easy to identify (as a runner myself) with the author's feelings on the sport.<br /><br />Also very interesting are his thoughts on writing, especially his approach to the profession.<br />I'm sure this book would appeal to both runners and non-runners alike,
B004D7GU3M|5.0|This came really quick. I think the quality is good. Not the best vinyl I have, but I dint buy it for that. Vinyl makes me connect more to the music. Flipping the record. dropping that needle. It's an experience.<br /><br />Devil in a dress sounds so yumm.<br />What a great price for a triple LP.
B004UID2LC|2.0|So damn frustrating when i wanna watch somwhing then it crashes and the app wont reopen. Need the real deal
B001B0G5WA|5.0|Again Capitol are doing such a justice to there remasters. This album made me fall in love with The Beach Boys and the art of collecting and listening to vinyl. This album is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Really wish they would re-release Smiley,smile. I would buy it in a heartbeat.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4! Lots of drama. Love the English accents, the characters, and the actors in this show.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 starting in January.  This is one of the best shows I have seen.  Can't believe they don't win Emmy awards.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I really enjoy this series, it's amazing! I'm reading these at the same time as the Dresden Files(which are also very good).
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|neither i nor my kid can keep up so i took it back off my kindle.<br />all in all ok
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Well, this is how she sounds when she's at her best, but she shouldn't make the mistake of calling it country though.  Hell, country don't even know what country is anymore, it's all a barrage of cookie cutter pop-rock, but Sheryl is right when she belongs, somewhere in the middle, closer to the rock, the way I like it! And so,to me, this album is like I just said in the last sentence, somewhere in between TNMC and her Self-titled 2nd release as far as sound, with a few tracks cutting a little too close to the old country sound(YIKES). A GREAT listen beginning to end though in my book!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This movie is action packed! Actually, if the pace wasn't so frantic, you'd probably take the time to notice the truck sized plot holes, and lack of character empathy development. I really liked that it kept me on the edge of my seat, but wanted a bit more from the story. I think zombie movies live and die by some examination of the human condition and this one circumvents that by always keeping on the move.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I am addicted to this game. The tutorial was very informative and made it very easy to understand how to play the game.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie for Star Trek fans and an excellent reboot of the original story.  Now I have my younger daughter hooked on the original series as well as this movie.  Looking forward to watching the new release with her as well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have and have read every book by Mr. King,,,this one is no exception! Good book and good story! Funny thing I have lived in Kennebunkport Port for awhile, been all over Maine, when my grandpa passed moved to Texas, wish I stayed in Maine! Anyway was never able to meet Mr. King or get an autograph,,, oh well, I still look forward to when he brings another book out!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Hope springs eternal.this is a very real and believable  story. You can't judge people by the way they look. Enjoyable read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is one great challenging game. It's so challenging. Worth your time and you want to keep going to beat all the other players
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy to set up and works well.  The only problem I have with it so far is there's not many programs you can stream to it.  I'd give it 5 stars if it just had Hulu+.  If you have a PS3, you can d/l the chromecast ap and get Netflix to work as if the PS3 was the Chromecast.
B0063M22QO|5.0|As a senior citizen it helps keep my mind active, I would recommend it to everyone for that reason.  Each time I play it becomes easier.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is absolutely nothing better on TV at this moment....Downton keeps us guessing and always surprises...Patiently waiting for season four.....
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|I have seen both Fright Night (s) and was really impressed with this one.  It was obviously not meant to be an exact or even a really close adaptation, but it was great! Very modern... I recommend it to anyone who liked the first one.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I am a big fan of fantasy and gotta say I this movie trilogy is one of my favorites. would highly recommend watching all three in one night like I did xD
B0073QQ3X2|5.0|the color is much vibrant than I thought, this product has a good realistic ratio in shape, very good details, also
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app has been a great help for backup alarm. Love that it. Would recommend it to others to use.
B0073RQMBY|4.0|the color is not as dark as it shown in the photo, the details are very fine. I think mine has a misshapen chin so it looks ridiculous when its mouth closes
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I have pure love for this book.  I felt like I was on this journey right along with her.  I laughed out loud and sobbed tears as well.  It is a beautifully written, insightful story of loss, learning about yourself, friendship and bravery.
B00005N6KG|1.0|For years my husband and I have bought each other these for Christmas every year because inevitably they lose sound in one year within 6 months to a year. That won't happen this year- $45 is too much to spend for such a dispensable product. Too bad too, because they are the only headphones I like to run in-- ear buds fall out and are annoying. Will have to find another product.
B001O03NCW|5.0|if you like the movie and liked the sound track, this is good.  I liked the music so i bought it
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|When I started the app it recommended starting with basic Spanish. Barely into the program and it starts throwing out words that weren't even covered yet. I have always wanted a program that would start off like you didn't know anything about the language and start from the beginning.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I loved and still do love it. I always wake up to the alarm and  I can also play my music. How cool.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read! Kept me turning pages quickly and kept me interested in the next turn off events. Highly recommended read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|AWESOME GAME!!!!<br /><br />Really entertaining and time consuming. Very very very excitingly I have learned alot from this game and really enjoy playing it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I don't have HBO so for the past few years I had not seen this show despite having heard A LOT about it.  I finally broke down and bought the first 2 seasons on DVD, and all I can say is WOW, it sucked me in from the very first episode and would not let me go until I'd finished Season 2!  And then I immediately had to start watching it all over again for a second time!  This show has to be the most epic show ever produced for television.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Game of Thrones (GOT), it's a cable TV show based on an as-yet-unfinished fantasy book series by author George R.R. Martin.  It's set in a fantasy world similar in many ways to our own world during ancient Medieval Times in England and Europe.  The notable exception being that dragons, zombies, shapeshifters, witches, warlocks and black magic exist in the fictional GOT world, though MUCH more sparingly than one might assume.  Dragons, zombies and magic seem to be rare and ancient things, almost lost and forgotten in the GOT world.  And their use in the story is handled very craftily and deftly, creating a rare mystique and uniqueness to these often overused fantasy elements.<br /><br />The content is very adult.  Like most dramatic cable TV series being made these days, it is a VERY adult show, with full-frontal nudity and graphic sex and violence.  So not really the kind of show you can enjoy with the family necessarily.  I have no idea why HBO doesn't put out an adult version and a family-safe version.  Seems with some editing and creative camera work, they could easily do both versions.  But for whatever reason they don't.  Nowadays, cable TV is a lot more \\"adult\\" than theater movies are.  Oddly, the adult content paradigm has completely switched around--the \\"bad stuff\\" now being more on TV than in the movies.  But honestly, the adult content in this show is a relatively small aspect of the show.  Concerning, yes, for families and possible underaged viewers, but it shouldn't dissuade the average adult viewer from seeing this truly remarkable show.<br /><br />The story in GOT is both simple AND exceptionally intricate--opposing comments, I know.  But that's how well this show-based-on-the-books is written.  The writing is spectacular.  At its core, a simple act in the first episode (a boy seeing something he shouldn't) leads to the unraveling of a tenuous peace between three ruling families on an island continent.  Mysteries, deceit and treachery are slowly spun and uncoiled, hidden truths are revealed, and soon the entire continent is building towards a war over a multitude of reasons.  That is a very simple assessment of a VERY complex and extremely engaging story.  But trust me, how it all unfolds is VERY entertaining and fun.  And the story doesn't pander to the audience at all.  In numerous cases I expected the story to go one way and it went the completely opposite way.  So the show challenges the viewer on many levels and is never afraid to pull the rug out from under our feet or add even MORE ongoing characters and storylines to its vast tapestry of epic storytelling.  Again, it all adds to the delicious fun of watching this hugely elaborate story unfold.<br /><br />The cast is enormous and the acting across the board is brilliant at all levels.  And Peter Dinklage in particular is phenomenal.  He stands out even among a cast of spectacular actors.<br /><br />The sets and wardrobe are jaw-dropping.  I've never seen sets or costumes as great as these on any TV show ever.  I don't follow the Emmys, so I don't know if this show has won any yet, but buckloads of Emmys should be rained down on the folks behind these sets and costumes.  We viewers greatly appreciate your hard work and your genius!<br /><br />The editing and camerawork are seamless, beautiful, perfect.  Same with the VFX.  And the exceptional soundtrack.<br /><br />But does all this make it my favorite HBO series?  No.  The Sopranos and Rome are still my all time favorites, but this showis a very close third.  And it's still FAR from over.  The series could end up running for a total of 7 to 10 seasons, so who knows where it will rank by the time it's over.  It might end up being my top fave.<br /><br />One thing's for absolute sure, I can't wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD!
B005ZUR724|5.0|One of the best mmo rpg portable games I have ever played so much fun enjoyable gameplay beautiful graphics loads of monsters dungeons lands and mounts it is Amazing and q great game I think u should definitely try it at least once
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I love the new crew. Great idea to go back to the original crew from the tv series. I hope they make more.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Who knew that the CIA had so much going?  Really paints a negative picture of the way we elect our governing officials.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought the book because it had 4 stars, and I  needed to download a book to my second tablet so see if the tablets synced. I knew it was BSM but started the first few pages and it read as if a high school student had written it. Just amazing a book could be so poorly written, cliched, holy crap, just save your money.Go on line, and read the summary/  I wouldn''t be reading a book from the New york Times best seller list again soon.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think that this book was written in the  most brilliant way. It had so many definitions of the things that I needed. This was a really good book.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Every time I try to use it, it says that &quot;it's taking a little longer than  it should. Please fix the app so I can use it.
B008133MDK|3.0|The writing and acting are above average, but Cumberbatch's Sherlock is weak compared to a number of others (Rathbone, Brett, Roxburgh). Freeman's Watson is a much more engaging character. Worth a look though.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|BBC did not run this series long enough.  It had action, humor, character development, everything you would want in a fantasy/science fiction show.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the second- Adventure from these guys that I have played (I also played Abyss) I really enjoyed this game. The storyline was interesting, the graphics excellent, and the puzzles intriguing (not ridiculously hard but not too easy either) They have many adventure games so I don't know which one I will play next but I will definitely play another.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is easy but enjoyable--stress free. The pictures are cute. I find this to be relaxing and a good way to pass some time at doctor's office.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I have still not figured out how to make this item work.  There is nothing easy about it.  Will have to get some help in order to actually use it.  I would not recommend it unless you are extremely good with computers.  Not good for the average user.
B009MYARIK|4.0|If you were the older sister, how responsible would you feel for your younger sibling? Having lost your parents and raised your younger sister, you would feel motherly toward her and responsible for seeing that she does not make irreparable decisions with her life. This is Fliss's dilemma.<br /><br />Lottie has a history of romance entanglements that end in frustrating break-ups. She also has a history of making rash decisions after each break-up which months later, she regrets. This last break-up is no different. Richard just wanted to continue the way they were, Lottie was already preparing to choose her wedding gown.<br /><br />Enter Ben. Lottie and Ben have not seen each other in 15 years. Their love affair during their college gap year has left memories that have endured due to the unique passion and, let us face it, mythical fantasies of the mind. In only takes one meal, a few drinks, and a spontaneous proposal to push Lottie into an entertaining chase to wed and consummate her marriage.<br /><br />As any responsible about to be divorced sister would do, Fliss must stop this wedding. Fliss wants Lottie to avoid making the mistakes she herself has made in life. If unable to stop the wedding, she must at least prevent consummation so an annulment will be possible. The story develops from here as a madcap chase and devious scenarios to prevent the newlyweds from consummating their \\"love\\". Unlikely allies such as Ben's financial adviser (Lorcan), Richard (yes, he misses Lottie and cannot live without her), and Noah (Fliss's seven year old son) make this an unforgettable and delightful story.<br /><br />These women are at times on steroids hysterical. Although I think this story would have benefited from a strong editor, if you can overlook these parts of the story, you will find laughter and enjoyment as the chase ensues and the frustrated newlyweds try to become creative in their endeavors to consummate.<br /><br />originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
B008JFC6F0|2.0|I definitely expected more out of this CD. It has too much noise and not enough talent. Don't waste your money!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Enjoyed it!  I really like the casting.  No the directing & editing make it a fast paced action packed movie
B00E9P959O|5.0|I could just stop there, but I guess that's not very helpful.  I haven't held this baby in my hands yet, but listening in the cloud as I write this.  I'm loving Amazon's Autorip as I get to listen to my cds even before they arrive.  And for this release i just couldn't wait.<br /><br />Being a huge fan since '80, I anticipated the original release of this LP since it came after a long gap and a near break up of the band.  I think I was like most fans, in that I was so happy for a new release, I was more than willing to overlook the albums muddy and busy mix.  Don't get me wrong, the sound never affected my enjoyment of the songs, because they were great songs.  \\"One Little Victory\\" may be the best opening track of a Rush album (certainly up there with the chestnuts Spirit of Radio and Tom Sawyer) and it just shouts: \\"WE'RE BACK!\\" both lyrically and sonically.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see if this remix version generates any controversy as I think most people hate when artists tinker with their work (movie directors being the worst offenders of this), but in the case of Vapor Trails, I think it's most appropriate.<br /><br />And the result is pretty amazing (especially on headphones).  I found myself smiling  throughout most of my first listen as instruments jumped out and just shined!  It's clearer, brighter, crisper (I could go on forever) and just fantastic.  OLV, Ghost Rider, Peaceable Kingdom, Vapor Trail, Earthshine (flat out fantastic sounding!), Nocturne - okay - the whole darn album.  The crispness of Alex's solos, that fat base sound (yet clear and crisp too!) and I could swear that Neil re-did the drum parts - just amazing!  it's also some of Geddy's best singing - which now sounds even better!<br /><br />For this Rush fan, I'm more than pleased!  i could go on but i won't.  Just one  last aside:  if you didn't get to see the Clockwork Angels tour the upcoming BluRay/DVD release is your chance to see one of the best tours of their career (it's out Nov 2013).

B008Y212PI|5.0|Lots of fun. So glad I got this app. The pics are great to watch come together with the puzzles.l
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Unusual for Grisham the pieces of this story don't always fit together.  A couple of times I came across errors showing little research in the way things work.  Characters weren't plausible and not well developed.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Very we'll done. It was very futuristic like it should be. No major complaints. I really liked this Star Trek film.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|It's supposed to be a spoof, but the thinking is frightening and the characters are pretty close to the real thing. Even Dr. Strangelove is dead on for Henry Kissinger who wrote the nuclear war strategy.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|It was good overall. Just wish there was more of a closure in the end. It also felt as if it was just focusing on one big event to the next.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|If you like Neil, this is the perfect album with Neil's greatest hits, his unique voice and guitar style are a pleasure
B00F5FBE82|4.0|Drake came out with a solid album, but I wish he would have left out some of the featured artists like 2Chainz....terrible.<br /><br />All in all, I would suggest you purchase the album.
B0033AX1YG|5.0|Gary Moore was one of the greatest guitarist ever. He certainly passed too early. You won't believe how fast his fingers work !!!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The story is very dark and deep. The acting was just amazing. Beyond amazing. I think this group could have turned any story into a masterpiece!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|So far,it is interesting.  I will try to read the rest of them.  Hopefully being a government employee, I'll have time to do it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book for King fans! I have not read the Shining in 30 years but was immediately brought back into the story through Stephen Kings masterful writing.  The new story unfolds so quickly and King did a splendid job of weaving the past and current story lines  together.  I enjoyed the shocks and twists and really cheered for the good guys.
B00BBYZ14E|4.0|Of course this classic is a great read!  Nice to read a classic that i have not read before, you should read it.
B000THCFA2|5.0|Consumers or real hip hop already know what to expect from this.  No disappointment here.  Recognized a few beats from some of my favorite tracks from other albums.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Really enjoyed this film.  It was often over the top and a little unbelievable at times, however, it was full of action and had a really interesting plot.  It was not quite as good as 28 days later, but still very very good!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it, but am absolutely stuck on level 5. Are there tips to be found anywhere? I don't want to cheat...just get a little help.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Enjoyed this film. It was a little cheesy at times, however, it was very sweet.  It was nothing out of this world but definitely enjoyable.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Would like more info on what I am actually doing. What are each pieces capabilities? I just muddle around, not knowing what I am really doing.
1885167776|5.0|In my work with leaders and individual contributors who attempt to \\"do more with less\\" there is often a lack of focus.  Many maintain the belief that they can successfully multitask which often results in additional loss of effectiveness.  Keller and Papasan have done an outstanding job of presenting practical steps to focusing on \\"the one thing\\" and increasing personal and professional effectiveness and efficiency.  I also found the use of data helpful.  For example, how often we are interrupted, how long it takes to recovery, truth v. \\"truthiness,\\" creating habits, the role of mindsets, and much more.<br /><br />AS far as I am concerned, this is another \\"must read\\" book!<br /><br />Ed Nottingham, PhD, PCC<br />Consulting & Clinical Psychologist<br />Author, [[ASIN:0595141684 It's Not As Bad As It Seems]]

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has always been a favorite of mine.  Now I get too see my children enjoy the same book, reading it straight through from start to finish.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The slow reveal of the bigger picture made this book absolutely captivating. Great job in creating a bizarre world that is both human and alien. WOW.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Program crashes after title screen on my nexus 7 2013. Clean restart does not help. My Nexus 7 is a recently parched 2013 model.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like that the story kept me wanting more like a good story should. I wanted to see what would happen next, it was never redundant or boring. I watched the entire season in a week flat (which is impressive for me because I'm very busy). I needed the laughter this added to my day. Phenomenal show!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is my first time reading this author.  At first glance when you read the title it sounds like a husband's dirty little secret, but oh how it's totally nothing you could ever imagine.  Kept me guessing until the end.  Characters are people you can totally relate to making the plot totally believable.  Can't wait to read another one of her books.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. Did not want to put it down until I was done!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game. Best puzzle game I havev played yet. Very addictive. Finished all levels already. Please add more levels!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I like the app but I don't like how it ask every time I open it if I want to upgrade.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This mp3-player app works so much better than that stupid i-Tunes from Apple! It doesn't control your life as i-Tunes does!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This is movie is just as great, if not better, then the first movie. I say that, because I personally didn't care for the second one very much. Nonetheless, this one more than makes up for it, and was great! I bought it the week that it came out, and have watched it a few times now. If you are a fan of either of the first two movies, add this one to your collection. It won't disappoint.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I got quickly tired of all those Angry Bird apps! You play one and you played them all! I no longer play the stupid app!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the book ! It was amazing I couldn't put it down. The ending, the ending couldn't have been better !!! This book makes you look at life in a different way, a better way.

B00B7NPRY8|5.0|What is unique about Herbert is his ability to weave not just a good story, but an entire multi-world government with its own levels of social and intellectual strata.  Herbert asks what the world would be like in a thousand years or so, then fast forwards far past that.  This first novel asks the question, \\"What would happen if a leader were chosen for all the right reasons?\\"  Galactic peace?  Hardly.  His attention to detail and his characters' ability to observe the slightest minutiae in others adds verisimilitude to an almost unbelievable universe, and certainly keeps the pages turning.

B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a little to raw & graphic for me however, it did have a good story line. It kept me reading to the end!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A beautiful story of young love and great loss.  Touching in moments, yet tearful in others.  Something every young adult should read.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|I really like HAIM, and the amazing drive of the drummer is such a huge part of it. Too bad that it seems that most of the songs are recorded with a drum machine, (and some with some added cymbals and percussion recorded on top?). As a result, the energy of the live gigs disappeared a little more than it should have.
B00000BKDV|5.0|THE BAND:<br />Bruce Dickinson- Vocals (Amazing vocalist with a unique voice)<br />Steve Harris- Bass (Arguably the best heavy metal bassist around)<br />Adrian Smith- Lead/Rhythm Guitars (Great melodic, bluesy solos)<br />Dave Murray- Lead/Rhythm Guitars (Great shredding solos)<br />Nicko McBrain- Drums (Awesome drummer)<br /><br />THE TRACKS:The album contains literature quotes, songs about famous books/movies fusioned in great heavy metal sound.Masterfully produce and mixed by Martin Birch<br /><br />-Where Eagles Dare:Repeats the story of the same-titled Clint Eastwood movie.The song starts out with a pulse-like, emotional beat, and is followed by a heavy and catchy (although predictable) riff.The drumms sound amazing<br /><br />-Revelations:This song starts out with a hymnal passage of some sort.Is an atmospheric song, that manages to be both dark and beautiful. Bruce's performance here is amazing.<br /><br />-Flight of Icarus:The most emotional song of the album,that was so good that people that are not into metal at all tend to like it very much.The pre-chorus/chorus kind of runs together in an awesome display of underlying bass<br /><br />-Die With Your Boots On: This song is probably the one that suffers the least from the hard-rock guitar.Good lyrics,amazing drums, the vocals(Harris and Smith do some nice backup, by the way)are among the best,and even the guitar is unique in this amazing song.<br /><br />-The Trooper:This is one of my favorite Iron Maiden songs ever.The call-to-arms opening riff and the galloping bass lines fit so well with the lyrics of a soldier's futile battle that it brings shivers to my spine almost every time.<br /><br />-Still Life:Is one of the songs that most benefits from double guitars.The chorus are simple, but don't deny the power this song holds over your ears!<br /><br />-Quest For Fire:The most anachronistic song of the disc.The voice of Dickinson reaches the high notes of all the album.<br /><br />-Sun and Steel:Other great song,incorporate some galloping rhythms into it, which is always a plus for me.<br /><br />-To Tame a Land:In the grand tradition of epic closers.It's based off of the book \\"Dune,\\" which I haven't read.

1476727651|5.0|I read this on my Kindle.  I usually buy the hardcover of Mr. King's books because part of my pleasure in reading his works are the hefty tomes. I enjoyed Dr. Sleep, couldn't put it down. This past weekend, the laundry didn't get done, meals were hurried and the television was silent (in full disclosure, the laundry didn't get done because I was too chicken to go in the basement by myself; you all know how that feels). I disagree that this book was not scary. I liked this book as much as The Stand, It, Pet Sematary, and his magnum opus, The Dark Tower (just to name a few).
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Many sounds to choose from with nice visual interface. Seamless loops and effective dream state helps. Upgrade with it but great as free app too!
B00F91H666|3.0|interesting plot...  a mix between  The  Walking  Dead and I am  Legend ...   perhaps not the best Brad Pitt's  movie  but I  enjoyed it...
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|The smooth, silkly, sultry sound of AJ's golden V-chords are so appreciated in the Blue Grass genre<br />of country. He is country! His voice is a gift to us! A must have in any country collection!!!<br />Thank you Alan!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Chrome Cast.  Anything I can watch on my computer, tablet, smartphone- can be sent to the TV for viewing on a bigger screen.  I've had mine for a few months now and watch everything for free.  Some images have better quality than others but I've found that most of the companies who transmit via the internet will be adding the chrome cast option for their signals- just like Red Box, Hulu, You Tube, etc.  The setup was easy as plugging the 'thingamajig' into the tv and clicking a few links on the computer and it has worked tirelessly for the past few months.  I watch all the NFL games, Baseball Games, etc for free! As well as the network stations and anything else I can find online.  The Chrome Cast is a big hit here at home and worth the $$$ at twice the cost.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|I totally loved Sarah's first album for its freshness and the fact that so many of my acoustic music heroes appeared to accompany her. The second album had a few strong selections, but was a few notches below her first. If you love her voice and want see a real step forward, this album does the job.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|In true Phillipa Gregory Style, a fascinating historic novel, very well told! Beautifully written, beautiful story line. Highly recommended. But do read the red queen and the white queen before reading this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The graphics for this game are amazing. Play is easy, and both of my kids (6 & 9), as well as myself, love to play it. It gets played at least once a day. If you like the Temple Run series, you'll like this game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book a good story some surprises that I didn't see coming would recommend anyone to read it
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story make no sense. The kid got less than a week training and then he got to patrol the wild with the king son? What the heck? He was proclaimed to be a member of the royal family and is still being treated like sh..t? He warned the king of being poisoned and knock the drink to the ground and he is now in the dungeon? What the heck?
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I think that the app Magic 2014, is a great app except that it takes up so much space on my device.  If they could make it take up less space and maybe cost money it would be perfect.  (At least for me)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I flew through this book in a matter of hours, and my heart ached for days afterward. I fell in love with John Green's wonderfully quirky characters. Beautifully tragic love story. I read this months ago, and just thinking about it to write this review, the ache in my chest is returning!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|This book came highly recommended and i found it so predictable and boring. i wanted to stop reading after 30 pages, but was encouraged to continue and still felt completely deflated when i finally finished reading. It took me very long to read because i did not enjoy it and in my opinion a never to read again. Has put me off the author too. don't waste your time.
0920668364|5.0|This book is magical. Every time I read it, I cry. I bought it for my son. I thought it was fitting.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|The book really is quite good and not as melodramatic as the Netfilx version.The author's style is deliberate and leave the reader with much insight as to just how dull prison life can be : boring,and uneventful place to spend even one week at. This is made abundantly clear by the very intelligent, Smith a college graduate who was a minor drrug money currier several years before her arrest . The wheels of justice can grind very fine and slowly. It was almost 10 years following her initial arrest,before her trial,conviction and 13 month sentencing .<br />The book is a good read,kinda describing just how dull and uneventful a prison life can be,sending a great message to those of us who never want to wind up at a place like  The a Federal Prison .at Danbury Ct.Soon to be change to Alabama that would make the experience possibly less boring,but also a far ore dangerous place to be incarcerated . Or some State prison that usually make the Federal prisons look like a country club<br />DMS

B000TEPKS4|5.0|This is a nice remastered edition of one of my favorite albums with the bonus of some interesting out takes.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I can't say enough about this book...There is no such thing as coincidences or accidents...This book will wake you up to a new reality....Once you begin to control your THOUGHTS, you will then begin to control your REALITY....
B00DWOUY3Y|5.0|First off, check your collection. All but one of these (OTELLO 1940) have already been released on CD labels. The 1940 OTELLO has the same cast, by the way, as the Dec 1938 broadcast (Rethberg, Martinelli, Tibbett). These are on the same sound as the previous ones and don't have any added tracks or Milton Cross. So the choice will depend on how many you have and how badly you want the 1940 OTELLO.<br /><br />Second, the remasterings here are all of the first order. No Cross commentaries but, for example, the FALSTAFF is better than any prior remastering.<br /><br />The choices are mostly great although I'd have opted for the 1968 RIGOLETTO rather than the 1945 broadcast and either the 1943 or 1955 BALLO in place of the 1940 one here. Don't get me wrong. These are superb performances (especially since Bjoerling is in his prime) but both the 1940 BALLO and the 1945 RIGOLETTO have been available in equally good sound on several CD labels over the past decade or so and most collectors interested in these performances already have them. If not, you're in for a treat. Just as a side note, I'd probably have opted for an ERNANI with del Monaco (1956) or Bergonzi (1962) rather than this NABUCCO which, while good, pales next to either performance of ERNANI. But, then, we collectors are never satisfied are we?<br /><br />One note is that the packaging is as bad as in the Wagner sets with tight-fitting paper envelopes instead of jewel cases. Surely someone at Sony could've come up with something more durable.<br /><br />Sony has an annoying habit of withdrawing successful CD sets so grab this while you can - or see outrageous prices for it on Amazon later.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone and anyone who believes or does not even believe that your thoughts create your reality.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I do not think I will ever look at rvs the same again. And if I see a woman in a t shirt that says ask me about my grand kids , I am running.Scary stuff. I like how everything ties together in the end. And little Danny gets a good ending.Nice to know what happened to him. As a reader there are some characters you get attached to. And he was one.So thanks for this book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great series can not wait to go to the next one. Really well done, great author. Thanks!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|The dialogue, the actors, the set--it all comes together perfectly to honor the darn good story behind it.  And the Tyrion actor is worthy of the novel's most intriguing character.  He nails it on multiple levels.  A very pleasant surprise.  I had avoided watching it for some time because the story is so dark--but the series has found the right balance between darkness and light.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There is not one thing I did not like about these books! I am in love! Forever my favorite!<br />LOVE!
0316204366|3.0|I notice that at the date of this writing (1 October 2013) the Kindle edition cover describes this book as \\"the No 1 international bestseller\\". Since today is the date of first publication, even in the US (on paper - Kindle not out for 2 more days), and later still elsewhere, this can surely be no more than a confident prediction? Or is Gladwell so gifted he can see the future with 100% certainty?<br /><br />On the basis of similar supernatural foreknowledge, I predict the book will prove, in the tradition of his other bestsellers, very readable, but intellectually insubstantial. I'm not printing this prediction on the front of any books though and I'm modest enough to admit I could be wrong, pending an actual reading of the facts of the case.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A friend recommended this book, and I loved every minute of it!  I found it hard to put down.  Amazing (Amy)!!!!

0762449314|4.0|This little plastic guy was the perfect match for my TARDIS USB Hub (purchased elsewhere).  It stands at about the right height to be considered a companion piece and is a nicely detailed Dalek replica.  Since this was all I really wanted it for, I can't comment on the booklet that shipped with it as I haven't even looked at it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For the money I wasn't expecting a lot, but have been happily surprised.<br />Its small size is nice for storage, but it performs well. I have sharpened both steel and carbide blades with it and performance was good for each.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|way too dark to see all hidden objects. not as respond shiver to touch  as it should be. needs more. variety than just searching for objects. graphics are very nice.
B0041T52S6|5.0|One of my daughter's favorite movies. We have seen it many times but didn't own it so well worth the price to buy a copy.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|Yes that's what I said...you may ask, who is Fanny??  Well, Fanny were the first all-female rock & roll band signed to a major label (Warner/Reprise) back in the late 60s.  Hearing Haim's long-in-the-works debut album, \\"Days Are Gone\\", I was grinning from ear-to-ear!!  Vocally, the Haim sisters reminded me a LOT of the Millington sisters of Fanny...but without sounding retro in the least.  They have 80s and R&B influences galore, but not a pastiche.  If anything, and this is exciting, it's like the Haim sisters took synthetic 80s pop music and translated it to be played organically, as if they were in the 70s So-Cal Laurel Canyon scene.<br /><br />The tunes are catchy-as-hell but not formulaic...they sure know what they are doing.  I am not surprised the UK took to em first...they don't sound American really...they sound like Brits or Swedes IMITATING 70s So-Cal female American bands but with an 80s Euro approach...<br /><br />The songs are fresh, enticing, and exciting...now I want the 2CD import on Polydor/Universal UK with 2 B-sides, a live track and a slew of remixes!!<br /><br />Fave new band by far!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So far, the Chromecast has been extremely useful in my apartment with 5 roommates and two TVs.  It works excellently with Netflix and YouTube after the initial setup (very simple and quick).  The quality is great and can be changed from 720p high bitrate to 720p low bitrate or 480p in order to accommodate slower connections.  Tab Casting works relatively well, but is dependent on having your computer do the streaming (rather than from the server end in the case of Netflix, YouTube or Play Store).  Can't wait to have other services such as HBOgo and whatnot join in.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is really fun and a great way to spend some extra time. Ai enjoyed every minute of it.
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|Phenomenal song writing - you get so addicted to her voice that you forget you're even listening to electronica. PLus who doesn't love the scottish?!
B00DB2JQ7W|4.0|Once again, the Mule puts a little twist on their latest release...a duplicate album with guest vocalists! OK, pretty cool...they got some good singers, some great, like Glenn Hughes, Myles Kennedy, Steve Winwood and Dr. John. Great choices there! I'm not familiar with any of the others other than Elvis Costello, who was ehh...OK, on his performance. So that was a cool, novel idea for the Mule to do that, and it's REALLY cool that they kept the cost down to what you would pay for just the first CD! :-) In all honesty, if they had offered the 2-CD version as a \\"Deluxe\\" version for more money, I probably wouldn't have bothered with that and would have just gotten the \\"pure\\" Mule version single-disc version instead. Warren handles the vocal department just fine by himself! :-)<br /><br />The material, for me, was overall good with only 2 or 3 clinkers. Scared To Live...another reggae song..ugh. But that's just me...it was well done, if you like the occasional Mule reggae diversion. Another I didn't care for that much was Done Got Wise, which features a slide guitar riff that just sounds weird. And then Danny Louis repeats the same kind of riff using a horn section sound on keyboard. John Paul Jones did the same thing on a Zeppelin tune on Houses of The Holy (I think it was \\"The Ocean\\" can't remember offhand for sure). But I'll cut Jones some slack because it was harder to get good synthesized horn sounds back then...lol! I guess Warren and Danny were just clowning around, but it definitely isn't a cool sound, IMO...and toward the end they go crazy with that slide-up-and-down thing, which results in a real mess! Okaaaaaayyyy....<br /><br />The other song I didn't care for that much was Funny Little Tragedy. It sounds like a Smithereens song from the 80's. Not very Mule. And when I heard the guitar solo, I thought, what the heck is Warren doing?? Then upon another listen, I heard Warren shout out, \\"Danny Louis!\\" right before the guitar solo...oh, OK, so it's Danny playing the solo, now I get it...lol! It was pretty cool in a way, kind of punkish, and Danny's a great musician, so I'm sure the non-virtuosic performance of his solo was intentional...lol. Just not my kind of music...<br /><br />Bring On the Music...what a great song! Definitely the best song on the CD! The other songs were pretty good, but some were a bit monotonous and groove-oriented. I myself prefer the big, hard-rocking guitars and songs of past Mule albums like High And Mighty and of course the 90's albums. For those who like a multitude of musical genres equally, this CD sure fits the bill. I'm just more narrow-minded than that...lol!<br /><br />One of my minor complaints about the Mule's last CD was a lack of jamming, mainly Warren tearing it up on guitar solos...fortunately, there is plenty of that on this CD, so I was stoked about that. Just a few too many easy-going songs and not enough hard rockers is my main gripe on this CD.<br /><br />So overall, not exactly a repeat of the Mule's old stuff, music-wise, but good stuff nevertheless...<br /><br />EDIT 10/6/13: What? Only one unhelpful vote? Where's the rest of the Amazon Non 5-star Review Death Squad? LOL!<br /><br />EDIT 10/15/13: After multiple listens to Shout! just to make sure I had my assessment of it down, I decided to throw in the Mule's Life Before Insanity CD (from 2000) into my stereo just to \\"reset\\" my overall perspective. Holy crap...Life Before Insanity never sounded so good!...lol! Let's face it...the old Mule demolishes Shout!...sorry. How any long-time Mule fan could possibly claim that Shout! is the best Mule CD since Dose is WAY beyond me...there is no comparison!! I'll leave my review as 4 stars, but I'm being generous here.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|great album, start to finish. It doesn't sound all like her singles so you really have to like her voice not just what's catchy.
0767817478|5.0|I don't get the flack Roland Emmerich's \\"Godzilla\\" (1998) receives. The criticisms come in two forms or a combination: (1.) Godzilla purists complain that the monster is different than the one in the classic Godzilla movies, and (2.) others complain that the film is what it is -- a story about a 200-foot tall dino-lizard attacking New York City.<br /><br />As far as the first point goes, so it deviates from the Japanese Godzilla, so what? The hailed 1982 version of \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" deviated a lot from (creator) Robert E. Howard's version but that didn't stop people from loving it. Or how about \\"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan\\" (1984), how faithful was that to Burrough's book? \\"Godzilla 1998\\" is an American re-interpretation, what's the big deal? Besides, the behemoth as depicted in the 1954 original \\"Godzilla\\" was actually cute. The last time I saw that film it was impossible for me to take Godzilla's attack seriously -- he was too cute! In other words, the filmmakers HAD to change the monster's look to make him more threatening-looking. As for the second point, this is a film about a giant lizard attacking a city, why would anyone expect \\"Ghandi\\"?<br /><br />My title blurb calls this the \\"king of the monster movies\\", and so it is! However, the tone is more akin to Indiana Jones than the ultra-serious vibe of, say, \\"Aliens\\" or \\"War of the Worlds\\". Remember the scene in \\"Jurassic Park\\" where the T-Rex chases the vehicle? \\"Godzilla\\" has a similar scene except that the monster is 200-feet high rather than 20-feet. Remember the great velociraptor scenes? \\"Godzilla\\" has similar scenes except that there are a couple hundred creatures rather than just a few. In short, \\"Godzilla\\" is like \\"Jurassic Park\\" on total overdrive. This may make it less realistic, but it's arguably more entertaining. In my opinion it is: although the dinosaurs in \\"Jurassic Park\\" are great, the story isn't that compelling and the characters are weak. \\"Godzilla\\" by contrast has more drive and a better cast.<br /><br />Speaking of the cast, Matthew Broderick plays the likable protagonist, Maria Pitillo his wannabe-reporter girlfiend, Hank Azaria a photographer, Jean Reno a French military officer intent on destroying the monster, Kevin Dunn the American colonel in charge of the New York operations, Michael Lerner the mayor of New York and Lorry Goldman his aide. The latter two amusingly spoof Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel evidently because these critics trashed Emmerich's previous two films (and I agree that \\"Independence Day\\" was lame).<br /><br />Speaking of Roger Ebert, he of course gave \\"Godzilla\\" a very low rating (1.5 Stars) and criticized it like so: \\"Going to see \\"Godzilla\\" at the Palais of the Cannes Film Festival is like attending a satanic ritual in St. Peter's Basilica. It's a rebuke to the faith that the building represents.\\" But isn't this the same same guy who gave 2005's \\"King Kong\\" a perfect rating? What's strange with this is, as cartoony and unrealistic as \\"Godzilla\\" is, \\"King Kong\\" is at least three times worse in this regard; in fact, it's like a live-action Road Runner cartoon (Remember that moronic brontosaurus stampede sequence? Or how about the scene where one guy shoots the big bugs off another guy with a machine gun? You can't get any more stoo-pid). And yet Ebert praises \\"King Kong\\", but \\"Godzilla\\" is supposedly a terrible film. Not only is this absurd, since \\"Godzilla\\" is the better film, but it reveals a double standard. Maybe Ebert is good buddies with Peter Jackson, who knows?<br /><br />Broderick and Reno shine here and the rest of the cast are effective. The weak point is the women. Maria Pitillo is a quality female protagonist, very cute, but the filmmakers don't do enough with her. Vicki Lewis plays a scientist but her role is very minor. And Arabella Field's role is even smaller (although that's not necessarily a bad thing since her character is so annoying). Needless to say, weak job on this front.<br /><br />The film alsohas an entertaining soundtrack, including some \\"Kashmir.\\"<br /><br />FINAL SAY: \\"Godzilla\\" is just a great turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast flick. It has the fun air of Indiana Jones and The Mummy films. It takes the concept of a giant monster attacking a city and goes totally over-the-top, but not to the ridiculous extent of Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" cartoon. Lastly, if you think the only menace to the city is the 200-foot tall creature, you're wrong!<br /><br />The film runs 139 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: A-has an entertaining soundtrack, including some \\"Kashmir.\\"<br /><br />FINAL SAY: \\"Godzilla\\" is just a great turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast flick.

B00BK5D95C|5.0|The first time you hear it, it's almost too odd to handle but before you know it &#34;Breezeblocks&#34; is so ingrained in your head that you feel the need to have the entire album.  Every track is amazing. Taro, Dissolve Me, and Fitzpleasure are my favorites.

B00DYWKPAQ|2.0|Every now and then, radio is right. In the case of the mighty Kings of Leon, they seemingly -at least in my neck of the woods- are refusing to participate in the hype of radio play for \\"Mechanical Bull\\". It's all a cyclic irony for the Nashville foursome who seemed to have full come circle with their -lack of- radio presence, but for different reasons.<br /><br />Upon the release of \\"Come Around Sundown,\\" the band dipped more towards the soft-rock feel, I was left to take it or leave it and foolishly I became acquainted with the release. However, I was not willing to accept this is where the band had progressed towards permanently.<br /><br />When \\"Supersoaker\\" first hit the inter-webs, the excitement of a band nearly dead in the water from inner-turmoil who reportedly were returning to the sound they once proudly played had us all faithful, admit it. Sadly, the single came through as an extension of \\"Come Around Sundown\\". Nonetheless, the bland and disappointing sound left room for improvement, room for a return to their passion of folk rock, their passion of grit and grind, we were just going to have to wait.<br />While the second single, \\"Wait For Me\\" has a much more pleasant and melodic vibe, if I was in the mood for the Beach Boys, they have nearly 30 albums to choose from. And that's really the gripe here as the band has churned out an album full of drool meant more for your local contemporary mix station, rather than your college radio frequency.<br /><br />For example, songs like \\"Temple\\" should be renamed template, simply because the generic nature and hooks. \\"I take one in the temple,\\" the notes closed with Caleb's signature howl, only this time seems to induce an embarrassment for the lead vocalist as it takes on an egotistical tone. \\"On The Chin,\\" and \\"Work On Me\\" once again, have a defining and memorable melody, but just do not explore the raucous flow that has inspired most of us to purchase all six Kings of Leon albums.<br />\\"Family Tree\\" is more in the ilk of expected southern blues flavor and showcases KOL's more nonchalant talents, which is certainly a good thing. However, just as they have an opportunity to follow it up with some of that KOL raw tempo, they float back to the dreamy \\"Comeback Story,\\" which is not without its groove, but just doesn't have the signature bite we've all come to expect out of these boys.<br /><br />Amidst the pretentious over-produced tracks of easy listening alternative, there are some tracks that highlight their ability to be raw, such as \\"Tonight\\" which bellows and bluffs instrumentally more than it underscores lead man Caleb's pipes. Obviously, as a writer and appreciator of mostly indie music, the all holy radio play means very little to me. Nonetheless, it's certainly a watermark of the album's interest level and I would venture to liken this album to the exploits of Metallica's \\"St. Anger,\\" which promised a return to original passion and focus but failed miserably.<br /><br />Whether it was to mold the music around the monster-sized ego of one lead singer or it's just a \\"maturation\\" process, the Kings of Leon have fallen from grace with a second straight album of regressing blends. \\"Mechanical Bull\\" is in fact aptly titled, an automation of going through the motions.

B005CRQ3UC|5.0|I love reading this book to my son. He loves the animals an all the colors. This is a great bedtime book.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A nice twist on the fill in the squares genre. It is easy enough and challenging enough to keep your interest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Can choose which options you like. Good selection of options. Win games not impossible. Why not try it out yourself?
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. Keeps your mind thinking of multiple possibilities until you hit the correct answer  loved it!  Recommend it!  Get it!
B001MSMULG|4.0|I stumbled onto one of Daniels Silva's books recently. It was an absolute nail biter. I decided to come back and read the entire series. The answer is truly a master of intrigue. Highly recommended.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I purchased this movie for family movie nght.  I have notseen this in theatre while the rest of my family have.  I loved the clarity of the picture and the movie itself.  My husband enjoyed the move so much that he watched the movie three more times on his own.  The only draw back is that it doesn't have the special features.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading the books so far.  Dance continues the story and has definitely left me waiting for the next book in the series.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|A sure hit for the whole family.  Again, everyone in the family saw this in the theatre except me.  It was worth every penny.  I loved the picture quailty and the sound quality was excellent.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I am a huge fan of Philippa Gregory's books. I loved the Boyeln Girl and ever since then have been addicted to reading her books. This series that includes the White Queen and Red Queen is really good and well written but I was disappointed in the White Princess.The entire book is about the constant threat of another prince taking the thrown, Elizabeth getting pregnant....and then repeat the process over and over again. I typically love historical fiction, but I found myself not reading through this book as quickly as others which made me realize that I was not entertained by this one.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I loved the free version so much that I purchased the full version of the app.  This is more than just a dictionary.  It is an encyclpedia, thesaus, dictionary.  The home page is filled with interesting content.  My high school boys are always asking to borrow my kindle so they can you the dictionary for their school work.  They use it for spelling, vocabulary, and the thesaurus. I like the encylopedia feature and the home page activites.  I easily loose track of time when playing Words Within Words, and the Matching Words.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another winner from Grisham, this one keeps you engaged till the very last page. One might wonder why Max (Malcolm) suddenly decided to make a documentary and why he chose Nathan as his subject. But Grisham takes his own sweet time in building the plot and lets it unfold itself. Interesting and engaging stuff!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great book! Meets and exceeds all expectation of the author's norm. Captures all that family has to offer, inside and out

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a great book.  It assembles a lot of information into a concise and easy to understand format.  Having been familiar with many of the concepts already, this author presents a no-nonsense approach to implementing some pretty awesome experiments regarding our thinking.  It is good to be reminded of our own power.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I was pleased to find this movie at such a great price. My daughter is finally old enough to see it and would prefer no commercials. A great older movie, funny.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this is a very fun game with pretty pictures. many hours of play.tell your friends to get this game please
1401937519|2.0|I was anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended by Dr. Wayne Dyer, of whom I am a huge fan.  I found the book to be nothing surprising or new, but to also be unrealistic for most people.  I think it was a little judgmental in that she had a husband with a good job and no children, so she could just quit her job and only do what she wants to do, but most of us in the real world have financial responsibilities.  She makes it seem as if you are wasting your life if you do anything in life you don't really enjoy or find joy in doing.  Unfortunately, I have to work to help support my family and do not have the luxury of doing otherwise.
B0063M22QO|4.0|A lot of fun and plenty of challenge.  Really enjoyed the time playing and the ability to pause the game.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS-  hmmm- can't really call it a game.  It's more like a world-open the door and enter!  My 11 year old grandchildren and I entered the first time through and we had so much fun-then when they went home I entered alone and  yes,Mist and Riven are the only close examples soooo- CREATORS- PLEASE MAKE MORE!!!!!!!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I love this book thanks Rick Riordan your books are amazing keep making the movies you are amazing I like you Rick Riordan:).
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was very easy to read.  The instructions were clear, concise and simple to follow. I would recommend it to anyone needing help in self-publishing a book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Ms. Collins dealt with the relationships among the characters well. Her descriptions often evoked strong feelings on my part. Although, there were passages that felt like I had to plow through.  Sort of like filler.  Overall, really good story!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|One of the best Megadeth albums ever, remixed and remastered. How could anyone not love it? Absolutely blistering and stunning in every sense.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game great fun .not as easy as I thought need to think about  the next move<br />Very addictive
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Fast paced & well written. Wow! Super fast read, great twist & turns. Will make a movie blockbuster some day.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have tried several puzzle apps. No other apps have even come close to this one.  I really like how it is laid out.  The only thing I don't like is the app crashes at times and you lose any work you haven't saved.  I have tried a ton of jigsaw apps and this one is the best by far.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book will grab you and not let you put it down. The characters are worthy of your undivided attention.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|The constant reference to &#34;apart time&#34; annoyed me to death.  I feel like the character...actually the whole book was written from the point of view of a child or mentally disabled person.  The ending was anticlimactic and predictable.  Not sure why this was so highly rated.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This character is not very like able at the onset. Tends to grow on you as the read progresses. Overall a very nice read.
B004J4WL50|5.0|Unbelievable book.  Everyone should read this to inspire them with the spirit of giving.  Amazing story and anecdotes, it will make you think about the world differently.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|This record is excellent.  I can listen to it over and over again.  It's good, enjoyable rock music.  As a Gaslight Anthem fan I love it, but I would recommend those who have never heard of The Gaslight Anthem to check this music out as they may be fortunate enough to become a fan.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I have been using this amp for the last two weeks pretty much every day, and it is great. I've only charged the thing twice during that time (and it didn't run all the way out of the first charge, I just charged it anyway). It is perfect for what I use it for.<br /><br />Not many people have mentioned this in other reviews, so I will: I really like the way the amp was packaged. It was sent in a tin with some cellophane around it - once the cellophane was removed, the rest of the packaging is essentially a permanent case for the amp. It is compact and protects the amp well. I like when a company pays attention to a) how much garbage is generated as part of the packaging and b) protecting a product in the long-term with a well-made case of some sort.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Works pretty well.  I still enjoy shopping and buying from a PC but this app makes it very possible to do from your phone or tablet.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was really good and just down-right great! It was filled with good sometimes funny stories that make me proud to be an American.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Chris'  insight was wonderful and he does his best to tell not only his story, but the story of other wonderful soldiers he worked with. God Bless these hero's. Highly recommend this book.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Pretty good so far..just started it so I don't know too much about it just yet although it looks to be easy to play and understand
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is definitely a great game, you will not believe how fun and addictive this game is. I play it all the time and I love it, you can't stop playing. I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who loves addictive puzzle games.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Awesome book, very interesting and complex plots. Ve ry well written. I have enjoyed reading this book and I hope the saga continue.
B00E9P957Q|2.0|Read this part of the description carefully: \\"features each album presented in a wallet sleeve that faithfully reproduces the original artwork\\"<br />That is by no means the same thing they did with the 3 box sets of the earlier stuff last year.  These are thin paper sleeves with the external album artwork.  The other 3 boxes had what looked like miniature versions of the original gatefold covers and thin plastic sleeves protecting the disc itself.  Not as good as the zeppelin box set which also had the inside sleeve artwork but far better than this latest rush box.  I'm very disappointed and expected better for 40 bucks.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|Listed as \\"Horse Back\\" in the More section of the blu-ray: with the musical introduction it comes in at 37 minutes!<br /><br />You won't get this on the CD or DVD apparently and definitely not on the vinyl.<br /><br />The blu-ray sound is very good but according to some reviewers not as great as the (very expensive) vinyl.<br /><br />Decisions,decisions. (FWIW I opted for the blu-ray.)
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend's child and she loves it! It was shipped very quickly and was packed well. I love Amazon for shopping!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!!!! Great mix of romance and action with a HUGE twist in the end<br />this is a book everyone should read
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This was great when a girl at our work brought her daughter with her one day. She's a great little girl and so well behaved but I could see she was getting bored with coloring. I had my Kindle there, so I ordered this up and let her watch it. She was thrilled!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I LOVE these books!!! I love all of the chracters and everything about them!!! They are truly and utterly amazing!!!
B00C33M2EE|2.0|I was disappointed - I should have listened to the tracks before ordering....  Nowhere near as enjoyable as their other stuff.  Am looking forward to their Christmas collection.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Its Ok, but it should have a comment center. Otherwise its abit glichy but its Ok, Really!<br />I don't know why y'all are saying its a virus.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|Well packaged, on time, exactly as had been described. I love the movie, great dancing and a decent story. Definitely makes up for being a sequel.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I've loved all of Sanderson's books, but this one has probably been my least favorite. Not a bad book by any means, just not up to the level of his other stuff. I get that it's supposed to be more YA oriented, but I didn't find the characters terribly appealing/compelling and the dialog could have been better in places.<br /><br />I love that Sanderson is prolific, and I really get excited for anything he puts out, but this book felt like it wasn't given quite enough attention/polish. It felt like he had a great idea, knocked it out in a few drafts, and they shipped - There is greatness in there, they just didn't really find it. I don't know anything about the writing of it, that's just the impression i got.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be too critical - It's a good book with an interesting setting, and definitely worth a read - It's just not quite up to the (very high) standard of his other work. Cant wait for Words of Radiance! Keep 'em coming Brandon!
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Well packaged, on time, exactly as had been described. The movie itself is wonderful of course, great dancing and decent screenplay with a nice cheesy plot.
B00E9P959E|4.0|If you remember buying the original Vapor Trails when it came out in 2002, you remember that Neil Peart lost a wife and a daughter and was trying to pick-up the pieces of his life.  We were all thrilled about a new album, but the expectations were sympathetic and few were surprised that the original Vapor Trails was a bit of a disappointment.  Rush was wise to remix this album, as they really couldn't do much worse with it.  The result is that the remix is exactly what the original album should have been.  It sounds better, clearer, and simply more meaningful and interesting.  The remixes are not drastic, but really do change the feel of the songs, without destroying them.  For casual Rush fans who only know a few songs, this album is probably not going to wow you much.  But for die-hard Rush fans, this album is a glimmer of hope, and shows that Rush is indeed a progressive band, and they are always willing to give their best, even if it means admitting their mistakes.  Kudos.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Seems well packaged from the outside. Purchased as an early Christmas present for my dad so I have no idea the condition on the inside. No visible damage on the outside though
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but so far it's great! I'm absolutely fascinated by the complexity of this man.  A genius who is also fallible.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|For me this was a must read book.  Inspiring and motivating and cutting edge! Am definitely attempting the slow carb eating style.  The writing style is down to earth and engaging and hilarious at times.  Full of well researched ideas about diet and exercise. TED is most definitely O.C.D -- it works!

B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is challenging but fun. Glad to finally see a King game on the kindle. Now all we need is candy crush they I will have all my favorites.
B00FFVML74|5.0|Full disclosure, I really only watched this cause David Tennant was in it. When I realize Arthur Darvill was in it...well... that's just whipped cream, right? And then the story got me. Don't get me wrong. Tennant is tenaciously broody and damaged. And Darvill... well, I was ALL Thornbirding on Darvill's devastatingly passionate priest. But the story really shone through here. Powerfull performances all around. A really gutwrenching story and some inventive direction choices that keep you guessing, even if the ending is a little weak. So, final word, watch for the man candy, stay for the story.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love The Good Wife. The characters have depth and cross moral lines. I especially love Archie Punjabi's character Kalinda. She rocks!
B000PXUA5W|5.0|It's a very good watch.<br />It's easy to use, fits good and the kids loving in it!!!<br />I indicate that.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is surprisingly good for a Picross style puzzler. I found it to be rather short, but it was nonetheless enjoyable.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game. Takes too much of my time but it's worth it. Just wish I could convince my boss of that.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|It's about inside, and outside. Always must be come from inside, because it will be show more than outside. When you're focus on outside, and you hide what is inside, and you're not yourself. Just something to learn, and understand what you need to change in your life, and see what you can do for others. Your eyes will be open before your life, and see what you have did, and what you can to make the changes, be more respectful, and willing to trust yourself.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Understand going into this series that these are not novels in the literary sense.  You won't find prose, but you will encounter a compelling and imaginative story told in an alternative, but seemingly very present world.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Nice way to waste a little time, each puzzle goes quickly.  Well designed for ease of play on a tablet.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's a pretty decent game. You do have to post a review to get more levels but over all I like it
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I bought this vertical mouse for work because of issues I was having with tennis elbow.  The vertical design places your hand in a more natural position.  I love the fact that you can set each of the buttons to do different things - it has three buttons on what would normally be the top side and I wanted the middle one to be my &#34;right-click&#34; instead of the bottom button.  Everything is customizable (not sure if that's actually a word, but I'm using it anyway!).<br /><br />When my husband came to my office to help me rearrange my area, he used it once and fell in love with it.  Guess we're going to have to get one for home as well!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King...he never disappoints me.  This was a kick-ass sequel to the shining.  The development of characters was awesome.  Now I want to know what happens to Abra...I'm a greedy constant reader...I wish I could just stand next to his typewriter and read each page as he rips them out...read this...it's wonderful!
B003INBOE2|5.0|What a great movie!!! I've seen a lot of Chinese martial arts movies in my life, but this one was probably the best. From the production values to the musical score to the action sequences, there was a lot of time, money, and love put into the making of this film. Donnie Yen does such a great job portraying his character and some of the supporting cast are also very strong. I was extremely pleasantly surprised by this movie. The quality of the Bu-ray video and sound were good, not great, but good. Some of the dialog does seem cheesy at times, but it's hard to tell if that is just the result of poor English translation. The item came on time and was in good condition.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I think this book is only getting good reviews because it's about cancer patients. Though it's a touching story, and had a few very good points and ideas, the dialogue and characters were terrible.<br />Nothing that happened was very realistic. I don't care how many cancer perks someone has, a flight attendant will not let underage kids drink on an airplane. America's airway is insanely strict.<br />John Green was trying to make every person in the book a philosopher. At least one person will say almost-touching things to the main character every other page. I felt as though the dialogue was so similar between characters, everyone was the same person. There was no personality, no depth. I no longer cared about anyone by the time the story was over.<br />One other little thing that bothered me was her parents were terrible to her and wouldn't let her do anything even though she was dying. Maybe they just wanted to keep her caged up for the rest of her existence. I don't know-but she still treated them like they were God's gift to Earth.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Each actor was painfully believable.  Well written and played out.<br />Suspense was consistent to the last episode.  All the actors were<br />equally fantastic and believable in each role.  It was a total group<br />effort production.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this book for an outside reading assignment for my Honors English class. I thought this book was really good, very different from other books I've read before. When I first started this book I didn't know if I'd like it because I'm not really into mythical stuff like vampires and werewolves, but it ended up not being as different as I thought it would be. It was a perfect mix of a love story and action. I would definitely recommend this book and the four that follow, they all have great plots that play off each other nicely
031618201X|5.0|I was instantly hooked onto the Parasol Protectorate pentalogy and this manga just enhanced the visual experience. The characters were well thought out and represented. Wish they had converted this into an anime series. Eagerly awaiting the 3rd volume. This manga stays true to manga style and focuses mostly on thoughts and dialogues. So it is necessary to understand the character history from the actual books before reading the manga. But for folks who don't want to read a whole book but just enjoy the conversations, this is the right book!
B004YXE438|5.0|Love it...lots of fun ....addiction warning....I never liked or did real puzzles...but I seem to be able to figure these out with ease.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I'm watting for the next season! You can relax and not think about nohing a let the show take you to a very funny situations.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A great legal thriller.  The ending was a surprise I had never anticipated.<br /><br />The story was captivating.<br /><br />This is a book that is hard to put down.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|(A little spoiler alert.) Most people who loved the book will love the movie. It's very true to the book, and makes explicit certain things (like how Gatsby made his money) more explicit. The movie also added nice foreshadowing, like when Gatsby throws his empty champagne glass in the pool where he himself eventually dies. The casting is spectacular. Some people may be put off by the contemporary/hip-hop music that plays during the dance numbers, but it gave me a sense of actually being there and added to the excitement for me. There are a couple of instances where Tobey Maguire seems to break character for a second, going into a smile during a serious scene, but overall stellar acting. I liked the older version, but have to say this one matches the book as it appears in my mind much more faithfully (minus the hip-hop!)
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I was thoroughly intrigued by the premise the author put forth - and was disappointed that this story was so short.  I hope Mr. Sanderson develops and expands both the characters and premise more extensively.  I would certainly buy more books!
B0010HA68I|5.0|I purchased the Op/Tech USA System Connector - Reporter/Backpack to use on my D7100 together with BlackRapid Slim Sport strap. They worked awesome together. This is my setup: D7100 + Battery grip + flash. All of those items attached to BlackRapid Slim strap and Op/Tech USA connect as backup. I have been hiking for 4, 5 hours through bushes, mud and I felt very comfortable, safe with my gears on my side. Very good quality!!! People may think the plastic clips can come off easily, the plastic clips once it clicked on, it will not come off easily w/o forceful push on its connection.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the stories were told on each of the characters. quite refreshing. I also enjoyed the language; no foul word.

B005BZQVJ8|1.0|I have to be clear and just say it!  When Paul and the trailer park girl starting talking about GOD I just lost it!  Being that I love GOD and science fiction its hard for me to except writers when they go to far in trying to tip the cup and say there is no God!  Anyway its a me thing and I just can't let it go.  :)

B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I really like Will and his son working together.  Jaden is becoming a great actor.  If you like science fiction then this is a good one not to miss.
0765334798|3.0|This book is one example of why reading the reviews on Amazon.com are usually far more useful than reading professional reviewers.  The general gist of the reviews here is more on the mark than the pros.<br /><br />This book is indeed clever and worth the time.  I enjoyed it, generally.  Unfortunately, the novel knows it's clever and spends too much time gazing at its own navel, and that is its main issue.
B00006FDCD|1.0|This is not the full movie. It is missing many , many scenes. I bought it because I love the movie but this stinks
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the first books I have not been able to put down in a very long time! I spent all day putting off chores to finish this book. Luckily my son had 1 more set of clean pajamas. Starting on the next book tomorrow.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This was a great deal of fun and took a lot of thought and effort on my part.  I think that the creators did a fantastic job.  My interest was held even when I got so very frustrated and had to put it down for a while because I could not solve the puzzle.  I would recommend this game to anyone who really enjoys a brain and hand coordination.
0307938905|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, very unique and kept me wanting to keep going until the beautiful end.  I recommend it!
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|While I have been a fan of this band since way of the fist and even a fan of Ivan's earlier band motograter. Thought way of the fist was a great debut and war is the answer blew my mind. American capitalism came out it was good, had some great songs on there but I couldn't really get past the song that sort of sounded like nickleback. So 2013 rolls around and five finger is expected to come out with two albums three or four months apart from each other the first volume is out now gave it a little while to sink in and sort of digest the album. It's started to really grow on me it really rocks. It already rocks harder than the last album which it is a good thing. The only problem is some of the riffs and songs sound a lot the same. And I feel the lyrics are sort of dumbed down but delivered my Ivan always heart felt and with a lot of passion and anger. Zoltan guitar is stellar as always with a lot of face melting solos. A good metal album but you don't have to thing to hard to listen it to it. And I feel like their not really taking any chances and sort of playing it safe. But still a good head banging album just some of the same old same old going on!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great movie for anyone, grand kids love it as much as my wife and I would recommend this movie to anyone young or older. ( gru rules)
B008Y212PI|4.0|It is easy enough to be fun.  I have never played anything like this before.  I would recommend it to kill time.

B004U8VQOW|2.0|I seriously enjoyed this in IMAX, but that was 3D and that was a date night and that was an experience. $3.99 for a 24-hr rental of the 40 minute Hubble on a computer screen wasn't worth it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Reveals info little by little and sucks you in!  I feel the need to go right to the next book!
B00E9P959E|4.0|I have to admit that I disliked this album when it was first released back in 2002.  While I still consider it to be a lesser Rush album, this remix has improved upon the material greatly and songs such as \\"Out of the Cradle\\" and \\"The Stars Look Down\\" have become songs I think twice before skipping.  It also sounds amazing on vinyl!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|great price when you pre-order and just cant say how much i loved this movie. really need the HD osund reproduction to enjoy it though
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is perfect! This is my third time reading it, because once I start I can't stop. Read this book!!!!!!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Have a list of the dvd's the girls want - this was at the top.  So - when I saw the price ordered it immediately.  Arrived quickly and don't even want to think how many times we have watched it.  Very pleased.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Dexter Season 8. Well, where to begin? Already people are starting to voice their dissent at the horribly weak ending to such a fantastic (at least at the beginning) show. Here's my addition to add to the growing multitudes...<br /><br />Dexter was one of those increasingly rare shows when it first began. Compulsive viewing almost by definition, the first four seasons were are combination of mesmerizing characters, well constructed plot threads and macabre humor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, from there it has been a steady decline culminating in this crushingly disappointing season 8 finale. Deborah's storyline was tedious, Batista virtually disappeared into a pale imitation of his former personality and even Masuka, the comic relief to the show, was replaced by a listless, drab, non entity of a character. Superfluous characters came and went, ceasing potentially interesting story arcs in their tracks. The college guy serial killer for example. I can't even remember his name but they spent two or three episodes building up a potential story changing plot line just to have him killed off randomly.  They could have made him Dexter's protégé, someone to hand the vigilante torch to when Dexter leaves? But no. He dies. Off camera. For no reason at all. Thus making his storyline strangely irrelevant to everything else. I imagine the conversation between writers went something like this:<br /><br />Writer 1: \\"Hmm, where should we go with this plot line?\\"<br />Writer 2: \\"Dunno. Just kill him off and let's grab some donuts.\\"<br /><br />And don't get me started on the star of the show. Dexter, previously a darkly humorous enigma, has progressively been turned into a boring, predictable paper mache substitute of his former self. Gone is the sarcastic, ironic personality of a genius psychopath with a moral code. In his place is a confused, rudderless mess of a main character which has lost virtually everything that made him a likable anti hero.<br /><br />Also, the whole Dr Vogul, Brain Surgeon thing was completely under developed. There are so many different ways they could have taken that to make it more interesting, but instead it just fizzled out with Dexter finally dispatching the bad guy as almost an after-thought. The whole thing just felt flimsy and two dimensional. At no point did I ever feel Dexter had met his match with the Brain Surgeon unlike several of his other nemeses from other seasons. I was like the 'writers' (although I would be truly embarrassed if I had written this season) were just doing the bare minimum to cobble a season together.<br />To conclude my rant, here's my thoughts on the final episode. I need to say there are PLOT SPOILERS FROM HERE.<br /><br />For Pete's sake, what were the writers thinking when they thought of this ending?! I mean, not to be overly dramatic about it (although it's a shame the writers couldn't have been a bit MORE dramatic when conceiving this episode!), this final installment was the most slap dash, lazy, disappointing, poorly written, just plain STUPID ending to an eight season show like Dexter I can think of. There are so many things that are annoying  it'd take me forever to list them but fundamentally, the most glaring is WHY WOULD DEXTER ABANDON HIS SON AND FAKE HIS OWN DEATH? WHY?? Particularly as the whole season there was this (incredibly boring) under tone of Dexter reforming himself from serial killer to family man? Is it because his sister died and he felt guilty? Really? Is that really what Deborah, who loves her family vehemently, would have wanted him to do? Also, what was dumping Deb's body at sea all about? That's where he dumps the bodies of evil people so, it begs the question, why would he dump his sisters body there?<br /><br />If there's any justice in the world, the final episode would be re-written and the writers of the original ending banned from ever working in television again
1616614609|5.0|If you like a complex game with a back story. In this case a futuristic cyberpunk world with corporations running things and hackers trying to take them down then this game may be for you. If a more simplistic game is your speed. with a small 4x4 6 page rule book and mechanics as simple as rolling dice, moving a few spaces and buying hotels. Then maybe stick to Monopoly.<br /><br />Came across this by accident. I wondered if my Magic cards from 2 decades ago were worth anything. Went to a local (what i thought was a comic book store) to find out. This place doesnt sell comics just card games, Happen to see Netrunner on a shelf. It reminded me of the original from the 90's but thought nothing of it. My fiance suggested a couple days later we buy something like monopoly for nights when we dont have enough people for poker. I said pass.. With my attention span Monopoly gets boring to fast. I remembered the Netrunner box I saw so looked it up online. Only to find out its a remake of the same Netrunner from the 90's. I suggested it to the fiance. She said she'll give it a shot so I bought it. That was 2 weeks ago but due to our schedules we still havent played it. However i did find someone else to play several games with just to try it out. Pretty amazing job they've done. And so much value.<br /><br />Great for people who get bored of the same old same to easy. Since you have 5 corporations to chose from you can basically change how the game plays by deciding to use a different one. And with 3 different netrunner factions you can change how the game plays from that side as well.<br /><br />I've seen the one star reviews. It seems like these are mostly from people who cant comprehend the rules and find the game to confusing. So if straight forward and simple is your speed do not buy this. Pick up Connect 4, Checkers, or Hungry hungry hippos<br />As a warning if you have never played a game like this the rules (probably) will be overwhelming at first.<br /><br />I personally read the magazine size rule book twice, watched the 20min tutorial at FantasyFlightGames website and watched another youtube tutorial with a guy named Nom and Jerrmy. I then made two basic decks and went through every card. when i came across one i wasnt sure on how to play i googled it. The end result was a smooth game right from the start.<br />Seems like a lot to do for a game. But thats a good thing IMO. It makes for a game with a lot more depth. I also like that there are no rare powerful cards in expansions. They are all the same. So you will never run into over powered decks (ie. Magic). Its a great way to expand the game keeping it fresh without ruining it for casual players.<br /><br />Before you buy take a look at an example game/tutorial by Nam Ngo  Then decide if its for you.<br />[...]ally read the magazine size rule book twice, watched the 20min tutorial at FantasyFlightGames website and watched another youtube tutorial with a guy named Nom and Jerrmy.

1476729085|5.0|I love a book that has me laughing out loud.  The the Rosie project embarrassed me several times as I burst out at odd moments.<br /><br />I also have [[ASIN:0977140016 Data Modeling Theory and Practice]] by the same author.  The Rosie Project is a surprising sequel and one of the few times I can say that the sequel is much more fun.
B00ALGW286|5.0|Moscow Dreams by Julia Gousseva is wonderful read that really touched me. From the beautiful descriptions all over Moscow, I was able to pictures the tanks in the street to the bakery and classroom, the apple orchards and the marvelous fountains and so many other great descriptions of Russia.<br /><br />Marina is a young teenager learning the history of her country by her Babushka (her stories of the past are just wonderful) and living in changing times in 1991. There is a new McDonalds and Western food to try. She would really like to travel like her father does and see the world. Maybe as a Russian-English interpreter. Can she make her dreams come true?<br /><br />There is also a first love for Marina, and Nikolai is a very driven young man who wants to go into science like his brother, otherwise it is straight to the military. Will his dreams get in the way of their love? There is a twist which was surprising and the constant change in \\"Moscow Dreams\\" was beautifully described by the author in such a way that was interesting and I really enjoyed the imagery she gave to me of snowflakes, Christmas ornaments, balloons on the water and especially the Tibetan sand through the fingers.<br /><br />This is a coming of age story that I would highly recommend. Very smooth flowing and quickly paced that the pages just turn themselves. Thank you Julia Gousseva for writing \\"Moscow Dreams\\" and giving me more knowledge about Moscow.
1592407889|5.0|I once loved MacLaine but noticed her narcissism growing & lost interest. Ironically, the key figure in the book really is her father - a megagrifter & likely a psychopath. Sachi struggles to keep her story positive, but glosses over incestuous sexual abuse. MacLaine comes off better than she deserves, considering she abandoned her only child to this monster. Much of the book was painful to read, but I admire Sachi's spirit. Shirley failed & the karma from this will follow her into the next life. Parenthood is an awesome responsibility.  I wanted to reach into the pages of this book & give Sachi a hug.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game has good puzzles and the mystery element is good. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Bruce Willis, the producer, director and the writers just mailed this one in. I couldn't make it past 35 minutes, it was that bad. Cliche riddled and a swiss cheese story line. My 2 year old grandson's rendition of his latest potty adventure is more riveting than what this movie is. Barf x infinity plus infinity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it nice and good. and I really good I don't known what to do without that game and I will cry if they had ever took it off the app store
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Really, it does.  I gave it one star which is three more than it deserves.  What more can I say.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun time killer. Would be nice to have more puzzles to work with though. It's a nice challenge for my youngest child.
B009C7JS14|1.0|Boy did I ever waste my time downloading this junk.  I'd rather watch a bad chick flick.  Really, I would.

B00280LYIC|5.0|This is another amazing book by Rick Riordan. I recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to read.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Contra was a five-starrer, too, for me, but this album surprised me with its omission of twisted sugar and its added sobreity and seriousness. From start to finish, Modern Vampires is effortlessly cohesive in its story and its sound. Plenty of the toe-tapping and catchy, sing along phrases and melodies fans have grown to enjoy flow throughout, as do their addicting dramatic builds with background vocals swelling and VW's clever changes and meaningful lyrics and insights. I found this to be a very engaging set.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really like this game. It is challenging at fort then it gets easier.  My  either does not get it but it is fun.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Gripping story lines with a memorable and likeable line of characters.  One of the best law and trial dramas with a twist!

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|The title says it all! This game is addictive and simple to play. It focuses around a good lesson and makes you laugh while you play. all ages!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Not what I expected at all, but great story, visuals, and characters. I would recommend this to those who like the comic book genre.
0307887448|1.0|Despite the abundance of artistic riches to pull from, the book displays a total lack of imagination to call it's own. Stories which play with genre conventions are one of my favorite experiences. Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Most all of the writings of Neil Gaiman or Terry Pratchett. The difference between those stories and this one is that rather than use it's mythos sources respectfully, it uses them as window dressing for bare bones plotting and characters whose backstories and development amount to around a paragraph each. Those other classics include their own characters invented to play-off and exhibit the flaws and superficial expectations of those sources. To have at least one unique fully developed character, one with heroic aspects but flaws too rather than having as much depth as an 8-bit sprite.<br /><br />  Take Roger Rabbit for instance, a Cartoon whose onscreen slapstick persona is juxtaposed with his sick dependency with his love Jessica Rabbit which creates a character-centric downward spiraling of plot. Every depression he feels is tied in with the plot, in a way that forces Eddie Valiant to confront his own demons which is mirrored by the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" lives of the cartoons which are shown to be a bit more like a AA meeting but with Toons ( which reminds me of the best scene in another Homage film, Wreck-It-Ralph, in that it is one of the only scenes that deepen the characters lives and world, rather than hang it's hooks on them like the rest of the film ).<br /><br />  Ready Player One does not do this. The main character is an extreme, poor social shut-in who can exchange in witty banter with anyone, including seducing a woman, tricking trained security guards and verbally fencing a professional businessman in a way to expose his opponents weak standing in the company he is trying to help to win, all done with the acumen of a Las Vegas magician. Perhaps he is a Savant, as shown in an encyclopedic knowledge of 80s culture and the biography of James Halliday, but also to be a social savant is too much to handle especially since he comes from a dystopian reality which lacks human interaction besides running away from knife wielding maniacs and an aunt who makes Harry Potter's caregivers look like saints. In the virtual world he only has one friend. Where he learned to be so versatile in conversation and wordplay beyond canned responses which is shown in actual Otaku, geeks and lovers of culture is beyond my suspension of disbelief. Plus it makes me feel like I'm rooting for an untouchable champion among men rather than the cliche of the come-from-nothing hero, such as Rocky. The reason why people love Rocky is that he has personal flaws and insecurities he has to overcome which is felt and relatable to our own lives.<br /><br />  The contest that is the crux of the book is presented in a manner of an adult telling you verbatim what he is seeing as he's playing something, such as playing through Mario Bros or Zelda. The backstory of the worlds we enter, again taken from MANY sources, are described as basic as a wikipedia article. We get no insight into the worlds and if we do it's only superficial such as seeing the eternal Lich playing an arcade game or acting out movies whose intelligent ideas expressed are exactly the ones from the movies itself, adding nothing. For a story whose main villains are faceless corporations, we get no information behind the beloved worlds nor their creators lives or how they feel about their creations being used for business purposes such as micro-transactions and teleportation expenses in the virtual world. Perhaps EA has bought up all the works of the world like Michael Jackson buying up the Beatles catalog from their original creators in order to sell them for a profit. We know nothing of who really owns anything which makes the struggles of the protagonists against a corporation bland and meaningless. Maybe the corporate puppets really won, but hey who cares there's a Giant Robot over there!!!<br /><br />  I really wanted to love this book but i couldn't get into it with it's plain Deus-Ex-Machina plot devices of the riddles whose clues are either obscured by what the novel gives us or as simple as a google search. It makes a lot of noise with our memories but underneath it all is a hand writhing underneath their skirts making them dance. Take away all the nostalgia and all you got is a spastic hand. Now that's entertainment.
B001V5ADS2|4.0|I haven't seen the first season, but this show is a great drama. I'm not too crazy about the making of drugs being a theme, but it does make the show quite interesting. I find myself still watching it into the third season, wondering what's going to happen next. It's interesting.<br /><br />It's not one of my favorite shows, since drama isn't really one of my favorite genres, but I highly recommend if you do like drama, especially if you don't mind drug-related themes.

JF, Hammond B-3 organ; Frank Vignola, guit; Joe Ascione, dr.<br /><br />In the late fifties and early sixties, Jimmy Smith albums poured out in a veritable torrent, and I didn't like them at all. It seemed to me too formulaic, Funk By Formula, and that wasn't my thing.  Plus, I didn't much like organ jazz. The instrument seemed too slow moving to me, not flexible enough for bop, which was my flavor du jour of jazz. I'm older now -actually, a lot older--and I like more kinds and flavored of jazz than I did when I was a Young Turk in my twenties. So when the opportunity came to pick up this humungous compendium of eighteen albums by Jimmy Smith for a ridiculously low price, I did it.<br /><br />And I'm glad. It's not an even collection. All too often, the music descends into clich&eacute;. It's boring. But there are plenty of un-boring moments in this collection and some of it is really quite fine.  The best albums are those with just the trio -organ (doubling on bass lines), guitar and drums. The more horns that are added to the mix, the less I enjoy the resulting music as a general rule. But the trio albums are a delight. They're especially good to listen to while driving, one of my favorite ways to listen to new music because there are no distractions. In general, I find Smith's music least enjoyable -or rather, more predictable--when he attacks a slow ballad, and more exciting on up and funk tunes. Another interesting point to me:  Donald Bailey was a good drummer but no match for either Elvin Jones or Art Blakey, who also play on some of the albums. But Bailey is a much better fit with Smith: they obviously grooved with each other. Anyway, I'm a (qualified) convert to Jimmy Smith's deservedly popular form of jazz. I'll listen to this music again.<br /><br />Joey Francesco is the best known and most highly acclaimed of Smith's successor's on the Hammond B-3 so I thought, if I'm going to listen to Jimmy Smith, why not Francesco as well. I purchased two albums by Francesco, the first because it paired Francesco with Smith, whom he acknowledges as his original inspiration (along with his grandfather), the second because I liked the way the samples sounded on Amazon.<br /><br />Both albums are first rate. Francesco and his colleagues on these two albums aren't innovators. There's no new ground broken in jazz. But who cares. They are talented craftsmen -artists- who play interesting and tasteful and exciting (especially exciting on the Incredible album) music. Francesco's associates on the Goodfellas album grab me more than the guitarist and drummer on the Incredible, which was recorded during the San Francisco Jazz Festival in 1999. But the two medleys with Jimmy Smith are phenomenal! Apparently, they'd not played together before, but you wouldn't know it from these cuts. This is good music, a joy to listen to, and when the two organists want to, they sure know how to generate the heat.<br /><br />Goodfellas is even better. It's a pleasant conceit: three Philadelphia-based musicians, all Italian, play a program of Italian (\\"Volare\\") or Italian-American pop (\\"Fly Me to the Moon\\") tunes. (One exception: a Monk tune -I don't have the album in front of me now but I think it's \\"Evidence.\\") Francesco is a bear on this album and a plus to it is the drummer, who can play both subtle and kick-a** as needed. He does a great backbeat.t Blakey, who also play on some of the albums. But Bailey is a much better fit with Smith: they obviously grooved with each other.

B00E9P959O|3.0|I was excited to hear elements of the new mix that simply cannot be pried from the dead-cold hands of the previous mix, not even with all fancy plugins and other dissecting tools anyone can afford. It's really great to hear some haunting vocals, and spacial atmosphere undetectable in 2002 from a mix slammed to the wall and choked at the throat. From a great-sounding snare drum, to clarity in the bass, and newly found vocal harmonies and tucked away, to nearly synth-sounding guitars(?) in the middle of Sweet Miracle, I really dig hearing new things in a mix I could never pick out before.<br /><br />However, I will NOT simply toss the old first-run mix of Vapor Trails. Believe it or not, the sheer raw power and heavy abusiveness of the old mix will stomp all over the sweeter Roll The Bones power of the new Vapor Trail mix. For example, the middle section distorted rhythm guitars of Ceiling Unlimited where Alex simply plays his guts out with as much blistering tone as those Hughes and Kettner stacks can blow through some tubes at high volume doesn't hold a candle to how powerfully shoving and brutally rocking the old mix sounded. Plus, What the... a solo? Really? That had to have been added later. Or was that a track they cut from the original. Either way, it didn't help.<br /><br />The overall mix here is cold, but open and less congested. It gives us the overwhelming freedom of spectral space I can relax with. I don't expect it to be as punishing as in 2002. But I can't ignore that this was no doubt the loudest, most powerfully sounding Rush album to date. I personally don't think there was another album before or after that has the raw power Vapor Trails has. This mix tones that down a LOT. Well, it is pretty polite.<br /><br />The kick drum is too clicky for me. The toms are dead and lifeless, an the snare, although I simply LOVE the tone and the pop Neil got with this, it's the wrong snare sound for Vapor Trails. I actually dug the garage tone the 2002 mix had onthe snare.<br /><br />Finally, my favorite song on this album is Nocturne. It has been my favorite song from the very first time I heard it. Two things made this mine. One was the reverbed bass tones during verses. The other are the screaming vocals during the pre-choruses and choruses. I've never heard Geddy throw himself into a horror movie before, but it's the most raging scream I've heard him pelt out since 2112. BUT! This new mix subdues those screaming vocals and embellishes on the lower-register sing-along harmonies instead. This literally killed the vibe of Nocturne for me. I still love the song, but I prefer the old way better.<br /><br />With all this said, I strongly suggest you buy this re-mix. Although I think the mixing engineer choice was questionable, especially judging by some of the oddly-placed volume changes (Vapor Trail at 3:13 and 3:45), then guitar width (mono-to-stereo at 4:00-4:20) in Earthshine, Much has been revealed in this mix that is certainly not detectable in 2002's Vapor Trails. If it had an engineer who's background isn't pop-metal or math rock with a tendency to vacuum the life, warmth, and burn out of mix, this would be an amazing experience!!<br /><br />But judge for yourself. I'm only one critic. Go get it!!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I think the other reviews were way too harsh. The movie was gripping. It captured my attention right from the start.

It was a fun movie to escape into for the evening. Worth renting.

B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|During mid summer my friend Henrique informed me that Justin Timberlake's [[ASIN:B00BCZU8WM The 20/20 Experience]] would be followed up by the end of September by a second volume. Seems Timberlake has recorded easily enough usable material in the last seven years for a double album. But probably knowing the economy level of most music buyers he elected to release it in two parts,also releasing the two full albums as the double set it was intended for those who haven't gotten the first part yet. For one thing,the idea that a contemporary recording artist to think creatively in terms of double albums (or albums period) is a profound revelation. Of course it helped that the first volume on this focused primarily on a genre one could call AOS/AOF (album oriented soul and/or funk) that hearkened back to the prime of the 70's funk era. Of course I was eagerly anticipating this album. Of course I steered clear of streaming as I wanted to allow this album to speak for itself as I listened. From what came through that was a very good idea.<br /><br />  \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\",\\"True Blood\\" and \\"Murder\\" are driving,rhythmically thick funk of the highest order. Justin jams on the one throughout all of these-intersecting the related grooves of James Brown,Michael Jackson and Prince through his own distinctive vocals,beat boxing and sexually eccentric lyrical orientation. His slyness,wit and assertions to freedom of expression permeate all of these. While both very well composed and rhythmically complex the 2-step hip-hop/dance styles of \\"Cabaret\\" and \\"TKO\\" are probably my least favorite here. Yet the fact they are not stereotypically overproduced does give them extra vitality and groove. \\"Take Back The Night\\" is a beautiful dance/funk odyssey-almost a follow up to \\"Rock Your Body\\" from [[ASIN:B007V4QKRA Justified]] only with a fuller production. Its easily my favorite here,and one of my favorite Timberlake songs of all time. \\"Drink You Away\\" is a grinding,rocking and funky blues type number-with Timberlake supplying some grooving guitar work of his own.<br /><br />  \\"Amnesia\\" is a wonderful ballad combining classic soul and boogie type funk,kind of a two decade span of the groove while the 7+ minute \\"Only When I Walk Away\\" is a ferocious psychedelic rocker. The upbeat pop/rock of \\"Not A Bad Thing\\" almost closes the album before the hidden track emerges with \\"Pair Of Wings\\",a richly beautiful composition of a piano ballad that shows the full understanding of the musicality of Stevie Wonder that everyone from Timberlake to Janelle Monae is getting a firm grip on these days. Compared with the more cinematic first part,this part of the 20/20 Experience is based heavily in funk,is more dance oriented and experimental. Never ceases to amaze me though how Justin Timberlake could still have so many haters,seemingly based entirely on the critical reception N'Sync once met,when his music as a solo artist has continued to grow more musically exciting and daring. With each successive release,he continues to flaunt not only the funkiness of his music but his persona. He proudly emphasizes the sexiness of the \\"suit and tie\\". And even makes the occasionally profane hip-hopper use of language work for him as emphasis in the finest funk tradition. An excellent album and perfect for \\"nu funkateers\\" out there.funky blues type number-with Timberlake supplying some grooving guitar work of his own.<br /><br />  \\"Amnesia\\" is a wonderful ballad combining classic soul and boogie type funk,kind of a two decade span of the groove while the 7+ minute \\"Only When I Walk Away\\" is a ferocious psychedelic rocker.

B00C6XBEPY|5.0|This is a selection of tunes from the outstanding Genesis Revisited II (two disc set), with one exception.  There is a version of Carpet Crawlers with Ray Wilson on vocals on this single CD.  I opted for the two disc set.  It does not disappoint! I hope that one day I can just download the individual Carpet Crawlers song because I will not purchase duplicates of songs I already have to get one new song.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Well just when you thought CHER would drop out she created a new stellar dance album with new innovative lyrics that make you tap your feet with joy.  Closer to the Truth is a landmark album and raises the bar for other performers.  CHER is truly a legend and uses her iconic voice to reach new heights of creative music.  Definately the Queen of Audio Digital voice!  I trust that CHER will have to tour another time with such a wonderful album.If you ever get a chance to see her in concert \\"just do it\\" and buy a ticket as she entertains beyond any entertainer to date!  She has such a variety of songs from the past that are amazingly timely each performance.  Her ability to shape shift during her concerts is both creative and awe inspiring!  Cher's energy in live concert is unmatched anywhere with the possible exception of Michael Jackson in his prime when performing in the past. This new album is truly a gift to the world of dancing and having fun in life. BUY IT and listen to perfection!<br /><br />Having been a conference DJ for large groups this album rocks and delivers!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hos book was really but it has its really sad moments . But this book is really good and .
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's unusual for me to sit down and read a book for an extended length of time, but this one was a page-turner. I wasn't crazy about the ending, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But I would definately recommend it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can not wait to read the next book in this fantastic complex action packed series of highly crafted novels!

B00AAZSH0U|5.0|It just gets better and better. A nice book for a toddler learning animals and animal sounds. My one-and-a-half year old loves the pictures and rhymes. It is very short, however. Nonetheless, this is Boynton's best baby book!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is.my first time using this app and its very addictive!I like the restart ability if I can't solve a puzzle right away.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Didn't like the twitter feed style of the book. I get enough of that during the day. Would rather read a cohesive story but I can respect the style as something new and kinda risky
0811879542|2.0|I found this book too juvenile.  All it is, is color dots that the writing tells you to touch a color once or tap 3 times etc.  No story line and feel not many young kids could imagine anything by doing this.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Simple, no issues.  Good idea to make review required to move on.  That does not annoy me half as much as being asked to review all the time.  Seems to make the reviews more honest as well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game but if u get a new kindle, u have to email the support team to get your stuff back again.
B00EY8ARYS|1.0|Can anyone say Daredevil live action TV series and not throw up in their mouth. This sucked and I'm betting that the five star reviewers were paid by somebody to give their reviews. First do we really need another Alpha's slash Heroes knock off, um no? Second how much of my (dis)belief am I supposed to suspend to connect the disjointed plot. I could have bought a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent themed plot entirely dedicated to agents with no super powers or...never mind the plot was so disconnected and poorly written it's hard for me to even imagine a scenario that could have presented the show in a better light. I've seen British science fiction shows better than this.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game for all ages to enjoy. I have it on my phone and my kindle fire HD.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The first thing i do when deciding whether or not to buy an app is check the permissions to see if the app has spyware or want my life history &amp; the history of all my contacts,etc. This one, i am pleased to say, has none of the permissions that make me scream in frustration. It only needs access to the internet. Then, i look at the reviews. Pretty awesome reviews for this app, so i gave it a try. I never played a game like this before, although i see they are popular. I loved playing this . The graphics are awesome, &amp; you really have to think in order to solve the puzzle. Use the tutorial which explains very clearly how to play &amp; give you hints . There is a bonus puzzle at the end. To unlock it, you either have to share on facebook, or write a review. But if you dont want to do either, you can just click on write a review, then click back,
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Well the graphics were cool but this wasn't one of my most liked games. The price I paid for it was completely over riced. I paid $4.99 for this game and it was way to short of a game  for that price. There was no bonus levels and most of the puzzles were really boring to me. The story line was ok but wasn't crazy about how the game was set up all. The hidden objects were far and few between. I was very disappointed in this game and the only  gave it a 3 star rating because on the story line and the graphics. If you can find this game for the price of $.99 or maybe up to a $1.75 then I would say to go ahead if you are just one of those people like me that just have to try all these types of games. I was able to watch t.v. and play this game and easly keep up with what was going on both of them. This is one of the first of these types of games that I was so disappointed. I know I rated it a 3 star game but probably should have only rated it 2 stars for the graphics and story line. If I would have been rating on fun of game alone I would have rated it a half star only. Hope this helps you decided rather to buy it or not. Thanks for reading and sorry its so long.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|I didn't realize AMC was running the BB Marathon this past weekend (09-27-13 thru 09-29-13) until the last 5 minutes of the second  episode!  Got the remaining 59 onto a DVR though!!!  My BB Marathon begins this weekend!  Can't wait!<br /><br />Regarding the video via Amazon!  Clarity was great on 22&#34; widescreen LCD monitor (PC) and sound was crisp and definitive were applicable!  Will view episode 2, &#34;Cat's in the Bag&#34;,  using Amazon Instant Video as well!  Thanks Amazon!
B008K9UZY4|3.0|Well, the game is OK, but there is many problems I can't stand about. There too many springs and spikes, the special stages are HARD,the boss+game over music is just terrifying,it introduced AMY,and the bosses suck. But I do have some pluses. It introduced Metal Sonic,the music is cool. But that's about it. This version allows you to play as tails,fixed the spindash,time attack,and that's about it. So I like this game,but it is just overrated.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you read King's books merely to be frightened, you may not enjoy this one.  It has some creepy moments, but I don't read Stephen King for the chills.  I have always read King's books for his characters and his unparalleled ability to tell a good story.  Those attributes are in fine form in this follow-up to The Shining.  That's not to say that there aren't some scary moments, and he does an excellent job of playing on the deep-seated fear of so many that history will repeat itself, that like your father or mother, you won't be able to resist the bottle, or the temptation to lash out and hurt others, even those you love.<br /><br />I read The Shining as a teenager, and it was the first book that scared the holy hell out of me. Hedges and swingsets spooked me for months and I half expected to see bloated Mrs. Massey crawling out of the bathtub everytime I pulled back the shower curtain. The Shining worked on both levels--lots of blood and gore for those who like visceral imagery, but also steadily building tension as the reader realizes that a character you've come to care about will not be strong enough to fight his demons and will destroy (almost) all that he holds dear as a result.  But then Jack never sought help, never put in the grueling work required to move away from addiction. It's entirely possible that he would have survived the Overlook if he had.<br /><br />I veered between 4 & 5 stars on this one, partly because the villains may be a bit *too* humanized, and therefore a little too easy to dismiss.  It's still Mrs. Massey that I occasionally look over my shoulder and fear seeing in a dark bathroom, and I'm pretty sure she'll never be replaced by Rose the Hat. Rose and her ragtag family are definitely monsters, but they are monsters who experience deep, almost human emotions and I found myself (reluctantly) empathizing with them on occasion.  That makes them less scary in many ways, but it's also a tough trick to pull off -- how many writers can make you feel even a tiny, grudging bit of sympathy for creatures that would torture and kill a child? King is one of the few who could do that, and ultimately, that's why this book gets five stars.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Very fun game, got in trouble at work playing it lol<br />. Works great on kindle fire. Wish it was a little easier unlock new armor though
B00CATSONE|5.0|I downloaded this book thinking that it was going to be simply about Nikola Tesla, but it is that and so much more. It is an inspiring plea for us all to unlock our imaginations and just create. Something. Anything.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I thin its kinda good but it's kinda iffy I mean just get the xbox version it's got better multiplayer and well just more content
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie. We have watched it a couple times now. I am sure we will watch it a couple more times.
B00F87ZYO2|5.0|The Walking Dead is on the very shortlist of shows I follow on a regular basis. Undead, gore, grimness aside, TWD combines excellent writing, acting, production to form a genuinely outstanding experience. It's worth the time and money to follow it from a reliable source like Amazon Instant Video.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I think I just wanted more from the movie. It was good just not what I thought it would be.
0399159347|5.0|\\"The Husband's Secret\\" follows the story of three different women as their lives go through significant news and change.<br /><br />Cecilia and John-Paul have been married for 15 years.  The prototype of a perfect wife and mother, Cecilia has her life in order.  While her husband is away on a business trip, she finds a letter that reads \\"For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick.  To be opened only in the event of my death.\\"  Tess and Rachel have equally intriguing stories, where new information changes their worlds forever.  (I'd share more, but I want you to enjoy the thrill of learning their stories.)<br /><br />The connections between these women and their stories makes you question love, loyalty and the decision to share secrets.<br /><br />I started this book, thinking it would be a fun chick lit.  That side did not disappoint.  But it was a much more gripping and thought provoking novel, as the main characters must decide how to navigate in the world they've found themselves in.
0345472322|2.0|The book tried to do a lot of things and, in my opinion, fell short.  There isn't anything earth-shattering in here, though the book may help some people.<br /><br />The author gives us a nice refresher on a subject many are familiar with: hard work and desire are the biggest predictors of a person's success.  Along the way, Carol Dweck encourages us to look at mistakes as opportunities, continually strive for improvement, derive strength from failure (if there is such a thing as failure), etc.<br /><br />A lot of things are presented through a black-and-white lens and this could potentially mislead a reader,  even though the Dweck makes a disclaimer about this early on.  The author significantly skewed several anecdotes and left out critical circumstances in her retelling to highlight points (e.g. John Wooden's high school coaching story, Pedro Martinez's pitching performance against NYY).  It is also funny to see how some of Dweck's celebrity examples of success would be considered the complete opposite several years after publishing.<br /><br />The book could be a very important gift and read for someone in their late-teens or early-20s.  It just might not be for someone who has experienced more simply due to age.  Chapter 1 is worthwhile and the rest of the book is all repeated reinforcement.  I suggest maybe reading the first chapter and then looking for another pop psychology book.
B00004TJLD|5.0|I paid $112 USED for this DVD DAD version.  Only because it is one of my all time favorite albums.  Sound quality EXCELLENT, but unless you REALLY REALLY love this album - stick with a good CD remaster or vinyl.

B009UNGYHG|1.0|I did not read that this was only the case and not the head set. The photo is misleading. I cannot say it is good or bad. The packaging is not Frustration free this I can say.
1609611543|5.0|I think this book has made a good case, although at times a bit too technical and overlong in laying out the case for many people.<br /><br />At times you wonder if some of the author's claims are over-stated or premature from preliminary testing, but it doesn't matter, I have gotten RESULTS.<br /><br />I have researched nutrition for at least 20 years just as an avid book reader and general interest in the subject but after knowing people who went gluten-free, and already in the past having some results with the Atkins diet, this diet makes the most sense to me than any other.<br /><br />Think about how much wheat we eat in our diets; breading, flavorings, fillers, pasta, rice, cereal, bread, etc.  I was just as guilty as many people in buying into the whole idea that whole grains are good for you and eliminating fat is the whole key to weight loss and good health.<br /><br />Even with an active lifestyle and being aware of what to eat, I blew up to where I was over 250 lbs. by the time I turned 50.  I was getting a big gut, heartburn, elevated blood pressure, elevated but not too high cholesterol, and was starting to get some severe sleep apnea, even when modifying my sleep by sleeping at an angle on a pile of pillows.  I got most of this over about a year or two when working on the road with a stressful job, living mostly in hotels.<br /><br />Last February, I read this book and it just made sense, as I was eating wheat almost every meal.  I didn't think I was necessarily a celiac, but at least it made sense for a weight-loss diet.  So I phased into the diet over 2 weeks, slowly reduced the other carbs like potatoes, fruits (I still eat berries), beans, and corn (tortillas and chips) and worked hard to stay away from all the hidden sources of gluten in things like soy sauce and flavorings.<br /><br />To be honest, if you eat out much you will not be able to consistently stay away from ALL hidden gluten, so you just have to settle for minimal consumption here andthere.  Just keep it to a minimum and don't worry about it.  For example, most Asian food dishes have hidden gluten in the ingredients (such as in batter or soy sauce), so just choose as wisely as you can.  You can get gluten-free soy sauce for home, known as \\"Tamari\\".  The best choice is usually \\"Shrimp With Lobster Sauce\\", which usually doesn't contain gluten but also has less sodium than other Chinese dishes (Asian food is usually high in sodium).  To reduce carbs I only eat about 1/2 of the rice they serve me.  Occasionally I desire pizza so there are decent gluten-free crusts offered by better pizza restaurants but you'd better sample around as not all taste good and some may have undesirable textures.<br /><br />I had to quit beer; I was generally a German beer snob and liked craft beers.  So once in a blue moon I'll have a gluten-free beer but not very often.  It just makes me feel bloated now.<br /><br />In about 3 months I had lost 30 lbs., then plateaued for awhile.  My clothes fit better (pants were falling down, though) and I had more energy than I used to.  I sleep better including I rarely snore anymore and seldom wake up with a cotton-mouth in the middle of the night.  My sleep apnea has mostly gone away as I don't wake up much during the night anymore, and my girlfriend noticed I didn't stop breathing during sleep anymore and snored much less.  This is the MOST IMPORTANT thing for me, as I just simply breathe easier at night and will now not have to bother with getting a CPAP machine.  I still can't sleep flat on my back, though.  Sleep apnea has different root causes so I can't guarantee it will work for everyone but losing all this weight helped me to at least get good sleep on my sides.<br /><br />I used to get sleepy an hour or two after lunch every day during work due to carb-induced blood sugar cycles but all that has gone away.  I stay at a energetic and productive level throughout the day.  A more stable/constant blood sugar level is one of the goals of the diet outlined in this book.<br /><br />The heartburn problems completely went away, although to be fair, I had quit eating later at night and had already made adjustments for it.<br /><br />I still need to do blood work to see if my HDL/LDL ratio being backwards and elevated triglycerides have gone away; I will try to update my review later afterwords.<br /><br />I can't believe how successful this has been for me.  Everything the author said would happen DID happen.  I don't crave snacks between meals anymore.  I only get hungry at mealtime.  When I do snack, I eat nuts and cheese.  In general, I eat way less than I used to and don't feel the need to eat any more than I do now.<br /><br />I lost all that weight WITHOUT EXERCISE!  I normally ride my bicycle a lot, but this year I've had on-going issues with a sprained ankle and/or bum knee (probably from years of being overweight) so I haven't done my normal bicycle riding at all.<br /><br />Since my weight-loss plateau, I still am slowly going downward, just not very fast.  The weight loss on ANY diet is always quickest in the beginning and the last pounds are the toughest.<br /><br />I believe people need to be patient and be dedicated for about 6 weeks or so to start seeing the results.  Once the fast weight loss cycle began, I literally felt like the fat was burning off my body during the day; a weird but good feeling.  Like the fat factory was in reverse.<br /><br />I know other people who have had other issues different from mine that went away after a gluten-free diet.  One friend took an entire year on it to get rid of his particular issues but it DID finally work for him.  It takes decades to build up the problems; they sometimes take a long time to go away.<br /><br />Give this diet a chance; have patience & try it for a few months before considering giving up, and perhaps you will see benefits like I did.  Don't be scared off or ashamed by people who \\"hear\\" the gluten-free diet is a fad orbunch of bunk; whether all the claims made by the author are overstated, or untrue, it's value as a valid weight loss program should be good enough and you may find other benefits you didn't expect.  However, different diets work differently for different people.  Find the one which works for YOU.<br /><br />Good luck!
0812983459|5.0|I must preface this review by saying my eyesight is failing and I am very particular about which books to read. After reading glowing reviews I decided to read this book. All I can say is it made me want to become a better person. That is almost the best thing you can say about a book. I did not find it slow or ordinary in any way. Although my favorite genre is mystery and I rarely read novels, I found this book to be quite thrilling as it reveals its secrets in due time. It also had a surprise ending even Agatha Christie would appreciate. I cried, and I had to write down some of the spiritual and beautiful quotes for future reference It made me want to walk in nature and \\"look at things that are bigger than myself\\" to receive the hope and faith that Mr. Fry experienced. I have agoraphobia and even wrote a memoir about it and it made me want to leave my safe cave and experience life in a more earthy way. I am astounded at the author's talent not only in writing but in humanity. Reading this book was a meaningful experience and deserves all the accolades and 5 star ratings in the world.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Greatest movie ever made. Nothing else needs to be said. But if you insist for the sake of review... Read it I again.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Have read the series and have enjoyed it.  Sometimes I feel bogged down in it but it gets back on track.  Ready to read the next!
B004LP601S|5.0|I have been listening to Panic! At the Disco for a couple of years now through my Slacker and Pandora accounts, and I decided to buy this album. Despite it being two years old, I am still a huge fan of it, and I cannot say there is a song that I do not enjoy. The songs transition well, the lyrics sound good, and although I am not very deep intellectually, I enjoy the songs. While I do not like to &#34;talk up&#34; many things in life, as I think that few things live up to exaggerated hype, I really believe this is one of those things which I cannot talk up too much. Check out the available samples, or even listen to the songs on Youtube, I do not think that anyone would be disappointed with purchasing this album.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have always loved the psy-changeling books, imagine my delight when my favorite story was about the psy and not the changelings.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This a very nice game for my Kindle Fire HD. It eases my wait time at my appointments and boring man shows my guys watch. I recommend this game for all Kindle users. Thank you.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Easy to use and allows you to blend all your favorite sounds.  The timer allows you to fall asleep and not kill your battery.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Good game. I enjoy puzzle games, and games that make you think (even if just a little bit at times). Would recommend this game
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This is a great album. Not sure what all the negative reviewers' issues are...I saw him in concert and he performed some of the songs off of this album and one after one was a hit. I love this CD. It plays in the car over and over...and over :)
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I thought this set might demonstrate just how brilliant and inspired this group of remarkable musicians truly were in concert based on the much earlier release of what really amounted to a highlights package of these shows at The Academy of Music on NYE 1971. The four CD's are just amazing-bell like sound, the three singers all performing at their absolute peak on Robbie's great songs and on a few inspired covers but the DVD is worth the price of this set (admittedly not cheap) on its own. No video as such except on the two included \\"Archival film clips\\" but there's a brilliant use of concert photographs to accompany each song and the effect is simply stunning. Possibly the best live set I have ever come across-and I have heard many. George Harrison once called The Band \\"the greatest band in the universe\\". George was right! Here's the proof!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This book is a must have if you are a startup entrepreneur.  It is written very well and speaks to all of us out there who are looking to create a startup.  You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Enjoyed reading about one of my heroes. I wasn't disappointed.  He was an American hero and changed the lives of many people. Mr issacson captured the essence of Steve jobs.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fantastic. Amazing fun and exciting I couldn't put the game down. It's so addicting I ignored my wife and she slept with my best friend. We are literly getting divorced over this game! Would recommend it to any recently single folks.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 months gave me good tips on how<br />I can sell eBooks on amazon and make a profit.  I would highly<br />recommend this book to any writer or friend looking to make<br />money from their books online.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It took me forever to start watching this series. Never have i seen a series where every single show is interesting,never a slow moment, no let downs.every episode has kept me at the edge of my seat. The writers were either close to genius or has some reallllllly good weed. Good Work
0024181900|5.0|The elements of style improved my writing a lot such as giving<br />me good tips on writing great sentences. I would recommend<br />this book to anyone wanting to improve their overall writing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game even better than playing it on my computer! Thank you good the game and all of the other card games made available now!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Hey, it's a zombie movie, but more action-oriented than gore-oriented. These last 10 words are required. And that is all.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Some songs sound like Dylan, some like Buddy Holly. Really great album that I like listening too. I am also happy to have more young people with actual musical talent.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|A great read intended for young adult readers that speaks to any age. Somehow Pratchett has the ability to reach inside to the reader's memory and imagination to make it a pleasing read for adults. The author portrays female characters with honor and grace which is rare among authors, both male and female.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Just like any other free kindle app. if you want to compete with other players you need to spend money. Takes hours for coin,building, vehicle, and land production.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I just want to give it stars and quit. I read books. I don't review them. Buy it. Worth it.
B00640UICA|5.0|Unique concept for a puzzle game; each level is a bit different and it gets to be quite challenging. No invasive permissions. Cute graphics. Great game
1781162646|5.0|Nostalgic. Coming of age. Suspenseful.<br /><br />All around great book from Stephen King. Easy to read and enjoyable throughout!! Loved it and already looking forward to rereading it in the future!
B0028RXXE8|1.0|As a fan and follower of Rome when it aired I ordered the complete series some time ago. One disc was missing from the shipment I received. I dutifully followed every step of the amazon return procedure, packed it up and mailed it--at my own expense--back. Months later and nothing and no recourse. (How can I prove I shipped the thing back to amazon?) So I'm out $60. Though it must also be said this is the first time I've ever been disappointed with an amazon order. But what a disappointment.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Initially I thought the game looked corny. My granddaughter was playing with my kindle and she had the game on the screen. She's five. Now I'm hooked...
030745455X|5.0|As others have surely told you, do not read Stieg in the evening when you are hoping to fall asleep .. because you will not put it down until long after you should have been sleeping.
1583334386|4.0|I'm reading this book with about 15 other women, one chapter each week. I love the way Kelly McGonigal inserts witty comments that make you laugh out loud. With a subject as &#34;resisted&#34; as will power and self control, I think Ms McGonigal does an outstanding job by bringing humor and research together in a usable and easy to understand format. I now have new tools to use to reach my goals and not sabotage myself along the way.<br />JOY
B000O8OTNC|5.0|very small and compact and does what its designed to do. Good when you don't want to carry around a big stone and just need a little something on hand.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I just first heard of Arctic Monkeys a couple of months ago, I guess I have been living under a rock (or South Florida where we don't even have an alternative/indie rock radio station).  After doing some research, these guys seem hugely popular, especially in Europe, or anywhere other than the US.  Everyone has their own musical tastes, I love bands like The Black Keys, Walk the Moon, Incubus, Kings of Leon (older, not newer), and also like Mumford and Sons, and recently found Django Django.  I love this album, AM.  The vocals are amazing.  The other reviewer's mention of \\"swaggering beats, slinky riffs, and sophisticated out-on-the-tiles lyrics\\" hits it spot on.  I am in my early 30's, and have noticed my musical tastes changing over the years.  I got a couple of their other albums and don't like them as much as AM, maybe I would have 10 years ago.  A little too punk for me and in my opinion the vocals are much better in this album.  I bought tickets to see them live at a small venue in Nashville in a week or so, I'm excited to see them at a small place as opposed to a huge amphitheater as they are hugely popular in Europe.  I have high hopes that they will sound great live too!  We will see!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good game! Easy to play and difficult to master!  5X5 is really easy....  15X15 poses a challenge....  My kids love it too!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Whatever reasons one might have for reading books, this trilogy is for you. I read for ideas, and then for the pleasure of elegance in the craft that went into it. This is the most satisfying read in a long time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is the second FlipPix Art app I have added to my Kindle.  The first one (Zoo) asked for a review too soon.  At that time I was just learning the game and really couldn't give it an honest review.  Now I love the game and have to recommend it to everyone who likes puzzle games.  I am going to add all of. Gabysoft apps to my collection.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Boring and not like the book at all. Way too scattered, I couldn't even finish it. Don't waste your money.
B003QS9TKU|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid. Now I get to share it with mine. Good music; fun imaginative story!
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is one of the most creative, beautiful, and original Musicals ever written. Cheers to Steven Trask & John Cameron Mitchell.
B008Y212PI|4.0|But not all that challenging. Good logic game. Might be good for tweens juzt posting this sk I can finish last puzzle
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so fun it's like temple run or subway surfers<br />But minion rush is more fun
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I think that this bundle is pretty affordable for e books. And it's way better than buying the actual separately.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Started out slow but turn out to be a very good movie I would recommend it to be watch will not be disappointed
B0030MM68O|2.0|It seemed like a good story and I'm trying to watch....but whoever the camera man was did the worst job ever....He can't keep the camera still!!! Other movies are not like this, the camera shakes way too much and I'm getting a headache watching. I had to stop the movie and I can't continue watching.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I liked the movie, very much. I thought it was well written, and casted beautifully. The story line was great, along with the introduction of the characters. Lots of action without a lot of gore.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting, but with Brad Pitt, I expected more of a plot, but it was entertaining.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Another easy read, but not a \\"can't put it down\\" kind of read like the first book. Nice to see things from another perspective at the end
B00DP3IESY|3.0|I don't know, but I expected a little better movie wtih Morgan Freeman, who is one of my favorite actors.  It had some pretty good special effects, but not one of my favorites.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I CAN'T FIGURE OUT ALL THE FUSS ABOUT THIS GAME. I PROBABLY WON'T PLAY IT VERY OFTEN.  I AM NOT IMPRESSED.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a simple, but fun game. A good way to pass time. I'm glad I tried the game. I recommend it for those who need to participate in activities to exercise their cognitive skills.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|IT MAY BE BECAUSE I AM NOT GOOD AT THIS GAME, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A SLOW GAME TO PLAY.  RUN OUT OF COINS TO PLAY VERY QUICKLY
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is a joy to watch I look forward to it every day, takes me back to when I was a little girl in Italy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am to level 21 and I love it.  If you don't buy money or anything it makes it funer
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very addicting. Spent hours on it first time I played. Will enjoy this game for a long time to come
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If u get this game it's awesome go online to your computer play animal jam ITS SO FUN!look me up on it I'm leahleahkitty
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've used it for awhile on my kindle fire. And it's saying it's taking to long to log in  it hasn't work do not buy this!!!!!!!#
B008Y212PI|1.0|in order to unlock partv of the game you have to be on Facebook (I'm not) or write a review. since this is held secret until you are into the game, it is totally inappropriate.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love my Kindle App which I use all the time for my many purchases on Amazon.  It is quick and easy to use.  I am an avid reader, copy editor and author of children's books and use this app for reviewing my books or just reading for enjoyment.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game of nanograms is fun to play. What I like about it is that you are presented a painting background and each puzzle you solve are the details of the painting. The puzzles are not progressive. You don't start with the easiest and move to the hardest. Instead, the 3 levels are based on puzzle size. The easiest puzzles are on a 5x5 grid, medium are on a 10x10 grid, and the hardest puzzles are on a 15x15 grid. If you are a beginner, or haven't played in a while, then you can play a tutorial.<br /><br />I've only played one game on the 10x10 grid, and it seemed pretty easy. The controls are a little different than what you may be used to, but they are not that difficult to master. You are allowed 3 mistakes per puzzle, but you do have the option to ignore errors. You can also restart a puzzle many times. You are not timed, so you can play in Zen mode, but you are not scored either. If you want your progress tracked, then this game is not for you.<br /><br />This game is designed for both phones and tablets. I haven't played it on my phone yet, but it works beautifully on my Kindle Fire HD 7. The graphics are crisp and clean, and the pictures are realistic.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this game for those who enjoy nanogram puzzles.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love the descriptions of places and people in the book, but (spoiler alert!) I don't like it when the siblings are still harbouring some romantic feelings for each other despite knowing that they are siblings.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|I loved the costumes, the classic cars.  The camera angles and music were interesting and very 70s, but still, an entertaining movie.  I can't wait to compare to the new one!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It was wonderful, although there were some parts that I did not understand. Tina Fey really knows how to make people laugh
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This S.H. Figuarts is so much cuter in person than online. I definitely recommend it for any fans of Sailor Moon. Bandai doesn't disappoint. Can't wait to have the other sailor scouts in my collection too :)
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|Just went too Walmart near my crib at 12:25 am they had said they put 5 out at midnight but they was sold out, went to the one on South side they had 20 at Midnight an also sold out by 12:43 and the one by Interstate 20 had 10 copies to put out at Midnight an they had none at 1:10 am! I always get this day of release.Should have just pre-ordered I guess.On too FYE an Kamart at 9am when they open I will be at door!The greatest comedy tv show ever!
0143119680|5.0|I loved this book. It was a well written book with a fantastic story. I love Vampire and witch books, pretty much anything supernatural and this was different to past books I have read. Glad to have found this author.<br />Dont get the negative reviews, but I guess everyone is different. I personally loved it.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|Along with the SECTER box sets this now makes the RUSH collection whole...I've followed RUSH since their inception and this new set is just amazing....\\"PRESTO\\" doesn't even sound like the same album...the highs are high and the bass is crisp and rich.  As others have taken away points for the packaging ...for $40 or less it is what it is....this is all about the music..enjoy the music of RUSH!
B006LXQID8|2.0|I lost interest after about 30 minutes.  I just did not see where this was going and I did not care.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Great song.  Can't wait for the mixes.  Lady Gaga never ceases to amaze me with her music and performances.  Done!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I have seen my cousins playing it and it looked so fun but it wasn't on the kindle yet, now it's here an  I'm sooo excited!
B00DWFQ2N4|2.0|no matter how  you dress and fix it up Justin Timberlake will always be a Broke Michael Jackson and in truth he peaked in 06 and  hasn't showed any growth what so ever in all that time. releasing two long overwrought  albums to cover the lack of one money track which in releases prior Timberlake  had at least one half way decent song whereas now he is putting out cutting room b sides or outtakes and pushing it as a album. \\"take back the night\\" for instance is a sideways  knock off of  Luther Vandross's \\" never too much\\" even the vocal  presentation, however its masked cleaver enough to offset it a bit.  problem with Timberlake is that he often and usually rides off of past grooves and concepts and comes across like a lounge Karoke act. which works really well on Saturday night live, however on his own albums, the results are mixed.  to me these records are moving units based on his name and reputation as to having that one standout track.  if he wanted a dark concept with some style then i say  find a link between Nine Inch Nails and Sade and find that balance like a old Sting Record use to do just making these kinda albums. he still wants so badly to make that ultimate MJ album and he just doesn't have that thing MJ had and that is a couple of things, the Songs and the voice to work a concept without trying so hard.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Good review of running styles and historical account of the modern running shoe, from simple to complex back to simplicity. It follows my history as I was a Junior in HS when the Nike Cortez was introduced.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love the way Connor believed he could have a marriage without love just to realize he was wrong I think anyone who love's a good romance story should definitely read this book
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is such a great app. You have to use your brain but it is not so difficult that you get frustrated and give up. It is the perfect balance between problem solving, fun,  and beautiful pictures.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Oh, Brad; you lost me when you boarded that military transport helicopter wearing your fashion scarf.  The hoards of zombies stampeding around in those huge groups...it was hard to see when they had time to bite anyone.  And the female IDF soldier with the shaved head..whoever cast that has obviously never seen a female IDF soldier.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The only down side to Dr. Sleep is that I found it impossible to read slow....... as much as I wanted this story to last, I just could not resist its call. Thanks, SK!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app! Graphics are great. Hours of entertainment. Perfect for kids and adults love to play as a family!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. Highly addictive. No issues known or found thus far. Definitely recommend to puzzle lovers. Lots of fun. Download today while free or buy it later.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|This season of suits is honestly incredible.  The writing and film is superb!! The character development and acting is nothing short of perfect!! Intense and great show!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Reading this series was so much fun! I couldn't put it down! The author kept me wanting to read more and keep going to see what was going to happen next! I find that hard to do in most books now days. It also gave me some ideas! Which was fun!
B0000028M7|4.0|This album is good and definitely worth a cheap purchase!! Classic Alice in Chains!! Don't buy their new trash album!
B009SQRC9E|5.0|My family loves this christmas movie.  Its funny and exciting. Fun for the whole family both young and old. Enjoy!!
B00000099Y|4.0|You can never go wrong with Tool!! Great industrial album!! I miss this sound but its nice to be brought back.
B0013D69YE|5.0|This album reminds me of why I LOVE Beyoncé!!! It takes me back to when I was an undergraduate sitting in my dorm room writing research papers, cleaning my room, or washing my hair!! It's an awesome throwback!!
B000001IPL|5.0|This album is really good - 85% of the songs are awesome!! This was before they went pop and made all that trash!
B001KR9AP8|4.0|I purchased this album to complete my Beyoncé mp3 collection! There are a few songs that are my absolute FAVORITES that I vividly remember belting out with my college BFFs but in my opinion the album is too short!
B004IK30S2|5.0|You just can't beat comedy like this!! Hilarious and they do not make them like this anymore!  All star line-up cast!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used my kik for months and it worked perfectly fine and now when i try to log in on my acount its says sorry there was an error loading<br />FIX THIS PLEASE -&hellip;- its so annoying
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This movie is the best - Michael Jackson's videos with a storyline and Joe Pesci as the villain! Yes, classic!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is an extremely convenient piece of equipment that provides more usage time for my headset.  It works very well and is a lifesaver.
0316017930|5.0|I always recommend this book to everyone that asks about it! I read it in two days.  Interesting and fun read with success stories!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|The DVD came in the mail in the original wrapping as stated in the ad, no complaints at all! Keep up the great work
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|This album was actually pretty good - Royce kills every verse and Em holds up well with him.  I was surprised bc I personally think Eminem is falling off a bit but overall good work!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I got this error when downloading the app, &#34;not available in your country&#34;. It didn't say anywhere &#34; for US only&#34;, now i bought it and is useless. There should be a message somewhere saying don't buy it if not in the USA
0316172324|5.0|All of the Gladwell books are great and fun reads!! You can realistically get some good life takeaways and read them fast!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm sad to be almost through with listening to this book on tape as I've been enraptured by it. To me it is perfect - the story, the performance, the character development. I am floored by the gift and talent a novelist emmanates from well-written work. This book is a work of art! Truly... Liane Moriarity crafted this story from her soul. I liked that the story is set in Australia - but despite it being in a place I've never travelled to, I could totally relate every single character on a human-to-human level. I've never come across anything with such heart and wisdom. I recommend this to any woman looking for a good cry. The audio is WONDERFUL and the narration is fabulous. TWO THUMBS UP!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Ads, ads, ads.  The producers play games trying to make it more difficult to bypass the ads. And the ads are the same ones, over and over.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very entertaining, lots of good clean fun for the family. Try it out , you will like it.
B004S699LI|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I want to say the one thing that I think most people forget to say when reviewing this book.  It's a fun read. A page turner.<br /><br />It's not deep. It has good pacing. The characters do things that are interesting. They do stupid things that make them human. Martin knows how to weave a plot. Red herrings and plot reversals. Most are well crafted. A few are predictable. Overall I was please after reading it. The language was a bit overwrought, but that's fantasy. I like some of the characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister) and I hate others (Sansa, Joffrey, and that punk The Hound).<br /><br />But for real, come on guys, it ain't Proust.<br /><br />I was put off of it for the longest time because of the hype. I have friends who will not shut up about the depth and profundity of the imagery and the plot. I will never subscribe to HBO as I am a chord cutter, and I refuse to torrent, so the HBO series is off limits for now.  Yes I know I can buy the DVD and no I won't. I picked it up finally for a long flight.  I am glad I did, but for chissakesalmightee I am still put off of the hype. I plan to read the other books now.  I like this book and I want to see what unfolds.  That's why I'm reading it.  It's fun.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Couldn't put it down....loved the way it was written and slowly unfolded without making me bored or totally stalling....if your looking for originality suspense and drama this is the book to read
B008MIMWOO|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Amazing story with truly amazing insight and wisdom! A must-read for all! You won't want to put it down promise!
B00164GDD2|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the way the book flowed. I especially liked the epilogue which helps ties loose ends but still leaves room for your own imagination! Great read
B005PK56TA|5.0|Its an amazingly addictive show! I loved it so much that I purchased the second season.  It has so many twists and you fall in love with the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it was fun and easy for young to old. my 4 year old enjoyed as well. great graphics for kindle fire. it takes awhile to load though.
1593275080|5.0|This book is really put together well. The photos and the creations featured are truly beautiful. This would make a great gift for all lego aficionados, kids, and kids-at-heart.<br /><br />The possibilities shown here with Legos is mind-boggling.<br /><br />I think a hard-cover version would be more suitable for coffee tables, but the book quality is great in any case.<br /><br />*I received a review copy of this book. This review, however, reflects my own opinions.*
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a gripping series geared for tweens and older.  It is well-written and quite creative, a good read for 4th grade through adulthood.  Subject matter is appropriate and interesting!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I read this book for my book club and had to force myself to finish.  Talk about wordy.  I think the author was paid by the word.  He provided long drawn out descriptions of everything, mostly not necessary.  The story didn't hold my attention until at least half way through the book.  Honestly, the only way I could finish reading it was to have my kindle read it to me while I cooked, drove, etc.  I am an avid reader and have never listened to a book on tape before.  Don't read this book.  When I put it down, I felt like I had to yell at someone because it was so bad.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Fast moving film that kept my interest and attention, no small feat.  Had enough action and relationship development to be fun.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Very happy with this soundtrack. Have all the others and this one has quite a few that I like to hear over and over.
B0036OS3EW|4.0|will buy another sometime if this last long enough and still look good they look like they will last for right now
147674355X|5.0|(letting out a long slow breath)<br /><br />This book is a long winding road. There are places in this book that i visited and revisited (you'll know when you read it) There are passionate places and funny places but what resonated with me was when things got real. When the satin film was lifted and the grainy truth lay out in front of me ... that's when i realized how gifted this author is.<br /><br />Either she knows someone who suffered the same crime Hope/ Sky suffered or she herself at some point in her life felt her innocence destroyed.<br /><br />Holder had me at Shayna / Shawna (or whatever it was)I mean whats not to like.. he's a strong, passionate, smart guy. Perfect words spoken at perfect moments... you cant help but fall madly in lust with him.<br /><br />Then the writer does something fantastic ... She takes this hot specimen of a man and adds a shining armor. My heart contracts as i write this because I once needed so desperately a Holder in shining armor. That was my escape once.. dreaming up rescue scenarios.<br /><br />Today, I know  that i am my OWN Night in shining armor. I wait for no one to rescue me. But it sure is nice to step out of that hard, shiny protective exterior and feel rescued every once in a while.. even if only by a Delicious fictional Character..<br /><br />At one point the author places you in this horrible situation and she does it with such fantastic writing that I could feel the dust on my fingers as Hope slides her hand over the furniture. I'm breathless when she faces her past. She then eases our suffering with words that people pay a therapist hundreds to hear.<br /><br />I love how her characters transform into completely different characters before your very eyes..you hate them, love them, suffer with them.. For example Karen became the savior we all pray for and Holder the hand that we all need to steady us ... I found myself crying not only because it was beautifully written but because i felt like I was purging some part of me that needed release.<br /><br />I can not explain it, its just one of those books that make you feel validated somehow. With LOTS Of heart raising, hand clenching... breathless passion as well. The book feels personal and raw and real and i live it!
0141345659|5.0|This book was fantastic! It's my favorite John Green work.<br /><br />  It was brilliantly written, convincingly, from the point of view from a teenage girl who has terminal cancer. She meets Augustus Waters and everything changes. Their worlds are flipped upside down when Gus finds out his body is riddled with cancer...<br /><br />  For the last one hundred pages you'll feel like someone shoved a grappling hook through your belly button and then pulled it out... while twisting it...
1451695195|2.0|I purchased this book hoping that a discussion of the topic of life after death by a neurologist would offer valuable information.  What a disappointment!  There are many explanations of this extraordinary phenomenon that a thorough examination by a neuroscientist might endorse or dismiss.  Unfortunately, this book is, like many others of this genre, more autobiography than exploration of the phenomenon itself.  Save your money.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put it down. The Alcoholics Anonymous references were spot on; have lived with 30 year AA member and as the book states some do make it through the program and never have another drink. Liked the ending as well, so I hope we can see Abra appear next in the continuation of this story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app I hated the regular version a kindle has on it the updates are cool to my loads super fast and those people who rate bad shame on you lol jk
B008Y212PI|5.0|I find this game to be entertaining  and allows some brain stretching.  I am looking forward to completing the rest of the levels.
B006VJMZXY|2.0|Having read The White Queen, which I enjoyed, I was looking forward to this latest book about Anne Neville. Sadly, the book did not match the anticipation. Anne appears as a snobbish one-dimensional character and I was completely over SPOILER ALERT the inccesant whining that the Evil Evil Queen Has Killed All My Family Through Witchcraft, which dominated the story. I know that medieval England was a hive of superstition, but seriously? This went way too far. There were elements of a stronger more complex character in the story, notably during her courtship with Richard, and at the end when Richard is contemplating taking the Crown, but overall I found it hard to care about the characters in any shape. And this is from a person who cried at the end of Sharon Penman's The Sunne In Splendour.<br /><br />I'm sure there is a good book out there somewhere about Anne Neville, but this isn't it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Lots of fun.  It's hard to put down! I'll definitely be looking for more like this when I finish all of this one.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a gift. she loves the album and we love to buy our CD's and MP3s from Amazon since they make it such an enjoyable process and the ability to download instantly. Michael has a bunch of older songs that are remade on this album and even my kids like it with &#34;you've got a friend in me&#34; from the Disney Childrens movie Toy Story. another great addition to the collection for a Michael Buble fan.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Sometimes I need to get access to my pc without having all of the typical IT resources that I may have. this application allows me to be out and working offsite and still gain access to my computer and the files that I need in a bind. I have it loaded on a couple phones and tablets and it works well. Don't have any complaints or insights as to specific features that are helpful since my usage is pretty basic but it is reliable and that is the key feature for me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it was really easy to use and download. Also the option to see the whole addition was really awesome! I would recommend this
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I hate Jamie Foxx, he's an arrogant sun-of-a-b#$ who thinks he can sing and lacks passion - BUT the FOXX  an act! and although he's by far the weakest actor... the film is AMAZING!
B00E9P959O|3.0|I, too, am a lifelong Rush fan - having seen them live the first time in 1978 - and while I agree that a lot of hidden sound has been brought forth, this remix has removed too much of the power of the original. The drums sound way too tame and the guitars in too many instances have been pushed back a bit too much. I can hear some certain details in the remix that I didn't hear before, but the balls have been cut off of a very strong album. The force that Neil puts into every downbeat has been diminished and his bass drum sounds so 'homogenized'. The toms lack the percussive power that are Neil's trademark and a lot of his nuances have been buried. While the bass is clearer by far, the bottom end has been gutted. Alex's guitars are less prominent, in my opinion as well. I think I'll just listen to the original mix whenever I want to hear VT.<br /><br />P.S. - I can only assume that the majority of the people that have heard the new remix listened to it on headphones and not on a actual stereo system....big difference! The compressed sound works better with headphones but not so much on actual speakers with separation and space.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Many of the words are either too hard or too easy. It's an okay game but not as good as I was expecting.

1933952806|5.0|I am a new photographer and I cannot wait to delve in to this book.  It came earlier than expected.  It has a slight bend on the corner and a couple scratches, but over all it isn't anything that I would expect even when buying from a store.  Can't wait to read it!
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|My favorite musical genres tend to be classic/modern rock and epic orchestral music. My two favorite rock bands are AC/DC and Airbourne, and Two Steps From Hell and the Final Fantasy series' music are my favorite orchestral groups of music. In the last year or two I have also begun listening to quite a few more recent rock bands, including Black Stone Cherry, Theory of a Deadman, Shinedown, Three Doors Down, Hinder, Nickelback, Jackyl, and Seether. Due to the genres I like, I did not think I would ever greatly enjoy listening to a female vocalist since orchestral music rarely has singing and rock music is usually sung by males, but even when it is sung by females (such as Joan Jett, Janis Joplin, and Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett being my favorite of the three listed), males always seemed to be able to be able to sing the rock genre better. However, when a Halestorm came up on my Black Stone Cherry Pandora station a few days ago, I quickly looked up more songs by them and found I had been dead wrong.<br /><br />Lzzy Hale of Halestorm has quickly become easily my favorite female vocalist, and her vocals are easily the best part of Halestorm. Her voice is perfect for rock 'n' roll (similar in some instances to Joan Jett, though Lzzy Hale's voice is much better, in my opinion). However, Lzzy Hale can also handle slower, more ballad like music, too (such as songs 5-7 on this CD), though I prefer the faster, harder rock songs.<br /><br />My favorite songs on this CD are the first 4 songs, and the third song, \\"I Miss The Misery,\\" is my favorite Halestorm song as of the writing of this review. As I said above, some of the slower, more ballad like music such as songs 5-7 I do not like as much, though as another reviewer mentioned it is interesting listening to them to see the range of songs Lzzy Hale can sing. However, I hope for their future work Halestorm concentrates less on slower, ballad-like songs and more on the faster rock songs like \\"I Miss The Misery.\\" Some might arguethat its boring for a band to just stick with the same kind of music all the time, but one of the greatest features I like about my two favorite bands, AC/DC and Airbourne, is that they DO tend to stick with the same kind of music. AC/DC has almost 20 albums and they never strayed from the hard rock/bluesy type of music (though they had one or two slower songs I don't like as much on their Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap album) - in my opinion this steadiness isn't a bad thing because it's boring (it's not), but a good thing because they're reliable.<br /><br />Also, song 10 (\\"You Call Me A Bitch Like It's A Bad Thing\\") reminds me a bit of Joan Jett's \\"Bad Reputation,\\" and song 15 (on the deluxe version) \\"Hate It When You See Me Cry,\\" though admittedly a bit on the slower side (though probably more of a slower rock song than a slower ballad-like song like 5-7)), reminds me of 3 Doors Down's \\"Kryptonite.\\"<br /><br />So, that's my two cents on Halestorm. Also, Lzzy Hale, in addition to having one of the best singing voices I've heard, is also admittedly pretty hot, and her nickname \\"Lzzy\\" (which I read was based off of Ozzy) also reminds me of a Terry Pratchett quote:<br /><br />\\"Where were you when the vowels were handed out? Behind the door?\\" - Nanny Ogg to the demon WxrtHltl-jwlpklz, The Wyrd Sisters<br /><br />(P.S. I also saw mention of a Scotish band called Alestorm in a YouTube comment on a Halestorm video, and I looked them up and they're a pretty funny \\"True Scotish Pirate Metal\\" (in their own words according to Wikipedia) - I'd recommend looking them up as well if you like Halestorm)

0316204366|5.0|Much like his other works, Gladwell masterfully pulls together a lot of anecdotes into one compelling message.<br /><br />The main message of this book is that underdogs, and disadvantaged people who have experienced difficulty, can actually be at an advantage because of it.  Every chapter highlights one person in particular and Gladwell draws meaning from their experiences, and weaves them together within the analogy of David vs. Goliath.<br /><br />Chapter 1 -- talks about the most unlikely basketball coach and his efforts to work within his means to lead his team to victory.<br />Chapter 2 -- discusses class size and the point in which more money and resources leads to limited return on the investment.<br />Chapter 3 -- is about the big fish in the little pond or the little fish in the big pond.  In particular, Gladwell focuses on one women in particular to show that it might be of more benefit to be the underdog.<br />Chapter 4 -- delves into the topic of dyslexia and uses David Boies as an example of how this disadvantage was used to help him grow and accomplish things not possible without this condition.<br />Chapter 5 -- talks about Emil Freireich and his efforts to battle leukemia.  He had to overcome great odds to do so, and his troubled upbringing may have been the perfect backdrop to lead Emil to be so effective.<br />Chapter 6 -- focuses on the Civil Rights movement and chooses a unknown participant named Wyatt Walker to display how David thrived and overthrew Goliath.<br />Chapter 7 -- discusses \\"the troubles\\" of Northern Ireland and shows the downside of being Goliath.  It also shows how a group of moms overcame the army and helped stop the circle of violence.<br />Chapter 8 -- talks about the birth of the 3 strikes law in California which is used as another example of the underdog overcoming odds to be victorious.<br />Chapter 9 -- concludes the book with a look at the Huguenot's and their successful defiance of Nazi Germany.<br /><br />While most ofhis previous works relied heavily on research in the area of social psychology, David and Goliath reads a more of a compilation of biographies.  He also used footnotes extensively for the first time which I found a bit odd and distracting.<br /><br />In the end, this was not the best he's written.  However, it is still entertaining and it still carried the same feel as his other books.  As is the case for most of his other books, the application is left to the reader so don't expect to have a step-by-step plan for applying his book to your life.  Gladwell wants the story to inspire and the main message to be illustrated by numerous accounts of people, who like David before them, rose to the challenge and made use of what they were given in order to overcome the insurmountable odds they faced.<br /><br />Well written, entertaining, and worth every penny.

B0061S0A64|4.0|I love it (says in a prissy voice) It makes some pretty creative songs and beats. I'm thinking about making some cool music for a game I'm making. It functions okay I sometimes have some errors that force close it. That was why I docked a star. I probably just to need to root my tablet so I can partition more RAM but oh well I still like it. Especially because you have the record feature.

I hope they make some changes to slow it down or give the user  if  some control. A pause button would be nice too. I got it as free app of the day if I had paid I would be more frustrated.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really like playing this game.  It makes you think about what needs to go where to solve the puzzle while not being so frustrating you want to give up.  It's short enough that you can play it if you have a few minutes between class or commute.  Would recommend to others.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon who went through a near-death experience and believes that since his brain cortex was \\"inactive\\", or \\"shut down\\" during his NDE, that he couldn't have hallucinated or dreamed up the experience, hence he must really have experienced heaven. He uses many different words to describe how his part of the brain that deals with higher thought processes (the neocortex), was out of action, but he never says \\"dead\\", since it was getting blood flow. And he does completely recover, so there is proof that his brain didn't die. Also, what does 'inactive' mean? Is it the same as 'in remission' in reference to cancer? 'In remission' only means that cancer is not detectable, not that it is gone. So, the neocortex could have been active on an undetectable level.<br /><br />The author proves his arrogance in asserting that his NDE was more important than any of a million others; at the same time admitting that if this had not happened to him personally, he would not have believed it. Why is it only scientifically possible and believable because HE went through the experience? The book is so poorly written that I had the feeling that he believed that his was the only true experience of heaven, when I really think that he is trying to validate everybody else's experiences by 'proving' that the experience does not come from the neocortex. He thinks he was saved because of others praying for him and holding his hand (love). If that is all that is needed, there would be millions more loved ones alive today. He wants the reader to believe that he knows enough about the human brain that there is no other explanation than that he saw heaven. I say that the only provable fact was that modern medicine can keep a patient alive long enough for the body to repair itself, if it is able. He has only proven how little is known of brain function, especially when a coma is induced medically.<br /><br />The book is a very fast read, 170 pages, large type with lots of filler on his early life and ends with lots of gibberish about defining consciousness, meditations, medical terms that make no sense to anybody but doctors, and lots of nonsense of how his NDE was completely different than others (but similar also). It would be a VERY short story if he only described his NDE (most of which seems suspiciously like his early childhood dreams of flying and adult skydiving experiences). The author believes that he now knows all about the spiritual world and that EVERYBODY can speak directly with God \\"through various methods of prayer or deep meditations\\" (pg. 161). He doesn't say if God will acknowledge you and converse or not. I haven't studied NDE's, but I have heard and read of some, and his experience doesn't sound like any I have ever heard of. He claims to have asked many questions, received many answers during this time, but none are in the book. He's no doubt saving them for his paid lectures.<br /><br />He has no idea how long his `experience' lasted, but assumes it was for the whole 7 days that he was in a coma. I have heard of a person's complete life flashing before them in a heartbeat, so the part of his experience that he wrote about in the book could have happened a second before he went comatose or a second before he awoke.<br /><br />I originally reviewed this book as 2 stars, but after reading other negative reviews I now consider it very dishonest. Other reviewers point out his medical malpractice problems and his paid lectures along with his website mostly offering items for sale. Also, there was a Baptist minister on television calling out all of these so-called 'near death experiences' that have cropped up lately and over the years as delusional or dishonest: his reason is that every one is totally different. Why wouldn't there be a consensus among some if the experience was real?<br /><br />In short, the proof is in the title - the author wants us to believe that he can prove the unprovable. He may have proven it to himself (doubtful) that he visited heaven, but the reader has to take his word on faith...n, but the reader has to take his word on faith...

0783240287|5.0|This 1990s take on Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1968 children's musical, based on the Old Testament  story of Joseph and his brothers gives even more freshness and depth to the ancient tale, though perhaps some scenes in this version are too suggestive for children.<br />  Donny Osmond, who has a bit of experience in being a second youngest brother in a large family of brothers with the brightest spotlight shining on him is perfectly cast as the titular Joseph--a role he played onstage for many years prior to this televised version.<br />  The production begins as a school assembly event as uniformed British schoolchildren take their seats and the teaching staff take their places.<br />  Soon the tardy narrator, Maria Friedman, arrives, and stumbles while making her way to the stage, to the amusement of many of the children assembled.<br />  But she will lead the audience though a dramatic and fantastic tale. After Friedman's skillful introduction  via a song about dreams, we are introduced to the family of the Biblical patriarch, Jacob(Sir Richard Attenborough), and ten of his eleven sons, including Reuben (Nicholas Colicos), Levi(David Higgins), Asher(Martin Gallaghan), Dan (Sebastian Torkia),Simeon(Jeff Blumenkranz), Naphtali(Shaun Henson), Zebulun(Michael Small),Issachar(Patrick Clancey), Gad( Peter Challis)Judah(Gerry McIntire), and Benjamin( Nick Holmes). Joseph's introduction cues Osmond to  lead the children in the light, upbeat stanzas of the bouncy, \\"Any Dream Will Do\\".<br /> We learn of Joseph's reception of a coat of many colors from his father, earning his brothers ire and resentment. They also resent his telling them his dreams of their being second fiddle to him.<br />  They decide to do away with him one day, and initially toss him into a well, sans his coat. Initially planning to leave him for dead,  they change plans and sell him into slavery,  smearing his precious coat with goat's blood and, via the Country-Western style song, \\"One More Angel in Heaven\\", lying to Jacob about his favorite son's so-called demise.<br />  Now a slave in Egypt, Joseph begins working for the Captain, Potiphar(Ian McNiece), and through a cutesy song , we learn that Joseph grows to like his master and works for him with devotion, but Potiphar's wife (Joan Collins) makes advances towards a reluctant Joseph. When caught in a compromising position, in which he was placed against his will, Joseph his arrested  and incarcerated, and we go from the mournful, \\"Close Every Door to Me\\" through the upbeat and contemporary \\"Go, Go, Go, Joseph!\\" as the central figure rises from utter despair to being able to use his gift for interpreting dreams to predict the fates of a butler(Alex Jennings) and a baker(Christopher Biggins), who are his fellow inmates.<br />  Soon the Pharoah (Robert Torti)is in need of someone to interpret the meanings of his dreams, and the butler recommends Joseph, who realizes that his big moment is at hand.<br />  As we learn how they rock'n'roll in Egypt, the Pharaoh explains his dreams to the young Levite, who interprets duly, stating that the dreams are a warning about the need for preparation for an approaching famine, and the need to ration during the next seven years. Joseph is put in charge of directing the effort, and we see how everything in his life prepared him to be where he is at this moment.<br /> Via a Basque lament we learn that Joseph's family miss him and that they have been adversely affected by the famine. They decide to go to Egypt.<br />  A cool jazz number  is the expression under which the brothers reunite although they no longer recognize their long lost brother. Friedman, who has insinuated herself into the story throughout, seems to especially gain pleasure as the brothers grovel. The \\"Benjamin Calypso\\" is the segway to a reconciliation.<br />  Various musical styles, and the obvious enjoyment of the participants give this production something for everyone, and it is especially brightenedby the participation of children. Like many a Rice-Lloyd-Webber collaboration since, this beloved now-45-year-old musical has withstood the test of time and like its central figure, will always come out on top.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Overall enjoyed seeing Danny and his problems a few years down the road.  Felt the final confrontation was a bit anti-climatic--though cleverly done (did have believability problems with how one of the threats was addressed).  Would have liked to have seen more of the True Knot; as is, they're a pretty generic bunch of bad guys with many being little more than names.  Had a bit of a problem with the big Torrance family secret revealed here--I realize that The Shining wasn't written with a sequel/follow up in mind, but it felt like a cheat to me and an unnecessary one at that.
1590171993|2.0|I read this book as a Mizzou graduate who was curious about how he deals with<br />familiar geography and the breathless reviews.<br />I don't think so.<br />Technically, the writing is well done. But the book is so cold you feel<br />like you are reading it through a microscope.<br />I was disappointed and while it didn't leave me neutral about these characters, it left with an<br />intense dislike.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|First off, I want to make it clear I don't think this is a failing on Sanderson's part.  From what I've seen in the last three books, he's a good writer and I will be reading some of his solo work.  There were some problems with characterization that I'd noticed in the last two books as well, but, hey, they weren't his characters to begin with.  And it's not even that the characters as written by Sanderson were bad, it's just that many of them felt flat, as if some of the color of them had been sucked out.  Ah well.<br /><br />If everything I've read about the collaboration between Sanderson and Jordan is accurate, Sanderson was constrained by Jordan's vision in the writing of these books, so I have to believe that the \\"meh\\" I felt upon reading it (I waited, btw, for the Kindle price to come down...I was offended by Mrs. Jordan's insistence that the ebook be released after the hardcover, a bit of unnecessary silliness in this day and age) would have been there regardless.  I found the prolonged four front battle to be tedious; I had foreseen how Rand would defeat Shai'tan books ago, though not the exact nature of their confrontation; I'd known even longer that it would end with the wheel being \\"reset\\" because, duh, that's how a wheel works.  And that's probably the most disappointing aspect of the final book for me...Ages down the line, it's all going to be replayed again.  And again.  And again.  The knowledge that everything is pre-ordained by the Pattern--much as it was spun earlier that anything is possible--lessens the impact of the story and my investment therein.  I suppose it's possible that the Dark One may actually defeat the Dragon in some turning of the Wheel, but, meh. Additionally, I think the confrontation between Rand and the Dark One gave a lie to the claim that the Dark One exists outside of the pattern...not going any further than that to avoid spoilers (and no, I don't consider Rand's defeating the Dark One a spoiler).<br /><br />One last thing:while I originally found Balefire to be a way cool weave, it's overuse here was disappointing.  Both sides way back when realized it was too destructive to be used in the war in the Age of Legends, but now it's tossed around with the seeming intent to actually destroy the Pattern.  And if the Wheel brings everything around again...well, eventually there would be no Pattern left to save.  Just a personal nitpick.

B00CKJTOHO|4.0|I watched it all seasons and it kept my interest.  Other seasons I liked better, but Dexter's new love interest is great.  His connection with his sister I could do without.  His character is untouchable, but Debra kind of ruins the intrigue.  Look forward to the final season.

They are not a handsome couple, I don't know if the chemistry is there or not, she is so over the top in so many ways, it is grinding to watch her performance, Lewis, as always shines no matter what he does or how his character looks. Some of the actors seem miscast, the kids are horrible! I understand season 2 after seeing his family, the kids are overbearing, they, especially the girl, get on my nerves, they need to have less screen presence and more focus on good actors, like Lewis, Danes and Pantinkin.
B00932A4N4|5.0|I love this amazing love story. It leaves you feeling a passion you can;t even explain.  The story line is great and easy to follow
B00F35BV64|3.0|The title says it all. The movie was a dismal disappointment! I wanted to see more of Benedict and less of every one else, especially Spock and Kirk. Story was weak and all over the place. Lots of miscasting and weak characters. Looked forward to this movie, I personally, felt let down and cheated out of what could have been one of the better movies of the summer block busters.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. When it came out I heard nothing but bad things about it. All the reviews were bad. But I watched it, hesitantly. Rented it for a buck at Redbox. My husband had no desire to watch it. I sat there with my 4 year old, laughing. And about a half hour in my husband finally sat down with us, b/c he had been in and out of the room catching moments of it, and would laugh. At the end of the movie he said &#34;That was a really good movie!!&#34; I agreed and hopped on Amazon and bought it. Maybe my hopes weren't high, but this movie really was good.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|A smart and honest show.  The characters are well developed and interesting. The plots are believable and entertaining.  Great to find a show that is written for intelligent adults.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best HO/point/click adventure games I have played in a long time! I would not usually spend $4.99, but this time I'm sure glad I did. What a terrific game!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This Jack Teacher novel was entertaining and good. However it wasn't \\"great\\"<br /><br />There were times it prodded along. It was good but not great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It Had me hooked from start to finish. Definitely a can't put down page turner and always to the point.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Another of his excellently written and surprisingly well informed books.  You're into it from paragraph one, and as ever, Forsyth weaves in parallel sub-plots to the finale.  If you've not read a Frederick Forsyth novel, this is as good as any to get you hooked.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Never has Stephen King written a book so well. From the beginning to the end I could not put this book down.I am at 78% on my Kindle.Need to finish it tonight.I only prat that they turn it into a MOVIE.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|We downloaded this for my son while he was sick and had to miss school. He enjoys the game and I enjoy helping him play.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I have read all of P.G.'s other books on the War of the Roses, and eagerly waited for this one. Unfortunately, I found it very depressing compared to her other books. Henry VII is utter unlikable, and seems to go from sullen and grumpy to enraged in seconds, very often. And what is this about Elizabeth sleeping with Richard? As far as I know, there is no evidence of that. P.G. seemed to take more liberties with this one than her other books. I liked her other books because they filled in little gaps in history, rather than rewriting chunks of it. Finally, I disliked how the book ended on a very depressing event, unlike a triumph like her others.<br />That being said, the novel was told with her usual flair for language, and Elizabeth, when she isn't moping, is a very interesting character who deserved better than what life handed her.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and I didn't want it to end but wanted to know what happened.  Wonderful view of peoples perceptions.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Still doing the 5x5s but the interface just seems easier than others have worked with.  I guess the ability to see that what you have done so far is correct moves things along. I am looking foward to the 10x10s
B00CWY76CC|5.0|But put on your thinking cap! It really makes you think and I am only on room number 5. Really fun.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|just a master piece!!, excellent album with great songs, i hope the young people that  dont know about  cher work because the time without recording music give himself a chance to appreciate her talent, because cher is such a great artist like a person, and have done good for homeless, gay, lesbian, kids, womans and old people , everybody in general. the less she deserve is respect and recognition for her job and not hate of bad people that dont know anything about her. love u cher beautiful album xoxoxoxox
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|What a breath of fresh air \\"Dead Medium\\" turned out to be. May, a grumpy and lonely old lady, dies suddenly and discovers to her dismay that she is \\"the rarest of ghosts.\\" That is to say, she has become a medium, which is the refreshing twist in this tale, as she is of course dead, and so speaks on behalf of the other ghosts to the living. The story tells us how she uses this new \\"talent\\" to help Chloe (alive) keep her house, after meeting Penny on the \\"other side.\\" It was a pleasant read told in a humorous tone and I recommend it wholeheartedly.
0142501123|5.0|Haven't read it yet. The pictures definitely got my kids attention already. Definitely worth the money. I received everything I ordered very quickly.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very addicting can play it and time goes by and you don't even know it.  Only wish you  didn't have to reload game every time you die only draw back so far that is only complaint. The minions are a blast I love the different costumes they have great fun for whole family.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John grisham did it again with this Fast easy read that keeps one's interest. I would recommend this book if you're looking for filling time on the beach or anywhere.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|What can I say? I am a huge Sailor Moon fan, and when I saw that there were figures of my favorite characters being made, I knew I had to have them. So, onto the review.<br /><br />I love this figure. I do not own any Bandai figures, but I know very much about figures, mostly Figmas(I have seven). However, the joints are a little stiff. But I have seen a few reviews on this figure, and even though the joints seem stuff, this is apparently much better than previous Bandai figures. The hands are a bit troublesome, they often will pop out. This should be a lesson for Bandai, Good Smile Company has come a long way with interchangeable hands. The bangs also took a bit of finagling to get out, as well as the face, but once out they were easy to interchange.<br /><br />And here's a plus: HER PIGTAILS MOVE. Not her odango buns, but the pigtails do move and even pop out. It was very fun moving them around with different poses.<br /><br />The paint job was amazing. I've seen other reviews saying that it was botchy and uneven, but everything was beautiful, especially the face and the moon sticks. And the hair goes from a solid color to a bit transparent the farther down her pigtails. Simply marvelous!<br /><br />Not only does she come with a moon stick, she comes with two! One with the Phantom Silver Crystal and one without, so you can  pose her as she is healing one of the seven great youma or after! I thought it was a very nice touch. It would have been even better if she came with the Cutie Moon Rod, but I can see why, these figures must be first season only. Hopefully if these figures do well so they can come out with more! Woohoo! She also even comes with a Luna! Her tail moves as well as her head.<br /><br />Overall, I love this figure. She is.. pretty! Ahaha!! But anyways, I am very excited to get the rest of the pretty sailor soldiers! I really hope they make the rest of the soldiers. Well, maybe at least Chibi-Usa! Then I'd be happy!<br /><br />I love this figure, andI hope this review helped you out!
B000I186FW|5.0|Great story and performance by Portman.  A must watch!!  The movie starts and ends well.  Keeps you wanting for more.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Addictive game.<br /><br />But its annoying to ask for reviews.  Very simple to learn but i could not put it down.
B00BGD8CFK|2.0|I ordered the &#34;Tangerine Tango&#34; orange case.  The color was very bland.  If you are hoping for something like a &#34;blaze orange&#34;, you will be disappointed.  The orange is very dull.<br /><br />The case didn't fit too good.  It was particularly loose around the bottom of the phone.  I don't mean to bash the product, but there are other cases out there that are much better - some are even cheaper, and others are more expensive.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was very good but very intense.  Great cast, the acting was really good, I would watch again.  Very little profanity which is nice.
0142403873|4.0|This is a silly rhyming book with the introduction of a creature that is less than attractive...it's singsongy rhymes make it fun and easy to follow.  It has a simple story with a decent ending.  Colorful illustrations.
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|The product was defective and seller refuse to give a refund. Customer service very rude. Imagine giving your kids a gift that doesn't work. Hopefully it will happen to them. I won't even give them 1 star. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING WATCHES AT JOMASHOP.
1451626096|5.0|Philippa Gregory is a great history writer.<br />The story is compelling and set in  the turmoil that succeded the battle of Bosworth.<br />I am fascinated by that period.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I don&quot;t like my little pony but this app is awesome! Take my advice.<br /> This game is the best game I've played in a while.
B0090CVJZ4|3.0|As stated,this is my first time using banana plugs. I usually just thread the wire through the speaker inputs. Since I am new to using these,packaged instructions would have been helpful. They seem to be of good quality and the container is easy to get into. I'm using the side hole,couldn't figure out how to use the bottom one. As suggested by my speaker manufacturer, I am using 16 gauge wire. Most of the connections seem solid. I have only had 1 wire come loose, and that was easily fixed. So I would recommend these,but there has to be a slightly more secure connector out there.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A great continuation of the series. I don't know why all the bad reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it and the whole series to any reader. Now just to wait for the next book to be written.
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|A good read although took me some time to get into it given I'd read the 2 earlier books 9 and then 2 years ago, respectively. Atwood has a fabulous imagination and tells vividly of the possible world we could be faced with (minus the gene splicing perhaps) if we continue to warm our planet.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Not too much adware/network spam. Easy gameplay and instructions. Plenty of variety to the puzzles. Love that it can be played in different sizes
B00F88H5K2|2.0|2013-10-01
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is coo  but a lot if adds pop up and It is annoying the game is good for the kindle an  should download it
B008Y212PI|5.0|Kinda additive. Couldn't stop until I finished it. I got this when it was free but in hindsight. I would have paid the 2 bucks. fun.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This used to work perfectly, but........<br />FIX THIS NOW. EVERY TIME  I TRY TO LOG IN , IT SAYS &quot;Can't log in right now, try again in a bit.&quot; WE NEED AN UPDATE KIK TEAM, NOW!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I cannot believe how much I LOVE this album. For once all the great reviews are right on. Bruno is a revelation! I usually like more alternative music. I always thought he was too pop sounding for me. Who cares? Great music is GREAT music. Every. single. song. is phenomenal. I want to listen to them all over and over! My only complaint is that this album is so darn short. Please please release a double album next! I loooooove him!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This series of nonogram/grid puzzles is really fun and addicting. There are three grid sizes and you can set them to ignore errors if you want to...try them out.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Low noise level on heavy vinyl discs.  Music as I remembered from my younger years.  Lots of material I don't remember hearing before.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I used it to wake up for school every day but now it it poop the seconds ere all mest up. now I got up late for school
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game makes you think.  I found it both fun and challenging.  If you like to stretch. yourself then try this game.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Excellent movie. It was very unique and you never knew what was going to happen next. I though it was so much better and more interesting than Twilight. I loved it and so did my husband.
0385349947|5.0|I loved this book. Everyone thinks that woman are treated equally in the work place but it really isn't true. This book is a must read for all women looking to take on a career and a family
B004SOR4H6|3.0|some glitches but it's ok at times, like at a point the App stops and don't wanna make me sign in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The product is good itself but I think it needs more power ups and more outfits. I like this product a lot!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|it kept me wanting more and more, i did not want it to end. can't wait to start season 2!!!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Installing Apalon's Alarm clock pretty much made my Kindle Fire unusable. It was fine for 2 days, then the ads started to get obtrusive, popping up constantly. My Kindle became extremely laggy and I would awake to no alarm and a popup ad. I uninstalled Alarm Clock then reinstalled and the performance degraded further. Too bad. The clock display is nice when it's working and the alarm settings are easy. Address the memory issue and you may have a nice app.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book Is very inspiring it is also very good for children under the age of 12 and 13 .
B00E9P959O|5.0|I was surprised to hear how different the album sounds after the remix. The sound is much wider and less compressed and all the different sound components have their own individual space. They did a good job.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Myst like game in the palm of your hand. Got it as a faotd and enjoyed it thoroughly.looking forward to their other games.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This is one happy Rush fan.<br /><br />Vapor Trails is an album I always wanted to like. I could hear potential in it, but the sound was just so sloppy and harsh.  Everyone knew is was rust from their long hiatus, but that didn't help the quality of the sound, and it always frustrated me to say \\"I love all of their albums, except...\\"<br /><br />But the improvement is immediately evident the second you hit play here.  I've only listened to the new version once, but I suspect this one will be easily jumping up in my ranking of their post-hiatus material above Snakes and Arrows, and perhaps even Clockwork Angels.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love it!  It's interesting and I got hooked easily.  I have always enjoyed figuring out puzzles, and I had never come across a puzzle like these.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This movie is a vehicle for Brad Pitt and very little in the way of plot.  The book was OK, but the movie is just boring.  I can't address the ending.  I quit watching with just over 40 minutes remaining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read the original shining back at seventeen. Although this book does not inhabit a scarier medium, it delves into much more adult orientated problems that would come along with any psychic ability. A ride from start to finish; seeing Dan &#34;Danny&#34; Torrence complete his journey and become a sort of mentor himself warms the heart. Full of gasps and gut wrenching honesty, Dr Sleep is a grand novel and well worth your time. Watch out for those turnpikes constant reader.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I loved the movie but I'm still not sure about the idea of the alternate universe concept.<br />If you watched the series as I have you know when &#34;things&#34; took place. Khan was a big part<br />of the series and the villian in Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan. But I do find myself really liking these<br />characters and very interested in the story lines.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book! It was just so perfect all around! I read it in one day. If I could give it more then 5 stars I would! It's a must read!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Out of all of the Jurassic Park movies this one is my favorite. The story line was very good<br />however I didn't care for the idea that Dinosaurs could open doors.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I loved it<br />I disliked that there was to many words<br />I liked that it gave every single word ok
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|I don't know if it's the cable or the devices I'm trying to use it with ... but, it doesn't work in my car or with my surround sound ipod dock.
B00A25NLOU|5.0|My first book purchased for my new Kindle. Super fast download meant that I started reading immediately! It was what they call in the venacular a real page turner. Entertaining and very well written. I was not disappointed. A rollciking good read
B003ABZCX6|5.0|This album is incredible; a must-have for any fan of hard rock, metal, or great guitar-playing & instrumentation.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I was under the impression that the disc itself was going to be red or blue, as it shows in the picture.  Not a huge deal, but the colored record is an eye-catcher that I was looking forward to.
0811879542|5.0|This is the cutest book ever!! After my granddaughter received it, and I knew it would become one of my favorite go-to gifts. I've given it numerous times, and the recipient's reaction is always the the same. The giggles and wide-eyes that come when the child thinks they're &#34;magic&#34; is priceless.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A fun puzzle game that makes you think a little different to solve it. I would compare it to a picture version of sudoku.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Absolutely an amazing movie. I seen it on the big screen and totally enjoy owning it and watching it at home.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love it! I love picross and this is a great app that is really good at introducing it and teaching you how to play in order to go on to harder picross apps and puzzles.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Its well made but the overall action and inter-action is not in the same class as Band of Brothers. I did enjoy it through.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Pretty good game, there are some that are better but this is a good time waster.  Quite a few levels but don't like that you have to write a review to get bonus levels.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Loved how it carried on from the white queen. Elizabeth York was a good queen. Awe some great story word
