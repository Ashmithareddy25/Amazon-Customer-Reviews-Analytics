B001AQTWF2|3.0|I'm thrilled to hear Whitney sing again, but be warned--this isn't 80s Whitney, or even 90s Whitney for that matter.  This is Whitney now.  There is still some power there, but it's limited.    After a 7 year wait, I expected more than 11 tracks, especially when half of them are lackluster.  But the tracks that shine (\\"Call you Tonight\\", \\"I Look to You\\", \\"Worth It\\", \\"Salute\\") are worth the price of the album.

B001U6YI92|4.0|I've now owned 5 versions of the film,  2-tape VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, restored 'full-length' DVD, and now the Blu Ray version...<br /><br />I'm sure that if I added up the total amount spent on all of the purchases,  I'd find that I've spent over $150 on this film...<br /><br />It's been well worth it !<br /><br />And, especially since the cost of the Blu Ray edition, is less than almost all the previous purchases... (Available for between $14 and $16).<br /><br />It contains the restored 'full-length' version of the movie (like the restored DVD edition), but does not come with all of the 'extras' such as the original movie posters and booklet that were in the 'box' for the DVD.<br /><br />When I played it (Sony BDP-BX2 player, Sony STR-DA3400ES upscaling receiver, Sony KDL-55xbr8 LED tv), it didn't seem to be up to 'true' HD quality,  (though, all of the 'close-ups' of faces were perfect, as they always were on the previous editions, due to the high quality of the original film).<br /><br />I didn't think that much had improved over the DVD release (which looked very good on my 'triple' upscaling video setup),  UNTIL I played the DVD version again, and noticed the difference.<br /><br />There is a great improvement in 'contrast'.  Dark areas (in shadows, etc) are now visible (note the stucco wall to the left of the table that Angel Eyes stands next to in his first scene). And, the higher bitrate gives greater clarity to the sky, the ground (pebbles in the dirt, blades of grass) and all of the 'wide' background scenery.  Compare the scene after Clint and Eli Wallach cross the river (where the bridge was blown up) climbing the hillside (approaching the camera).  The DVD release is all 'jaggy' and 'dark',  while the Blu Ray version shows every detail of the bodies strewn about the ground.<br /><br />You may not notice the enhanced 'detail' if you have a small TV screen,  but when shown on the larger models (50\\" and above) the improvements become much more apparent...<br /><br />The 'restored' DVD release had added a 5.1 soundtrack, with 'added' sound effects.  The Blu Ray goes beyond this, with the DTS-HD format, which (to me at least) sounds less 'added on' and has more 'punch'.  The second blast from the cannon, when Eli Wallach attempts to get to the cemetery without Clint was much more pronounced (especially with a subwoofer).<br /><br />The bottom line is, that any improvement to the film is worth it...

B000TBJSDU|5.0|Yes, the Beatles are back in the limelight once again! And sure, LP's are hot again as well. While we all love both, I feel I could offer a little advice when it comes to buying Rubber Soul on vinyl.<br /><br />The vinyl reissues of Beatle albums these days are the same as the CD reissues, as in, they are tracked in their original UK order... as opposed to the US Capitol order. A good thing, because we all know that the US were just ripping everybody off, by making their own butchured mixes of The Beatles work at the time. Sure. It especially started to piss the Beatles off around the time of Rubber Soul too, because at this point, they were really starting to view the album on a whole, rather than just a collection of singles... etc.<br /><br />However, I must say, that with Rubber Soul, you are better off getting the US Capitol mix. It is one of a handful of albums where I like to have both the US and UK versions. While the CD is only available with the UK mix, you can still find the US version if you hunt hard enough (right here!) and get it on vinyl.<br /><br />Sure some key songs are missing. Theres no Drive My Car or Nowhere Man (they went on that infamous album where the Beatles are holding butchured baby parts on the cover), and theres a George song and a Ringo song missing as well (both of which I find to be filler anyway).<br /><br />The songs that are added kick off each side. I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE on side one, and IT'S ONLY LOVE on side two. To me, this is the one album where the US version got the mix better than the UK. These two songs flow much better in the grand scheme, and give the album a much tighter theme over all... (the game ain't all about holding hands and feeling fine... but say the word and you'll be free!)  ...I never thought Drive My Car fit as well next to NORWEIGEN WOOD as Just Seen A Face did, and John Lennons GIRL just seems to be made to go alongside It's Only Love in my opinion.  Therefore, I find the U.S RUBBER SOUL to be the better album,  and if you collect LP's then it's a no brainer in my book. Make sure you have a copy of the US CAPITOL release!!llect LP's then it's a no brainer in my book. Make sure you have a copy of the US CAPITOL release!!

B000GIXEIG|4.0|this movie was by no means perfect but I found it highly enjoyable. I think it was well cast and it was a unique take on this classic tale. As the title indicates, Grendel is more central in this version. He is more than a one dimesional monster. He is a chracter with thoughts, and feelings, and motivations for his actions. I like this idea. I also particualary enjoyed some of the religiouse commentary that was added. I thought it was a great way to adress the fact that while Beowulf is has a Heathen Norse setting, the text that we have was obviously written down by a Christian (or possibly several), who put his religious slant on all the characters and events.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for fans of the the story and also for Heathen looking for a good show with a few laughs.

B002DKGWSE|2.0|This is like a severely watered down version of the original and it is far less shocking. The original was so scary and so real and so sick that I think if I ever saw one of the actors in it I would run as though a member of the Manson family showed up.  It was that bad.  Almost like watching Faces of Death or something.  Really creepy and just evil.  I wouldn't watch it again alone or in the wrong frame of mind.  This remake barely evokes anything close to that.  And I find it funny that in 2009 the filmmakers didn't dare have the mother take a bite out of crime so to speak like in the original.  Those of you giving this a glowing review in comparison to the Wes Craven version are delusional if not connected to the production or something.
0977476073|1.0|The translator of this books claims, \\"if you have read one of these older translations of 'Mein Kampf,' then you have not read the REAL 'Mein Kampf' which is found only in the Ford Translation,\\" that it is \\"the most accurate translation ever produced,\\" and that it is translated \\"with no translator's bias.\\"  These claims are dubious, at best, and are indicative of a central problem with this book.    \\"Mein Kampf\\" has a reputation in Translation Studies as a difficult work.  And any translation has a bias, as translating a text is always a work of interpretation.  Ford gets some things rights, but many things wrong: See the review by my colleague Randall Bytwerk, an expert in Nazi propaganda.    Contrary to Ford's claims, Ralph Manheim's translation (Mariner Books, available through Amazon) is widely acknowledged as the most faithful English version in terms of style and content. Stephen Baumgarten, an expert on the translations of \\"Mein Kampf,\\" told me that the Manheim translation is the most literal one, makes the best effort to echo the original text, and is readable.  Even the \\"white pride\\" folks recommend the Manheim translation, though you might think they'd prefer James Murphy's official, sympathetic translation from 1939.    In deciding between the Ford translation and the Manheim translation, consider using credibility as criterion, if nothing else.  Manheim won a MacArthur Foundation \\"genius\\" award, a National Book Award, a prize from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.  Moreover, the PEN award for career excellence in translation (which Manheim won in 1962) is now called the Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation.
0670020478|2.0|It is a long time since I have read any self-help type books, so I can't readily compare with any recent examples of this burgeoning genre. But at least that means I might be able to read this tome with something of a fresh mind.     If you read and understand a sentence such as `Follow your passion' - you have the essence of this book. But it's long in the telling: following one's passion takes on a quasi-religious role denoted as the `Element' (with a capital `E'). Like all religions, no proof of the metaphysics is offered; instead we are forced to sit through a long list of examples from the world of celebrity. (And I couldn't help wondering: \\"Sure. Paul McCartney is great. And is, no doubt, following his passion and doing very well out of that. With no disrespect to myself, I am probably not a Paul McCartney\\"). A few more examples of how ordinary Jill & Joe had found their passion and were now living extraordinary lives would have added to this book. Sadly, such examples are lacking, apart from the odd reference to a car salesman who likes taking surfing photos (which didn't do much for me).     I will acknowledge that the book did make me painfully aware that my working life was not spent with my `Tribe'. Although whether my `Element' and `Tribe' truly exist and whether I can find them, I am no more the wise.     The book could have been so much more if it offered a way for us to actually find our Element. Instead, we are required to sit through more dreary examples and a critique of the modern education system, which may be of some interest to those with a particular concern for education, but is of little interest, perhaps, to those of us looking to change our lives some distance away from childhood education. Again, I agree that Paul McCartney may not have benefited much from his formal education; but for the rest of us, unless we have a major hidden talent, it probably does pay to pass a few exams before we face the world of work.     In the end, I was reminded of Hume's injunction (on books concerning reasoning), if the book hadn't cost so much, it was better committed to flames. As I said at the beginning, I haven't read much of this genre, but I'm sure there are far better books out there to assist one move, say,  out a of mid-life crisis or into one's life career.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I just finished a review of Jackie McClean's [[ASIN:B0002KQNZY Destination Out!]] which said that McClean's album was one of two \\"chamber\\" jazz albums that defined this genre in the 1960s. Right here is the second of those two.<br /><br />Like 1963's Destinstion Out, Out To Lunch by Eric Dolphy contains a music that mixes complex blues changes,  avant gaurde splashes, and classical elements that bridged the gap between traditional and free form jazz. The two albums even share Bobby Hutcherson, the premire vibraphonest in what was then called \\"the new jazz, the new thing, or the new music.\\"<br /><br />But there are differances: enter Mr. Tony Williams. With all due defferance to Roy Haynes--and there is a lot due--William's used counterrythms and came up with combinations no one else could even think of, much less play. Haynes was a hard bop drummer with a musical spirit adventurous enough to add flair to the \\"new\\" music. Williams was to the drums what Paul McCartney is to the bass. He simply plays the instrument in a whole new way, which turns out to be the BEST way.<br /><br />This impacts Out To Lunch in that the numbers don't always have the solid swing bottom Haynes would provide. Listen to \\"Hat and Beard\\" from Out To Lunch. Williams works in syncopations and fills that are 100% him. No one else sounds like this. Most drummers use fills to add variation to the bottom. For Williams, the fills IMPLY the bottom, which is always there.  Dolphy, Williams and the rest of the band feed off the wierd rythms created, and the music seems to float in some pulse that is otherworldly, yet completely solid. Williams and Dolphy are like boxers counterpunching.<br /><br />On Destination Out! there is not so much dissonence as  counterpoint: the atonal aspects spring from the compostion and not the soloing. Out To Lunch is the freer of the two albums: the chord changes are more complicated, and the players solo far outside them at times.<br /><br />Out To Lunch also features Dolphy on flute-and I have to check but if I am not mistaken-bass clarinet. Freddy Hubbard also is here in usuall brillance.  This adds more variation to the music, especially when Dolphy's flute playing sometimes takes on such an errie tone.<br /><br />Please do not misunderstand: both albums are equally great, but McClean's for its chrystral clear writting and Dolphy's for its complications and otherworldly playing. Both provide excellent introductions to this underappreciated cornor of jazz and both are essential for their differance and their sameness.if I am not mistaken-bass clarinet.

B0029LHW4U|4.0|Having grown up listening to Alice in Chains, and remembering vividly when singer Layne Staley was found dead in 2002, saying I was skeptical about Jerry Cantrell bringing the rest of the band back together with a new member is saying it lightly indeed.  Thankfully, and surprisingly, \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" marks a triumphant return for Alice in Chains, and it's one that has been long overdue.  New singer/guitarist William DuVall may not be able to replicate Layne's booming voice, but he fares quite well in comparison to sharing vocal duties with Jerry, who manages to come up with a sludgy sound reminiscent of the band's 1995 self-titled release.  Opening track \\"All Secrets Known\\", along with single \\"Check My Brain\\", \\"Your Decision\\", \\"Acid Bubble\\", and \\"Private Hell\\" are great cuts, and even though the album bears more resemblance to one of Jerry's solo releases the longer it goes on for, make no mistake that at its heart \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" does the name Alice in Chains proud.  All in all, no matter how skeptical you may be about this new era of Alice in Chains, give \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" a chance.  You'll be happy that you did.
0385503954|4.0|I had to think long and hard before giving this book as many as 4 stars, and maybe one day I may regret it. But anyone who can conjure up so much hate in a reader toward a character for pages upon pages, to the extent of wanting to pull one's hair out, is certainly worthy of 4 stars despite its flaws.     There were points where the tension was so fraught I had to stop to catch my breath. I simply couldn't bare the injustice Briony had caused Cecilia and Robbie.     The ending of the first act honestly left me standing, screaming, yes, yes, yes! It was brilliant, the type of fall-to-the-floor, gasping, hand-over-the-forehead drama you would only see at a Verdi Opera.     The second act seemed to be a complete and unnecessary detour. While the reader is anxious to get on with the story, we are forced to endure battle scene upon battle scene of Robbie's troops in France, which would have been fine had McEwan only spent, oh, let's say, 25 pages, instead of the more than 100 pages of what then seemed like a story losing its focus.  The writing was top form and hypnotizing, but the detour from the story was entire too drastic and may have ruined the novel for many.     The end, last Act in London, what can one say; awkwardly brilliant. Wonderfully written. McEwan has a way of making you feel like you're glued to the pages. I ceased to see words, and only images, and extremely clear ones. While some may complain about the slow pace of the book, that may have been what was needed in order to create such vivid and authentic imagery.
B000RW3VD4|4.0|Hard to believe it's been over 20 years since the release of the movie that gave us the clever tag-line \\"Greed is good.\\"<br /><br />The now double-irony of that phrase could not really be foreseen except by a prophet or time traveler from the future we now inhabit.<br /><br />Maybe greed is not so good.  Maybe the ideas of capitalism and democracy are not even fraternal twins from the same father.<br /><br />What has gone wrong?<br /><br />Take another look at this film with the hindsight that two decades provides.

After all, the money Madoff made off with is greater than the wealth of publisher Randolph Hearst, the purported character on which Kane was based.  But what's Madoff's \\"Rosebud\\"?

031604461X|2.0|I've been completely consumed with these books.  I managed to read the first three back to back in just a couple of days, taking valuable time out of my busy life to do so, hugging the first three beautiful books to my chest in reverence. I get to breaking dawn and was let down... completely. Breaking dawn sucks alot, that's been said a number of times here, but I would like to believe that there is still hope for this story.  Now that its been confirmed that there is a movie deal for this book, I think the screen writer should go all true blood on us, deviate from the book, and wow us. They owe it to the fans, and they owe it to the characters of the story.   The movie should be every thing the book wasn't, and it should be a not-for-teen movie as well,  it should go far enough to satisfy the multifaceted audience that these books now have.  I'm pretty sure most of us are not  young adults anyway, and even if we are....this is the kind of story that grows with you....the messages should be correct since it has managed to impact our lives and hopes for love so strongly.  We can't have women and young girls out there with all the wrong ideas about how these things work. It needs to be redeemed, it would be the responsible thing to do.      Edward and Bella's honeymoon- where the book failed:   After 2000+ pages Bella and Edward finally get to do the deed and Stephanie pretty much faded to black on us, Sent the message that sex is painful, you will get pregnant even if you think its impossible, and then you'll die!  Seriously Stephanie, have a little more faith in the intellect of your audience, I think we could handle a little more than this. Afterall, they were married now, you were being responsible enough when you added that detail.  Making sex suck after marriage....that deminishes the value of getting married, makes it look like its not worth it.  That's not a responsible message either!    Where the movie can fix this:  Make the scene really tastefully steamy yet a bit rough. Really SHOW Edward fighting a climax by holding on too tight to Bella's body, and SHOW Bella letting herself go completely in enjoyment.  Maybe let him accidentally bite her (instead of a damn pillow), and suffer thru the anxiety of not knowing whether he killed her, or turned her while he waits for Carlisle's help.     Scrap the whole half breed Renesmee with the pet pediphile werewolf, that just made the whole book jump the shark for me. It broke my heart to see it turn so corny.   First off Stephanie, you set the stage for us to think that a werewolf imprints on someone whose most likely able to carry the werewolf genes, why on earth would this be a child whose half vampire. You broke your own rule.  Not to mention the message it sent--Its okay to let Jake feel inappropriately about a child as long as everyone gets something out of it like a vampire-werewolf alliance.  Really Steph, some poor girl out there is probably now thinking that pedophilia may be acceptable under certain conditions.  You really shouldn't even have touched this topic at all....it doesn't  fit anywhere in the story anyway.  Jacob was a hero of this story that was worth his weight in gold, it would have been better for him to lose all his humanity and became a full blood wolf, or even die than imprint on a baby.  What were you thinking..... why did you do this to Jacob!!    How the movie can fix this:  Leah leaves Sam's pack and catches up with Jacob... their bitter love/hate relationships blossoms into an attraction as she nurses him thru the pain over Bella.  Jake decides to do something nice for Leah, he wants to take her out, so he  phases into a human to shower in a public pool locker room.  He comes out and spots some random girl and imprints on her.  Leah finds out .  She runs off sick of these guys not ending up with her and she tries to off herself.  But she just keeps healing every time she tries. She goes insane, and becomes a murderous werewolf and the packs haveto unite to take her down because no one can see her thoughts any longer.     Bella becomes a goody- two-shoes vampire  with no learning curve with hundreds of nauseating pages of self absorbed happily ever after, that she didn't even have to work for... and now Edward is nothing but a side kick booty call.   I mean really Stephanie, do you hate us or something??    How the movie can fix this:  Bella becomes a vampire,  sees and feels things more than she ever has before.  Actually VERBALIZES her feelings to Edward so that he can stop feeling so insecure around Bella since he can't read her mind.  This teaches women to tell a man what she wants and how she feels, instead of waiting for him to read her mind. It teaches women to make a man feel good too sometimes, instead of needing everything to be about her.  Instead  the whole relationship was about Bella, and she sucked it up, whiney and all.... she could've done more to try to please Edward too since she was suppose to be so selfless.    Edward told Bella in book one that she said she loved him while she was sleeping.  He said even though he didn't doubt that, it was nice to hear.....We all knew she worshipped Edward, but why didn't she ever let him know that too.  We will require a very ARTICULATE monolog from Bella professing her love for Edward she could never find the words for before to make up for all the overuse of blind-folding non-descriptive adjectives that littered this book.    Edward loves her now more than he thought he already did, to the point of even more gushy pain that no longer existed in his throat but moved to the heart he didn't know he had.      Bella attacks that hiker while they are hunting, Edward couldn't stop her in time.  She is overwhelmed with guilt, and he is overwhelmed with her pain.  She sneaks away to the Volturi, she wants to die to pay for the life of the human. Edward missed it because he couldn't read her thoughts.   He now has to go to  Italy and tries to stop her.  There's a fight  with the Volturi,  Carlisle Dies!   before they behead Edward Bella stops them, offers herself to them in exchange for his life.  They decide they want her to join them. She agrees in order to spare Edwards life...they later decide to keep him too. They live with the Volturi together.  The Cullens now hate Edward and Bella for causing Carlisle's death.  The Cullens are now their mortal enemy.  The movie ends with an open ending.         Give us what the book didn't ...make this movie the classic the books had so much promise to be.   I'm begging!!  Also if what I've said does become a movie...DIBS!

I love the songs on it, I even like how it all flows between early Madonna and the newer Madonna music, but I would rather have had GHV3 with the newer hits. There are some good hits that did not make it on here, such as \\"Jump\\" from the Confessions CD, \\"Give it 2 Me\\" on Hard Candy just to name a couple at the top of my head. A lot of these songs on here were already on Greatest Hits already. Like I said, I would rather have had the newer hits. Or make it a 3 disc box set of a definitive collection, or something. So even older hits like \\"Angel\\" could be on that. I don't know. But it does truly lack the newer hits, that even a casual fan could be disappointed. I would be if I was a casual fan. Madonna's last few albums have been mega hits, so to leave out as much as one song, to me just again, truly lacks to say the least. I do like the sound.  I don't think she can win, because unless it's a box set, all of her hits will never make it on a GH collecton. I did give it 3 stars, however, because what can I say, I do love the music. So it can't be all that bad! And she is the Queen!
B000002LFZ|5.0|Released in 1988, this Fleetwood Mac compilation features all the smash hits and, with the exception of \\"Rumours,\\" represents the group's finest album. Worth having for the unedited \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Sara\\" - not to mention the always-thrilling \\"Tusk,\\" \\"Say You Love Me\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way.\\" The CD still omits the U.S. Top 20 singles \\"Think About Me\\" and \\"Seven Wonders,\\" but Christine McVie's \\"As Long As You Follow\\" is a keeper. An ideal starting point for the uninitiated listener.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|I really love the videos and I think this is a real must have for any Madonna fan. The only thing is and it is the reason I gave it four instead of five stars, is because there are missing videos. I suppose there was not space because she has so many hits and so many videos. But nevertheless, I really enjoy this collection of videos! I love it and I really admire her work!
0767834739|4.0|It wasnt a perfect movie, but I cant understand the relentless bashing of it either. I thought it followed the plotlines (and characters/monsters) of the game a lot closer than the first (which I think was a good thing). Maybe I'm just an unashamed fan of the VG, but I thought this was the better effort of the series. It is what it is...a fairly cinematographic, fast paced popcorn movie.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|This is a type of release that makes a quick buck for Warner, nothing more really. The quality is incredibly poor, it makes the whole thing look cheap, even the cover looks cheap. Why they didn't use double layered dvd's is beyond me!!! It's such a shame. Everything looks pixelated and very poor. Celebrating Madonna's years in the business and what we get is this! Even the release of the earlier dvd's and videos are in much better quality than this. I am sooo disappointed with this. It's not a thank you to the fans, it's more like a f*** you. And forget the 5.1 sound, there is no such thing on this collection. They also managed to put a black sticker in Justify My Love, nice \\"extra footage\\" that was promised - was that it?!! When this video (JML) was released in 1990 it had no sticker on it and it was in much better quality than this. OMG Warner, you've shot yourself in the foot. Thank God Madonna has left you. But I can also say that she should have had more of a hand in this than she did. I don't think there was much from her side on this.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Better the second time around. While it doesnt hold a candle to the 2nd film, it is only loosely based on the series, whereas Apocalypse will be the winner of the two to big fans of the videogame. The dialogue has its numbing moments, and yes, it could have been a lot more, but it still had a more cohesive feel than any of the videogame inspired crap from Uwe Boll. I wouldnt OWN it, but I would (and did) rent it in succession with the other two Resident Evil movies, and taken as the sum of the parts, it ain't bad.
B00005JL0I|3.0|Does everything have to be s-serious?  Can't we all just g-get along?  Alright!  Ursula Andress' name (Bear Naked?) doesn't appear in David Thomson's BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONAR OF FILM, but so what?  She's the best-looking piece of cineflesh in this hashish spectacle, and more than anything else, by far, partly naked, wiggling femenine bodies in every imaginable situation are in and of themselves all (or at least most) of what this movie has to offer.  Wildly forgettable Jiggle Music by Burt Bacharach.    Hashish spectacle, you say?  Well, mostly the result of confusion about production (who's in charge?); the primary star quits the show; there are at least three different, unresolved scripts; it appears there are four directors, each with his own favorite part of and kind of movie to direct, and casting is searching for any putative star or personality they can find to plug a hole as a cameo, and the scene designer(s) have gone stark, staring mad.  Let's go back:  It's 1967.  Five years ago DR. NO and the new Sean Connery took the world by storm, launching the James Bond 007 craze.  It was followed by FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, another sensation, and an even better movie.  With what looks like a franchise in the bud, Albert Broccoli appears to have found a gold mine.  How to get some of that money?    Fleming's first Bond novel, CASINO ROYALE, a wildly improbable story about an attempt by a novice agent to bankrupt a crack but corrupt soviet functionary with a gambling habit and millions of siphoned-off Soviet money to lose, at a crowded French casino, became somehow available.  The Producers dove for it and began production as quickly as possible.  Catastrophe!  The story proved useless.  They couldn't get Connery, but they got his co-star from DR. NO, the stunning Ms. Andress, gave her the name of Vesper Lind and kept her before the camera for as long as possible.  Apparently Peter Sellers, headliner, was to have played a presumably comic Bond, but he bailed out and theninto the more professionally produced and sillier PINK PANTHER movies.  Was he miffed because the producers hired Woody Allen to play yet another version of Bond?  And let him bring his own material?  He needn't have been.  Allen's appearances on screen, are about as amusing as watching gangrene fester.    The star of the mix-up appears to be David Niven, who manages to get through it without making an ass of himself.  He plays in rather an over-longish, not terribly funny bit, against Deborah Kerr.  She's the widowed lady of a castle staffed and stuffed with horny, nubile red-haired scotch maidens, and he's an interloper come to confront or to comfort her.  Either or both.    What saves this dog and pony show is the fact that the Psychedelic Sixties are in full bloom, and the Western World turns for a decade, into Lotus Land.  It was like the 20s, but instead of Gin, with Marijuana.  It was everywhere.  It was cheap.  In big cities, people gave it away on street corners.  People kept it on cocktail tables in sticks, rolled, or they offered it to you as a matter of course.  People everywhere began to find other aspects beside the obvious desirable, in viewing cinema, and were often to be seen with the sound low or disguised or overriden by other sounds or music, simply watching the screen and laughing simplemindedly at what they took to be hallucinations.  This social blowback it was that gave the movie its saving grace.  It wasn't funny, it was preposterous, but in a drugged-up, high kind of way.  The movie began in hard focus, but changed until wide swaths of it oozed and swam in psychedellic pattern and color, indicative of nothing so much as a good head trip.  At one point, toward the end, a shapely woman named Joanna Pettet (possibly an English, Australian or New Zeland musical comedy personality) who was supposed to be James Bond's daughter by Mata Hari, began an interminable music and dance sequence -- a blonde woman dressed in sort-of Baliinese pagoda costume -- that goes in every conceivable and many inconceivable directions, up, down, side-wise, until, somehow, it ends.  Or just, just...  Disintegrates.  Don't ask.  And somewhere in there there's George Raft, doing...  Please, don't ask.    The long anticipated Bacarat game with LeChiffre takes place, more or less as expected, with Orson Welles, a sweaty Hindenberg -- corpulent quite beyond belief -- doing magic tricks above the gaming tables.  Charles Boyer, William Holden, John Houston, Jean-Paul Belmondo do their five minutes, variously, and take their money and run.  And somehow, throughout all this, occasionally, there's an extraordinary-looking woman in a big black wig, called Daliah Lavi, (East Jordan movie star) who apparently came with the Producer(s).  At her entrance on camera she is first thrown to the ground, fully dressed; and later appears naked, strapped to an operating table for Woody Allen to play with.  (Ms. Lavi can be seen to advantage in THE RETURN OF DOCTOR MABUSE, as The Photographer.)  Please, don't...    Anyway, I have the BOND collection, love them all for their eccentricities and excesses, and watch them frequently.  If what TV broadcasts or newscasts show me have any truth, drugs of many kinds are coming into the country regularly, dependably, and in quantity, and consequently one thinks they must be available at reasonable cost.  Somewhere or other...  If so, why not enjoy this particular 007 fantasy in the way it was intended/marketed?  Or any of the others, for that matter?  What's the difference?  I certainly used to escape regularly into them and, for an hour or so, imagine myself the dashing stud assassin of British Intelligence, wallowing in conspicuous consumption and the wet laps of magnificent women.  As long as the images remain stable on their media, why not enjoy ourselves again, and yet again?  Bond films are all Boss-Man sex dreams.  Why shouldn't we too dream we are Boss-Men?
0920668364|5.0|I am amazed by the negative reviews of this book. Some readers are looking too deep. There is no such thing as too much love. (smothering is not love ).  Children will enjoy the illustrations .  Parents will feel the emotion of love in their hearts as they read to their children. The book is clearly designed to touch the heart of the parent while entertaining the child.  Bringing the unconditional love into the air between parent and child is healthy.  God bless the author.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Nightmare Before Christmas / B001AIRUP4<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I vaguely recall missing out on seeing this famous movie at the original release, largely due to the fact that my conservative parents were displeased with the Halloween-style material, particularly the starring talking skeleton, Jack the Pumpkin King. And when - years later - my fiance brought this lovely Blu-Ray home, I was puzzled: why were we watching a Christmas movie in October?<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, despite the title, \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" isn't really 'about' Christmas in the usual TV special tradition kind of way - and that's a good thing. The arching story is that the king of the Halloween world is very, very good at what he does, but very, very bored and tired of life, his job, and his friends. When he accidentally stumbles into the Christmas world, he is delighted by the different sights, colors, and sounds - and rushes back to tell the Halloween residents of his discover. Though they are less enthused than he, Jack becomes increasingly obsessed with finding a new holiday outlet for himself and finally decides that this year's Christmas will be handled by the Halloween world residents!<br /><br />This interesting \\"bored with life\\" plot is carefully overlaid with truly beautiful music and lyrics - \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is a lovely musical, even judged by today's standards, this is music for all ages, not just little children. And, indeed, I can't imagine why children of all ages wouldn't enjoy \\"Nightmare\\" - despite the title, there is very little here which is scary or frightening (even the Boogie Man is silly to the point of hilarity), and I suspect that the titular \\"nightmare\\" is one of Jack's own devising - in learning his limits and coming to love what he's best at and appreciate those around him.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray transfer, this movie is absolutely lovely. Since it's animated, you're not going to see every pore on each actor's face, but the detail on the animated characters is surprisingly complex on such an old movie. I'll put it this way - I often can't even tell if a movie is blu-ray or not, but with \\"Nightmare\\" there was no doubt.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollrisingly complex on such an old movie. I'll put it this way - I often can't even tell if a movie is blu-ray or not, but with \\"Nightmare\\" there was no doubt.    ~ Ana Mardoll

0307266303|5.0|As a new runner, I was directed to this book  not knowing what to expect.  It is well written and caught my interest from the first page.  I only put it down when I have to.  Lots of insight to other cultures and ideas for improving your run.  It is a bit long - and since we run, an audio version would be appreciated.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Back in the 20th century, Hollywood used to make movies in which extravagant locations were actual locations, crowds of hundreds were hundreds of actual people, and the characters and events were actually interesting to watch.  In the current CGI era, almost everything is fake (and looks it).  Pop a copy of \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"Troy,\\" or \\"300\\" into your DVD player and you'll quickly feel like you're watching a Pixar cartoon or Japanese anime.  If you want to see the real thing, however, watch \\"El Cid.\\"  The binge of historical and Biblical epics of the 1950s and 1960s had its share of stinkers (if you can sit through \\"Cleopatra,\\" you deserve a Purple Heart), but when they were done right, they bordered on pure cinematic perfection.  The stunning visuals, the booming music, and so on: all of it was real.  In \\"El Cid,\\" Charlton Heston was perfectly cast (he wasn't trying to overdo the \\"man as heroic myth\\" bit, as in \\"The Ten Commandments\\"), and the subject was, and definitely still is, topical (Islamic rulers trying to take over the world: sound familiar?).  If your tastes lean toward CGI effects and computer games, you need to see \\"El Cid\\" in order to learn the definition of \\"great movie.\\"
B002ELM5HY|3.0|This album is well made but sounds just like the last one, nothing new from Mark, just more of the same...
B0012IV3RS|4.0|How can one best describe Lucio Fulci's prime cut of perversion, also known as \\"The New York Ripper\\"?  Sick?  Disgusting?  Crude?  Tasteless?  Senseless?    Yep, that pretty much sums it up.  NYR is a brutally violent masterwork by the master of brutal violence.  The plot doesn't always make sense, but I couldn't care less.  As a catalogue of human perversions, it's a de Sade classic.  As a portrait of grindhouse-era New York City, it's a Rembrandt.  As exploitation cinema at its most exploitative, it simply can't be beat.
B002DZX96C|5.0|\\"Infamous\\" means known widely and unfavorably. Which is hardly the case here. Until he retired last year, Brendel's live performances were known widely and favorably for decades, and his studio releases are pretty magnificent, too. Brendel recorded the complete Beethoven piano sonata cycle three times, an early version for Vox, this Decca set and a later Philips version. Although the sonics of this version can be pretty hissy, it's still my favorite. It would have been nice to know whether any remastering was done here to improve the sound. Because Amazon's lsitings are frequently missing such useful information, I guess you could say their editors are infamous.  ;)
B000F4RHB6|3.0|Here is the good about the album: The songs are great. The songs selected are very good it has something from every album but the Plan B album. The remastering is good too. I have all the albums and loved them as a kid growing as I do now in my 30's. It's great to have them all together. Also I will say kudos for including Back in Time from the B2theF soundtrack. The Crusin' song is on there too (edited).<br /><br />Here is the bad:<br /><br />The fact that they crammed all 21 of them onto 1 cd stinks. All the solos and great instrumental parts of the songs have been taken out. They should have done 2 discs in order to include the complete songs. I still have the time flies GH from '96. It only has 12 songs as I recall but they are unedited and the complete versions of the songs with solos. So I'll hang onto that. I realize they cd is 80 mins with 21 songs this is great but with the solos gone it's not a great as it could have been.

Not going to debate why her voice is not as powerful any longer but she does not have the range that she used to.

Maybe she should look into doing more movies[[ASIN:B001AQTWF2 I Look to You]]

B001EO748M|5.0|It's TV, not a history lesson, and The Tudors, Season 2 delivers good period drama, with plenty of courtly plotting. Natalie Dormer brings grit and moxie to her role as Anne Boleyn, and while Henry VIII was a bit older than Rhys-Meyers appears, it's amazing to watch as the king slides into the megalomania that characterized the second half of his reign. Nick Dunning is spot on as Anne's  cunning, cold father. Unfortunately, Anita Briem is miscast as Henry's next paramour, Jane Seymour, who was not the beautiful, nubile temptress portrayed here. The highlight of this season, of course, is the execution of Queen Anne, and what a death scene Ms. Dormer turns in, showing the mettle that gave Anne the power to dethrone a sitting queen. And the final scene, Henry enjoying a \\"subtlety\\", reveals him as the selfish tyrant that he truly was.<br /><br />This is a grand, sumptuous production, with eye popping costumes and scenery. While it could easily have gone over the top, the directors deserve credit for using at least a modicum of restraint. This series is great fun. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a wonderful viewing experience.
0307269981|5.0|This entertaining reading brings back Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomqvist. The latter is named after Astrid Lindgren's boy detective Bill Bergson. The installment reveals Lisbeth's childhood. In fact, the plot ferrets out her past secrets. The author improves characterization in the sequel. The most lovable characters are the worst, the different, and the odd. The ending cuts off as if Larsson were in mid-sentence. For me, the suspense is too much. I cannot imagine not reading Hornet.

0375836675|4.0|This novel follows the life of Ed Kennedy. Under aged and under accomplished, this small town cab driver does not expect his life to become anymore that what exists for him presently. After stopping a bank robbery by sheer luck, Ed began receiving Ace cards. Each card brings new individuals names to help. The only thing that Ed doesn't know is what message he was supposed to deliver.  This is intended for an older young adult audience. The protagonist is nineteen years old, therefore a younger teen perhaps not be able to relate to the older male character. Ed Kennedy is on the brink of leaving the young adult world and entering the world of adulthood. It contains stronger language, violence, sex, and underage consumption. Though these issues pervade the novel, each has purpose within the text. The language helps to develop Ed's personality; it's not just thrown into shock or just to say the words. The violence help's to develop Ed's emotional complexity. The sex and consumption gives the story a realistic feel, as it is present in the lives of young adults.  Don't go into this story expecting a strong realistic ending. The journey to the end of the novel overshadows the ending by design. Markus Zusack concentrates the lens of focus upon Ed transformation, and not necessarily upon making it realistic. Overall, it's a good read with personality and spunk. Ed is a unique and fresh character. The ending took awhile for me to accept, but the overall concept is excellent.
0385737947|4.0|When Thomas wakes up, he finds himself on an elevator going up and up through a seemingly endless darkness. The only thing he remembers is his first name. When the elevator doors open, he finds himself surrounded by dozens of other young boys. Thomas has arrived in the Glade, a large open-air place surrounded by high stone walls.<br /><br />The other boys don't remember anything of their previous lives either. All they know is that they arrived in the Glade the same way. Once a month, a new boy arrives on the elevator. Each morning, openings appear in the stone walls and the way is open to the Maze. Each evening at sunset, the openings in the wall close for the night.<br /><br />Thomas stumbles a bit as he learns the slang the other boys use, but from the beginning, he has the faintest glimmers that he knows this place. When he looks out into the Maze, he knows that he has to explore it. And the very next day when the first girl ever sent up on the elevator to the Glade arrives, every boy living there knows that, somehow, things are about to change.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, I was stumbling around as much as Thomas-- becoming acquainted with the characters, trying to get used to the annoying slang, getting a feel for this world that author James Dashner has created and put me in the middle of. It didn't take long for me to get my bearings and start becoming fascinated with this strange new land. What on earth were these young boys doing in the middle of a gigantic maze patrolled by monstrous creatures? It had to be some sort of test...but why? To what purpose?<br /><br />I knew when I picked up The Maze Runner that it was the first book in a trilogy, so I was not surprised or angered by the cliffhanger ending. Multi-volume Young Adult series seem to be the order of the day.<br /><br />Dashner has created a very interesting world for his characters, and it will be very interesting indeed to follow this story in the next two books. The only thing that annoyed me as I read was the slang that the boys spoke. I didn't find it difficult to decipher, and it's probably just a sign of my age, since I find the speech patterns of many tweens and teens irritating!<br /><br />If you like reading about a world in which something has gone very wrong and about characters who are trying to fight their way out of it, you will enjoy The Maze Runner. It won't take long for you to realize that Thomas and the others aren't the only ones trying to solve the puzzle of the labyrinth...so are you.he boys spoke.

Everyone has his own preference in music, but after over 40 years of being totally enthralled with what music can do for you, Bonamassa is the one who hits the resonance with me. In this performance, he hits his prime. I feel this is an exceptional DVD, his best work yet. Every time Bonamassa puts out a piece of work, I think it is better than the last. This is no exception. A fine piece of work. Thank you Joe.    PS    I had to add, ALL the players in this concert, Rick Melick (keyboards, background vocals, & tambourine), Carmine Rojas (bass), Bogie Bowles & Anton Fig (drums - check out High Water Everywhere), Lee Thornburg (trumpet), Sean Freeman (saxophone - check out Asking Around for You) and last, but not least, Mike Feltham (trombone) all put in absolutely fantastic performances.

The skipping back and forth between time periods was at first distracting, but once I got into the manner in which it was being told, each switch whet my appetite for the next.

B001TH16DS|4.0|My wife and I are a couple of Trekkies and couldn't wait for the series to come out on Blu Ray. You can tell the people who worked on this project put a lot of love and respect into their work. The picture is awesome! I like just looking at the restored and enhanced Enterprise. We have just one quibble; why aren't the episodes in order. We collected the series on VHS and each tape had two episodes with original air dates on them. The episodes in this set don't coincide. What's up with that?

140120841X|3.0|Maybe my expectation were too high after reading my first graphic novel \\"Watchmen,\\" but I was rather underwhelmed by this critically acclaimed story.<br /><br />The concept was intriguing. Moore once again creates a clever political dystopia. The novel is set in 1990s UK which is under the rule of the fascist party.  The party came to power after a nuclear war which eradicated Africa and Europe and drastically changed climate which in turn caused various natural disasters, hunger, and chaos in the country. V is a masked vigilante whose goal is to overthrow the totalitarian government and to bring the country into a state of anarchy which, in his opinion, will help people of England to establish a new fair and honest regime.<br /><br />I did like the idea of the book (BTW I wonder what was so special about 1970s that gave Moore these crazy dystopian ideas), as for the execution, it definitely lacked. First of all, I think this book should have been longer to provide better background for both characters and events. For instance, it was said that UK was under totalitarian regime, but it was not really shown what exactly was bad about it aside from surveillance and arrests of minorities which had happened decades prior. What I mean is, the everyday struggles of people under this supposedly oppressive regime were never described, and therefore I didn't really come to care for this regime to be overthrown. In regards to characters, I would really want to know more about them if just to be able to distinguish numerous men in suits from one another. Seriously, there were so many of them, they all played some significant role, but I was always lost. If I am honest, I was able to completely understand the book only after reading plot summary on wikipedia. Until I did that, I was a little confused who did what and why. This brings me to my next concern - the story itself wasn't structured very well, it was choppy, story lines ended abruptly, and many questions were left unanswered in the end. Finally, my probably biggest disappointment had to do with the fact that identity of V was never revealed. He had such a great background story, but I felt I never knew him enough.<br /><br />Overall, a great idea, but poorly executed. I'll try other graphic novels in future, hopefully \\"Watchmen\\" is not the only one which is worth reading.wered in the end.

0385512104|5.0|I loved this book, which is a detective story of sorts \\"written by\\" a teenaged boy who is autistic. The author, Mark Haddon, used to work with people with autism. (Not sure in what capacity; the book doesn't say.) I haven't found a review of the book by an autistic person, but having known some teens with autism -- friends of my daughter's -- I would hazard a guess that Mr. Haddon has done a very good job of capturing the way they perceive and try to cope with the world.    Christopher is gifted in math, but he's no idiot-savant; he also understands astronomy, physics, philosophy, theology and metaphysics. What he doesn't understand is human behavior and emotions. Due to his phobias and hyper-awareness of his environment, he has led a sheltered life. I have read some reviews of this book that call Christopher \\"highly-functioning,\\" but he is not. At this point in his life he is utterly incapable of attending a mainstream school, science club or sports program or of living anywhere that does not cater to his very specific demands. The reader is able to understand many things about his world and the people in it that Christopher finds mystifying, or does not notice at all.    Christopher wants to know who killed the neighbor's dog, and no one wants him to investigate, least of all his father. The father is raising Christopher alone, and this book not only helps the reader to understand the way the mind of an autistic person works, but it also helps us to understand the trials and fears faced by the parents of autistic children.    Did I mention that this book is a lot of fun to read? It's very well-written and the plot -- and subplots-- are very interesting. There are actually several mysteries that unfold.
1433502410|5.0|I have the NRSV Lutheran Study Bible, the NIV Study Bible and now the ESV Study Bible.  So far, the ESV is my favorite.  There is so much additional information in the essays and section introductions beyond the notes for almost every verse.  For example;before you get to Genesis, there is an OT introduction then an intro to the Pentateuch and then an intro to Genesis.  This material reflects the conservative, Evangelical Protestant point of view.  The ESV translation is closer to the original Greek and Hebrew than the NIV, the other favorite of conservatives, but still very readable.    My only problem with it is that they pack so much into it but still try to keep the size managable.  It is slightly bigger than the NIV Study Bible and quite heavy.  They have had to use such thin paper that you don't want to use a highlighter.  It is frustrating to get to within a page or two of the page you want and not be able to seperate and turn that last page.  I am afraid to lick my finger for fear of leaving a mark.  I am also worried that I will tear a page if I am not extreemly careful.  However, these are minor inconveniences compared to all the wonderful features.  If you are a member of or teach an adult bible study group this would be an excellent tool.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Planet Earth is a mammoth undertaking of a series and the end product is one of the most fitting contributions to the High Def format in home viewing.      The BBC documentary stretches some 10 hours of perfectly captured life on this planet.  Every one of the stunning visuals has nuance and interest.  There are almost no stupid quick cuts found in 99% of all tv or movies these days.  This is 10 hours you can really soak in.  David Attenborough has a soft guiding voice through the depths and heights of our journey and the audio too fares well on my surround sound.    While the Blu-Ray is curiously missing the extras found on the DVD set, the only real criticism you can levy at Planet Earth is the lack of a larger narrative scope belying the overall epic vision.  Instead of participants in the world we are presented, the viewer is left as a bit of a tourist.    But in the end the series is what it is and how much can you really criticize 10 hours of continuous beauty?  This is a must own.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|I bought this for my son's birthday, having selected it from his wish list. He was delighted with it.
014241493X|5.0|Paper Towns was my first John Green novel, but it definitely won't be my last. It was so seriously amazing... there aren't words to describe my reading experience.<br /><br />I'm usually not into reading books from the male perspective, but I recently read Black Rabbit Summer by Kevin Brooks (which is narrated by a male protagonist) and loved it - and am now working on not being so narrow-minded about my main characters. Q was one of my favorite main characters, so I'm glad I gave Paper Towns a chance.<br /><br />I think the aspect of this book that really made it amazing was the author, John Green. I'd heard that he was a really amazing, funny guy... something about Nerd Fighters?... but he has some serious writing talent. All the little details, the plot, the dialogue - it was so great... I could not put this book down.<br /><br />I loved the clues. Margo leaves clues for Quentin to find her and I was trying right along with him to figure them out. I couldn't stop reading until I found out what happened.<br /><br />This book was also so freaking funny. I was laughing out loud at 1 am, especially at the end of the book. There is some seriously hilarious dialogue during a road trip... the road trip alone is reason to read this book! :)
B001GCUO16|4.0|OK, so ive been reading comics for 3 decades give or take a few years and have been a film buff for just as long.  I had no expectations of this movie.  I had not been pining away at message boards waiting for spoilers or buying wolverine related stuff to bide my time.  Put simply this was a great Friday night movie.  There are some good and entertaining actors in this one.  I wish Ryan Reynolds had more screen time as Deadpool ala wisecracker, but the 'mutant killer' Deadpool was pretty wicked.  And yea some things were different than I expected, but honestly as swiss cheese full of holes wolverines origin has been over the years who cares?  Seemed like they hit a lot of good beats.  Just wait, more will come...
0439023491|5.0|I absolutely devoured this book. In one night. When I had class at 8 am. There is just no preventing it - so make sure that when you read this book, you have a chunk of time to do so. And you want to read this book, trust me!<br /><br />Katniss absolutely shines in Catching Fire! She is still very much the survivor readers saw in The Hunger Games. I liked that we saw a little bit more of Katniss' softer side come through in this installment. I love Peeta just as much, if not more, than I did in the first book, but I'm still glad that we got to see a bit more of Gale than before. I can understand why he and Katniss are best friends now, whereas previously I couldn't see what was holding her back from Peeta.<br /><br />I was dreading the twist in Catching Fire. I had a heads up from a review I'd previously read, but I wasn't sure how Suzanne Collins was going to pull it off. I shouldn't doubted though, Collins seems to be able to pull of anything! :) Sorry if that is extremely cryptic, but I don't want to have any spoilers!<br /><br />There was some talk of District 13 in this novel and I'm hoping that the rumors will be explored in the next book(s). There are so many directions the next book could go - plus Catching Fire ended in a major cliffhanger! I've got to hand it to Collins, she keeps the readers coming back for more with her intense endings - but it hurts!! :)<br /><br />Now, on to my favorite aspect of Catching Fire: the romance! I will admit to being a huge fan of Peeta (see my button in my sidebar???!). Gale, though a quality character and guy, just doesn't do it for me. In my eyes, Gale is the childhood crush: there is definitely comfort and familiarity there. Peeta is true and real - Katniss NEEDS him, even if she is denying it! I'm really curious to see where the Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle goes in the third book. Especially after that darn cliffhanger!
B001PPGAIA|2.0|I suppose I have the disadvantage of having seen too many movies in a moderately long life, which means I could predict every cliched moment of this effort way in advance. Is there any hackneyed plot device that was left out of this overly long and exhausting melodrama?  I have always considered Nicole Kidman a competent actress but in this she constantly overacts in a strained attempt to mimic some kind of emotional range. The soundtrack is awful except for the bit of Elgar they steal for the last scene.
0061537969|5.0|I liked this book so much I gave it as gifts to two people the same week I read it.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Even seen in a VHS \\"widescreen\\" version clocking in at 229 minutes with 2 short documentaries added at the beginning and the opening overture music(like being in the theatre), this is one of the great cinematic masterpieces of all time.  Consider especially,no CGI were used in the desert and battle scenes(computer-generated images)-please correct me if I'm wrong but it was 1961-62 in a remote location 150 miles from the nearewst town according to the short 8-min documentary.Everything was flown in by plane. Highly recommended!
0061730327|5.0|Like many, my introduction to William Kamkwamba came in the form of a slightly awkward but similarly fascinating speech that he gave as a young man to the TED Conference in Africa.  Speaking before a collection of billionaires and entrepreneurs, William spilled out what little he could of his story in short fragmented answers to the interviewers questions.  One such fragment, simple in its constructions, resonating throughout the hall and amongst the net when he spoke about building his first windmill:  \\"And I try and I made it\\".    That he made it is not simply a battle against the wind, but a battle just to survive long enough to get to that point.  Much of the book, most of the book takes place before William has ever even heard of TED and the story since then.  The prejudices of his community, the superstitions that held back so many, and most notably, the terrible famine that struck his village.  You may have seen photos of a starving kid in Africa but you've probably never heard their stories in such a conversational style.  William relays the details of the famine as a blogger would telling the story of his day.  It's simply a gripping read, a story not heard often in the West, and makes his eventual triumph all the more amazing.    The overall book itself is a quick read.  I plowed through it in a few days with a smile often on my face, an occasional chuckle and a few moments in which I said to myself \\"they'll put this part in the movie for sure\\".  It's a good story from a land where happy endings are far too few and far between.  I would recommend it for those who are seeking an inspirational tale or who have an interest in science and the learning process.      I would also recommend a quick review of the TED video and a few others that exist on the net to get some visuals in your head of what William looks and sounds like so you can put a face to the name and a sound to the voice.
0140186409|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and even during the opening chapters I knew I was reading great literature.  Other reviewers label this a classic, a masterpiece, etc., and I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />This novel places Steinbeck up there with Twain among the great American authors.  \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\" are the best expressions of the American experience in their respective centuries.<br /><br />This should go on everyone's to-read list. Don't miss it.<br /><br />If it's assigned in school and seems too long and too boring, do what you have to do now. But by all means, return to it a few years later and read it when you can.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|It's nice to have Whitney back on the scene with good music and a new outlook for her life. \\"I Look To You\\" could show up in churches around the country even though she doesn't mention that it's God that she looks to, but only an omnipotent power could have brought Whitney back from her addiction. Every track on this CD is worth the price and listening time.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Well this is a first for me I never write a review on anything. First off, I havew several workout DVDs by all kinds of different people with different techniques. But I just loved Jillians attitude in the DVD, usually I will watch a workout DVD once and be done with it but I've been doing the 30 day shred for about 10 days now and I am still not tired of it fo it finally looks like I found someone to keep me in shape now.. it is a must have
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is seemingly the romantic one in \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" whereas Summer (Zooey Deschanel) is seemingly the one who will never believe in love or marriage.  A big reason for this is the break up of her own parents' marriage.  That Tom works for a greeting card company devising cards about emotions  couldn't be a more fitting metaphor for the metamorphosis he is about to undergo.  They go together for awhile and then Summer breaks it off.  Tom is heart broken and wants to get her back.<br /><br />Summer (Deschanel) is lovely to look at with very beguiling manner.  You can see why Tom fell for her.  However, she can be offputting as well.  The character you really immerse yourself in is Tom, not Summer.<br /><br />This film does not go where you expect it to go.  It goes someplace better.  I can't say anymore without ruining it but you will love it from beginning to end.  It is a romance movie with a happy ever after ending but unlike any one you've ever seen before.  Its arty and indie roots show in every frame.  The film's visual palette is beautiful and often you feel as if the transitions between scenes become wonderful watercolor paintings.<br /><br />This is a quiet, thoughtful and reflective film.  There is no other plot other than young people coming together, falling in love or not and getting on with their lives.<br /><br />Deschanel also released an excellent album this year, SHE & HIM so this period in her professional life is the breakout one for her.  She has labored long and hard in the indie film field.<br /><br />Peter Travers of ROLLING STONE thought this was one of the best films of the year.  I saw it after watching his review.  I totally agree with him.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307588335|2.0|This book is not a detailed look at why Lehman fell. It is one persons view--a lopsided view from the trading desk. The author spent way too much time talking about his career and brilliant calls, and way too little time on what was happening in the executive suite.
0385504225|1.0|Couldn't believe how shallow and unbelievable the story was.  I'm embarrassed to say that I actually kept at it hoping that it would get better.  It didn't.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The image quality is perfect. This is THE showcase for blu-ray players on a large screen. Tremendous detail, exquisite photography, vibrant colors... It is the perfect combination of long-distance beauty shots of mountains, jungles, etc. and textured, enchanting close-ups of animals.    The pacing is great. It doesn't get bogged down with any of its subjects, and moves satisfyingly to follow the theme of the episode (eg. \\"fresh water,\\" \\"mountains,\\" \\"desert,\\" etc.).    The content is surprisingly original. You would think you've seen every nature show there is to see... But they manage to find new, unique creatures (often never-before-photographed).    Overall, it is enthralling, breathtaking, and deeply stirring.    How they made it (and how they're recooping the costs of making it) is beyond me. In fact my only complaint is that it could use another disk with more making-of features. Get a good price for it, and you won't regret it.
B001EC3JME|5.0|An awesome holster for the line of work i'm in... At heights of 300ft inside wind turbine towers when items must remain securely attached and easyly accesseble this holster out performs the cheap holsters that come with high end flashlights (surefire/fenix). I purchased my first holster at REI sporting for my surefire E2D.. It has a \\"military/Police\\" type feel to it, the clip is made heavy duty along with the elastic and the sheath itself.. When i'm climbing up the wind turbine tower i wear a safty harness, i clip it to my chest strap and i'm able to rotate the holster 360degs allowing me to point it up at 45degs or down at 45degs when going down tower... It almost appears that Nite Ize custom made this holster for these/size flashlights.. I no longer own the surefire (way over rated), i gave away to a good friend of mine to allow myself the justification of purchasing a Fenix T40 (dollar for dollar, Fenix hands down/above Surefire, almost half the price!!)... some flashlights have an external grip ring, on the Fenix it comes with a \\"spacer\\" so you can remove the ring.. With the ring, (used for a shooting position/grip)it is almost impossible to insert.  the only problem i have, on the clip it has a \\"barb\\" like device that makes it difficult to remove from your pants (waistband or pockets)..  I just ordered a Fenix 4, and to my surprise Amazon carries these holsters!! i'm ordering 2, wanna make it right for my buddy's surefire...
B001FB4W0W|3.0|Maybe it's just the first season, I heard a lot of good things about this and I'm a huge Twilight fan so I thought, hey what the heck.  Well, it was ok, definitely no Twilight.  Actually the plot was eerily familiar to the afore mentioned series but much more X-rated...can't say I'd advise this for the 18 and under crowd.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|This movie skips a lot.  I wasn't pleased. so Whoever sent this to me, I feel that you have wronged me.
0790740443|5.0|The plot on this action flick is pretty much disposable, and merely serves to set up some great scenes of carnage.  Following the development of Kurt Russell as a baby to adult to outdated Solider, this movie is liberally dusted with action.  Everything though, is merely setting the stage for the requisite end of movie battle royale that pits Russell against a company of newer, supposedly better Soldiers.  Showing that experience in killing is better than just being trained to kill, Russell of course stomps the heck out of all of them.  What more could you ask for?
B00000G3I2|4.0|I received the movie quickly, which was great. The overall quality was fine, but it had a few problems towards the end, it would pause for quite a bit.
0312360258|2.0|While an interesting book that could have been very good, they chose to add some things (of a graphic nature) that really ruined the book for me. The plot, other than those things, is ok. The main character is pretty slice-of-life ish, except for being a vampire. Some good humour, and still manages to keep some basic issues that most teenagers go through.    I wouldn't use this book, or read it again. >.< It doesn't promote family in the least, but does have to do with the building of self.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Love the packaging. This is the first box of wires I was able to open without a box cutter or serious set of scissors. Frustration free packaging, indeed. There was little difference between these cables and the ones they replaced. I discovered that I had been using the wrong cables to hook up my dvd player to my high def TV. This system of cables was organized better, and actually fit better on the receptacles. They are also much sturdier than the stock cables that came with most of my devices. The Amazon warranty is nice. I have never had any problems returning stuff to Amazon. I do hope they make more stuff because from what I have so far (I have a Kindle) I am liking their brand for quality.
B001AUKUTU|4.0|I've always been attracted to Ronnie's leather-lunged voice, and he knows how to belt out rock with the best of them.<br /><br />Dream Evil is a great example of his expanding from the start with his earlier albums. Here, his singing seems to be a bit more laid back, more mellow, but still with a lot of balls.<br /><br />There is some excellent guitar playing in here as well as great keyboards by Claude Schnell.<br /><br />My favorites are I Could Have Been A Dreamer and Dream Evil.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002O1TMI4|4.0|Muse is definitely not what they used to be. However, they never fail to surprise with the changes they make on every CD. I would say that The Resistance is a one step forward and one step back for Muse. This is definitely an awesome album. One thing that bothers me in this CD is that there isn't as much guitar as I wished and Mathew Bellamy uses too much tremolo bar in some songs.     1) Uprising - 8/10 - Good song to start the CD which for some reason gives Muse a \\"libertarian\\" label. Too mainstream.   2) Resistance - 10/10 - Beautiful song with great lyrics.   3) Undisclosed Desire - 10/10 - It doesn't belong on this album and guitar was replaced with a keytar. Also, if it I didn't know it's Muse I would think it's Depeche Mode. Nonetheless, my second favorite song and very catchy. Good to sing along in the car.   4) United States Of Eurasia - 9/10 - At first I hated it, but then it started growing on me.  5) Guiding Light - 5/10 - Filler. Not a bad song, but not a good one either.  Weakest one on the album.   6) Unnatural Selection - 10/10 - best song on the album. Great riff in the beginning and even better lyrics. Similar to New Born but very catchy. I hate the way he says \\"ocean.\\"   7) MK Ultra - 8/10 - Good synth work in the beginning; the song could use more speed though  8) I Belong To You (My Heart Opens To Your Voice) - 9/10 - The transition to the French part is so good that you don't even notice it. I wish the whole song was in French.   9 - 11) Exogenesis Symphony 1-3 - 10/10 - A masterpiece hands down.     Muse continues to amaze with every release. Their style and music is an art; after all, how many rock bands do you find that have symphonies, pianos or use Chopin's work? Yeah, I can't come up with any other band either.
B000002L7V|3.0|I guess this is typical Dio, but apparently does not really break new ground for him. If I'm accusing him of pulling an AC/DC, at least with them, they still have memorable songs even if they sound the same from album to album. I can't blame Mr. Dio for not wanting to fix something that isn't broke, but I wish he could have come up with some better songs.<br /><br />When I first got this album, it was a gift from a friend when I was stationed in Turkey in the 80's. Though the album cover was great, the music just didn't seem to live up to the graphics.<br /><br />As I just recently burned this to CD to play on my long commute to work, I find that a few careful listens reveal the songs to be much better than I first remembered. They are all good, but even after several listens, not all that memorable.<br /><br />There is no one cut that really stands out for me, though overall, I could listen to it over and over again without too much grief. It's just missing a certain spark.<br /><br />Still, recommended for Dio fans.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|I'm a big fan of PT and I personally think that PT is one of the greatest and most interesting progressive groups ever. I also think that \\"The Incident\\" is much, much weaker than previous albums. It only proves that Wilson reached his full potential on \\"Deadwing\\" and he should take some time off. Steven, stop thinking about the fame and money and slow down a bit. Make one album every five or even ten years, but a good one!    I generally agree with other reviewers that there are no actual songs on this album.  I totally don't understand the idea of so many short 1-2 minute tracks (infamous filler tracks) which disappear so easily. \\"The Incident\\" is underdeveloped and lacks everything what was great on earlier albums. I miss beautifully arranged solid songs, great guitar solos and atmospheric keyboard themes. I would only recommend PARTS of \\"The Blind House\\", \\"Drawing the Line\\", \\"Time Flies\\", \\"I Drive the Hearse\\" and an unfortunately cut-short track \\"Kneel and Disconnect\\". The rest, oh well...
B0002XMF5S|5.0|We bought this album in the 80's and quickly figured it was a Tony Iommi solo album. In fact, it never should have been strapped with the Black Sabbath title, because I think that unfairly biased many people against what is a very good album.<br /><br />After two decades, I burned it to CD so I could listen to it on my long commute to work. After giving it a fair listen, I must say I like it a lot better than when I first heard it. Back then, I was also expecting something in the vein of Black Sabbath and was likely disappointed and shelved it. Now I'm glad I have given it another go.<br /><br />I had no idea Tony Iommy was such a good guitarist! I mean, he would do a bit of soloing here and there among the drudgy riffing of Sabbath, but I was surprised he could really cut it with more standard metal. The songs here are full of his riffs and lots of jamming. This is a guitar player's album and I now have a much greater appreciation for his guitar and songwriting skills.<br /><br />After listening to it several times, I have no specific favorite cut as they all have their merits. This was quite a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended.
0618918248|2.0|In frankness this book is disappoints if you're looking for reasoned arguments.  Instead of a scientific study (in laymen's terms) were treated to one sided ranting.    Dawkins misses opportunities to accurately represent the other side so as to propose a debate.  Given the misrepresentations he's free to create arguments that appear relatively convincing.  Further, misquotes and improper citations are used to create self defeating arguments for opposing opinions.  Here's one example:  he state that the Bible in the book of Luke says Jesus was born in Bethlehem, but that the book of John say he was born in Galilee.  Therefore he states the Bible can't be trusted.    This is fine if it were accurate.  Luke does say Jesus was born in Bethlehem and that's why Dawkins properly cites Luke.  However, on careful inspection, you'll notice no citation for the book of John.  Why?  Study it carefully as I did trying to understand this and you'll see.  John never state Jesus was born in Galilee.  In fact he doesn't discuss his birth at all.  John starts with Jesus in adulthood, and at no time said he wasn't born in Bethlehem.  So here is the style for argument used by Dawkins.  It lacks the kind of peer review that any scientific arguments should have, it lacks honesty, and continually misrepresent apposing arguments and or evidence in order to support Dawkins theory.    This book is nothing more than a hate rant, and frankly there are many good books on evolution from which you can simply learn.  Buy one of those.  This one is political garbage.
0452289963|1.0|You can't disagree with this author because he never says anything.  I would agree with him that the self is an illusion, that we are one with the earth, and that we are evolving, but he never says what consciousness is, how exactly we are one with the earth, or what we are evolving into.  It is maddening that he approaches so many subjects that need our attention, and ends with mystical statements that say nothing and are entirely useless.<br /><br />Tolle takes a little bit from everywhere, and addresses important points so superficially that you can't pin down his true position.  He combines evolution and religion in a way that they couldn't possibly mix.  He never says what consciousness is, even though he says the universe is conscious.  Although he never says so explicitly, it is implied that this consciousness is something like god, but all the gods we've invented until now were mistaken approximations of the true consciousness.  Jesus and Buddha and other prophets were on the right track, but Eckhart Tolle figured out what they couldn't?  And he can't quite explain it to you, so you have to take his word for it?  This consciousness will enter you and empower you and make you happy if only you stop getting in its way.  Useless nonsense.<br /><br />Some central points you could take away from this book that might be useful:<br />--We are evolving.<br />--The Self is an artificial construct.<br />--How you focus your attention will affect your happiness.<br />--War is counterproductive.<br />--Nature is beautiful and can be enjoyed for its own intrinsic value, rather than its exploitation value.<br /><br />All of these are potentially valid points, if supported.  Tolle uses each as a generalization to drive toward his mystical, unexplained, universal awakening.

The European locations give an exotic feel to the book as well.  Read them both, but dont miss this one!  I can wait for the final episode this fall.  THe realization that Steig is no longer with us to enjoy his fame and write more makes each of his books bittersweet.  Enjoy while you can!
0470477237|5.0|There are times in history that change the whole dynamics of business, including the dawn of Radio, TV, then in the 1990's the internet, then the proliferation of worldwide cellphone usage - and now, it's Social Media time.  And for a time when it is just booming, and not many people are writing about it (well, maybe quite a few, but nothing compared to what's coming), Socialnomics has hit the nail on the head!  This is MANDATORY READING for anyone in business today.  Social Media Marketing is not just PLAY marketing - it is serious business and Erik has explained it so well on his book.  It will give you a clear understanding of what took us here, what is this transformation going on, who's in it, and how you need to work with it if you want to stay in business in the new Web 2.0 era.  Maybe it is the most complete book of this kind at this point in social media history.  It is easy reading, not written for techies (although many will find it useful), but for the masses to understand.  It is written in a way that many readers will feel they know Erik personally, as I feel I do (even when I don't).  After you read it, follow Socialnomics on twitter and FB and/or any other social media you use, as it will keep feeding you with ideas and information that the book thoroughly explains, but since this technology is changing so fast, it is nice to know Erik is there for us.  Buy the book, read it, and then buy another one (or a few more) to give to your colleagues.  Keep your copy for reference - there are tons of great examples in the book to use as idea benchmarkings.  There you have it!  It's a 2TUR (2 Thumbs Up Recommendation) !!
B002GZQYMK|1.0|Wow, I now know what it would sound like if Britpop went through a \\"KC & the Sunshine Band\\" phase. Arena rock used to be more monster truck, but now my kid brother's up on the stage, waving his snotrag above the greasy crowd like it's an extension of his \\"aura.\\"<br /><br />I remember when these Brian Eno Juniors were just innocent leeches. On \\"The Resistance,\\" these dime-store divas are all too happy to concede. And the one attempt at humor, \\"United States of Uranus,\\" ends up merely being the least offensive Queen imitation. These guys are the Madonnas of old-man emo.<br /><br />If you had asked me before the fact, I never would have thought that you could market so many Radiohead imitators at the same time. If you had said Thom Yorke's help-I-just-choked-on-a-chicken-and-got-the-urge-to-sing vocal stylings would spawn a million followers, clogging up a whole decade in faux alacrity, I would have considered thee mad! Surely the world couldn't be that cruel! Then I heard the beginnings of the \\"Exogenesis\\" trilogy, a self-congratulatory fusion of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and Rush's \\"Moving Pictures,\\" and I knew that hell couldn't be much worse.

B001TH16DI|4.0|One would be hard pressed to find films that have gotten more treatment on video than the Star Trek franchise.  This review only covers the quality of the Blu-Ray release.  I've written separate reviews of the individual films under their titles.<br /><br />The image quality of the The Motion Picture is spectacular, easily eclipsing the Director's Edition DVD, which in turn was a vast improvement over the LaserDisk, which was better than any of the VHS versions.  Indeed, this Blu-ray version even looks better than the original theatrical print - which was so rushed into theaters that it wasn't properly color timed.  (Strangely, the Klingon and Vulcan subtitles are not burned into the film as in all previous transfers, but are part of the Blu-Ray subtitles.)  The visual effects are the greatest beneficiary of this improvement, particularly during the V'ger sequences.  But two caveats: the image is now so clear that flaws in the visuals (especially those dealing with compositing) are very obvious.  Also, this is the Theatrical cut, a rush job which suffered from poor pacing, lack of sound effects, and incomplete visual sequences.  The scene near the end where the crew emerges from the Enterprise is painful to watch.  Hopefully, Paramount will pony up the money to have the Director's Cut visuals re-rendered in high definition and make a Blu-ray available of that.  Until then, I'm holding on to my Director's Edition DVD.<br /><br />The Wrath of Khan is the only film in this set to have been fully restored - and it needed it.  Due to the film's popularity, so many prints were struck that the printing master was damaged.  This, again, is the theatrical cut (except the \\"II\\" didn't appear in the title when it ran in theaters).  The restoration reveals a lot of detail, such as the fabric in the redesigned uniforms, and set backgrounds.  The color balance has also been improved - it was previously too red tinted.<br /><br />The Search for Spock looks slightly better than the DVD, but the difference is hardly striking.  Perhaps the fact that the film was less popular than II has resulted in less damage to the master print.<br /><br />The Voyage Home, the most popular Trek film in real dollars, has looked terrible on home video.  The initial VHS tapes were nearly unwatchable, and even the 1990s Laserdisc used a print that had looked like it was dragged across the floor.  The DVD improved matters and this Blu-Ray is even better.<br /><br />I don't much care for The Final Frontier, but I watched a few sections of it.  Again, more detail is revealed for good (the early scenes at Yosemite National Park) and ill (some of the optical effects).<br /><br />This marks the first time The Undiscovered Country has been released on video in the original theatrical cut.  Thus, the film loses the Operation Retrieve subplot and renegade Colonel West character (a sly reference to Lt. Colonel Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety).  I'll be holding onto my regular DVD of this film for those few minutes, cut under pressure from Paramount, which thought the political commentary was too on the nose.  This disc is a case where Blu-ray can reveal too much.  The visual effects look fine, but the improved definition reveals the extent to which the studio was trying to conceal the actors' aging.  This is especially the case with Leonard Nimoy, whose makeup appears to have been applied with a trowel.<br /><br />There have been complaints about excessive Digital Noise Reduction.  There were some sections where it seems a bit overdone: an establishing shot of the Enterprise inside V-ger, which now looks like a still photo, for example.  But for the most part these films look great.<br /><br />The sound mix on all films is first rate, with dialogue strongly placed front & center, and proper use of surround.  Unlike previous DVD issues, the films are now available with French and Spanish soundtracks (the latter not too good, according to my spouse, a native Spanish speaker).<br /><br />The features partly duplicate those from the 2 discs DVD versions, with a few removed and some new features added.  The Starfleet Academy feature is useless and quite annoying.  The Captain's Summit is an enjoyable get together with Shatner, Nimoy, Patrick Stewart and Jonathan Frakes, loosely moderated by Whoopi Goldberg.  Ardent Trek fans will learn nothing new, and even hear Shatner say (for the umpteenth time) that the Enterprise Bridge set was destroyed after each film was complete, and had to be rebuilt for each sequel (not true).  There are also additional commentaries, which run the gamut from amusing (the Okudas, Reeves-Stevens, Dochterman commentary for The Motion Picture and The Final Frontier) to irritating (Manny Coto's contribution to The Wrath of Khan commentary borders on snotty).VD versions, with a few removed and some new features added.

This set is phenomenal there are so many extras, with the setting in Gdansk and some of the last footage containing Richard's magic, this is a must have for any Floyd fan. The Live in Gdansk album propels Gilmour to a new level in music which is beyond the imagination. David Gilmour's new music is the best I have ever allowed my ears to enjoy. Thank you David.

0553381695|4.0|I think I read the much longer Clash of Kings in a faster amount of time than Book 1!!  There are certain characters I'd like to spend more time with (Jon Snow and Arya) and certain characters I'd like to spend less time with (Daneyers or however you spell her name).  I'll make this a short review and say that anyone interested in a fantasy epic with a cast of thousands that involve politics, wars, romance, magic, dragons, direwolves (love them!), etc...this series is for you.  Now I have to go and start reading Book 3 :)

B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I am going to get right to the point & state that this CD is an awesome album filled with great material from a band that has been able to beat and defy the odds. Yes, boy bands are not the type of artists that typically sells these days and are not artists that usually winds up in a conversation of exactly what's being played on your MP3 player, but almost ten years after their monster hit that was Millennium - The Backstreet Boys have been hanging in tough and delivering three good albums after Black and Blue (Which was at the height and end of the boy band era in 2001). Britney herself decided to go more adult mainstream and R&B with her record that year and so did Nsync. Everyone seems to go R&B when they want to be considered mature for some odd reason.<br /><br />Needless to say, the BSB are still hanging in strong and delivering another stellar album. I have to agree with the other reviews that this album is a bit more true to their previous albums during their heyday (Backstreets Back, Millennium, and Black & Blue. Their last two efforts were good, but a bit on the mature adult contemporary side. Kind of music that Celine Dion fans would be into.<br /><br />For their newest efforts we find the boys working with big name producers that seemed absent on the last album. The men find themselves in the realm with producers such as RedOne, Dr. Luke, SoulShock Karlin (Heartbreak Hotel, Before You Walk Out Of My life, and Get Out), and two of my personal faves Ryan Tedder and the man who made BSB, Nsync, and Britney Spears famous, Max Martin (Baby One More Time, Tearin Up My Heart, Oops! I Did It Again, Quit Playing Games With My Heart, Bye Bye Bye, If You Seek Amy, etc) The list goes on and on. This Is Us is an album that is truly just pure pop with little hints & shades of R&B. Where artist like Justin Timberlake having abandoned the sound that made him famous, BSB sticks to it. Cause everyone loves POP.<br /><br />Overall, i am very pleased with this album and i go from track to track without skipping There is only about two dud songs on here. This is truly a winner & BSB gives it to the fans the way it should be. A great PRODUCT and \\"A Solid Pop Album\\".<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br />Straight Through My Heart<br />Bigger<br />Bye Bye Love<br />If I knew Then (Great Mid-tempo Track)<br />This Is Us<br />Masquerade<br />She's a Dream<br />Shattered<br />Undone (Amazing arrangement & should be the next single)without skipping There is only about two dud songs on here.

I bought the first book thinking \\"What the hell, it's only $8\\"  but I soon found myself captivated by the series.  After reading the first book in 4 hours I immediately went to the book store to get the rest of the series.  I can't wait for the 6th book to come out later this month.  If you like books that meld vampires, wiccan principles, and mystery you will love this series.

There are no tabs, etc. So if you want to get the basic song structure down this is a great song book. The drawback is the book itself. It does not lie flat and it quickly become annoying as you try to keep the pages open. BnB Beatles Depot

0316017922|4.0|This book was so fun to read, I just couldn't put it down. I was quite amused at his easy to read and fun detailing of the many examples of how innate talent is simply not enough, it is the series of opportunities and community that also propel the talented to lead exceptional lives. He did a good job of encouraging the reader to dig deeper and take the long view of all those specific things happening in a specific way to unfold greatness upon the earth. It makes me think about our moon, how the exact size and distance are a perfect compliment to stabilize the earth to sustain higher life forms. Look back further, how massive stars had to go supernova to produce the heavier elements that created rocky planets and provided the right chemical stew for life. This book really made me fall back into thinking of the wonderful history and circumstances that make the world what it is and you what you are. You are a story a long time in the making. To think of your ancestors and their circumstances and attitudes- its fascinating to think their legacy may still touch your life, even if it is beneath the surface. I liked how he challenged the elite forces in our society to rethink their methods of picking the best- to saturate the worlds talent pool with more equitable processes is fabulous. Really great story telling in an entertaining way- reminded me of Freakonomics - now I will probably go back and read his other two books- can't wait.
1401207529|4.0|Created by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli, the story of Batman's beginnings is told not only from the perspective of the Dark Knight but that of policeman Jim Gordon, his eternal ally and friend, as they take on Gotham's criminal underbelly and a corrupt justice system.  Though it goes as far into Batman's origin as it has to, what really sets \\"Year One\\" apart is that it's as much Gordon's story as it is Batman's, which sheds more light on how their unusual partnership begins.  As an added bonus, the story also tells of the birth of Catwoman.  With Miller going back to the Dark Knight's dark roots, if \\"Year One\\" doesn't wipe away your memories of that 1960s TV show, nothing will.    This comic is unrated: Violence, Adult Situations.
0375413405|5.0|I grew up watching Julie Child's program from time to time, but as an adult I spent years feeding my kids pizza, tacos, and hamburgers thinking that was the easy way to go.  I must admit, it took watching the movie Julia and Julie to pique my curiosity enough to purchase the book and try what I mistakenly thought would be difficult French cooking.  Now that I use it ALL OF THE TIME I'm sorry that I waited so long to get this gem.  Sure, there are some recipes that you won't ever use, but if you want to learn how to make basic, step-by-step, absolutely fabulous meals that turn out perfect EVERY TIME you'll want to own this cookbook. My family couldn't care less about tacos and pizza now.  Everyone shows up for dinner, oohs and ahhs through the meal, and if there are any leftovers at all they disappear late that night.  The only down side is that no one wants to eat out any longer because you can't get this kind of flavor and quality on any menu in town.  Buy the book and cook baby!
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|After \\"V for Vendetta\\" and \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" I had less than high hopes for Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Alan Moore's most acclaimed graphic novel.  So does Hollywood kill \\"Watchmen,\\" too?  Not really.  Then is it everything fans dreamed it would be?  Not really.    The comic, about a plot to kill and discredit former superheroes in the 80s, is a multi-layered story with a lot of ground to cover.  The film cuts into the meat, keeps the best parts, takes out the bones, and leaves all the blood.  This is probably the most faithful comic-based movie you'll ever see.  From Jackie Earl Haley's Rorschach to Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, \\"Watchmen\\" doesn't seem so horribly miscast either.  It's the sheer weight of it all, the daunting task of bringing so much style and substance together, that leaves the film in the gray area between sweet success and utter failure.  But the real joke is even the 24 minutes of extra footage in the Director Cut couldn't get the film up there with \\"Spider-Man\\" or \\"X-Men.\\"  So who watches the Watchmen?  Just the fans.    This film is rated R: Graphic Violence, Nudity, Adult Language, Adult Situations, Strong Sexual Content.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book will make you think and question many aspects of your running routine, namely the shoes you wear, your form and your training. Since reading the book, I've tried a few of the concepts like barefoot running but am not quite ready to make a complete change. I'm a runner but had given little thought to the level of ultrarunning that this book covers. What makes this book captivating are the characters with Caballo Blanco at the center. He really steals the show in this book, overshadowing even the Tarahumara thenselves, in my opinion, because he is a character/runner whom many of us can relate to on some level. The book did tend to go off on tangents often, especially when introducing new characters, but the author always brought the book back to its main story. If you are a runner and want a thought-provoking read, you have to pick up this book. In fact, I can hardly imagine anyone who calls themselves a serious runner who hasn't read this book.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|When Skynyrd first began recording, as a native Southerner, I fell in love with a great Southern Rock band. When they came to town, I was fortunate to see them twice in concert. Needless to say, they were great. My brother, who is eight years younger, did not see the original band, but fell in love, too.  He has all of the Skynyrd CDs plus the Vicious Cycle concert DVD. I have lost count of how many times he has seen them in concert.    I took my daughter to see Skynyrd on the Vicious Cycle tour. She fell in love with them, A month or so ago, I took my son and his best friend to see them. At the time, I did not realize there was an upcoming CD release. I just wanted him to be a part of a real family tradition.    Skynyrd opened the concert with Skynyrd Nation. I freaked. What the hell was this? It was good but not any Skynyrd song that I knew. It dawned on me that there must be a new CD coming out. Wow. It rocked! As the concert went on, they played two more new cuts. I went home and immediately pre=ordered the CD.    I really wanted this CD to be good. But I did not want to write this review before I LISTENED to the CD. I try to review objectively.. My criteria is, \\"Would I still listen to this CD years from now?\\" I judge any CD in terms of Pronounced, Second Helpings, and even Who's Next, Low Spark of High-heeled Boys and Aqualung.  So far I'm on the fifth time through. God & Guns is Skynyrd    1. Still Unbroken- This should be adopted by some football team. After this past week's goal line stands, I can think of a number of candidates.  This is a blood boiling, do or die, song of pure determination.    2. Simple Life- A touch of Country. The real feeling of wanting to feel the way you did when you grew up.      3. Little Thing Called You- Well, you really can't say B*tch, but close enough. Good Rockin'.    4. Southern Ways-Take me home. I'm a Tennessee boy stuck in Ohio, but whereever you're from you'll appreciate going home.      5. Skynyrd Nation- Third generation of Southern Rockers. `Nuff said.    6. Unwrite That Song- Another Country type song. Wonderful ballad.  Not unknown for Skynyrd to do this. Evidence, Write In A Song and Red, White, and Blue.      7. Floyd- At first, I thought it was a little different but it's not. It's tough guy and gators.  Great guitar work.    8. That Ain't My America- Liberals beware! Tells it like is.       9. Comin' Back For More- Guy, Girl, desire to a rockin' accompaniment.    10. God & Guns- Fantastic! Title cut and says it all.      11. Storm- Another really good song. More than a little political, too. Very optimistic.    12. Gifted Hands- Billy Powell tribute. God bless and RIP. Great ballad.
0786838655|3.0|This is a good starting book of a young adult series. Full of adventure and clever dialogue, it was pretty entertaining. Definitely helps to have a basic understanding of Greek mythology (or else some of the jokes won't seem so funny!). I can see how this book would hold great appeal for middle schoolers. As an adult reader and future teacher, while I enjoyed reading this one, it wasn't 'unputdownable' and the writing and vocabulary choice were a little lacking, in my opinion. But I would recommend it for a fun summer-y read and to middle schoolers looking to read a clever adventure series.
0385342020|4.0|As usual, Sophie Kinsella has impressed me with her ability to entertain me and capture my attention completely. Yes, the plot was somewhat formulaic and the main character is very similar to all of Kinsella's other main characters, but hey, it's chick lit and it worked! This novel was light, frothy, and fun...all in all, a perfect summer read.
0486440966|3.0|I read this novel in it's intended format: serially, receiving a part each day via email (from a site called [...]--they have a catalog of classic novels that you can subscribe to). It was an intriguing story, and I am glad I read it in the way I did, as each part left me wondering what was to happen next. I think the pacing was a bit uneven and the ending twist was a bit convoluted for my taste, though. But still, if you enjoy classic novels, this one was a pretty simple read compared with others of its era, and it definitely kept me in suspense almost until the end.
B00076RT24|5.0|I have seen all the Star Wars films with the exception of Episode III, and they are some of the best movies perhaps of all time. This one, the first in the series of newer movies following the life of Anakin Skywalker, is probably the best, if there is one that is better than all the others. I've always thought that the newer movies had sub-par acting in comparison to the original three, but Episode I has an exceptional performance by Liam Neeson. The special effects are absolutely stunning. The best scenes in the movie, in my opinion, are the podrace scene and the Qui-Gon Jinn/Obi-Wan Kenobi vs. Darth Maul lightsaber battle. The effects in the podrace scenes are good in the fact that they accurarley portray the speed of the podracers and there are several crashes that are quite graphic. The lightsaber battle is longer than in the other movies and is, I believe the best lightsaber scene in any of the movies (I don't know about Episode III, but from what I've heard, there are some good lightsaber scenes in that one too). If you are new to Star Wars, I would start with this episode, not Episode IV, because you can see them in the correct order. I would also watch this one first because it's a good intro into the series. I highly recommend this!!
B002C1BHIO|3.0|The reason this cable is not 5 stars is because you can find other less expensive cables that will do the job just as well over a span on 6.5 ft.  Unless your equipment is defective, there is not much interference that will happen in that distance - so why pay for premium cable?  That being said, this cable beats the heck out of other cables competing in the \\"premium\\" HDMI cable arena.  Check out that on-line store with the big yellow price tag as the logo and a geek-squad cable of the same length goes for 4 times more on sale.

Physically, it is a thicker and feels sturdy, more so than cheaper versions.  The packaging is simple, no bigger that it needs to be, and all recyclable - a big plus.  There are no performance specs in the package so if you are interested in those, you have to get them from the Amazon website.
B002OMZTSU|3.0|A great part of the likability factor of a memoir is how much you enjoy the voice of the author, how much you like spending time with him or her. Craig Ferguson is a good guy, a funny guy. I had a little crush on him when he was on Drew Carey, but I think he really started impressing me on his talk show -- particularly the monologue he gave explaining why he was calling a moratorium on making fun of Britney Spears. It was during that period of time when she shaved her head and was clearly struggling. He spoke honestly about what it was like to be an addict and he said what needed to be said -- jokes are fine, but this was a young mother who was in pain and struggling.<br /><br />This is the mark of class.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book overall, but I must admit that it lagged for me in the middle. His childhood in Glasgow was interesting enough, but his early adult years were spent being a drummer in punk rock bands of which I'd never heard, and you probably haven't either. Nothing wrong with that, but I found myself skimming as he spent a great deal of time detailing that time. Of course, it was also a way to tell about the beginning of his alcoholism, and that was something I expected to read about -- I just kept wanting the minutiae of band names and acquaintances to take more of a back stage.<br /><br />The actual details about his struggles with alcohol and his desire to build a life for himself in America were quite interesting. Once he moved to America (for the second time, actually) the book really picked up steam. Sobriety, it's clear, had a galvanizing effect on him, and it was gratifying to read about him finding his niche. Before the talk show, he writes of disappointing experiences with movies he'd written and starred in -- feeling control was taken from him. He then mentioned writing a novel, and how the lack of interference made it more rewarding.<br /><br />I have to wonder, would some more judicious editing have made this a more satisfying experience for the reader? This is not quite the book that the cover and back would have you think. That doesn't make it a bad book by any means, but a reader often looks at those things -- the description and marketing -- as a promise.

For years his yellow eyes have haunted her, and she's watched fervently each winter for his return to the forest near her home. Somehow she knows he will always be there to watch over her. And then the unthinkable happens; a fellow classmate is not only attacked by wolves, he is killed by them. What will happen to Grace's wolf when the town is on the rampage, running to destroy the animals?<br /><br />Sam has watched Grace for years but their first \\"official\\" meeting is more than a little awkward; he turns up, naked and shot, on her deck. Suddenly he's actually talking to the girl he feels he's known forever, and she's responding. And though he tries to keep his true nature in check, he knows it's just a matter of time before he will once again disappear from her life. But that certainly doesn't stop the feelings that rapidly develop between them, and now  how will Sam be able to face a future without Grace's touch and love?<br /><br />Shiver is a new, unique spin on the werewolf genre. In Stiefvater's world, it is the cold temperatures that bring on the shift from human to wolf, and each year the time to shift back to human comes later and later until one day there's only wolf. Knowing that there is a definite deadline to their love, Grace and Sam fight the cold as best they can, hoping for a miracle that will allow them to stay together. But the newly created wolf, Grace's classmate Jack, throws kinks into their plans as his unstable nature puts others in jeopardy. Stiefvater gives the story just the right balance of poignancy, anger, and hope, with Grace growing more self-assured as she wrestles with Sam's impending departure. Stiefvater also fills the pages with a longing between the two that kept me enthralled, and a back story that fleshes out the reasons behind unexplainable actions. I was engaged and I was entertained, but mostly I was just captured by the beauty of the frozen world of Shiver. Excellent and creative.just captured by the beauty of the frozen world of Shiver.

0385504225|1.0|I was expecting a roller-coaster ride of a thriller. I was ready for my mind to expand, my pulse to race... All that. So with such high expectations, I dove in. And was sorely disappointed.     The book itself is standard Dan Brown fare - lots of historical details, intrigue, and of course, fiction. But the overall feel was that of an author producing a work because he had already spent the advance. Not inspired. Not groundbreaking. Not interesting. If anyone else had written this, I would have stopped reading it at several points in the book. I so hoped it would get better. Nope. It went the other way.     The whole thing was so formulaic, you could drop the book and lose your place, pick it up, find a passage that sounded like what you had just been reading, and you would actually be three chapters ahead (or just as easily, behind), and find yourself at a loss because the sequence template is reused so often. Someone is always asking:  \\"have you heard the legend that X is Y?\\" And the other guy says \\"yes, but I always thought that was BS.\\" And so on.  I so hoped someone would finally say, \\"yeah, actually, it is BS...\\"    So I would be reading, thinking how bad the story was, and and I would think, \\"it can't get worse,\\" and it would - so much worse, in fact that I wished I could return it. But you can't return it, so I would try to re-engage as Mr. Brown would be building up this huge dramatic bit about the hero being taken to a mysterious place, but he didn't now where he was being taken, and there was this huge buildup of tension prior to the reveal, but the problem is I KNEW WHERE HE WAS. It just isn't that well crafted.     There are a lot of GREAT books available on Amazon. This is not one of them.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|I enjoy this very much. Not as good as the first as it got a bit lady, lady with the whole baby thing. More blood please. But that aside I can not wait to get the next season of this.
B0012GVKVY|4.0|this movie is one of a kind, great story, makes you kinda think about things lol, the picture is 5 out of 5 very very clear picture. Sound is unmatched.  Go get this one its only 12.99 brand new!!!
0316789798|4.0|The book is great, my daughter loves it.  It did take a long time to receive.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|Rent it or just stick to the first hulk, better cast and better story, but as far as owning it on blu ray it has a great pic that i would rate 4.5 out of 5 and the sound is great too.
0515141429|3.0|A quick fast read full of twist, turns and a sordid plot. My only real complaint was there are too many convenient coincidences and the main character seems to have an unrealistic way of deducing mysteries and locating people.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|MUST OWN ON BLU RAY END OF STORY. You will be amazed at what pixar can do, this is there best art yet 5 STARS.
6305388458|2.0|I would have to say I love Monty Python, but this has be the least funny of the 3 movies. Wheres the wit? Wheres the exaggeration? wheres the low blows? the movie feels like a bad episode of Family Guy where the tired out the jokes are repeated.  The characters were not believable either. what happen to the social commentary? while it does poke at religion, the jokes seem more stereotypical than smart (wheres the history lesson?). Was the joke about the nose poking at the Jews or was it just a bit they stuck in? It seems like they got all the right elements for a super funny movie, but they decided not to refine it. Maybe the movie was just still too PC and not offensive enough to be funny.
B001FB55H6|4.0|Most people dont like the Watchmen just because its not like spiderman or a typical hero movie.  I loved the movie, i liked the whole concept of comparing the movie's time line in conjunction with the world actual time line. It was more of a drama movie with alot of action and suspense. In addition to this great story, owning this on Blu Ray is one way you cant fail, it has amazing sound and a crystal clear picture.
B002C6K7NU|3.0|I've been a LS fan since the beginning, have  all their music & dvd's. I've waited for this new music as long as everybody has, but they should've just promoted it as LS's new Country cd. There is hardly any rock or southern rock on this one. It's listenable but the death of Billy & Ean is missed largely on this cd. It has none of the power of the previous cd's, the third great guitar they are famous for is missing now. Didn't know what to expect but I'm really dissapointed.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Cmon its the Matrix go get it, the whole flick's transfer was superb (video and audio). MUST OWN.
1416594884|4.0|John LeCarre has once again delivered a thriller worth reading and a story with fascinating characters, and a suspenseful plot with many exciting twists. After reading this book you can't help but wonder what tactics are being used to protect us from terrorists,and that perhaps we don't really want to know.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|First off yes the picture in gladiator is kinda off being that its a blu ray, but besides that is not too horrible, i don't know what they where thinking when they remastered this movie but they definitely could of done a better job. Beside the weak video transfer this movie is still one of the best, the sound transfer was way better than the video. Go get this one if you own it on dvd, its still better than its original standard release
B0018CWEYY|5.0|For a while it seemed that Lost was going to fade away into the ether of exciting and relevant television that had become tired and aimless (see The X-Files for a prime example of this phenomenon).  The first two seasons of Lost were highly popular and acclaimed, but by season three most fans and critics seemed ready to put the show out to pasture.  It was moving too slow.  There were too many questions and not enough answers.  People just stopped caring.  But then the show's creators took a major gamble and set the stakes high by reinventing the series with the finale of season three.  Suddenly, the show had regained its focus and had a new sense or purpose.  Couple that with the announcement that the show would be ending in 2010 following three shortened seasons that would pull everything together and Lost was back in a major way.  Most series usually run out of creative steam and then fumble around to find an ending that will satisfy fans.  But here was a series that had laid out a blueprint of when and how it was going to end.  This bold move was just what the show needed to recapture it's spark and to cement its place in television history.  For better or worse, Lost was going to end things on it's terms.<br /><br />The new shot of creative energy is apparent throughout the fourth season.  The episodes are lean and economical in their storytelling.  The pacing is faster than in the past and there is an inevitable sense of doom hanging over the series like a cloud.  Somehow you get the sense that when Lost finally ends, it's not going to be on a feel good high.<br /><br />Season 4 integrates the new flash forward story device that was introduced in the finale of Season 3.  As the season progresses we flash forward to learn what members of Oceanic 815 (known as the Oceanic 6) made it off the island and what problems they have run into since their rescue.  Meanwhile, in the present, we slowly learn how the things played out and why some did not leave the island.  New characters are introduced:  Danile Faraday, Miles Strom, Charlotte Lewis and Frank Lapidis consist of a crew sent to extract Ben from the island.  Why?  It turns out that the island is of interest to another party as well.  New alliances are formed as Jack and Locke go their separate ways after disagreeing about the true intent of their potential rescuers.  Meanwhile, Desmond is featured in another excellent episode, \\"The Constant\\" which may be one of the series' finest hours.  The episode not only holds pitvotal information that may be a key to the entire sereies, but it also is emotionally satisfying since it focuses on his tortured romance with Penny.<br /><br />Everything leads to a finale, that while not quite as shocking as \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", still delivers the goods and sets the table for the head spinning time travel antics of season 5.  All of this from a series that was nearly left for dead.  The end is drawing near on Lost and you can feel the forces gathering for what should be one heck of a finish.  If season 4 is any indication, that finish is going to hit like a ton of bricks.rs are introduced:  Danile Faraday, Miles Strom, Charlotte Lewis and Frank Lapidis consist of a crew sent to extract Ben from the island.

B000002J1U|5.0|Im surprised to see quite a few 4 star ratings here, but i suppose this is natural when you have so many different opinions, isn't that what democracy is all about?<br /><br />I personally love this album, although i don't listen to it much anymore. But everytime i hear Immigration Song, or Since I ve Been Loving You, or Gallow's Pole I have something akin to Pavlov Dog's reflex. I start nodding my head, stomping with my feet, and waving my hands or something.<br /><br />I would like to hope that that reaction is more than just reflexive though and these powerful rock pieces are actually producing that effect in people by the virtue of what they are. I would definitely recommend these album to anyone who is thinking of getting into rock, especially heavy rock, or to anyone who haven't listened to this album yet.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|First off, as politically, culturally and critically divisive and controversial as this album was and is, it would be impossible for me not to give this album five stars as it is my favorite Beatles album of all time. It took me a good hour to hour and a half to even get around to listening to the discs, because I spent that much time just marveling at the care and detail that was put into the packaging of this most current re-issue of the album. I felt like I was opening it again for the first time, much as I did when I got my original vinyl copy in the 70's. I was just blown away by the little touches, from the embossing on the cover to the small reproduction of the poster included with the original vinyl pressings. If you are a Beatles fan, and if all of these recent re-issues received the level of attention this one did, you would certainly be doing yourself a favor by picking up one of these new copies even if you already own one. It is quite rare these days to feel the same sense of discovery and beauty with a CD as I did when vinyl was the norm, but that was definitely the case with this particular release of this version of the \\"White Album\\". Kudos to the engineers and artists for putting such care and thoughtfulness into this package. In my opinion, they have finally truly done it justice in CD format, and rather than pick up the rest of them individually I will now almost certainly be buying The Beatles Stereo box set if this specimen is any indication of the quality I can expect from the rest of them. Very few CD packages make it onto my list of treasured recordings, but this is one of the very few that's going fall into that category along with my original vinyl collection. My reviews usually tend to drone on much longer, but I'm almost at a loss for words with this one. All I can really say is if you're a fan of this album and don't already have a copy, and even if you do, and you're on the fence about buying it - just get it. The small things includedin this re-issue really do make it that much more worth having than any other digital edition, if you're into that sort of thing.   Edit 10/7/09: I just had to come back today to add a few lines. Yesterday I had just received this album as a gift from my wife, and I was so wrapped up in the moment and the overall package, I really didn't say too much about the recording itself. I have listened to it about a 10 times since last night, and I don't profess to be an audiophile by any means, but I have to say in my personal opinion that these remasters honestly sound like they could have been recorded and released yesterday. It's just that good. The audio is so crisp and full, and there were a few details I caught that I missed even having listened to the vinyl version almost exclusively all these years (and I thought that was about as good as it could get). I'm really impressed that a digital version of this recording could be so good, but it was seriously almost like listening to the album for the first time. I understand why it took them four years to produce these now. To quote Rolling Stone, this remastering \\"was carried out with the caution of translating the Dead Sea Scrolls\\", and it certainly shows.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Even if Miyazaki had made no other movies, this one would have firmly placed him in the cinema hall of fame. The story has depth; at no point would adult viewers feel that they are not the target audience. Yet, its elements are amazingly understandable (at different levels) to children as well. The messages are nothing trivial. Human struggle for survival, arrogance of power, evil often as a result of fear rather than bad intentions, values of hard work, sacrifice, respect and cooperation, harmony with the nature through her understanding by intellectual inquisitiveness, yet while retaining awe and respect for the mystical, love of life, people and living creatures. This all in fantastic animation and with superb dubbing.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Listeners expecting a follow up to FOABP will probably not know what to make of \\"The Incident' on first listen. It's a sprawling album, so deep in sounds and textures that you won't \\"get it\\" for the first few listens. But if you spend time with it, you will grow to love this record, and the melodies and riffs will settle so deeply into your head that it will be difficult to shake them. Some folks have compared this record to Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\", and that's a very insightful and accurate comparison. Like Animals, which flows thru moments of aggression and tranquility, The Incident is kind of an experience. It doesn't have obvious \\"radio\\" songs, because they aren't the kind of short, verse chorus verse format required. Pick any song on the record, and you'll just keep listening thru to the end. The Incident is the kind of record that becomes the soundtrack for a period of your life, because it keeps you thinking, exploring and  discovering new things in it every time you listen. This is the fall record of 2009 for me, a wonderful record on par with anything Radiohead has made since Kid A. Brilliant.
0385504225|2.0|The book gets two stars for its intriguing and accurate history, at least about art around Washington DC.  No idea if what's contained that's stated to be for example from Isaac Newton really is.  But Washington as Zeus is real, as are the other art references and I found looking those up to be fascinating.    But the protagonist, which he almost isn't in this book, Robert Langdon, reminds me of Forrest Gump, though a lot less noble.  He gets dragged through this book almost in a catatonic state.  I had ongoing visions of Professor Forrest Gump.  Yeah I know it's the Tom Hanks thing, but it fits.    About 2/3 of the way through I wanted it to be over.    Unless there's some compelling reason to read this, you might want to pass.

0140067477|3.0|Personally, I enjoy learning. I study the human psyche. I read a lot about the how people face the question of, \\"who am I?\\" \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" by Benjamin Hoff provides a view into answering this question, however, I found the use of the Pooh story to describe the Tao and life to be a little deep. As I worked through the pages sometimes I struggled to make the connection and to learn, but then I recognized the simplicity of the message and was able to grasp the author's intent. My roller coaster experience in reading this book went from deep reflective, intellectual investigation, to internalizing the simple messages of the Tao, to a conclusion of \\"what did I get from this read?\\" On the one hand, during the read I said to myself, \\"I will need to re-read this book, or chapters\\", then again, despite my apetite for learning, I wondered if I wanted to work that hard to get the message. Judge for yourself if you can gain the simplicity of the book's message for life.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Ok, maybe I am a kid at heart, or maybe this movie wasn't as bad as I expected, but I really enjoyed \\"Wolverine\\". I thought that the story was easy to follow, well written, and full of surprises. For example, I had no idea (because I didn't read the comics and only saw some of the cartoons and the X-Men movies) that Wolverine was Sabertooth's brother (and I am not even sure that this was in the original storyline of Wolverine). I loved that twist and others in the story. And while I wouldn't say that the movie was exactly fast moving and action packed (don't get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes) ...I thought Origins did a wonderful job setting the stage for later X-Men stories. And I now understand why Wolverine has very few memories of his life pre-metal claws. We also got to see several of the characters from later stories (Gambit, Professor X, etc.) and understand how some mutants became X-Men!     Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, and I liked Sabertooth's character as well. Understanding the Wolverine/Sabertooth dynamic is key I think, to later stories or even potential storylines.    Now a brief synopsis of the movie.....As a young boy Wolverine discovers that everything in his life is not as it seems, and finding out that he has a brother is the least of his worries. For spending years fighting beside his brother has not prepared him for a future of tracking down mutants for his boss, a military man trying to cure his son (who has mutant powers), and eliminating them because they are threats. When Wolverine decides that killing and fighting isn't necessarily fun anymore, and maybe the person they are working for isn't what he appears, he leaves the organization and settles down as a lumberjack. The rest is a story that only you can appreciate if you watch it. Understanding the motives for people's actions is not always as clear cut as you would think, in this movie. There are tales of jealousy, greed, and power woven throughout. Anyway,   X-Men Origins, had tons of great characters (interesting mutants with interesting powers) and a sweet love story to boot. I don't see why people are being so hard on this movie because it really wasn't that bad, or maybe it is because I was expecting a lot worse.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I'm sorry, but there are some serious haters posting on here... especially the hardcore madonna fans rating her album a 1 star.  Nerve!  Madonna's not your personal songstress, so don't expect her to produce music that only you like.  These are quality tracks, and I enjoy them.  These tracks aren't over produced, they're well produced.  Problem is many of them are well produced for the club and dance scene, so if you're not there, you wouldn't get it.  And her voice lacking maturity- wrong.  There's nothing wrong with her remembering the days of her youth with a couple vocals.  When you've done it all, sometimes you want to try something again- in a different way!  Hello.  I think Madonna did an amazing job, because just about every song makes you not only want to sing along, but feel like you can sing along.  Britney and all them other chicks are great, but try singing along... first try figuring out what they're saying... wait, get them to stop stuttering... \\"womanizer, you're a womanizer, womanizer...\\" Okay, I get it.  But let Madonna show that she can go into the studio and simply have fun just tossing down a few vocals.  At some point in your career, an artist doesn't have to work hard at being creative.  So at least respect what she's doing both as an artist and a business woman, and a person for crying out loud.  Sit back, enjoy the album, and know that there's something for everyone, though everything on it might not work for everyone.  That's just how albums go.  Be glad she has the versatility to produce something that you may not like, but with a different taste may... that's how you bring people together.  Put in a Madonna album, and watch them all rock out to different tracks.  :-)
0061885452|5.0|I have devoted my life to the Arts and now at the age of 75 I have linked to two greatest artists of all millennium: 1) CRAIG FERGUSON for writing and 2) KEN BYLER for painting. Their art is their soul in truth, beauty, profundity and prolificness.<br />Since it is Mr. Ferguson's work that brings me to this website I bring him to the fore. I have finished his first book, \\"Between the Bridge and the River\\", and call it the greatest novel ever written in surrealistic existentialism with both feet on the ground and both eyes in focus! I have just begun his \\"American On Purpose\\" and can say that his greatness continues. All is right.

B002IYEQR4|4.0|THE MOVIE:<br /><br />Set in an alternate 1985 where costumed crime-fighters stalk the streets and the Cold War is on the brink of nuclear armageddon, Watchmen portrays a society that is more morally complex than depicted in traditional superhero fiction, a society where it is more difficult to tell the difference between right and wrong, good and bad.<br /><br />Whilst the Theatrical version of Watchmen was still a faithful rendering of the source material it omitted several integral elements, most notable the book-within-the-book concept: `The Tales of the Black Freighter'. By re-integrating `The Tales of the Black Freighter' as animated interstitials into the Director's Cut of the movie, the Ultimate Cut is a much more layered, satisfying and complete adaptation of the landmark graphic novel that deconstructed the superhero genre. This creates a truly remarkable vision that is something more special than the previous versions. In this respect, the Ultimate Cut should be considered the \\"Definitive Edition\\" - if not quite the masterpiece for which we were hoping. The main thing that spoilt the suspension of disbelief for me were Moloch's massively distracting Orc-like ears: 'Spock meets Nosferatu'.<br /><br />THE EXTRAS:<br /><br />Disc 2 imports the bonus material provided with the Theatrical and Director's Cut releases. The Four main documentaries are all worthy of inclusion and concentrate on the origin of the graphic novel, its themes, and subsequent impact.<br /><br />The pseudo-documentary `Under the Hood' is a fun 60-Minutes-style pastiche that provides more backstory and details from the graphic novel that are missing from the feature films.<br /><br />The Video Journals deal with the making of the movie but (putting the lack of a PLAY ALL option aside) it would have been nice if there was a more in-depth making-of feature to take us through all the stages of this ambitious production - Especially one that covered the casting of the movie, its troubled release and the abandoned previous incarnations. (The inclusion of a few trailers would have also been welcome.) So this cynic suspects a Deluxe-Ultimate Anniversary Edition in the pipeline at Warners.<br /><br />Instead of the obligatory, annoying Digital Copy, just a simple DVD of the Theatrical Cut would have been better (like Disney includes with all of their blu-rays), or even nothing at all. Hopefully film companies will abandon the Digital Copy fad altogether. Personally, I'd prefer no additional copy and a few pennies shaved off the price instead.<br /><br />Rounding off the package, at 325 minutes, is the exhaustive (arguably gimmicky) Motion Comic - But at least it's broken into 12 episodes, like the 12 chapters of the novel, and should satiate completists' appetites.<br /><br />On a final note, the 3 main discs come packaged in a fold-out card case (with the Motion Comic in a slim plastic blu-ray case) inside a card box.

0446560065|4.0|If you own a cat, (ahem!) I mean if you are owned by a cat, you'll love this book.     Although I do not have a cat currently living in my home, I have enjoyed the antics of cats. Simon Tofield accurately draws the joys and frustrations of Simon while his famous cat attempts to do battle with fish and birds, torment dogs, avoid cat collars, obtain a never-ending supply of food, and find a comfortable napping spot. I chuckled out loud with the trip to the veterinarian and again when Simon had to rescue the cat from the tree.

B001EN71HC|5.0|Especially for James Bond fans, the Austin Powers Collection is probably the funniest spoof I have seen. Die hard 007 fans will see quite a few \\"familiar\\" activities and throw backs to Bond, all the way back to Thunderball and perhaps beyond. The quality of the Bluray is exceptional, and a definite upgrade (1080p) to cable or conventional DVDs.     And if you like girls, you'll especially love the story line throughout all three BDs. This is definitely humor and satire at its very best.    Thanks Amazon for delivering this collection with speed ... I was tired of surfing cable for Austin Powers in hi def.

B001G7SS9G|5.0|While I still have problems with the CGI incarnations of the mutated humans (especially in light of the excellent incarnations of the alien refugees in \\"District 9\\"!),this ultimate collector's edition is BRILLIANT and an absolute MUST HAVE for any & every sci-fi collector! Figure in the drastically reduced price of units in the used section (the unit I recieved was BRAND NEW and still in the original factory wrap,and was in the price range of 6$ to 8$) and this crowning jewel of collector's editions is irresistable!

B001V9LRTM|4.0|While I like the multichannnel remix overall I'd say if you already have the Directors cut DVD then I wouldn't spend the money on the Blu-Ray.  The picture on the DVD looks the same on the Blu-Ray which makes sense since I would guess that the original footage was shot in 16mm.  The audio on the other hand sounds much better than on the DVD. If you're an audio purist than you probably won't like the multichannel mix, but I'm not a purist so I enjoyed it.  If you haven't seen the Director's cut then definiately buy the Blu-Ray.  The extra footage is worth the price.

0671646788|5.0|This was a very good motivational book.  A book that I will pick up and read again and again.
0765348276|5.0|Such a fascinating concept, to send not our young, but our old off to war. (I shouldn't be surprised if there are people out there wondering if we couldn't adopt that policy now, starting with those very folks who voted for our current entanglement.) There's a long tradition of military fiction within SF. Probably almost as far back as we imagined taking to the stars, have we wondered what warfare might be like when we got there. Perhaps because looking back at history, we see all the warfare and strife of our past, that we can only assume such will continue well into the future. It could be that reading about humans defeating aliens gives us an ability to cheer for the victors without feeling as if we should also sympathize with the losers. Scalzi portrays a remarkable breadth within that simple niche of the genre. Providing not merely warfare among the stars, but intriguing and innovative technologies that arise with it. (I wonder what he thinks, now that some mathematicians have shown it mathematically possible that there are parallel universes much as the way described in this novel.) Definitely an engaging novel, that sucks you right in and through the gimmick of following a recruit into the space military, you get to learn about the way of the universe outside Earth as he does. Action in plenty, as you might expect from a war novel, but beyond that, you see a lot diversity in the types and nature of aliens, the tactics of space warfare, and I dare say even some questioning about the whole nature of war, and these wars in particular. No surprise that this book was nominated for a Hugo. I look forward to the followup novel: The Ghost Brigades.
0061841935|4.0|Anyone who may find themselves skeptical about reading Ferguson's memoir can rest at ease. This is not a piece of celebrity self indulgence, it is a honest and often blunt reflection of one man's life, good and bad, all nastiness exposed. The author doesn't revel in his troubles, he doesn't say he's better for his alcoholism, or worse. Its just something he went through. The experience is all his own. What was so refreshing is that it is abundantly clear that Ferguson believes that he is nothing particularly special, and that those who believe otherwise just might be fooling themselves. This book is funny, poignant, reflective, and a must read for fans and non-fans of The Late Late Show's Scottish host.     Honestly, its like reading Angels Ashes written by a Scottish funny man.
B0027REDK2|3.0|This is a disappointment.  Why?  Because they're not the original UK mixes.  At least \\"Save a Prayer\\" isn't.  I was looking forward to this because, as a kid, I had the original UK cassette.  Actually, I borrowed it from a friend.  When I bought the cassette for myself, I bought the American version with the Kershenbaum mixes, in which  \\"Save a Prayer\\" was 30 seconds shorter.  If you want to know what I mean, watch the video or listen to the live version from Arena.  I've since ripped the audio from the Greatest DVD so I can have the original version of \\"Save a Prayer.\\"  The rest of the CD is fine.  I haven't given it much of a listen yet.  As a fan I've collected all of these tracks elsewhere, same with the bonus materials except for the demos.  But I'm not reviewing those.  Just that the version of \\"Save a Prayer\\" on this collection and all other previous digital audio releases is not the original version.  It's a shame, given that this is ostensibly directed towards loyal fans like myself who care about such things.
B0027YUK98|5.0|I have perhaps not given the attention, with the exception of the Spring, Kreutzer, and OP.96 sonatas, that these wonderful pieces deserve. That has been rectified with this mezmirizing complete set by Isabelle Faust and Alexander Melnikov. This is playing of the highest order, beautifully recorded. I recently heard Faust play the Mendelsson concerto and was mightily impressed, and these recordings confirmed my observation that she is an outstanding violinist. I would love to hear more of Melnikov too, a superb pianist. This is chamber music playing at its finest. The accompanying DVD about the making of the recordings is also very interesting. Along with the recent Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues by Jenny Lin, this release gets my record(s) of the year vote.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Seventy two years ago, Walt Disney released his vision: an animated feature length film that would go on to create an entire industry, and become arguably the most influential film of all time. That movie? The iconic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.     Snow White's story is timeless, and although it may be taken from fairytales, Disney's adaptation and interwoven music gave it new life, ensuring it would entertain generation after generation. It started out as \\"Disney's Folley,\\" but it became something more important than even Disney himself could imagine: a timeless piece of human culture, and a testament to the power of human creativity.     It's almost impossible to critique the actual movie itself, without taking all of that into account. It's not the most complex film; it doesn't have the greatest character development or plot. For those who haven't seen it - hopefully you're just all young and have a legit excuse - Snow White is about... Well, Snow White.     She's a beautiful princess, living with her evil stepmother, the Queen. The Queen has a magic mirror, and asks it constantly who the fairest in the land is. The mirror, fearful of the Queen, would always say she was - but one day it answers that Snow White is fairest of all! True to her self-centered nature, the Queen orders her huntsman to take Snow White into the woods and kill her. Not wanting to harm her, the huntsman lets Snow White go, urging her to stay in the woods. It's there that she meets a group of seven dwarf miners, moves in with them, and the rest is history.     Like I said, it's not the most complex story - or even truly original. But the way it's presented, with fantastic music and animation that remains breathtaking three quarters of a century later, it's impossible to not love the movie. It may not seem as influential today as it did back then, but there's no denying the mark Snow White has had on children throughout the world; on the animation industry; on Disney itself; and on the world.     With the new Diamond Edition release, Disney is taking a new approach, including both Blu-ray and DVD formats in the same packaging. It may seem like a waste, but it's ingenious, really; people who buy the DVD because they have no Blu player suddenly find themselves with a Blu version, and people who buy Blu will have a DVD version to give to friends, use on trips, or watch in other rooms.     Whether you buy the DVD or Blu-ray packaging, you're going to get the same contents: one DVD, and two Blu-ray discs, with one being the film and commentary, and the other hosting most of the features.     With that all out of the way, let's get to what people really want to know: how the new remastering looks. In one word: brilliant. Side by side, the DVD and Blu-ray screenshots look mostly the same, with the Blu version having a much more natural and crisp color tone. But play it on a big screen, and the differences in quality become readily apparent. Whereas the DVD version loses clarity as your screen gets bigger, the Blu-ray version remains crystal clear.     It really looks as if you're watching the actual animation cels themselves move, it's so clear looking. I've been amazed by plenty of older films' transfers before, but this is up there with Wizard of Oz in terms of wowing me with what a studio can do with movies from the early 20th century given a little time to revisit them.     The new 7.1 audio track also sounds great. For most of the movie it isn't really too obvious, but at a few key times - mainly during the memorable songs - you can really hear the work that went into this version. And, for you old-school folk out there, the mono version is also included if you want to hear the original soundtrack to the film.     In terms of extras, a few things are missing from the 2001 edition, but ultimately this is a release that will keep fans busy watching for a long time. There's hours of supplemental features in this release, and amazingly a vast majority ofthem are at least worth one watch. (Some, like Disney's required \\"a modern Disney 'star' sings a 'hit' song addition you can skip.)     There are backstage looks at how the film was made, commentary from multiple people and historians, The Backstage Disney portion and the details given about Walt and the creation of Snow White is something that all fans of Disney, movies, and history should really enjoy. The little factoids about how jokes came about, and about how Walt dug through trash to find scenes they threw away are really fun to find out.     Really, I can't recommend this release enough. Not only is it a fantastic video transfer of a film that's 72 years old (which you'll forget when you see it), but it's a piece of American history. Snow White has never looked, sounded, or been presented better. With both DVD and Blu-ray included, there's no reason not to get this set. And, if you don't have a Blu-ray player, Disney is once again providing more than enough reason to look at upgrading to the high-def format.

B0020TS5JM|5.0|Sorry folks, this is no mythic hero slaying demonic beings. It's a soldier on his way home to bury his wife and child that ends up with a couple unexpected passengers he helped drive to the verge of extinction. His ship crashes on a backward planet their society \\"seeded\\" and he, along with the unexpected passengers, are the only survivors. He must then try to eliminate the two \\"dragons\\" before they eliminate all life in the area of his crash site. This isn't just an action tale of super-predators and human survival but a moral drama regarding the rape of worlds. Good Special effects, authentic Viking backdrop, and rich character lines make the movie enjoyable even if you miss the real lesson. If you haven't seen it, you should.
B000GG4XHO|4.0|This is my third favorite Lou Reed album, after Blue Mask and Rock and Roll Animal. \\"Coney Island Baby\\" (the song) ranks up there with his finest songs, and, to my mind, gets a boost because it seems so genuinely vulnerable (\\"wanna play football for the coach\\"). In comparison, other songs are not quite as strong (hence 4 and not 5 stars), but, they're all memorable and bear up well under repeated playing. If you love Lou Reed, this album is a must.

B002KVSJ64|5.0|I'm a big Breaking Benjamin fan. I was worried that they were beginning a trend toward more radio friendly albums (formulaic songs that lacked high highs and low lows). When Phobia was released, my fears were almost realized. However, Dear Agony brought me back to what I have always loved about Breaking Benjamin: cacophonic screaming, drums, gain, etc. mixed well with catchy hooks and a great voice. Classic Breaking Benjamin.
0786868724|5.0|I've read all of Mitch Albom's books. I must say that I really love all of them and I really enjoyed reading \\"have a little faith\\". Couldn't put it down. The author brings two different religions, one from the rabbi (who want the author to do his eulogy) and an inner-city convict who found faith and was saved (his faith brought the best in him). This book makes you reflect and see what is really important. I was very moved by their stories. It made me think of my own beliefs and see people in a different light.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|It has been over 20 years since I saw this movie in a theater and I was anxious to see how the visuals and storyline on DVD compared to my memories of it back then.  It did not disappoint.     The rich colors and clarity of the movie are impressive. By having the opportunity to watch the movie on a DVD media, I was able to better appreciate the detail and effort contributed by the artists in the creation of the movie.      The added feature \\"Making of Pinocchio\\" gives a look at some of the people who helped contribute to the artwork, character voices, and  musical scores.     Despite the computer driven technical advancements made in animation features, Pinocchio still retains its high position of excellence.
1601251505|5.0|Before I begin, let it be known that I think people are putting too much emphasis on this whole \\"4th Edition vs. Pathfinder\\" argument. I am sick of hearing about the pros and cons of both systems, usually written by people who have no idea what they are talking about.<br /><br />If an RPG is fun, and capable of entertaining a group of people for any extended period of time, then it has succeeded in doing what it was made to do. I have been a Dungeon Master for going on two decades now, I cut my teeth on 2nd edition AD&D, and I have experience with every type of player and Game Master that one could imagine. Most of my games have been run using the 3rd Edition D&D rules, but I do occasionally run Paranoia and Call of Cthulhu campaigns.<br /><br />Pathfinder is an RPG that not only stands on its own, it also meshes nicely with the D20 product line. What this means is, with very minimal effort a person such as myself who has access to a library of D20 books can plug the Pathfinder rules into them. The Core Rulebook has a dual role of serving as both the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide; meaning that it is really all one needs in order to start playing. (Other than dice, character sheets, and friends to play with of course.)<br /><br />What really sells me on Pathfinder is that despite the upgrades and changes to every class and character race, it still manages to keep that good old Dungeons & Dragons feeling. The artwork in this book is simply beautiful, and a vast improvement over some previous editions. Being the graybeard that I am about RPGs I usually don't go for the more modern digital art, but the artists clearly kept that sort of grungy dungeon crawl nostalgia to heart when they worked on this project. Many modern RPGs tend to force the popular anime elements down our throats when it comes to artwork, but in this case the classic D&D adventure springs to life from every page in ways I didn't think possible with a digital medium. Wayne Reynolds may not hold the same place in my heart as Elmore, Caldwell, Easley, Parkinson, or Brom; but damn if he didn't do an excellent job bringing this book to life. Bravo sir!<br /><br />The pages are laid out simply, and new bolder text makes them easier to read than ever before. I really like the way that each Magic Spell is headed by a bar that separates it from the other spells in the chapter. I have hosted a few Pathfinder games by now, and none of the pages have smudged or faded from use. It's also nice how little things (like the Monk's flurry of blows attack) are often calculated and placed in the chapters where they are most pertinent.  Simple things throughout this book make it easier to navigate, especially while a game is going on. I hate when the game is interrupted because someone can't find an obscure rule that is buried in the back of a rulebook. The Pathfinder index has kept such instances to a minimum.<br /><br />Before this product was even launched, some called the rules system \\"munchkiny\\" and overpowered. After actually playing this system for a few games I denounce such claims as foolish and misinformed. If anything, the Pathfinder system polices itself and keeps power-gaming to much lower levels than what I saw with 3rd Edition D&D. The flow of Skill Points is now limited by the current Hit Dice of the players; and that silly half-a-skill point rule from 3rd Edition is long gone. Players are rewarded with skill bonuses when they place points in Class Skills, and not punished when placing points in Cross-Class skills. Players also receive a Feat every other level now, which I applaud because it encourages players to customize their characters more fully. Some may claim that this is insanely overpowered, but I would point out that many of the more powerful Feats are limited by Class Level or Attack Bonus. A player cannot simply become a whirling death machine by choosing the right Feats at a low level. Instead players are given more of a chance to show love to some Feats that have been long neglected, such as Skill Focus and the riding Feats; all of which have been revamped and made awesome by this system.<br /><br />Each race and character class has been given an overhaul. Sorcerers and Wizards got the biggest changes in my opinion and damn if I don't love it. Sorcerers get to choose a \\"Bloodline\\" at 1st level that determines the source of their power; making each Bloodline like an awesome mini-class in and of itself. Wizards are given powerful abilities when they choose which magical school to specialize in, even the Universalist who can now throw melee weapons and have them return in a manner not-unlike the Glaive from Krull. It seems like every class is all about the options and what your character can aspire to is limited only by your imagination. Players are often given the chance to trade out some of the more \\"useless\\" perks (like familiars and animal companions who never see the light of day) for weapon improvements or additional powers.<br /><br />The classic races seem a lot less insulting in Pathfinder. Half-Orcs are no longer forced to be stupid, instead they can choose which stat to place a bonus into, just like Humans and Half-Elves. They also get the cool ability to fight on while mortally wounded due to their fierce heritage. Half-elves no longer feel like a wasted race, as they are the only ones who can choose two favored classes; an ability that no other race has. Even Gnomes are given a face-lift with the magic of their bloodlines setting them far apart from Halflings and Dwarves. (By the way, there are several players in my games that have Gnome characters. The \\"I'm a monster RAWR!\\" add campaign is not funny, nor does it make me wish to spend money on a new rules system. I'd rather play a Gnome than a dragon man or the newest flavor of Elf. )<br /><br />In short, I bought Pathfinder, and I am glad I did. My old 3rd Edition campaigns are as alive today as they were 5 years ago and I look forward to seeing what Paizo has to offer with future products. If you feel that this system is overpowered, I suggest that you give it a chance, play a game or two, and then decide based upon the effect it has on play. I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.ected, such as Skill Focus and the riding Feats; all of which have been revamped and made awesome by this system.

And how long will we have to endure the answerless questions? Could it be there is a secret code embedded in the Capitoline Plat? Naw, those streets were arranged for covering cannon fire in an age of bastions.

B00000J7SS|1.0|If you want to be annoyed by incoherent instrumental notes that never amount to absolutely anything, this is for you. Even saying that this \\"music\\" reflects the mental state of a drunk is a stretch, drunkenness still maintains a better sense of consciousness and purpose. Finding the fortitude needed to endure this tedious absurdity in its entirety is no easy task and one sure to provoke a headache and anger; because if this album achieves anything, it is being incessantly annoying by having no emotion, energy, melody, or anything that constitutes any musical value. At the end, this is nothing but trash recorded with good audio equipment, over-rated pretentious trash that is; and the claim of many that this album has elements of rock, funk, and soul is more absurd than the album itself. However, if you are a pretentious fool who likes to pretend to \\"get it\\" or an individual intrigued by random abstract noise to the beat of an overly monotonous percussion then this is also for you.     Here rather are various instrumental recordings that indeed deserve a look. Dave Brubeck - Time Out, Ruben Gonzalez - Introducing..., Cachaito, Herb Alpert - South of the Border, The Ventures, Ry Cooder & Manuel Galban, Beastie Boys - Mix up (you'll be surprised), Augustus Pablo - East of the River Nile, Jan Hammer - Escape From Television, etc.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|\\"In a Silent Way\\" single-handedly ushered in a new era of improvised music blending the sophisticated modes of jazz, the up-tempo pulse of rock and the cool other-worldliness of ambient - a term coined 12 years later by Brian Eno. According to John McLaughlin, Miles was an inspirational band leader who was able to inspire unique performances by bringing together the best young musicians and flexibly original material.     The 18 minute opening track \\"Shh Peaceful\\" finds the musicians moving in and out of the simple musical forms together building to a shared climax from what has come before. Resolve to the after-glow of \\"In a Silent Way\\" - Joe Zawinul's composition recalling the mountains of his boyhood home in Austria. Miles instructed McLaughlin to \\"play the melody but not the chords\\". McLaughlin came up with something that uniquely held the mood while allowing Miles and saxophonist Wayne Shorter to play the theme and evoke a haunting yet hopeful mood inherent in the composition.     \\"It's about that Time\\" emerges full-grown from that dream-trance. Clocking a 4-4 rock beat (Tony Williams) along with a spacious, stuttering bass beat (Dave Holland), Miles states an open ended theme underpinned by electric guitar (McLaughlin) and multiple keyboards (Corea, Hancock, Zawinul). Solos happen but the evolving blend dances around the solid pulse bringing to a boil the passions that have been simmering and building from the beginning. More than anything the music evokes the sensuous feel of late night sex.

How many times can you hear that the servants buy for the master whatever they need expensive or lavish and the servants don't have any greed on it? I know there are destitute all over the world -most of them in the third world, but they don't do what their masters want with no hesitation. If you really want to get depressed read this book.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|One other reviewer said she hadn't heard an album she liked this much in years. I feel the same way! Someone sent me (ironically on my birthday) an email with La Roux's 'Bulletproof' video attached. I was blown away! I got the whole CD on import the same day (this was last August) and have not stopped playing it since!<br /><br />I have always loved Yazoo (Yaz here in the states) and Eurythmics, and La Roux is somewhat similar (as far as being a synth-pop band with an amazing female singer). Some people can't handle there being absolutely no acoustics, but I have always been a huge fan of synth pop, so naturally this is a total thrill for me. We've been suffering SO LONG with such crap music all around us, that this CD is like rain on a dry, cracked desert!<br /><br />There is a beautiful track called 'Armour Love' and another called 'Cover My Eyes' (I am not sure why I get the distinct feeling these two songs are being sung to another girl). There are also completely brilliant dance tracks like 'Bulletproof', 'Quicksand', 'In For The Kill' and the very underrated 'Fascination.' Do you know how rare it is to have a CD with almost all great tracks!?<br /><br />Elly Jackson (the singer in La Roux) has at least three different voices and all of them are great! I totally recommend this album.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|DVD is excellent quality and arrived in perfect condition.  Excellent product - would certainly buy again.
B000002JPA|5.0|First let me start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of this band.  I've bought several of their albums since I first purchased Images and Words, their first cd, and didn't care much for any of them.  They now sit at the bottom of my 600 cd collection.  I purchased this cd the week it came out after seeing them on headbanger's ball, the only time they ever played them on that show and fell in love with it.  Pull Me Under is one of my favorite songs, it is dark and beautiful, mysterious and excellent.  The rest of the cd isn't as good as the first track but still every song is well done.  Track 5 is my 2nd favorite song.  This cd is also very long, well over an hour, so you get your monies worth there too.  If you have any interest in checking this band out, get this cd, it is their best work.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I've been highly anticipating this new album since all 2008 when the BSB announced it & teased us with interviews! And with all of the BSB's smart decision not to leak too much & tease a bit by updating on their personal internet pages; I was waiting for October 6 of 2009 to get here quicker! But now that the day has come; I've got to say it was definately worth the wait! ;)<br /><br />I've been with the Backstreet Boys since their first album, then Millennium, Black & Blue, & when they came back with more great albums like Never Gone & Unbreakable! As a matter of fact I got Unbreakable when it first came out back in late 2007; that was a day I'd never forget! ;)<br /><br />But does their new album This is Us live up to those other great BSB albums?! I say it most definately does; & even if it has a bit of a different direction! What surprised me was the new sound the BSB used for their new songs; & I'm even also surprised the track list didn't change after being leaked... when I first saw the song list on Amazon! ;)<br /><br />How I rank each song:<br />1) Straight Through My Heart = of course this is what started my craze to want the new album so badly; I've had it stuck in my head & because of the BSB's awesome vampire theme music video! It's just pure & simple aweness; so no DUH it deseres not a 10/10... but a 1,000,000/1,000,000! :D<br />2) Bigger = It's got a grown up sound to it; & I love the catchy & heartwarming lyrics! It's also perfect; so another 10/10!<br />3) Bye Bye Love = I was first skeptical of the song title when I first saw it & not hearing it due to no leaks; but it's not that cheasy as I thought it would turn out... thinking it have some 80's reference because of the song tile! But it's just a pure awesome pop hit; with the most insane & catchy BSB sound & catchy lyrics! It totally deserves a 10/10!<br />4) All of your Life (You need Love) = just more perfect catchy lyrics; which I can't get enough of! I also love the high tempo & fast paced sound! It's got an excellent vibe; expeciailly since it's all about romance! 9.5/10!<br />5) If I knew then = 9.5/10<br />6) This is Us = First I thought it would turn out as great as the title song was on Never Gone; but unfortunately it's just mostly fast paced repating of the new album's song title! It does have a nice tempo though; & the lyrics are expecially great as well! I was first thinking to rate it a 7/10... but I'm going to be generous & give it an 8/10! ;)<br />7) PDA = I was thinking it be like an AJ McLean song; since I am still wondering why he hasn't released any info from his new solo album! But after listening to it; it sounds like tha one song from Never Gone; Poster Girl! It's just downright attitude! It may be sort of akward for the album; but it gets a 7/10!<br />8) Masquerade = I have not much to say about it; but like PDA... it has that same kind of sound & feel to it! I'd also rate it a 7/10!<br />9) She's a Dream = very lovely indeed; it's got another romantic type of vibe... hence the song title! An 8/10!<br />10) Shattered = It's a beautiful ballad; but I'm not sure if it lives up the other best of the best BSB ballads! I'd personally give it a 8.5 instead of anything around a 9 for it doesn't show that much effort for me! ;) :(<br />11) Undone = feels empty to me; hence the title... so not much to say! A 7/10!<br /><br />So all in all; it sort of lives up to it's other albums... but is also just as good! ;)illy since it's all about romance! 9.5/10!  5) If I knew then = 9.5/10  6) This is Us = First I thought it would turn out as great as the title song was on Never Gone; but unfortunately it's just mostly fast paced repating of the new album's song title!

0756655307|5.0|NOTE: This review is for the NEW and UPDATED Marvel Encyclopedia. When I wrote this review, the new version's reviews were separate from the previous version. Since then, Amazon has combined the reviews, and this is a shame, because the updated version corrects most if not all of the problems found in the previous version. /END NOTE    I received this book on it's release day, as I was very excited about it, and wanted it as quickly as possible. I was not disappointed! The book is 400 pages on high quality, glossy print, with brilliant artwork, and color that pops off the page.     The book is meant as a reference, and includes basically every Marvel character ever created with a short bio for some, and up to 4 pages for the Marvel superstars like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine.    I have the DC Encyclopedia as well, and it's great too, but the text is so small. The Marvel 2009 (Updated & Expanded) Encyclopedia improves this greatly with a font that's at least 2 sizes bigger for all entries, and many lead-in paragraphs include even larger fonts. This was a huge relief to my older eyes.    The encyclopedia includes more than just A to Z entries for heroes and villains, it also has entries for Marvel events, such as the Civil War. Non-American Marvel characters are included as well, including UK hero Captain Britain, and Alpha Flight, a Canadian team.     Extremely thorough, giant glossy pages, incredible artwork, and excellent layout (with a highly readable font) make this a masterwork, and a must-have for any Marvel fan. Amazon's price makes it a no-brainer.    The only drawback? Get your arms ready, this thing weighs 5.5 pounds!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|As my wife and I feel that Diana Krall is one of our favorite artists, the CD is great.  I was very disappointed, however, that the CD case was cracked when the product arrived, as this CD was a birthday gift for my wife.  I don't know whether the fault lies with the mail service or the packers at Amazon.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|I actually resisted buying any of the re-masters, having just about EV-ER-Y fomat available of EV-ER-Y track \\"the boys\\" ever recorded. But I finally caved in using this album as a lithmus test (so to speak). Given the ground-breaking and (at the time) revolutionary production techniques used to record it, my thought was, 'if this one sounds good, the others will surely stand up as well.'<br /><br />So, does it?<br /><br />Yeah...kinda.<br /><br />The first thing that stands out is the care that went into getting the original mix just right while at tne same time enhancing the orignal masters (although I don't remember the original mix being in \\"Beatle Stereo\\"), most notably, McCarney's bass and Ringo's drums...you can actually hear them now! The vocals are as if they're right in the room and Harrison's leads, although a tad thin at times, are more present than before as well.<br /><br />But even after 40+ years of listening and memorizing, a remix can never be completely perfect. For example, there are off-moments in the mix of \\"Within You Without You\\" where the guitar solo is out of balance with the strings and tambouras (yet it comes striking back near the end). The horns on \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" aren't as beefy as they once were and the reeds on \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" seem a tad muffled.<br /><br />But where there are glitches, there are also moments that shine. \\"She's Leaving Home\\" has never sounded fuller and more lush, the opening track jumps out at you from the opening crowd sequence and Lennon's vocal on \\"A Day In The Life\\" is so in-your-face yet so innocent it's enough to make you cry. Not to mention the coup de grace - the most important single chord in the history of recorded music - the crashing final E Major chord at the end of the album; it's obvious that this one chord was treated with all the reverence it deserves as the monsterous clarity, intensity and finality of it is meticulously and majestically restored to signal the end to this vital piece of history.<br /><br />Overall, a good job - not terrific, mind you - of restoring (arguably) the most important album in all of rock and roll. But this one's mainly for the audiophile purist. And even then, don't expect miracles.job - not terrific, mind you - of restoring (arguably) the most important album in all of rock and roll.

B0021L8UXU|4.0|I say American because it is distinctly American.  The film not only brings the nearly iconic Woody Harrelson back into the mainstream eye, and boy does he prove to deserve it, but it is also a road trip film that references and celebrates cultural figures from Hanna Montana to Woody Nelson, and of course, and I say this teetering on giving away massive spoilers; the great comedic talent Bill Murray.  I too think Bill Murray is at the tippity-top of the Hollywood A-list.<br /><br />Zombieland stars Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus, a quirky almost obsessive compulsive zombieland survivalist who keeps a list of rules to guide him through an American zombie post-apocalyptia.  He's not quite the likable everyman, assuming I don't completely misunderstand this new twenty-something generation.  More or less, he's a loner nerdy type and balances out perfectly with Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee character.  Harrelson's character is fiercely vengeful, and in a surprising moment of real and even somewhat powerful drama the audience can sympathize.  He is an intense alpha male bent on destroying zombies in humiliating ways, and becoming quite possibly the last person in the universe to consume a twinkie.  The product is a zombie-killer to nearly rival Ash from Evil Dead II.  Sisters Little Rock and Wichita played by young talent Abigail Breslin and the very sexy Emma Stone are con-artists who have stumbled upon the other two protagonists and in the process gradually lose their mistrust of other people.<br /><br />Zombieland doesn't fall into the trap of being too derivative of, or even into becoming a willing tribute to other zombie movies.  Few movies can or even want to pull that off, and it's almost understandable given the thin sub-genre to begin with.  Zombieland also is not even remotely exploitative, as even its violence isn't done to shock or disgust, although it is often used to make those of us with a dark sense of humor laugh a little.  It has slapstick humor, some truly great one-liners, and moments where the comedy is more successful than even the funniest of zombie comedies.<br /><br />Although I did say this film isn't derivative of other zombie movies, it still serves to remind me of some great movies within the sub-genre.  The isolation and post-zombie takeover feel reminded me of [[ASIN:B0001611DI Dawn of the Dead]], arguably the greatest pure zombie movie ever made.  The slapstick comedy a la three stooges reminded me of [[ASIN:6305841861 Evil Dead II]], arguably the greatest movie ever made (seriously).  Other films that came to mind were the Australian cult-classic [[ASIN:157362408X Dead Alive]] and Robert Rodriguez's recent zombie comedy gorefest [[ASIN:B001F0TM5S Planet Terror]].  But mostly I'm glad some are seeing this as our answer to the wonderful British modern classic [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]], albeit Zombieland is still a dramatically different style movie.  I enjoyed Zombieland tremendously and not just because it is a delightful Halloween treat but because I can already tell this is a movie that will warrant many repeat viewings in the years to come.s, and moments where the comedy is more successful than even the funniest of zombie comedies.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|After a few comments about the film itself, I'll get to the issue that's probably worrying people about to purchase this disk -- is it worth the upgrade?<br /><br />\\"Snow White\\" is probably the most self-consciously ingenuous film ever made. It is so unbelievably sincere (and honestly, sincerely sincere) that it probably has more effect on depraved cynics like myself than on normal folk. When the dwarfs started singing \\"Heigh-Ho\\", I broke into tears. (And you don't want to know how I feel about \\"One Song\\". I was in love with someone I felt that way about.) It's no coincidence \\"Snow White\\" is the film the mogwai watch when they invade the theater. As Billy Peltzer says... \\"They're watching 'Snow White' -- and they love it!\\" Who wouldn't?<br /><br />My only complaint is that the sequence of Snow White meeting the dwarfs, making them wash their hands, etc, (note the similarity to \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\") runs on too long. But this was all very novel 70 years ago. Grim Natwick's animation of Snow White, especially her dance with the dwarfs, is still a marvel. (He animated Betty Boop, and Disney hired him specifically for Snow White.)<br /><br />Disney and his artists had no idea what they were doing... But they managed to \\"nail it\\" on the first try. There have been more-sophisticated animated films, but there has never been a \\"better\\" one. And when you get the audience to break into tears over the \\"death\\" of an animated character -- how much farther can you go?<br /><br />Now... as to the Blu-ray transfer (which I viewed on a 60\\" Pro Kuro fed from a Sony BDP-S550)... This is \\"Snow White\\"'s second \\"digital restoration\\". It is not the same as the digital restoration for the Platinum DVD. For one thing, every last bit of dust -- especially in the Multiplane shots -- has been expunged.<br /><br />The overall \\"look\\" strongly resembles the recent \\"Pinocchio\\" restoration that caused some controversy. (You might want to look at the \\"Pinocchio\\" reviews to get an idea of it.) \\"Pinocchio\\" had three promblems:<br /><br />1. The overall reduction in contrast caused many of the darker scenes to be too light. Given that \\"Pinocchio\\" is a dark film (both visually and thematically), this significantly altered the film's \\"visual tone\\".<br /><br />2. Cel imperfections -- uneven painting, in particular -- were agressively removed, to the point where the film sometimes looked downright \\"sterile\\".<br /><br />3. The saturation was goosed to the point where it seemed unnatural for a film that was supposed to emulate \\"European masters\\".<br /><br />\\"Snow White\\" appears to have been processed in a similar fashion. It's not a persistently \\"dark\\" film, so the (perhaps unwanted) increase in shadow detail is not as bothersome. Similarly, the \\"cleaning up\\" seems less aggressive, and there's rarely any sense of visual sterility.<br /><br />As for saturation... I was pleased to see that it was restrained, and not in your face. But... when viewing the supplemental materials on disk 2, the inserts from this transfer showed noticeably higher saturation. Which is thoroughly confusing, because both are presumably derived from the same digital source. Regardless, you can adjust saturation on your monitor to your taste.<br /><br />There is also the issue of color rendition. As wonderful as Technicolor was, it did not render all hues perfectly. So tests were made and paints adjusted to bring the final color closer to what the artists had in mind. Unfortunately, when you make a direct transfer from the original three-strip B&W negative, you lose Technicolor's errors, and the colors are rendered more closely to the way they appeared on the background or cel. This was not generally noticeable in \\"Pinocchio\\", but it is (or appears to be) in \\"Snow White\\". Some lighter colors -- particularly on animals, and some clothing -- just don't look right. Two of the birds have vivid lemon-yellow splotches on their chests, which I don't remember from any preceding version, and almost certainly could not have been Disney's intention.<br /><br />There are also some surprising glitches. In the title credits, there are green splotches over some of the text. Worse, in the sequence where Dopey gets caught in the furniture and kitchenware and runs out of the cottage, there is moment of the dwarfs in and among the trees with a nasty green color shift, that disappears when Dopey enters the frame. It's hard to understand how this was not caught.<br /><br />The soundtrack is supposed to be 7.1, but tracks 6 and 7 remained silent, and there wasn't much on 4 and 5. In compensation, the sound itself is just plain beautiful -- very clean and rich. (Contrast it with the new \\"Wizard of Oz\\", which has the worst sound I've yet heard from any edition of this film.)<br /><br />So... should you trade in the Platinum DVD for the Blu-ray? If you have no intention of ever switching to Blu-ray, I'd say \\"no\\". The earlier edition is excellent, and the changes wrought by this new transfer probably won't be important. But, if nothing else, the 1080p transfer is intended to be seen on a large, high-resolution display. You're not going to get that quality from an up-converted DVD.<br /><br />The high resolution has the expected benefits (note the incredible detail on the pages of the storybook at the beginning) as well as an unexpected drawback -- the poor animation of Prince C. is all-too visible, especially his mouth when singing.<br /><br />We'll have to get used to seeing the classic Disney films in ways that represent both improvements, and changes from the artists' original intent. I guess that's the way it is.<br /><br />PS: Since writing this, I've viewed the DVD version on a 36\\" 400-series Sony WEGA IDTV. Much of the quality is retained, though the picture is (not surprisingly) not so spectacular as it is on Blu-ray. However, the change in the picture's \\"visual tone\\" actually seems to help on a smaller, lower-definition display.

B002Q0F6V0|5.0|I am a huge AIC fan and was a little skeptical when I heard about a new singer. My doubts are gone. His voice is so close to Layne Staley, but also brings some of his own soul to the music. This is a great albumn. Must buy.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I've spent every day since the 9-9-09 listening to the Stereo mixes and then the Mono mixes. I'm not going to analyze every nuance heard, just a few points.<br /><br />Certain songs are completely different in Mono. First and foremost,<br />The Mono Paperback Writer is completely different from the stereo. They're are like two different songs. Then there are the obvious differences like Sgt.Pepper's LHCB. This was a a new experience for me. I now like the Mono version better then the stereo. The subtle drop ins between songs sound almost like mistakes. She's Leaving Home is in a different key. The White album has the same things going on<br /><br />Having grown up with the stereo mixes, I find many of the MONO tracks muddy.<br />I actually like the Left and Right seperation on the the first 4 albums.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The Mono mixes are great. The Stereo mixes are more satisfying.
0486450066|5.0|Book was as described.  It was packaged well and delivered to me promptly.  Good experience!
B002GZQYMK|2.0|Is this supposed to be different.  I couldn't be bothered to let it finish it was so boring.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|THIS CD IS WELL WORTH THE BUY, IT IS AMAZING, FOR IT SHOWS HOW TRULY GREAT THIS BAND IS.
B000001FZK|5.0|I am very fortunate that I happened upon this album in a used CD store....yes on the original label.  I have listened to it three straight times through.  I started reading other reviews and realized that I could not add much more to what has already been said about this amazing recording.  I love Talk Talk's debut, Colour of Spring, and Spirit of Eden.  This is a tour de force in a complete opposite direction......or maybe not.  If you want to talk about the maturity of a band like the Beatles between their first album and Revolver; five short years, expect nothingless than to be blown away by Laughing Stock.  This music is a sonic and lyrical blessing.     Dare:  put it on and dont take it off, even when you want to.  It is like taking a drive through as many landscapes/seascapes/earthscapes as possible in one hour.  Unbelievable.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I first heard about Lady Gaga on the Hills and her act caught my attention mainly because of the hooded leotard and the her name itself. Then i heard her first hit, loved it. Then i heard her second hit, loved it ever more. By Love Game I realized shes got something. Looked around her site and still was undecided. I only by Cds if i think the whole album will be worth it. After the VMA performance and hearing Papazzi.. it was decided. I went out and got this cd and I can not stop listening to it. I obviously skip the ones i already have heard a millions times on the radio, but all of the other songs are just like candy. The album has a variety of music and great to listen to. I often have it pumping in my cubical while I work throughout the day. It's upbeat and Keep my mood up. By far I love SummerBoy and StarStruck. I love the Mix of Glam Rock (reminds me of the Xanadu soundtrack), Simplicity of the songs (Lyrics dont have to be deep.. can't they just be fun), and all in between. I haven't bought a CD of an artist in many years. Usually just get the singles, but this one is really really good. Trust me, listen to the CD serveral times and you'll be hooked.<br /><br />Side note:<br />I also checked out alot of her performances over the last two years and she usually mixes up the beats when she performs live. When she performed at SNL Love Game, the beginning with the outer space mix was awesome, there also a European performance where she did another song with a Marilyn Mansion feel to it. Love it. i wish she would out a live cd with those performances, Check em out on you tube and see for yourself.<br /><br />Lady Gaga = 5 stars!
1594488916|4.0|I confess, I'm a bibliomaniac. But I'm not the kind of monomaniacal collector of first editions who commits credit card fraud in order to waltz off with first editions of classic novels to which he feels entitled, as was (and perhaps still is?) the case with John Gilkey, the \\"man who loved books too much\\" of the title.<br /><br />Allison Hoover Bartlett does a thorough and creditable job of giving readers insight into the arcane world of rare book dealers and into the mind of an obsessive collector, who figures that the high prices of these cherished objects mean that it's just fine for him to steal in order to build his collection. Gilkey can't even describe what the books mean to him -- it's the aesthetics, he ultimately tells Bartlett; he likes the way they look all lined up on a shelf -- but that doesn't stop him from compulsively and self-destructively doing whatever it takes to add to his collection, even after he's been arrested at least twice. Sentenced to three years on one occasion, Gilkey serves 18 months; it seems, he says, \\"an awfully long time to be behind bars for liking books.\\"<br /><br />This is an intriguing glimpse into a world that even many avid readers will find new -- that of the rare and antiquarian book trade. At the same time, however, the story itself too often felt like a magazine article expanded in length but not in scope to fill a book. There's a lot of repetition (particularly the author's musings about Gilkey's motives and discussions of his tactics) and not enough action. More problematic for me, at least, was the author herself was far too present in the story. Everything is seen through her eyes, even when I as a reader hungered for her to take a step back and let the protagonists -- the booksellers and Gilkey -- tell me directly or indirectly what transpired. There were some occasions where that tactic clicked, as when Bartlett accompanies Gilkey to visit a bookstore after his release from prison, and chronicles the tension in the air as he prowls through the shelves, watched with thinly-veiled hostility by the storeowner; or when she comments that the rare book dealer who sets out to nab Gilkey -- the hero -- is a more difficult person to deal with than is Gilkey, the criminal. On many other occasions, however, it falls flat, as when she rambles for several pages about the possible motivations of Gilkey. \\"What must it be like, I wondered, to view the world in such a way, to feel entitled to all one desired and to be able to justify to oneself any means of obtaining it?\\" It's also frustrating to hear her muse about the questions she wanted to ask him but didn't (if the questions were important, why not ask them? And if not, why bother to mention them?) When she gets a glimpse into Gilkey's room, including a closet filled with books, she doesn't scrutinize them in search of stolen items. \\"Later, I would curse my lack of courage.\\" But we never learn why or in what circumstances she did so.<br /><br />Intriguingly, Bartlett comes to question her own complicity with Gilkey -- he begins confessing to her, and tries to give her a satisfactory ending to the book. \\"I was still trying to cling to the notion that I was recording a story that was progressing without my influence. I was not going to become its director,\\" she writes; at the same time, one of the booksellers she interviews tells her, bitterly, that giving Gilkey a forum for his views is making him too public a figure, and compares the book thief to mass murderer Charles Manson.<br /><br />I've rated this 3.5 stars for a solid story well-told, and rounded it up to 4 stars because of Bartlett's ability to tell great stories about collecting and books, as well as her insights into how she, too, may be a collector, albeit of a different kind than Gilkey. Writing this book was obviously a transformative experience for Bartlett; I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to any fellow bibliomaniac, but Gilkey's story didn't have the same impacton me as it did the author.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone interested in books and collecting; others may find it interesting. There are several other excellent books out there with similar themes. In particular, a great five-star read about bibliomania is [[ASIN:080504826X GENTLE MADNESS: BIBLIOPHILES, BIBLIOMANES, AND THE ETERNAL PASSION FOR BOOKS.

1416550542|4.0|A little girl all alone on a wharf. What's a good man to do but take her home to his wife? I found this to be a very absorbing mystery. A manipulative aunt/mother/mother-in-law finally reaps what what she deserves. I would have given it 5 stars, but I felt that the ending was a bit unrealistic although very interesting. What are the chances of finding a missing person in the unrealistic way the Authoress happened to be found? And why was no other identifying evidence found? (I would say more about this but don't want to give away any of the plot). All in all, it's a very excellent read and I felt that most of it was very true to life.
B002AOWXQ8|4.0|This album was a bit suprising for me.  I was never quite sure what to make of it.  It definately is it's own thing.  The singing style seems to harken back to the 60's and 70's but the sounds are not like anything I've heard recently.  It was necletic and thats why I liked.  It had a little bit everything in there.  The best way I can describe is take arcade fire but imagine what they would have been like in the 60's.  Pretty cool but not spectacular.
B002ND6AOM|5.0|This version of 'Rio' is worth every penny due to the release, for the first time ever on CD or in preservable digital format, of the U.S. album mixes (including both the U.S. \\"album mix\\" and subsequent \\"Night Version\\" of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\") as presented to in 1983.  The U.K. mixes are present and accounted for as well, making this truly the definitive 'Rio'.  I could not be happier with the sound quality of this release.  Even the MP3's are balanced, clear and actually quite punchy: a step up even from the 2001 remaster, which was a tad bass-heavy.

1564148793|5.0|The author of this book is eclectic and so is the book, which truly delighted me.  Even though this book provides sample spells you could use, which are dedicated to Hecate, the book was truly intended for experienced witches / magicians and it is recommended that you either write your own spells or use spells and visualizations that are part of traditions you have been actually immersed in.  The author appropriately points out that being eclectic is all and well, but that you should know the energies you are calling and choose to work with inside and out to avoid any mishaps.<br /><br />The author shares many examples throughout the book - both from his personal experience and from experiences of other people - of what you may expect to happen when you engage in different kinds of practices.  He also shares stories that span across wide range of traditions.  He points out that causes of experiencing the effects of negative energies / attacks / bad luck may range from accidentally offending nature spirits or infringing upon places where great power has been raised to breaking vows one has made at some point or actually being attacked by someone else.<br /><br />He then shares suggestions for identifying the problem.  Incidentally, when it comes to identifying possible attacks, the culprits are not only individual people or energies but also big organizations - after all we are all constantly being influenced and we are influencing each other in different ways - through the use of thoughts, skillful use of words, technology, media, advertisements and so on - though instead of becoming paranoid, it is recommended that we take care of and  cleanse our minds, hearts and environments regularly and to be vigilant of our own thoughts - because our thoughts do create our reality.<br /><br />The author offers a general daily routine consisting mainly of meditation as a primary tool for purifying one's mind and bringing peace into one's life, making offerings and doing banishing rituals.  While this simple daily routine can take care of most situation and is alike a practice of daily mental and energetic hygiene (by the way you may incorporate other energetic practices that may be part of your tradition), the rest of this book contains techniques that may be helpful in more challenging situations where you seem to be experiencing a sudden run of bad luck, where you feel hit by a series of dismal events which may have no logical explanation.<br /><br />These other techniques include the use of shields, different things you can do with your energy field, the use of cleansing baths and amulets, there is a mention of exorcism, creating artificial spirits,  a variety of techniques for reversal magic, apparently mostly from the Hoodoo tradition, as well as healing and recovery after the problem has been solved - some of the healing techniques involve soul retrieval as practiced in shamanism.ing rituals.

B00000F14B|4.0|This movie of Meredith Wilson's \\"The Music Man\\" is quite a treat for the eyes and ears.    This bargain-priced edition offers some extra features - the soundtrack has been remastered; there's a short documentary on the making of the movie; an intro by Shirley Jones, who plays the female lead; and a couple of theatrical trailers.    This is plenty for me.  I find the so-called \\"audio commentaries\\" (where someone is yaking while the movie is running) to be an annoyance.  And I've never understood why DVDs sometimes include a radio version of the movie.  I've got the movie, for heaven's sake!

B00004SZWB|5.0|It was on the 1970 album release \\"Signed, Sealed, Delievered\\" that Stevie was able to have more imput on where his music was going and the true genius of his talent was allowed to sparkle started to take form.  The 70's saw him release what, in my opinion, was the most incredible string of albums and music that's ever been heard.  Only Earth, Wind & Fire to me had that kind of string of great albums in that decade and both were truly historic and took music, it's writing, recording and performance, to the next level.<br /><br />\\"Hotter Than July\\" which was released in late 1980 featured some of his best songwriting amazing songs and signaled an end to the type of music Stevie made throughout his decade of excellence beginning in 1970. Although he would continue to make great music in the rest of the 1980's and even beyond, this is truly the end of what many call his \\"Classic\\" period and the albums released from this one on were not on the same par as the work you find in this 10 year period.<br /><br />There's such a wonderful variety on this album and Stevie's historic songwriting skills are once again put on display.  You have the the soulful sounds of \\"All I Do\\", the lryical masterpiece in \\"Rocket Love\\", the funky and fun \\"As if You Read My Mind\\" & \\"Do Like You\\" are as nasty & funky as it gets!  I really adore \\"Lately\\" which shows off one his greatest strengths in penning love ballads.  Stevie goes country with \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" and of course, it wouldn't be a Stevie album with out a song dealing with injustice in society \\"Cash In Your Face\\".<br /><br />\\"Happy Birthday\\" which is a crowning achievement for Stevie!  I remember him being at the forefront of the move to have Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday honored as a national holiday even speaking in person before a joint session of congress with the president present.  It can't be overstated how truly influential Stevie has been in many areas of life not just in music.<br /><br />He's always been at the forefront of any movement that promoted equality and change in the way others thought about life, love and living for all people.  \\"Happy Birthday\\" once again reaffirmed Stevie's incredible social awareness and how important is was and is to recognize all people who have in some way made a change for equality and better living for all.  The world had not truly seen the likes of Stevland Hardaway Morris and to this day, we've not known another like him.

0132350882|5.0|Another reviewer stated that most of this book was \\"common sense\\".   However, he either didn't read the whole book (usually the case) or he works only with people who have.  The focus of the book is pouding the concept into your head first THAT you need clean code and then HOW you write clean code.   It's starts as easy, light read but it slowly changes into a compelling case study ... usable by any developer in any OO language.   While I agreed with many of the concepts in the book before I read it, it still seemed that it was good for other people, not necessarily me.   NOW, I'm a true believer and you probably will be too!    Recommended to any developer ... highly recommended for any developer that doesn't work alone.  The only real downside is that the book's sample code is almost exclusively Java.   However, most OO coders can read other languages even if they can't write in them.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|There was a time when I couldn't have believed I could actually enjoy the rough,  violent, anti-PC atmosphere of a film with the name \\"Clint Eastwood\\" attached to it.  Not only did I enjoy this film, I found it to be the most wonderfully touching,  funny, heartwrenching movie I've seen in a long, long time. That it is all that,  yet still remains faithful to the Eastwood rough, violent, anti-PC image, is a  remarkable feat.        Even the most successful film directors reach a point in their careers when their  output begins to fade as they get to retirement age. Clint Eastwood is the rare  exception. At 78, he has hit his peak with this film. As recently widowed, embittered Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski, he seems ready to live out the twilight  of his years sitting on his front porch and grousing about the stinkin' world. But  when the next-door neighbors, a family of Hmong immigrants, are threatened by the   local gangs, he finds himself goin' for his guns and standing up against the thugs  in the tradition of Charles Bronson in \\"Death Wish.\\"          But what starts out as a vigilante revenge story quickly blossoms into a moving  drama as Kowalski warms (in his gritty, teeth-clenched fashion) to his neighbors.  He takes the family's son under his wing and teaches him lessons about life, work,  and romance. Just when you think the story is edging toward sentimentality, there  is a sudden, shocking twist, one that Kowalski and his surrogate son struggle to  overcome. Which Kowalski eventually does, in a poignant ending that both resolves  his crises and redeems his life. It is one of the most spiritually satisfying   endings of any films in recent years.        If you don't think you're the type to enjoy a Clint Eastwood film, think again.  Don't pass this one up!

A girl gets lost in the woods with nothing but a baseball game and her favorite player (tom gordon) for comfort, but theres something else is in the woods to.

The book actually builds some very good suspense but when it reveals it's cards at the end your left thinking \\"thats it? thats what it was?\\" It's a short novel and far from his best but it will do the trick until you reach the final chapters.
B001P3SA94|4.0|I finally got a chance to view Cadillac Records and I am very glad I did so.<br /><br />Before I go any further, after all is said and done, Beyonce can just saaaaaaaaaaaaang, okay?  To say she WORKED, \\"At Last\\" and \\"All I Could Do Was Cry\\" is a MASTERPIECE of understatement.  Her singing those two songs alone were worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Growing up, my biggest connection with Chess Records were the sermons of Rev. C.L.Franklin and choice cuts by his daughter, Aretha. Later, many stalwart gospel artists also constituted my biggest connection with Chess so seeing/hearing some of the history behind this very important label was indeed interesting.  Of course, much of it was conjecture/supposition but related in a very comfortable way by the incomparable Cedric the Entertainer, who portrays Willie Dixon.<br /><br />Quite honestly, the story itself is rather sketchy...moreover, I don't know if this is necessarily a detraction. It becomes infinitely more important to follow the beginnings of such stalwart artists as Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Etta James, and Chuck Berry.  Jeffrey Wright is commanding and excellent as usual as Muddy Waters, Mos Def is just wonderful as Chuck Berry, Eammon Walker (have been a fan of his since \\"Oz\\")was most effective as Howling Wolf and yet, strangely enough, I found myself cringing when Beyonce started cussin'as Etta James.  She and Columbus Short, who portrayed Little Walter, pretty much wallowed in self-pity resulting in, what else, self-destructive behavior and both gave solid performances.  And finally, Adrian Brody was just excellent as Leonard Chess.<br /><br />Notwithstanding, this is still a very worthy movie dealing with the evolution of rock and roll in America and its impact on the social fabric of the times.  Highly recommend!!!

The man behind the machine was the same but different whenever he wrote under each of these names. The way he takes us on a rollercoaster with the storys main character Garraty who watches his friends and the rest of the kids around him all die is remarkable to say the least. The story is based in the not so distant future and is nothing but pure adrenaline. A must read!

B002FOQXZK|2.0|It is hard for a new artist to break through. Its even harder when that new artist is different. Kanye went through it. Lupe went through it. Both are successful now but the battle they went thru was harder than that of Lil' Wayne or T.I. Every ten years or so a new artist comes along in hip hop and brings something new to go against what is popular at the time. A Tribe Called Quest did when everyone was into gangsta rap. DMX did it during the shiny suits and bling bling era. Now its Kid Cudi's turn to go against `ringtone rap'.<br /><br />\\"Man On The Moon\\" is not true hip hop. I can't call his music hip hop at all. I call it \\"techno\\" hop. It's a futuristic, spacey journey through the mind of Kid Cudi.  Little was known about him before this album. He had a nice first single \\"Day N'Nite\\". He followed that up with \\"Make Her Say\\" ft. Kanye West & Common. Both songs make you want to hear more and find out what this man is about. He jumped on Jay-Z's \\"Blueprint 3\\",for a decent track. But who is Kid Cudi? This album answers those questions.<br /><br />It was real hard for me to like this album. The whole time listening to it I wanted to hear another \\"Make Her Say\\". I know this album is an introduction to who Kid Cudi is, but I was expecting more. His has a simple rhyme scheme with basic lyrics. The beats were far out and he's singing. Cudi didn't even invent this brand of music. Pharrell has been doing this for years. It makes me wonder...If Kid Cudi wasn't endorsed by Jay-Z, Kanye & Common, would there have been any hype? Would we even know (or want to know) who Kid Cudi was?  I'm sure there is an audience for this type of music. And Cudi probably will be very successful, it just doesn't work for me.

0385504225|4.0|© By Peter T. Haas    I finished Dan Brown's new novel The Lost Symbol last week. Truth be told, I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. To my taste, it is his best book yet. The texture of the antagonist's character, Mal'akh, was nuanced and vivid. His mutated, hedonistic spirituality completely overshadows Langdon's prosaic and professorial steadiness. Like the Dark Night's Joker, The Lost Symbol's Mal'akh steals the show - darkly.    I delighted in the plot development, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that this novel is not just about the secrets of the Freemasons and the cryptic symbology in Washington D.C. - as has been pushed by the book's publicity blitz. Curiously, The Lost Symbol is also a theological story, one which articulates some of the profound insights conveyed by Christian mysticism, which are now just being confirmed by science, such as the interconnectedness of reality (the Trinity and the Soul); the influence of intentional thought upon matter (prayer and meditation); and the transformation of human beings through wisdom into higher levels of being (salvation and theosis).    It is the presence of theosis in The Lost Symbol that shocked me the most, not because it is a shocking idea, but because it seems that the message of the book is theosis! I was stunned that Brown essentially begins and ends the novel at the Apotheosis of George Washington in the United States Capital Rotunda, a relief painting on the Capital dome that Brown says teaches that the Freemason Founding Fathers wanted to convey the principle idea of the Ancient Mysteries - that humans can become gods! This is one version of theosis, a version whose purpose or means is not spelled out in the novel. But its mere presence is theologically provocative indeed!    While The Lost Symbol draws upon a soup of Gnostic, mystic, alchemical, astrological and ancient symbolism to spin its tale, that does not diminish the historical and generally accurate reflection of these systems of belief. The novel also delves into alternative and emerging fields of science, like Noetic and Consciousness studies, two fields of studies that are fascinating and keep pace with the advances of quantum and string theories at the human level. Indeed, Katherine, the scientific damsel in distress in the story line, offers her own unique plot development that could easily be a separate novel. Her secret, scientific studies were compelling on their own, without the added drama of the spiritualistic connections driving Mal'akh and entangling professor Langdon, Katherine and her brother Solomon, the wise, open-hearted believer in the ancient mysteries, who represents the antithesis to Mal'akh's own hard-hearted approach to darker mysteries of the human quest for power, spiritually or scientifically.    Where I found myself most delighted in the book was in the hope that such novels begin to prepare the general populous with a higher-level mindset, one that begins to open readers up to the interconnected relationality of all reality. One of the messages of The Lost Symbol  is that at the deepest levels, reality is ultimately spiritual. This is a bridge for religious dialogue and connects us to the ancient Christian knowledge of the Church Fathers who sought to convey this with their very high Christology articulated by St. Paul in such passages as: \\"that Christ might be all in all\\" (Colossians 3.11), and the luminous prayer in Ephesians chapter 3, from which I quote just verses 18 - 19: \\"I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.\\" And of course, we must recall here the important doxological formula in the book of Romans: \\"For from God and through him and to him are all things\\" (Romans 11.36).    While it was probably not Brown's intention to write a systematic articulation of Christian mysticism, he did include important elements of the Christian tradition useful for conversation. For example, there are vast distinctions between the power of human will bent toward self-transcendence to become as gods represented by Mal'akh, versus the Christian self-surrender to love through a union with Christ - which is the journey into theosis. Theosis is an important Christian doctrine rooted deeply in the Christian tradition and teachings of the church fathers. While theosis has been historically neglected by the Western church, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, the Eastern Orthodox Church has kept this doctrine at the center of their views of salvation, and rightly so.    For the Church Fathers, salvation was not just about \\"getting saved\\" or \\"going to heaven.\\" Salvation was the totality of transformation of one's life in and through Christ by the power of the Spirit to such an extent that the fullness of what a human being could be was demonstrated by Jesus the Christ, not just to be worshipped as Lord and Savior, but to be followed, that is to say, to give one's life to God through an ever deepening union with Christ by the Word, Sacrament and Spirit so to become, in the words of the Protestant C.S. Lewis, little Christs, or in the words of St. Peter, \\"that we become participants in the divine nature\\" (2 Peter 2.4). This is the mystery of God revealed in Christ.    The Lost Symbol is a fun and fantastic read. But don't build your theology on it. Let it inspire you to search the deeper truths of the Christian Tradition. There is much to explore to great profit.  When you do, you will discover that there are two forces at work in this world: the way of gravity toward the earth, and the way of attraction to heaven. In Brown's story, Mal'akh represents the self-gratifying, sacrificing, will to power that is empowered by the forces of this earth, under the demonic influence of sin, death and evil. Langdon, represents the self-giving, surrendering, love of wisdom and neighbor empowered by the forces of heaven, under the divine influence of life, light and love. This distinction is captured in the Lord's Prayer where we pray for God's kingdom not our own. And for God's will to be done, not our own.    For Christians, Jesus Christ represents light, life and love. He is the way, truth and life. Jesus Christ is the living relationship demonstrating that God is the Relationship of Relationships, whom we call Father-Son-Holy Spirit, or even Being-Beloved-Becoming, or St. Augustine's, Love-Loved-Loving.  That is, at the heart of the reality, we confess a loving interrelated, life-giving generative source whom we call Father, and know through the Son and partake in by the Spirit. This is the spiritual life - life loving and longing and becoming God through union with Christ by the Spirit. It is also the source of worship and wonder.    If you feel inspired to search and wonder about the deep meaning of Christianity, I commend to you Andrew Louth's excellent and authoritative book The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition, or Bernard McGinn's five volume opus The Presence of God: A History of Western Christian Mysticism. There are many other helpful resources also that articulate how the new science is impacting our theology such as: Clestus Wessels', Jesus in the New Universe Story; Ilia Delio's, Christ in Evolution; and Raimon Panikkar's Christophany: The Fullness of Man. For a useful history of consciousness studies see Gary Lachman's, A Secret History of Consciousness. And finally, for a softer approach to the Christian mystic/contemplative tradition see the excellent new book by Inter Varsity Press, Longing for God by Richard Foster and Gayle Beebe.    The Eastern Orthodox tradition is also a very rich and historical Christian community to help discern the distinctions between Christian spirituality and the many divergent mystical and esoteric schools. There are vast and important differences to bemindful of. Some of the best work on Orthodox Christian spirituality is published by Cistercian Publications, especially the Cistercian Studies Series, such as volume seventy-nine, The Spirituality of the Christian East by Tomas Spidlik. For those who prefer web-resources, I have found the following link especially helpful on the doctrine of theosis: [...]    Whatever symbols might be found in the unfolding drama of human imagination and questing for meaning, I remind the reader that Jesus came to seek and to find that which was lost. Indeed, Jesus, as the good shepherd, seeks after the one lost sheep. When I realized that I was the lost one in need of being found, my life was transformed and I began a journey from one degree of glory to another and it continues today.    Every blessing in the love of God,  Peter T. Haas  [...]
B000002J0B|4.0|Some Zeppelin fans are so dumb. That's all I have to say about them. Anyway, this is definitely a classic and is easily placed in the top 5 of their best albums. The biggest problems with it is that you could easily leave off The Crunge and D'yer Mak'er and it would be fine. Their okay songs, though I never listen to the latter, but are kind of misplaced with the whole mood of the album. Another problem that has to do with that is the flow of the album. Going from The Song Remains The Same to The Rain Song doesn't feel right. Instead I think it should have gone to The Ocean or Over The Hills and Far Away. Highlights: No Quarter, Dancing Days, The Rain Song, The Song Remains The Same. Zeppelin were in their prime here and would reach their peak with Physical Graffiti.

B000ICLRIE|3.0|I watched the theatrical movie and the Directors cut. I was unimpressed by the Theatrical release and with reading the reviews about how much better the Directors cut is, I wanted to see what at least visually is a good movie.     Sad to say, the director's cut is just more of the same. Hard to believe characters like-Orlando Bloom.  Starting out as a poor blacksmith in France, yet as soon as he arrives in Jerusalem he is turned into a military genius with exceptional fighting skills, able to take on any foe or army and defeat them. One has read that the overtones of this movie have offended Christians and it's easy to see why.  Any depictions of Priest or Bishops are made to appear cruel and heartless, the Christian Knights as War Criminals, (with one exception of a good-hearted Knight).  The director's cuts show the priest in the beginning as Orlando's brother. Could a more cruel man be depicted, yet he is supposed to be a priest. He stole from his brother's dead wife's body, cut off her head, assaulted the grieving husband at his wife's grave while mocking him, and stole money from him. Nice depiction of a priest. The Bishop of Jerusalem was made with about the same tone, insolent, with changeable convictions to his faith based on whatever was safest for him at the time. At least five times mention was made of the Crusaders massacre of Muslims when they took over Jerusalem a hundred years earlier, along with numerous depictions of Christian knights unmerciliy killing innocent women, children. Any and all depictions of Saladin were made as if he were the picture of goodness and honesty. No mention that he killed hundreds of Christian knights when they were his prisoner, no mention of atrocities committed by the Muslim armies. I'm not attempting to say this should have been a tit for tat movie, but it was obviously made to make Christians look more barbaric and cruel while making the Muslims appear as victims. If Ridley Scott wanted to really be authentic, be honest in your portrayal of both sides. His constant reference to the holy land being seized by the crusaders from the Muslims negates the fact that the holy land was Byzantine territory before Muslim and before that Pagan under the Romans. History is changing, yet Ridley only reinforces one side of history.     In listening to Ridley Scott's director's commentary of the film, he mentions he received much adulation from Muslim groups about the depiction of Islam, Saladin, and the entire saga of the Crusades. I would say there is a definite reason why, he was one sided in his approach to this film.      With this said, it was a visually nice looking film. Battle scenes were great, acting good. As an amateur historian, most of main characters were real people, scenes contemporary to the times. Some artistic licenses here and there, but overall a nice looking film. Just a shame Ridley tried so hard to appease the Muslim community by degenerating Christianity.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Born to Run might just beat this album by a few notes, but this is sure close to the greatest album I've ever listened to. It's all here. The production, the songs, the voice, the band, everything clicks. None of these songs get old and the Boss's writing has improved drastically from \\"The Rising\\" (and it was great then!). I listened to it the other day and after listening from \\"Radio Nowhere\\" to \\"Devil's Arcade\\" all I had to say was \\"damn!\\". In a very good way. My favorites from the album are \\"Girls in their Summer Clothes,\\" (I nominate this song for not only the Boss's best, but one of the best EVER) \\"You'll Be Coming Down,\\" and \\"Long Walk Home.\\" Do yourself a favor, and go buy this album. You will not be disappointed.
B000092T6M|3.0|Were Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Sean Connery not in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, I would have passed on both the original and extended DVDs. Despite the fine production design, great location cinematography and some now-classic lines, the film is at best a fun but forgettable two-star effort.    An uneven screenplay with jerrymandered plot devices (was 13th century England really that PC?), inconsistent direction, careless editing, and an American actor who plays Robin Hood like a Huntington Beach surfer visiting a medieval theme park, are the reasons I downgraded this version of the outlaw legend. IMO Errol Flynn's 1938 vigorous swashbuckler is superior to Kevin Costner's 1991 reluctant-hero epic in every way.     With one notable exception.    The third star is for Alan Rickman (better known nowadays as Hogwarts teacher Professor Snape). I understand the English actor was given carte-blanche to do what he wanted with his villain's role. Thank God, for he saved this picture by stealing it outright. His performance as the demented, manic and lecherous Sheriff of Nottingham is a comedic tour de force. Rickman schemes, roars, slithers and hisses -- and delivers some of the best lines in the script like a vulture picking over entrails to devour. To wit:     Sheriff of Nottingham: Wait a minute. Robin Hood steals money from my pocket, forcing me to hurt the public, and they love him for it?   [Scribe nods]   Sheriff of Nottingham: That's it then. Cancel the kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans, no more merciful beheadings. And call off Christmas.    Sheriff of Nottingham: [to a wench] You. My room. 10:30 tonight.   Sheriff of Nottingham: [to another wench] You. 10:45... And bring a friend.    I can guess why many of Rickman's scenes were cut from the theatrical release. It wasn't just for time or relevance; when he's on screen you don't see anyone else. He's that good.     Other actors deserve praise for breathing life into their stock characters. Morgan Freeman as Robin's loyal Islamic friend Azeem, the fierce yet dignified \\"painted man\\", is wonderful to watch and listen to -- but when isn't he? IMO Freeman is incapable of giving a bad performance. The same is true of several veteran British actors in the cast: Brian Blessed (Lord Locksley), Nick Brimble (Little John), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck) and Geraldine McEwan (the twisted Mortianna). I also bend my knee to the always majestic Sean Connery for an uncredited cameo.       I like Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio's acting, but IMO her Lady Marian was undermined by the director's lack of focus. She is introduced as a knife-wielding Norman maid in men's clothing who is running her family's estate, but in the climactic fight scene she's running around and screaming like a helpless twit. Wha'? I also feel that Christian Slater was miscast as Will Scarlett. He comes off as a charmless whiner whose act you never quite buy. And while Slater vaguely resembles Costner, the two actors lack the requisite chemistry to be familial colleagues.    The bottom line: Pass on this one unless you're a hardcore Kevin Costner fan. (I like KC but not in this film.) Choose Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood instead as the gem of this genre. But consider RHPOF for Alan Rickman's over-the-top performance as the evil sheriff. He will not disappoint.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I have read all four of Dan Brown's books and loved them all.  I was eagerly anticipating the release of The Lost Symbol.  I pre-purchased it for my Kindle and read it the first day.  I was sorely disappointed.  The story was fine but the time it took Brown to get into the story was tedious.  He spent pages explaining his theories and the masonic traditions and intentions.  After about the first 1/4th of the book the action began and the reading was great for the middle half.  There were lots of twists and turns that held my attention.  Then the story basically ended except the book continued with more teaching, preaching and attempts to inspire.  This book wasn't bad but it could have been a great deal shorter.

B00005QGAV|5.0|First released in 1991, and promoted by a very successful tour, the Dangerous Album is very well known, and a number of its songs have become emblematic and iconic of Michael Jackson. The album demonstrates the range of his capabilities as a vocalist and composer. MJ was a master of poignant, touching melodies and soul-stirring anthem- like compositions. \\"Heal the World,\\"  \\"Keep the Faith,\\" and \\"Will You be There\\" are iconic and still relevant. MJ was also the master of the pulsating rhythm, the catchy beat, and heated passion. Examples are \\"In the Closet,\\" \\"Black or White,\\" and \\"Remember the Time.\\" Michael Jackson was able, in his long career, to make huge creative leaps and to transition from the voice of the hyper-talented child to the mature man. Yet, he was able to retain the very distinctive characteristics of his voice - capable of intensity and tension - a voice which could attain the sweetness of a violin, and also become a rasping, percussive device. Many moods and concerns are apparent in this Dangerous album, and they are still universally relevant.
B002LHZV5E|5.0|This is an awesome movie. this movie is great adam sandler is hillarious in this film about a guy who just wants to hurry up things. and when he gets a remote that can control the universe is hurrying things really that important when you mess alot. this is probably one of my favorite adam sandler movies. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00004RF9I|4.0|When I first saw Paddy Chayefsky's media splash film \\"Network,\\" I remember thinking how sad it would be should the news media, particularly the T.V. Broadcast News Media, ever fall so low as to turn the news into a media circus: i.e., news as Entertainment.    That was over 30 years ago, and as folks say: That was then, this is now. These days it is difficult to tell the difference between news and entertainment. A few hours watching FOX news blurs the line between commentary and news, and Commentary is nothing more than vitriolic venom spewed onto the choir of self-same fear-mongering hate filled hoards.      In other words, I love \\"Network,\\" because it helps to frame the weird world we live in and says something about the fools we have become.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Really enjoy seeing these episodes again, uncut and with all of them available.  Although we've (in our household) loved Fawlty Towers from the first time we saw it on PBS years ago, we don't remember seeing the first season until now.  Thoroughly enjoying this DVD set.  Highly recommend.  John Cleese is absolutely hilarious, and the rest of the cast is superb also.
0689878451|1.0|I was curious about all the fuss concerning this book; so when I saw it on display at Borders I decided to read it. Now I don't care if a children's book features a father and mother or 2 mothers or 2 fathers, but it needs to be good. To me the plot in this book is really insipid and pointless; and the writing has a really cheezy tone to it. I would not be surprise if a child describes this book as boring. If you need to fill your political correctness quota, then I guess there aren't many alternatives out there; but if you want your child to hear a well-written story, avoid.<br /><br />And if you want non-fiction, please tell your child those 2 penguins broke up in 2009; one male penguin decided to hook up with a female and leave his male companion. Might as well teach kids about split ups and divorce while they're young, right?
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I was excited to receive a copy of this film. I watched it first by myself without my 4 year old son and daughter to avoid any distractions. We have seen the film on VHS at my sister's home and I was not impressed with the quality of the film. My views has changed. The quality of this DVD is exceptional. The detailed and defined art work are amazing and the color is delightful. My children have watched the film at least 3 times. This is a film I will watch over and over.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Big PJ fan who ranks his albums as such    9) Riot Act (6.5)  8) Binaural (7.0)  7) Pearl Jam (Avacado) (8.0)  6) Yield (8.25)  5) Backspacer (8.5)  4) No Code (8.75)  3) Ten   (9.0)  2) Vitalogy  (9.25)  1) Vs   (9.5)      Although with more listens (and by hearing new songs live) I can see Backspacer moving up in rank.  Good stuff!
0545123267|4.0|I had seen a lot of buzz around this book so I was really excited to read it.  I liked it, it is a pretty darn good book.  Looks like there are supposed to be two more books in the series \\"Linger\\" and \\"Forever\\".<br /><br />Grace was attacked by wolves when she was a little girl.  She remembers one wolf that drove off all the other wolves; she remembers the wolf with the yellow eyes.  At almost 18 years old Grace still has a deep fascination with the wolves in the woods.  In fact she sees the wolf with the yellow eyes quite often and she feels like she belongs with him.  Sam is a normal kid during the summer, but when the temperature drops he becomes something different.  Things get complicated when a kid is killed by the wolves, but then turns up later not at all dead.<br /><br />There were a lot of good things about this story.  I liked how each chapter was labeled both with the temperature and the character whose point of view it was.  The idea of people becoming werewolves when the temperature lowers is intriguing, as is the idea that their time being able to convert to human only lasts so long.  I also thought that the book was beautifully written, Sam especially talked in beautiful prose.  The characters are very likable and easy to relate with.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me was the pace of the plot.  The plot is painfully slow.  There is a ton of time spent just recounting the details of Sam and Grace spending time together; and while these details are sweet, and somewhat touching, I think there were too many of them.  That being said the pace picks up toward the end of the novel and the ending itself was great, if a bit rushed.  If the last part of the book had taken place over maybe the last half of the novel instead of the last fifth, the pacing would have been perfect.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book.  It was a pretty good read.  I look forward to reading the next book in the series when it comes out.
B000NIZPKE|5.0|The battery works exactly as advertised. Gives me 3 full hours of continuous recording time on a single charge, very reasonable price, what more can you ask for?
B001N26GFM|5.0|I did not read the book that inspired this movie--but I had heard about it and figured it was just another weepy story about the holocaust. Not to criticize that awful time, but there seems to be an overabundance of films and books on this subject as of late, and I just about wrote this one off. (I saw last year's THE READER and while I loved the book, I really soured at the movie. I thought it was proselytizing and unbearably pontificating on the obvious).  So it was with much incredulity that I viewed this film.       First of all--the boys were so amazingly good--the acting and the true to life portrayals of boys at that age. I was also moved by the heft of the story--that the wife of the commander in charge was so powerfully moral. But what I was not expecting was this amazing story, and particularly, its summation--let me just put it that way. It had such a powerful effect on me that it resonated with me for days afterward.    Why did this movie not received the attention that THE READER (a lesser movie, for sure) did? (of course, there was the starring role of Kate Winslet, but still...it really was not that good of a film.) But THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS blew me away. And I totally recommend.  This was not just a movie, it was an experience.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I loved season 3, Michael C Hall just gets better and better and Jimmy Smits was awesome as a bad guy!

B00267N3DQ|5.0|This is it. \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\\" which is referred to as \\"the one that started it all,\\" is finally available in a sensational Blue Ray / DVD set that shall please both fans and collectors alike. And it has to be this way, because this film was Walt Disney's first animated feature, which has deservedly survived the test of time. Furthermore, \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is being released as part of the all-new Diamond Collection, which includes the best quality possible in high definition picture, sound, extras, and much more.    \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" possibly began the \\"good versus evil\\" trend in Disney's movies. It is about a beautiful, good-hearted princess that has the misfortune of being hated by her stepmother, because her mirror informs her that Snow White is the fairest and most beautiful of them all. Of course, her stepmother can not stand competition and rapidly orders a servant to go to the forest with Snow White, and kill her there. Luckily, the servant is incapable of following these horrible orders, and sets Snow White free.     While lost in the forest, Snow White finds a small house, which was apparently inhabited by seven little persons. They turn out to be the seven dwarfs - Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy --, who eventually befriend her. However the mirror on the wall informs the stepmother that Snow White is still alive, which infuriates her. She finds a way to locate Snow White and poisons her. As we know, only the kiss of a prince will awaken her.    \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is a treasure that shall be transferred from generation to generation, and the new edition is the perfect vehicle for that. In addition of including the film in both Blue Ray and DVD formats, this fantastic set also features a second Blue Ray disc loaded with extras, such as \\"Hyperion Studios,\\" a digital look at the place where Snow White was originally created in the 1930s; \\"About Toby Bluth,\\" the artist that created DisneyView art, which is featured in this edition of the movie; \\"What do You see?,\\" and, believe me, much, much more. A must for everybody!  Released October 6, 2009. (USA, 1937, color, 84 min plus additional material). Reviewed by Eric Gonzalez on October 4, 2009.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is in the top 3 of greatest Sci-Fi shows ever.  And I say that as a sci-fi writer/reader who has read/watched 1000s of sci-fi books/movies.  Thus, I do not say this lightly.    I bought the DvD, blew threw it in a weekend, and almost cried when it was done.  My mind still cannot comprehend how or why the show was cancelled. I hope the crack smoking monkey at FOX responsible for this mistake was dragged out into the street by their unmentionables and burned at the stake.  But alas, I digress...    The show is original and has a depth and realism that has redefined the medium.  You can see its influence in a lot of shows today, though i'm sure many writers/directors will deny it.  The only thing better than the stories are the characters.  You will fall in love with them many times over.      *sigh*    Buy the DvD, become a Browncoat, and enjoy the best 1st season ever made.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I have to be honest. I was worried about the direction of the music. It's not a style I listen to. Also after hearing a few songs on youtube I didn't like, I thought this album would suck. I was pleasently surprised how much I liked this album. I ended up liking most of the songs (still can't stand PDA though). BSB said they wanted to do music that is radio friendly. Which is what they had done in the begining of their career. I found that they could do this style and still stay true to themselves. The next album though, I hope has a variety of sounds.

0385504225|4.0|The \\"Lost Symbol\\" was an almost impossible task to exceed what was expected of Dan Brown, but I am happy that he shifted gears in this book to not only entertain and surprise but also to educate more while not stimulating the mental anguish of the Conspiracy buff audience.     The key to my liking this book as much as I did was how it was wrapped up in the final chapters bring all the issues together and to spell out that \\"So what\\" if our Founding Fathers were Mason's and \\"So what\\" if Masons has strange secrets ceremonies.   What was created in our country was a wonderful idea that is still evolving but most importantly that it is \\"Still evolving and will continue to do so\\" if we do not allow those who wish to say they know more of waht anything means than I do or you do.    I would now like very much to be able to climb to the Capital Dome and see a sunrise.    I now more than ever.   I would like to see the view from the top of the Washington Monument lokking down the Mall to see all of the knowledged gathered by our society through the grand visions of dear Mr Smithson.        Our country will continue to evolve and we as human being will continue to evolve only becasue we can and we are free to do so.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|A few days ago I received an advance copy of Disney's Snow White Diamond Ediiton Combo Pack to review.  Not only does it include a dvd of the original Disney masterpiece, but also a new Blue-ray version loaded with incredible features. Since my 18-month-old daughter has a sudden obsession with princesses, I couldn't wait to watch it with her.  Before I could even get the package open she was screaming for princesses. While we haven't had time to explore all of the amazing extra features, watching the movie was just as magical as when I watched it as a kid.  Plus, the picture quality is amazing considering the original is over 70 years old. I'm going to be singing \\"Heigh-Ho\\" in my head all week long!  I loved getting to share a little part of my childhood with my kids and can't wait for more classic Disney releases to come out of the vault!
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is Der Ring Des Nibelugen the way Wagner meant it to be.  Otto Schenk based his stage directions on Wagner's stage directions.  This brilliant production has the gods, giants, humans, and dwarfs in their proper environments.  This is the production against which all the new \\"clever\\" productions should be judged. I'm not an expert on opera, but to me the singing and music were fantastic.  I loved Hildergard Behrens and thought she did a great job singing and acting.  James Morris was fantastic.  Siegfried Jerusalem was great as both Logi and Siegfried .  Ekkehard Wlaschiha and Heinz Zedick were excellent, too.  In fact, I enjoyed all the actors/singers.  Levine did a great job conducting.  I have recently seen live postmodern versions of the first three operas of this opera cycle, and that has made me appreciate this traditional production even more.  It is a shame the Met has retired this production, and I'll never get to see it live.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Almost everybody knows the story of Robin Hood, and what he does for a living. He steals from the rich and gives to the poor, and he does a heck of a good job (unlike Dennis Moore). And so there are numerous movies that have been about this medieval legend. We have the animated Disney version, the 1991 Patrick Bergin version, the 1991 Kevin Costner version, the 1993 Mel Brooks parody, and most recently, the 2006 BBC series. Here, we have the 1938 Errol Flynn version. This is considered to be the greatest film adaptation, and it's not very hard to see why. It looks pretty outdated in today's world, but it's still something to look forward to. There are colorful costume designs, dazzling cinematography, and an impressive music score. But the real standouts here are Errol Flynn & Olivia de Havilland as Robin Hood & Maid Marian. The critics are correct: these two people give the greatest performances in this film and, in fact, the entire universe of Robin Hood films. This is the true Robin Hood: sly and charismatic. And this is the true Marian: kind, but troubled. Forget Kevin Costner's version. This is the ultimate film adaptation. Watch and enjoy it . . . and after that, watch the hysterical Mel Brooks version as well.<br /><br />Grade: A

0061649694|4.0|This is a delightfully creepy adventure that I'd recommend to anyone, not just kids! It is humorous, imaginative, sinister, and even downright frightening. Neil Gaiman sure knows how to play with our imagination. The artwork is downright creepy, but fascinating to look at. You won't be able to look at shiny black buttons or a needle and thread in the same way again. Button eyes.... ran chills up and down my spine.<br /><br />Coraline - the movie comes out in 2009. It looks like Dakota Fanning will do the voice for Coraline and Terri Hatcher will do the voice for Coraline's mother and \\"other mother\\". I can't wait to see it - especially since Henry Selick (The Nightmare before Christmas) is directing - I am a big fan of his.
B000002U9E|5.0|I was rummaging around my CDs and pulled Hounds of Love out.  Has not been listened too for a few years but high time.  It is still outstanding especially when looking back at so much of the dross that has been produced by other recording artists since 1985.  Definitely a high water mark.  Hello Earth is just finishing and merging into The Morning Fog, which is just an amazing finish for a truly remarkable recording.  Highly recommend for those looking for something a little out of the mainstream.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This is one scary miniseries. Everyone knows that clowns are creepy, we'll Pennywise will bring it all up about ten notches. Really, this Stephen King adaptation is very scary. Not as scary as The Shining and Pet Cemetery, but still very scary. If you think clowns are harmless, try to at least stare at one once you're finished with Stephen King's It. With a total of over 190 minutes, you'll find yourself hoping that the Stop button to your remote control really works. There are so many intense moments in this 1990 miniseries, such as the infamous fortune cookie scene or the picture that comes to life in front of our protagonists' eyes, and of course, the scene in which Pennywise is seen under a storm drain. So it's true: this is one heck of a horror flick. It's not as great as other King adaptations like The Shining, but it's still something that'll make you leave your lights on while you sleep.<br /><br />So have a good time getting scared by Stephen King's It. And remember now:<br /><br />\\". . . they ALL float . . .\\"

0307454541|5.0|I'll be honest, I only picked this book up because it was being offered to me at a great price through amazon.com. I had somewhat heard the hype about it, but I just didn't think it was something that I would be interested in. Boy, was I mistaken. It did start a little slow so it took me about two days to actually want to get into it (or try to get past the first 100 pgs.), but once I did get into it, it was hard to put down. It was a fast-paced, intelligent, whodunnit mystery. The character of Lizbeth Salander was totally kick-ass. There were some parts that were a bit hard to swallow, but overlooking that, it was a fascinating read. The only thing I wasn't too big on were all the Swedish words that I know I butchered throughtout the whole novel. So in conclusion, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was all that it was said to be and more.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|This movie is definitely character driven. You can become any of the characters and identify with them.  It is great. It is a movie of great sacrifice and emotions.   The Sci-Fi part of the film is very well done and for the most part realistic. I am a science teacher and they did leave out a few problems but they are easily overlooked.     I rarely watch a movie repeatedly; but this one I do. What else can I say?  I am tired of blood and gore in Sci-Fi and this is a very welcomed relief!!!  James S.  Georgia
B00003CXAW|4.0|To be perfectly honest, I always have mixed reactions about all three King Kong films: the original 1933 version, the 1976 remake, and the 2005 remake. I love 2005's special effects and the perfected image of the giant ape, but having it set in '33 again didn't make it all very special. I found Grodin's performance in 1976 very over-the-top, but the chemistry between girl and ape really improved. Now with 1933, it's also a mixed bag. Yes, it's am absolute classic and it brought an entire galaxy of upcoming monster movies. Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot gave terrific performances. The music is authentically primitive. The special effects are still spectacular and revolutionary, even if they do look very outdated in our modern time. But why did I give this movie four stars instead of five? Well, it's because, since it was still a very early time, King Kong and Ann Darrow are both very . . . two-dimensional. Here, Kong is just a monstrous ape, and we see him only as a plain antagonist. At least 1976 and 2005 gave him a slightly better personality: he's a beast who finds himself someone that he has fully cherished for the first time. Ann Darrow does nothing but scream whenever she's with Kong, and since it was way back in 1933, she's really a typical damsel in distress, and she finds nothing fascinating about Kong.<br /><br />So yes, I have mixed feelings for all three Kong films. I do like them all for very specific reasons, but I don't consider any of them as a favorite of mine.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|4 of 5 stars for this exciting and suspenseful sci-fi movie. An unusual storyline with solid action and sci-fi special effects. A bit far-fetched (traveling to the Sun to explode a bomb to re-energize the Sun), but hey, its Sci-fi. Very dramatic photographic and editing style with extreme quick cuts during the action fight scenes. This is a great movie! Frankly, I am surprised I'd never heard of it before now. Highly recommended. Oh make sure your sub-woofer is cranked-up!
0385504225|5.0|This is a terrific book. The beginning is a little slow but when it picks up, it goes from zero to 60! I read the book in 2 days. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. There are unexpected twists and turns in this book that leave you gasping. He brilliantly delivers another powerful book.
0395389496|5.0|Since Christmas is right around the corner, I thought reading The Polar Express would be a fun get in the Christmas spirit type of read and I was not disappointed. This book holds all the magic of Christmas within it's covers. It is a true Christmas Classic. The illustrations were a sight to behold as well. I also saw the movie and although it is a bit different from the book I enjoyed it immensely - so did my little ones.
0385504225|3.0|In general, this book was a major disappointment after reading the Davinci Code and Angels and Demons. The story really just felt too formulaic.  Also, most of the characters seemed very two dimensional.  The antagonist was depicted as a cartoonishly evil and almost omnipotent freak--not really believable.<br /><br />The highlights of the book were: a few of the many plot twists, the mostly fair, informative and generally accurate portrayal of Freemasonry, and a minor portion of the philosophical insights. Though, I don't think I can ever stand to see the word \\"apotheosis\\" again.<br /><br />A mistake I made was to read this book after reading the beautifully and painstaking written Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco.  This book can simply not be compared to Eco's work.  Umberto artfully immerses you into the complex world of the book while, in this book, Brown seeming knocks you over the head and then drags you through it.  The last 100 pages or so of the book were simply not well put together. I even found myself skimming some of the final chapters because of the redundancy.  It seems like the product of someone who was working to a strict publisher deadline and just wanted to be complete.

B000UAFDP2|4.0|4 stars of 5 for this classical sci-fi movie. Yeah, I've seen Starship Troopers lots of times. It is a unique story with great characters and well produced. This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. Great special effects and a nice future look. As always, my only complaint is why send ground troops with under-powered weapons to attack the \\"bugs\\" without air support? Oh, well. I do recommend this movie.

0596009208|5.0|I have read this book many times.  To me this is the required bible for anyone who wishes to learn Java.    The strongest part about this book is how it explaines object-oriented programming.  But if you want a book with business application examples then this book may not be for you.    Still it should be on your bookshelf with your other Java and JSP books.
0385504225|3.0|Did no one notice that Dan Brown has Langdon carrying around about 200 pounds of stuff as if it were his lunch?  There were so many beyond belief situations, none of which had to do with mystical anything.  In almost every chapter Dan expects us to buy some wildly improbably or downright impossible situation even as little as DC has cabs with separation between the driver and the passengers that magically allows the Driver to hold conversations that the passengers can't hear, but at the same time not only can the the driver hear everything in the back but so can someone listing in on a cell phone place on the dash board.  I mean this goes beyond physics.  That said, and in spite of really bad pacing, there were moments I enjoyed, moments that made me tense, let's just say there were moments. But to enjoy them I had to really really push my suspension of disbelief to the limit.<br /><br />My advice: Dan get rid of your editor.  He or she totally sucked at the job.  You should have been made aware of so many things like annoyingly redundant themes, long unnecessary passages, the fact that the book was really mediocre.  I don't blame you Dan, you were under a lot of pressure and with a great editor this could have been a really good book. I'm a best selling author myself and totally depend on my editors to make me shine.  Yours did not.

8489367116|5.0|Shantaram was humbling to say the least. At the end of every single chapter I'd feel overwhelmed and find myself absolutely stunned into silence staring at the empty wall for support. It's about a man like noone else and it is because of his character's humility we seldom stop and take note of how good a human being he is and how well he actually phrases sentences and those words carefully placed that make you read again and again and again. I've read this book twice and heard it once cause I have it on audio too. I fell in love with his definition, his description of heroine, the villains, the chains, the land mass India (im indian) and the characters and streets.<br /><br />Purple prose some say, I am not that clever to comment or try to justify or otherwise, but i do know this is a gem.<br /><br />Kudos,readers.

0385504225|3.0|I've read Dan Brown's other books, and the Lost Symbol provides both the best and worst characteristics of his writing.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Brown clearly puts a great deal of effort into collecting mysterious buildings and artifacts which people walk past without giving another thought and imbues them with hidden meaning.  He then weaves them together into a single plot and slowly unravels it, giving the reader a feeling that he/she has somehow become enlightened about the world/city/church/whatever.  He apparently does considerable research, and this lends an air of credibility to the real-life portions of his novels, which he then stretches to cover the fictional plot.  This requires not only skill at presenting a tale, but creativity to weave all these parts together.<br /><br />In doing this, he has a talent for making people want to learn more about the world around them, and this is a good effect to have.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />While it's a decent story to tell, the pacing of the telling was way off.  This leads to a long period in which it is hard for the reader to immerse in the story.  It just isn't a must-finish story for the first.... let's say half.  Then it gets more exciting, and then it somehow stalls out.  The reveal was disappointing for me, because it was so built up.  I don't have a problem with the overall resolution to the mysteries, but it just felt unworthy of the danger and energy which was poured into the mid-portion of the book.<br /><br />The climax of the story felt rushed and confusing.  This is not unique to Brown, but when it happens, I can tell how I feel about a book if (as in the Lost Symbol) I do NOT go back to re-read how the story ended up at the confusing part.  I just didn't want to invest the effort in the explanation, and maybe the author felt that way writing it.<br /><br />Motivations of some characters are needlessly hidden.  This appears to be so that at the end, Brown has more substance to reveal.  But I didn't have a \\"wow\\" moment for most of these, just a \\"oh, that makes some sense\\" feeling.<br /><br />Additional note:<br />It's nice to see a Dan Brown novel where the Catholic Church (or a sect of it) is not portrayed in a sinister light.  Wonder if the criticism got to Brown.  Either way, he's avoided alienating some people.<br /><br />While it differs in terms of buildings, mysteries, and just about everything, the fact that it dealt with the founding of the nation must inevitably invoke the National Treasure movies.  That's too bad because Brown doesn't really deserve to start out with someone else's work in you head, but when a movie is as successful as that, it is very hard to avoid.  Also, the movie was more exciting, so readers may get to the end and be disappointed by comparison to the movies.<br /><br />Overall, it was just OK.  Glad I read it, but wish I hadn't expected more.  Maybe he should have released it under a different name.st a \\"oh, that makes some sense\\" feeling.

B000MXPE7Y|4.0|Yale graduate (and Skull and Bones member)Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is recruited out of college as a spy and eventually becomes one of the founding agents of the CIA. In love with a deaf woman but forced to marry another (Angelina Jolie) because he got her pregnant, Wilson spends most of his time overseas and away from family. The movie covers Wilson's career, moving through historical events such as the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam War. But the emphasis is placed on characterization more than anything else. Wilson is a guarded, reserved man who rarely shows emotion. Jolie is a funloving young woman who becomes embittered over their estranged marital state. His son (the only person Wilson shows any sort of emotion with) yearns for his father's approval. Some pretty impressive actors make their appearance: Alec Baldwin, Robert DeNiro, William Hurt, and Joe Pesci, to name a few. Although the movie is well over two hours, it's a fascinating look at the life of a secret agent and the effects it has on his family and friends.

B000089QEN|1.0|It's beyond me why anyone would rate this disgusting piece of tripe w/five stars.  It doesn't even rate one star in my opinion.  The acting is admirable but there are things in the miniseries itself which are not, such as showing a woman picking her nose and rolling around the contents between her fingers in the opening scene, an obsession w/slobbering buck teeth on a couple of the men, one of whom literally sucks face w/his new daughter-in-law, freakish makeup on everyone including Becky and that music! my God, that music!  If I never hear a trumpet again, it'll be too soon.  I actually muted the TV and read the closed captioning so that I could power through to the end.  I'm going to start reading the one star reviews first from now on.  Had I done so w/this \\"messterpiece\\", I could've saved myself a lot of aggravation, nausea and money.

0740785508|5.0|I have been a long time reader of James Gurney's blog. My interest was not in sci-fi/fantasy, but rather, his insights into painting 'what's not there'. I have studied representational painting - the training is indispensable, but (obviously) focuses on painting a model or still life.  The academies do not teach the lost art of painting realistic but imagined scenes - of course you can find classes about painting 'abstractedly' or from 'imagination' but not painting, say, an historic scene or creature that no human has ever seen alive (like a dinosaur)  - and that's the gap filled in by this book.     The book offers a wide range of topics - from pleasant surprises like created imaginary maps that look 'real' to extensive coverage of the forgotten use of maquettes and dioramas.     What this book is not: Though this book is fun and interesting to read for non-artists, this is not an in depth 'how to' book on technique (though he does go over some techniques) - so before you set out to paint 'what's not there' you have to have the basic drawing and painting skills to be able to successfully execute the ideas in this book.     overall, its a great overview and practical guide  creating paintings from your imagination that look 'real' but it's also just fun to read.  Highly recommended.
0385504225|1.0|All Dan Brown wants to do is preach.  his books are like the liberal media.  He tries to show objectivity but in reality he is just a preachy little automaton trying to sway his readers minds.  Dan Brown has no respect...zero respect...for his readers.  Danny sees the mind of his reader as a blank slate upon which he will mold and fashion.  This book was nothing more than Danny pumping up Freemasons.   Garbage.
0440244870|3.0|This is actually my first cute/romance/girly book I read.  I'm usually the Charlaine Harris or J.D. Robb mystery novel reader.  But my coworker is really into contemporary romance and told me to try this book out.<br /><br />I didn't give this book a really high mark if I could I'd probably give it 3 and a half stars.  It was really a fun read but I'm 32 years old and I was once a shopaholic myself.  I maxed out all my credit card until I got declined when I went into Wilson to purchase my leather jacket for only $109, my credit card company stopped all my cards.  So, yeah....it also happened to me before.  But even I wasn't that naive in some of the scenarios.<br /><br />Overall, it's a cute, fun read.  Would I read it again?  No.  But I would certainly read the next sequel \\"Shopaholic Takes Manhattan\\" to see where the relationship goes.  But as far as I'm concern, there are some parts that I really see Becky a little selfish.  She's 26 years old and not very mature yet.  Sometimes a little annoying but overall, it's a cute one time read.  I would recommend for someone who shops and know what it feels like to max out your credit card as I certainly do understand!  ^^
B002N1AEN2|5.0|From the opening notes of \\"Intro,\\" I think it's obvious that this band is on to something. People often say Spoon's strength lies in their ability to edit their sound until only the bare essentials of music are left: a beat and a melody. Well whatever it is that Spoon got onto, The XX seem to have taken it a step further, somehow managing to cut their sound down even further. This is certainly a challenging album, but it's simultaneously incredibly rewarding once you really get into the groove. The band's female singer has a beautiful, sultry voice, and she's perfectly suited to the band's lean, taut style. However, because the band's sound is so idiosyncratic, I would highly recommend that prospective fans try before they buy. Even if this is one of the year's best debuts, it is also going to be a divisive album, and it really isn't for everyone. But if you can give the record a few spins, I think just about anyone will be able to get why these guys have been picking up rave reviews across the internet.

1594488916|5.0|[[ASIN:1594488916 The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession]]<br /><br />Could it be? Has Allison Hoover Bartlett penned my biography unbeknownst to me? Here is a title that grabs the attention of any self-respecting bibliophile, whose first reaction is to say, \\"Impossible! There is no such thing as loving books TOO much!\\" Until you read the subtitle, which is: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession.\\"<br /><br />I must admit that I skipped over the subtitle when I initially purchased this attractive little volume (the dust jacket has a shadow of a man who looks like Indiana Jones with a shelf full of gorgeous multicolored leather-bound volumes behind him) at the Hastings store in Hutchinson, Kansas. I assumed that it was a second rate mystery novel about a book detective, in the vein of John Dunning's \\"Booked to Die\\" series, which is referenced several times. I must say that I was more than pleasantly surprised with the factual nature of the book when I set down to read it just last night, along with the tedious amount of research and fact-checking that went into its' production.<br /><br />No, this tale falls into the True Crime genre, and most likely will satisfy like a drug for any fan of the genre, along with any fan of Dunning, Nicholas Basbanes, Larry McMurtry's \\"Books\\" and anything else of this sort. Written by a relative newcomer to the old white man's world of book collecting and dealing, Bartlett admits her ignorance from the get go, and then proceeds to try and understand the psychological workings of a bibliomaniac by immersing herself in the subculture of rare books. She does this by attending various book fairs, shops, sales, and by interviewing the two characters in the story who could easily be classified as the hero and the villain. Ken Sanders, owner of Ken Sanders Rare and Used Books of Salt Lake City, was the acting Security Chair of the AABA (Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America) in the early 21st Century, when our story takes place. He is portrayed as a relentless prosecutor of book thieves (in addition to running an open shop on a more than full-time basis), a counterculture expert, a savvy yet compassionate bookseller, at times a bit of a grump, but on the whole an interesting man whose friends call him \\"Bibliodick.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, we have our resident book thief, John Charles Gilkey, a larger than life character who is an interesting cross between con man Frank Abagnale of \\"Catch Me if You Can\\" fame and any sad sap Paul Giamatti has ever played on the big screen (think American Splendor and Sideways). Bartlett goes behind the scenes to visit Gilkey on his \\"book buying\\" excursions, as well as in and out of short stints in prison, mostly for writing hot checks, and exposes him to be the brain behind over $100,000 in stolen goods in just a few years time. Gilkey accomplishes all this while working full time in the men's clothing department at Saks Fifth Avenue, and eludes the authorities and a slew of Northern California's finest booksellers for the better part of a decade.<br /><br />Gilkey is portrayed as such a pathetic, although intelligent and highly capable, sap from the beginning, but any sympathy you develop for him (he steals for his love of books, and not to turn a profit) quickly fades when he boasts of his heists and you can sense his lack of remorse, along with his dementia for any perceived injustice which may have lead him to a life of criminal behavior. Not to mention the fact that many of my bookselling brethren had to chalk up several thousand dollar losses in their earnings to account for this jerk.<br /><br />As a bookseller, this book certainly makes me take notice of how easy it was for Gilkey to commit fraud. His goal was to compile 1st Printings of Modern Library's 100 Greatest Works of Modern Literature, and by the end of the book, he appears close to completing a large part of this task using only stolen Credit Card receipts from his workplace, which certainly gives me pause to take a Credit Card order over the phone in the future, or at least make sure the billing addresses matches the mailing address. My only aversion to this book was the fact that it may encourage other menaces to society in attempting to pull off similar stunts. Gilkey remains elusive from doing serious prison time right up until the present day, either by dumb luck or an unexpected reserve of cunning maneuvers, you can be the judge after reading the book.<br /><br />I completed this book in two enjoyable sittings, and believe that it will make a wonderful addition to any collection.

B0029XFNA8|2.0|The description here at Amazon was really confusing at first. No mention of Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne or Natalie Wood, the feature stars of this Oscar winning movie. In my opinion, this was the very best version of which there were many. Don't care for seeing it colorized..but someone mentioned it was also in black & white. I'm not planning to buy the blu ray because I don't see how they could improve on the original. Haven't seen anything in blu-ray that warrants buying it, but my husband seems to.<br /><br />As far as the movie is concerned, this is a very endearing film. How can you not love the diminutive Edmund Gwenn as Santa Claus? Natalie Wood does a wonderful job and is very believable when \\"Chris\\" blows the bubblegum bubble that snaps. If you don't have Miracle on 34th Street in any version, I'd say run out, buy and enjoy it over and over. But I don't think the extra price for blu-ray would be worth it.

B00104QSOM|5.0|I kinda considered myself a casual Daniel Day Lewis fan, but when i first saw There Will Be Blood in the fall of 2007....I WAS HOOKED. I now feel that, without a doubt, Daniel Day Lewis is most definitely one of our great film actors of our time. His naturalistic, unguarded, venomous portrayal of unscrupulous oilman Daniel Plainview will leave you shaking, and i feel its one of the best portrayals of human greed ive ever seen on film. The first 15 to 20 minutes, theres absolutely no dialogue, as we see Plainview as a young driller in a group searching for oil. After that, we see him and a young boy he adopts as his own son named H.W., come to a small town called Little Boston, where they pose as quail hunters, but in actuality, are there to find oil at the property of Eli Sunday, brilliantly played by Paul Dano. Sunday is a young preacher, thought to be a spiritual healer. Without giving too much away, over time, Plainview and Sunday dont see eye to eye, both men have their own reasons for doing the things they do, and with Plainview, we see firsthand how greedy and spiteful and deranged he becomes as the years pass and his wealth grows. To say hes not a likeable man is an UNDERSTATEMENT, and you wonder if deep down he wants us to hate him as much as he says he hates all other people around him. He proves to be out for self and is willing to openly sacrifice all those near him for what he feels is rightfully his to claim. The script, the haunting score by Johnny Greenwood, which relies on strings that parlay a riveting sense of psychological tension even in low-key moments and the vast cinematography all combine to create a film that will disturb and penetrate you for two and a half hours. Paul Thomas Anderson's masterful direction shows a eye of a great master. A powerful film.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I was not a Trekkie, but after seeing J.J. Abrams version of Star Trek I am now.  I loved almost everything about this film.      Opening with James Kirk's birth and his subsequent rebellious boyhood and risk taking behavior, this new Star Trek has given James Kirk a cool new persona yet kept his boyish charm.  He is cocky to be sure but also smart and a great strategist.    Spock, played by Zachary Quinto, is just about perfect.  Again J.J. Abrams redefines a character but Spock never loses his Vulcan self.  Here Spock wrestles with his human side and it is almost startling how well Quinto portrays his human frailties, he is almost vulnerable.    Uhuru is lovely.  She is so much more than her original character, intelligent, spunky and forthright.  She is now  more than the girl who sits with a headset.    Bones is wonderful.  His witty comebacks had me smiling.  The rest of the Enterprise Crew, especially Sulu who has been given a bigger role, is also well cast.      The characters really drive this movie, although the story is good but at times a little bit confusing.  This movie takes off way before the crew begins its virgin voyage of the Enterprise.  The first twenty minutes are fast paced and set the scene for all the coming conflicts between characters.  Kirk and Spock are terrific together - Spock distrusts Jim and Jim finds Spock unreachable and stubborn.  We also see the beginnings of the deep friendship between Bones and Jim.    The story moves forward rapidly as the Enterprise is sent to Vulcan and must then deal with bad guy Eric Bana who has the ability to jump through time with his massive destructive ship.  Bana is a delight and his futuristic water boarding device is chilling.     Somehow Kirk and Spock have to overcome their differences and with a little help from the Enterprise crew and some sage advice from a time traveling character, Kirk is able to meet the challenge.    Finally, I want to cheer the score of this movie.  It was hard hitting where it was needed but the softness of the cello struck the right chord in the opening scenes especially.  I saw this movie twice and my teenaged daughter who had never seen a Star Trek episode or Star Trek movie walked out stating that it was an awesome movie.  I have to agree.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust, the movie, is based on a book by one of the most imaginative writers on the planet, Neil Gaiman.  He is the author of the more recent book made into movie, Coraline and the Newbury Award-winning author of The Graveyard Book.  He is clearly a writer to watch.      Not having read the book, Stardust, I can't say how closely the movie follows the book, but there is no doubt that this movie bears the imprint of Gaiman's marvelous imagination. The movie is  wonderfully engaging and very, very funny.  Robert DiNiro's pirate portrayal alone is worth the price of admission and at least equal  to Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow in laugh-out-loud humor.  (But be patient: the humorous aspect of DiNiro's pirate character builds slowly.) Michelle Pfieffer is also great in this movie.     My understanding is that this movie only did moderately well when it hit the theatres, but I predict that like Wizard of Oz or the more similar Princess Bride, this sleeper is going to be a word-of-mouth classic: \\"Have you ever seen...?\\"  \\"You need to see...\\"  \\"One of the funniest I've ever seen...\\" etc.  This is a great movie, light-hearted, fun, suitable for adults, teens, and kids about 10 and up.  Two thumbs up and two big toes up!  Don't miss this.
1881273873|4.0|I read the original Five Love Languages book maybe 10 years ago, when I was in high school. I found the concepts very intriguing, but I'm pretty sure my thoughts were, \\"Great! I'll keep this in mind when I get married so I will know how to fill the 'love tank' of my husband.\\" The Singles Edition is a welcome addition to the growing collection of Five Love Languages books.    Dr. Chapman once again introduces the five love languages, using a chapter to explain each one. If you are new to the love languages concept, he outlines five ways of showing/receiving love:  1) Words of affirmation  2) Gifts  3) Acts of Service  4) Quality time  5) Physical touch.  We all give and receive love in all five \\"languages,\\" but for most of us there is definitely a primary way that we prefer to receive love. And if that area is lacking, we feel neglected (as Dr. Chapman puts it, our \\"love tank is empty.\\")     The great thing is, this time around, all of the examples/stories/anecdotes are devoted to singles! The main points of application involve: friends, siblings, parents, co-workers, classmates, and dating relationships. Similar to what some other reviewers have said, I think many of the anecdotes revolved around dating relationships (roommates, classmates, and co-workers were all compressed into just one chapter.) But overall, I still found it very helpful to have singles-oriented application. I especially appreciated the real-life stories of people who had reached out to their parents, utilizing the concepts of the love languages, and saw huge changes and restoration in the relationship. One man's parents had never said \\"I love you\\" or \\"I'm proud of you.\\" So he took the first step in saying \\"I love you\\" after each time they spoke on the phone, and later of thanking them for specific things they had done for him growing up. Over time, they began to take ownership for many of the ways they had hurt him, and they also started reciprocating his kind words. His relationships with his parents showed so much restoration and improvement; it encouraged me to reach out to my family members even when I don't feel like it or they have hurt me in the past.    While they did take up a high percentage of the anecdotes, I found the dating relationship examples helpful. 90% of people marry at some point in their life, so it's not off the wall to focus on romantic relationships! I especially appreciated his emphasis that love takes work and commitment:  \\"We have bought into the concept that love is something that happens to you. It is magical, obsessive, and extremely exhilarating. If you have it, you have it; and if you don't, you don't, and there is nothing you can do about it. While this description of love can be fairly accurate, it only describes the first stage of a romantic relationship. It certainly does not describe the second and more important stage of romantic love... the covenant stage of love.\\" Dr. Chapman describes the initial infatuation as effortless. But then when you move into marriage and the \\"high\\" wears off, your passion must be fed and nurtured. The concept of the five love languages helps you to feed and nurture the relationship, understanding the ways to communicate love that will help your spouse thrive and feel loved. (If you think you're showing love, but the other person doesn't feel loved, something needs to change!)    All in all, a great book. I highly recommend, especially if you've never read The Five Love Languages.
B000URDE2Y|4.0|I really like this Cd the guitar playing is great.  I do have to add. Some times he plays the same over and over to much.  But in all it's a great playing sounding CD.  It has that great sounding guitar like Jimmy Hendrix. The sounds of the 70's  A very powerful sound.  I give 4 stars.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|The music is very enjoyable and pure. Love the guys as a \\"group\\" still going after all these years.
B001G5IJVK|4.0|This is a very comprehensive package and would be a welcome addition to the casual fan. That said, there are some interesting ommissions, primarily from the Paul Stanley disc. I Want You, Sure Know Something and Shandi, all from the heyday era, are somewhat glaring ommissions. Other than that, a couple of the track orders are kind of odd. Rip It Out and Deuce would have been better suited as disc openers, but hey, that's being nit-pickey! Excellent packaging and a very cool concept.
B00007KWHG|5.0|All the hits and the memories that go with them. Great for Frankie Vali and the Four Seasons fans.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Has any one else noticed that the White Album isn't numbered?  When it was originally released on album and the 1987 and 30th anniversary cds, they were numbered.  I would have thought since the first pressings of the mono box sets were limited editions that the White album would have been numbered.  So the mini-lp covers aren't exact replicas.  I know it is a bit nit picking but the boxes aren't cheap and they do advertise replicas of the albums.
B000002KIK|5.0|This album has everything all the previous great sabbath albums had. I don't get the negative comments. I love Never Say Die, Johnny Blade, Air Dance..it's all here. I mean, if you keep a group in a box and say they are supposed to remain one way or the other, they certainly live up to the first three albums and some of the fanciness on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage. It almost is like Vol. 4 in that sense.     So, look, remain objective about this album. I mean there are some great tracks on this, It's a Hard Road, Over to You...not a big fan of swinging the chain but I find myself skipping ahead on some tracks on their supposed marquis efforts too. It's not possible to like every track on a sabbath record, but I can say Sabotage fits that bill the closest. Give Never Say Die a chance and forget what everyone says is their best. This album is one of their best, the song writing, Ozzy's singing, the production. Great last effort for a dying band, but it don't sound like it's a dying band.
0307277453|5.0|This is a great book to introduce and overview the concepts of evolutionary theory.  Neil Shubin writes in  anecdotal style, showing how many of his discoveries came to fruition.      The book can be read by anybody and does not delve so deeply that it renders it useless to the lay reader.  Shubin's incredible paleontological discoveries, including the discovery of Tiktaalik rosea, are also outlined to help illustrate may of Shubin's points.      The book stays entirely away from the politics of evolution, but in doing so it is even more convincing to the anti-science wings.  The book does not even include the word evolution until fairly deep into it, but it describes/explains its processes simply and elegantly from page one.      For an introductory level book on the topic, I don't know that it can be beat.  For more information on many of the topics see books by Sean Carroll including \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful.\\"
B001EOOQEM|5.0|I am one who probably was introduced to Sabbath through this album, and then found myself looking backwards through the catalogue. This is an excellent album. Can't say enough about it, the title track, children of the sea, it is very much like early sabbath in a way. Heaven and Hell though is something entirely new though. There is no denying the shift. I always liked Dio, especially in Rainbow, so the addition of Dio to Sabbath was actually quite good. The lyrics to Heaven and Hell are perfect, the sound of Dio's voice majestic, and ending of the song, the classical guitar? perfect too. There are some tracks that are dull, but in truth they would have in some circumstances been better off as Ozzy Sabb tracks. You can hear the transition in Heaven and Hell, Children of the Sea, but the one's that don't work maybe sounded like they were trying too hard to accomodate the early sab fans. The type of music that works for Ozzy only worked for Ozz and his type of vocals, so it doesn't make you wish for ozzy, it makes you wish there was more Heaven and Hell.    So, I won't review all the tracks and go on and on, there is plenty to like and I give it 5 stars because it is worthy of it.   I totally can see why these guys touring just on the Dio era sab tunes are getting a lot of people coming out to the shows, those two albums Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules were, in their time, entirely underrated given the transition from Ozz to Dio and the change in the music scene in the early 80's. I mean, this is the beginning of the Devo and Michael Jackson, Lionel Ritchie phase of music, enough to make me vomit then and now, but bands like Sabbath are getting their just deserts because new fans and old fans now know what we all knew just how good those efforts were...go buy this and Mob Rules, you won't be disappointed at all!!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|admittedly i had absolutely no intrest in seeing this movie in the theaters. it wasn't until i was bored one night and happened to catch it on television that the movie stirred my intrest.     the theaterical version is incomplete. there are many additional details in the director's cut that are quite significant to the plot of the movie that the theatrical version simply either leaves out or glosses over. granted, the moments time wise are very brief, but things such as Sybilla having a son, or Balian's memories of his wife, add depth to the history of the characters and their motivations that you do not necessarily grasp in the theatrical version.     that having been said, if you are someone with any disillusions regarding traditional definitions of christianity and what it means to be christian, then this movie will provide a point of view that you may find intellectually stimulating.     there are so many awesome actors that were part of this film, it is unfortunate that marketers chose to headline the film with only Orlando Bloom (who plays his role appropriately, regardless of what people would say about his breadth of acting ability).  Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis - all very well regarded actors who played important roles in the film. Even Alexander Siddig (from deep space 9) played his role so well i didn't recognize him.
B000002KFJ|5.0|It really is one of their best.    Surprised to know a lot of people don't get this far in the sab catalogue. I've found myself allowing this to continue to run through it's cycle and repeat and repeat and I never get bored. Lot's of dynamics, nuances, creativity, spookiness, it's heavy, it's everything you could want in a Sabbath record and more.  I especially dig the acoustic, Grateful Deadish acoustic ending to Symptom of the Universe, surprisingly fitting, it shows the band is at it's creative peak and aren't afraid to take a few chances...it's a very genuine musical moment.    My only negative comment about this record is how Iommi's guitar was recorded, or how he chose to make it sound. Not totally sure if the album would have the same effect if the guitars sounded normal, and it's the same on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath too. It sounds like the amp was mic'ed in a tube or a toilet.   That doesn't take away from the presentation, the writing or the greatness of   this album....it's just one of those things that make you go hmmm, like the snare drum recording on Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger...Some famous record producer once said, \\"an album can sometimes end up one step removed from becomming a masterpiece as a result of neglecting to adjust that fader a little here and there.\\" I think that's the case here.
B002E01LL6|1.0|Please don't waste your money on this movie!  Please!  I did and I'm sorry for it.  It is slow and boring and NOT worth the price of admission, or DVD, or even On Demand.  Just wait until it comes out on cable.  You'll be glad you did!
B001FB55H6|1.0|This was a brilliant Film. You might say the comic version of \\"WAR and PEACE\\". The Blu-Ray looks fantastic no SD shots slipped into the final production 100% picture perfect. So why one star you ask? The sound levels for the film are all over the place. One min the \\"action\\" is loud and intense. The next min you can't hear a word the actors are saying? My PS3 and receiver has a sound sink and filtration microchip set included and It didn't do squat! I SPENT 3HRS turning the volume up for the speaking parts and way down for the action sequences. This completely ruined the relaxing enjoyment of what movie watching is all about. This was a movie I was really excited about buying for my blu-ray collection, oh well now that got shot all to hell! Same with the newest version of BATMAN dark night. What in the hell is up with the weirdo crappy sound in the newer movies? Final verdict rent um before you buy um!
B00003CXSP|5.0|I recently watched \\"Hannibal\\" again and I realized I forgot how good a film this is. Directed by Ridley Scott (most famous for \\"Thelma and Louise\\") \\"Hannibal\\" stars Anthony Hopkins in the role that made him a household name. As Hannibal Lecter Mr. Hopkins is sophisticated, articulate, and most of all terrifying in his attempt to keep the FBI from recapturing him after escaping police custody in \\"The Silence of The Lambs\\". I'm not a fan of sequels but this movie works. With an excellent script \\"Hannibal\\" is one of those cinematic masterpieces both in story content and look. A lot of the film was shot in Europe and the background adds to the mood of the film. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the Clarice Starling role and it is evident, but according to reports Foster couldn't be persuaded to return. Five minutes into the film, however, you forget a different actress is playing one of the biggest parts which is a testimony to the wonderful actress Moore is. \\"Hannibal\\" was also a boxoffice smash grossing over $350,000,000. This exquisite two disc set features an array of bonus features that will pleasure the most ardent Hannibal fan. Included is an alternate ending, commentary by Scott, over 35 minutes of deleted scenes, a great featurette on the making of the movie, TV Spots, and more. \\"Time\\" magazine calls \\"Hannibal\\"...\\"Thilling\\". There are also two prequels to \\"The Silence of The Lambs\\", the first of which is called \\"The Red Dragon\\" that recounts the story of how Lecter was originally captured and there is \\"Hannibal Rising\\" that documents Hannibal at a young age and how he became a monster. Both films are worth purchasing.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I've never watched SOA when it was on TV, but read some good reviews of it. So, when the DVD came out I thought I'd give it a whirl. I was familiar with the premise (e.g., bikers) and was a fan of The Shield (at least the first couple of seasons), but thought the series would get a bit tiresome after a few episodes.<br /><br />I gt sucked into the program right from the start, and found it to be outstanding! Well written, well acted (and was really surprised to see Katey Sagal put in such a fine performance!) and gripping throughout. Can't wait for Season 2!
143911000X|4.0|A warning: If you have never watched HIMYM, this book is not for you, (unless you have a veeery thick skin). In order to really get most of the jokes, let alone not go out and start protesting for women's rights after the first few pages, (not that protesting for women's rights is wrong...) you really should be a fan of the show.     Other than that, although I would have liked to see more new things, instead of a transcription of the show according to Barney. Although old favourites like the crazy/hot scale were back, and were much appreciated. The book is a short read, so when buying it be aware that it's  sort of like a children's book in that there are only a few sentences per page, (although the similarties between it and a children's book end there). Still for a HIMYM fan, it's harmless bubblegum fun.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I love Bluray!!!  These movies are all new to me again and better than ever!!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I received the album in time and in good condition. I've been listening to it a lot ever since. He has an amazing and inspirational voice and this is a great collection of songs.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|For many years I had tried to find this series on VHS. It was available in England for about $280 ten years ago. To find it on Amazon in DVD format, so inexpensive was a wonderful surprise. I loved the series when it was on originally. I loved the book when it was published. To be able to hear Dr. Bronowski explain dogma, as he stands in the mud made from the ashes of his heritage at Auschwitz, is the most powerful presentation of Man's corruption of Power that I have ever seen. To see the development of Mankind through the prism of Science is an amazing accomplishment by Dr. Bronowski. He does this with a level of excitement and personal awe of those before him, many of whom we will never know. I LOVE this series and enjoy every moment of Dr. Bronowski's revelations.
1932907009|5.0|At last! A screenwriting book that gives you exactly what you need with none of that fleshing-out of an additional 150 pages - just to fatten the book.<br />Blake Snyder didn't just write the facts, he made it a lot of fun to read. I enjoyed the labels he gave many of the common issues one faces as a screenwriter. In fact, the \\"Pope in the Pool,\\" reference helped me solve a problem I just happened to be dealing with that week in my own screenplay.<br /><br />There are several tomes one needs to have at-the-ready when learning the craft. The old standbys by McKee, Syd Field, Lew Hunter and Skip Press are essential, but \\"Save the Cat\\" needs to be added to that list of \\"must reads.\\"<br />Highly recommended.<br />RIP, Blake Snyder.
B000001EL3|5.0|KISS' fifth album Destroyer was released in March of 1976.<br />The album was the band's long-awaited followup to the monstrously successful live album, 1975's Alive!. Alive! was the album that made KISS a household name but its followup immortalized KISS forever.<br />The band entered The Record Plant in January, 1976 (the month I was born mind you) with legendary producer Bob Ezrin (famed for work up to that point with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed and would subsequently work with Peter Gabriel and Pink Floyd) to create their classic contribution to rock history. I first got this tape by mistake in July of 1988 and the chance paid off, KISS' best studio release from the make-up years (I now have the remastered CD). On this album, rhythm guitarist/singer Paul Stanley, bass player/singer Gene Simmons, lead guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss peaked as a band.<br />We open with a news reading and intro of the fan going to a concert and cranking \\"Rock and Roll All Night\\" on his tape deck (either cassette or 8-track (this was 1976 mind you) into the rocker \\"Detroit Rock City\\" (penned by Stanley and Ezrin) which is a tale of a fan going to see a rock and roll concert only to die. The crash segues into the classic \\"King Of the Night Time World\\" which is also sung and penned by Stanley and Ezrin with Mark Anthony and famed Runaways svengali Kim Fowley.  Next is the Stanley penned sinister rocker \\"God of Thunder\\" (sung by Gene and would be his bass solo/blood spewing number and also was Peter Criss' drum solo spot for many years). The first side ends with Gene's grand theatrical number \\"Great Expectations\\" which featured choirs, strings and bells.<br />Then we have \\"Flaming Youth\\" which was penned by Paul and Ace and Ezrin. We follow with the Simmons penned rocker \\"Sweet Pain\\" (which featured famed Bob Ezrin session player Dick Wagner playing lead guitar here). Next was the first single \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" which was a Top 40 stomping anthemic rocker penned by Stanley/Simmons/Ezrin. Next was the ballad \\"Beth\\", which was written and sung by Peter. The song was a love ballad and seen as the band as a throwaway song and initially was the flip side to \\"Detroit Rock City\\" before DJ's flipped the 45 over and played \\"Beth\\" and the song reached #7 on the US charts. The closing \\"Do You Love Me\\" is a great rocker as well. Just when you thought it was over on the original album, it ends with the collage of sound effects a/k/a Rock and Roll Party with the choir from Great Expectations and was on the original LP, CD and CD remaster of Destroyer.<br />Destroyer remains KISS' greatest triumph and biggest selling studio album (Triple Platinum in US sales) as it reached #11 on the US charts. Today, Destroyer sounds great and has aged very well!<br />Highly recommended!Next was the ballad \\"Beth\\", which was written and sung by Peter.

B002KAJ0AO|4.0|I must admit I didn't know what to expect when I bought this CD.  I will say that I have been a BSB fan from the beginning and thought their last album was dynamite.  After listening to the CD the first time through (they were a QUICK 11 songs), I wasn't sure if I should label it an R&B album or a wannabe dance album.  The group sure has changed their sound with this CD.  The only 2 songs that remind me of the \\"old sound\\" are \\"Straight Through My Heart\\" and \\"Shattered.\\"  The rest of the songs are something you would hear straight from a Dance Club.....granted some of the songs are very catchy and some of them just make you want to skip to the next track.    By far the strongest songs on this disc are \\"Staight Through My Heart\\", \\"Bigger\\", \\"All of Your Life,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" and \\"Masquerade\\".  They have that catchy BSB sound and hook and are worth the price of the CD alone.    The weaker songs would have to include \\"PDA\\" at the top of the list.  I can't believe there weren't stronger songs to put on this album.  It sounds like something you'd hear from Kanye, Usher, or Akon, not BSB.     The other songs such as \\"Bye Bye Love\\", \\"This Is Us\\" are songs I'm sure will grow on me as time goes by.      All in all a worthy investment......can't wait for their next album.  Maybe they'll go back to their \\"old school\\" sound.
B000001EKX|5.0|New York's famous masked marauder rockers KISS released their follow-up to their self-titled debut entitled Hotter Than Hell in October of 1974.<br />After disappointing commercial and critical results with their debut album, the band went straight back in the studio (whilst touring to promote their debut album and being kicked off of tours for upstaging their headline acts with their wild stage shows) with Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise once again producing to create this album that was heavier than its predecessor. I first got this album on cassette in December of 1988 but the sequence of tracks were way off than the original record. It wasn't until I first got the CD in March of 1993 that I got the album with its true running order. The 1997 remaster is superb.<br />We open with rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Paul Stanley's penned great rocker \\"Got to Choose\\" which sounds like a Humble Pie song but a great song. Next is lead guitarist Ace Frehley's penned rocker \\"Parasite\\" which rocks out. We follow with bass player/singer/songwriter Gene Simmons' power ballad \\"Goin' Blind\\" which was written during KISS' Wicked Lester Days with Steve Coronel from Wicked Lester (pre-KISS band). Next was Paul's classic title cut which rocks. The first half closed with the Paul and Gene penned rocker \\"Let Me Go Rock and Roll.<br />The second half starts with the Gene penned rocker \\"All the Way\\" which just rocks out. Next is another rocker from Gene called \\"Watching You\\" which rocks out. Next is Paul Stanley's sexual laced rocker \\"Mainline\\" sung by drummer Peter Criss. Next is another Stanley track called \\"Comin' Home\\" which is a great song. We close the album with one of Ace's best penned KISS tracks out of \\"Strange Ways\\" which featured Peter on vocals and a solo from Ace which sounded like Jimi Hendrix had risen from the dead.<br />Strange enough, this album (like the debut) was hugely ignored when first released as Americans were still digging Elton John and one-hit wonder trash like Terry Jacks and John Denver but time has been good to this album and would eventually go Gold in US sales.<br />Today, Hotter Than Hell still holds up well 35 years after its initial release.<br />Highly recommended!acks and John Denver but time has been good to this album and would eventually go Gold in US sales.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Disney has definitely been at the forefront of Blu-ray releases, and \\"Snow White\\" is no exception.<br />When I popped the disc into my Blu-ray player and the movie began, I was impressed by the bright colors and the level of detail, but I also noticed some slight digital artifacting. I have to admit I was a little surprised. The soundtrack was amazingly clean...the best I had ever heard in its many incarnations. After watching for a bit, I was looking through the packaging and realized I was watching the DVD copy, not the Blu-ray. Folks, let me tell you...when I put the Blu-ray disc in, I was blown away. It was sheer perfection. It was as if I was looking at the actual painted backgrounds and cels. And the soundtrack...clear as a bell. Just absolutely amazing. To see the transformation of the Evil Queen into the Old Crone bears repeated viewings...it looks that good! Disney has also provided an alternate means to watching \\"Snow White.\\" Since it was originally filmed in the 1.33:1 format, those with widescreen TV's will have black bars on the left and the right. By choosing the Disney view option, the art of Disney artist Toby Bluth subtly frames the movie, acting almost as an artistic movie theater curtain. This definitely does not detract from the film at all, and because Toby has matched the style of the movie, it can truly enhance watching \\"Snow White\\" again and again.<br /><br />Plenty of other extras, too. However, those with the previous special edition of \\"Snow White\\" will want to retain them as this set does not repeat them. Mercifully, Barbra Streisand's version of \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" has been left off, too (sorry Streisand fans...I am not one of you). The extras that are on this set include:<br /><br />Snow White Returns - Newly discovered storyboards suggest a brand new Snow White featurette that never got made. For the first time, current Disney animators show how this short story would have played. This always blows me away; the amount of well-preserved vintage memorabilia and historical information that Disney has preserved. This never-made featurette was most likely and excuse to use two sequences deleted from the original film, but it is still fun to see the possibilities of more from the dwarfs.<br /><br />The One That Started It All - It is hard to imagine in this digital age, but back in 1937, Snow White really revolutized the world of animation. This featurette helps place everything in context.<br /><br />Hyperion Studios - Audiences are digitally transported to 1937 to discover first-hand the Hyperion Studios, the original studio Walt Disney built where Snow White was created. Viewers will be able to \\"walk\\" (virtually, of course!) the halls of this historic landmark. This amazing \\"Backstage Disney\\" feature contains newly dimensionalized archival photos, never-before-heard animator recordings, archival transcripts and rare footage of Walt himself revealing how Disney's gifted filmmakers crafted the very first animated feature.<br /><br />And not to get mired in the past, this Blu-ray also includes a sneak preview of the first 6 minutes of \\"The Princess and the Frog,\\" Disney's return to hand-drawn animation, to be released in a few months. And yes, it appears to live up to the hype!<br /><br />Overall: GET THIS SET! Even if you have previous editions, the upgrade in picture, sound, and extras is worth it.memorabilia and historical information that Disney has preserved.

B000001EL7|5.0|KISS' sixth studio album (eighth overall) entitled Love Gun was released in June of 1977.<br />Love Gun was the band's sixth studio album in a 3-year period, an amazingly prolific output considering how many bands today release only one album during the same period. Like the previous album, KISS once again used producer Eddie Kramer this time they would co-produce at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.<br />Love Gun was the first KISS album to have all four members have a lead vocal (and it would not be their last).<br />Rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Paul Stanley sang the killer opening rocker \\"I Stole Your Love\\", the anthemic first side ending rocker \\"Tomorrow and Tonight\\", the rocking start to Side 2 which was Love Gun's title cut and the closing rocking cover of The Crystals' \\"Then He Kissed Me\\" retitled as \\"Then She Kissed Me\\" and KISS' version was much better than the original turning a sappy song into a great rocker with great solos from lead guitarist Ace Frehley whom made his vocal debut on the killer rocker \\"Shock Me\\" (which Ace wrote by his lonesome).<br />Bass player/singer/songwriter Gene Simmons contributed the hit single \\"Christine Sixteen\\", the rocking \\"Got Love For Sale\\", the heavy \\"Almost Human\\" and the melodic rocker \\"Plaster Caster\\".<br />Drummer Peter Criss sang another great rocker with \\"Hooligan\\" on this album (which he co-wrote with his buddy the late Stan Penridge).<br />I first got this album on cassette in December of 1988 (after having a recorded copy for a number of months) and upgraded to CD in July of 1993 but the sound was kind of bland and some of the tracks had a few seconds cut off from the ending on the song. The 1997 remastered CD had the album re-released with the original artwork and also all of the songs are restored to their full lengths like on the original vinyl LP and cassette issues and is the definitive version of Love Gun and sounds superb.<br />Love Gun's not only when the band was at the height of their success but also when tensions were started to show in their armor. The Love Gun album was once again a Platinum seller which hit #4 on the album charts.<br />This album is highly recommended!s but also when tensions were started to show in their armor. The Love Gun album was once again a Platinum seller which hit #4 on the album charts.<br />This album is highly recommended!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Yes.  Count me in as one of \\"Them.\\"  A Kanenite.  Orson Welles's initial motion picture effort, CITIZEN KANE, not only is Welles's best film--it's the best film ever made.  Because of the story?  Well, that's certainly interesting enough in its own right, but it's not the reason this powerful film is the best ever captured on celluloid.  Look, any film that spawns books, documentaries, commentaries, and makes countless \\"Best Films of All Time\\" lists has got something unique and magical going for it.  So what is it?  To explore this topic, I highly recommend you get this TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION of CITIZEN KANE.<br /><br />Made in 1941, when Welles was a mere twenty-five, CITIZEN KANE was light years ahead of its time in production, imagery, lighting, sets--unparalleled cinematography.  Easily one of the most creative and innovative of all films, CITIZEN KANE is a haunting presentation of moving camera shots (often through what are supposed to be inanimate objects), of rooms with low ceilings made of cloth (for lighting purposes, plus the cloth easily hid the boom mikes), of scene lighting contrasts where one character is in light, the other in total silhouette, of scenes shot entirely by a below-ground-level camera, of surreal close-ups, of a despondent Kane walking across the screen, his reflection captured in hundreds of mirrors.  All of the visual tricks and optical illusions serve to enhance and symbolize the story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon so extravagant and outrageous in his efforts to attract acceptance and love he ultimately garners neither--and loses everything, especially a connection to his childhood.  (\\"Rosebud.\\")  That Welles was making a thinly-disguised biography of mogul William Randolph Hearst was lost on no one, especially Hearst, who made so much trouble with RKO Studios the film was quickly shelved, and didn't find an appreciative audience until years later.<br /><br />While this special edition contains several extras, you must view movie critic Roger Ebert's commentary.  Ebert, an unabashed and enthusiastic student and fan of CITIZEN KANE, is a wealth of information about all the scenes and their background history, about all the tricks and gimmicks and optical illusions Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland (the real star of this movie) dreamed up to make watching this film so mesmerizing.  For supporting actors, Welles brought over his Mercury Theater radio performers, who all made their screen debuts here, including Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore (playing a very shrill and petulant second wife), Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Everett Sloane, and William Alland (a longtime Welles assistant).  On disc two you'll find the documentary \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane,\\" a 1996 PBS production; it explores the lives of Hearst, Welles, and the controversy surrounding the production of CITIZEN KANE in meticulous and fascinating detail.  The delicious irony here, in the film and in all of the extra features, is that not only is CITIZEN KANE the portrayal of William Randolph Hearst--it is also a thorough examination of the personality of Orson Welles himself.  Best movie ever?  A resounding yes.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoningc Roger Ebert's commentary.

B00026WU82|5.0|This album mean's so much to e word's can't explain man..... My introduction to my favorite artist was this grand cd my second favorite of all time my gosh I am in love with the one.....      Just a musical masterpiece    Like A Rolling Stone- Um... do I really have to comment on this song? It's Dylan's most known and played song said by Rolling Stone to be the greatest song of all time this is a masterpiece with a powerful message there's noting I can say that hasn't already been said about this one 5/5    Tombstone Blues- Ow boy. The first time I was listening to this and heard the lyric `'Mama's in the factory ain't got no shoes daddy's in the alley he's looking for food I'm in the kitchen with the Tombstone Blues''  It was then I realized Dylan was on another planet the lyrics for this song are incredible and I love this song it's very near and dear to me 5/5    It Take's A Lot To Laugh It Takes A Train To Cry- It start's off with the infamous Dylan harmonica and a strange drum breakdown this a great song bluesy song very down by the bayou with Dylan type with some great lyrics of coarse and great musicianship 5/5    From A Buick 6-  `'You know there's this graveyard woman you know she keep's my kid's''  After hearing that opening I was convinced Dylan really was in his own world I love this song very upbeat and Rock N Roll with 5/5    Ballad Of A Thin man-  That dark and consuming piano intro, The talk-rap Dylan spews into you know what time it is it's one of Dylan's most classic song it's haunting and just fantastic the piano in the song is beautiful and dark, Dylan does an almost rap here I love the way he tells his story just a great classic Dylan song 5/5    Queen Jane Approximately-  Another Dylan Classic with some moody vocals and guitar rifts along with Dylan's strange and haunting lyrics     Highway 61 Revisited-    I Actually got to see him perform this one live!

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I have been a Firefly fan and wanted to see Nathan in a new role. After getting the season one delivered, I started to watch the first episode. The problem was that it was so good, I continued to watch all 10 episodes and 3 commentaries all weekend. This is a great show involving unique crimes and humorous banter. Nathan and Stana have great chemistry together.     Give it a chance!
B000002AZ8|2.0|I remember when everybody I knew thought this album was a train wreck when it first came out.  Really, the only decent song on this album is Better man, everything else is filler.  This was a haphazardly produced album that has no tempo or feeling, but rather a compilation of songs to meet a production deadline.  Apparently though time has softened opinions on this album, at least according to Amazon reviewers.  So with this in mind, I removed Vitalogy from my cd case, dusted off the cover and placed the disk into the stereo.  What I heard was exactly how I remembered it, mediocre material.  Time definitely did not soften my opinion on this album!  For all newcomers to Pearl Jam, stick with Ten, which has much more solid writing and production.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down once I started it. I enjoyed being able to predict some events and then being completely surprised by other events. I liked the way the book ended and am now intrigued by our Founding Fathers, Masons, and Washington, D.C. architecture. I love reading a book that makes me think of things and jumpstarts yet another topic to read about.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I was so happy to hear that new AIC music was coming out! I pre-ordered my copy and, upon recieving it, have had a grin from ear to ear ever since! This is definitely the next step in AIC's music. 14 years later and it sounds as if they released this a year later. Plus I agree that when listening it almost sounds as if Layne is singing. Maybe it's cause I miss his voice but I swear it sounds like he's on the album! William does a great job with his part. He fits well with the band. As if they'd make a goofy decision! The music is AIC no questions. The production is great, even, clean, and the harmonies are pure heaven to me! If you're a fan and reading reviews to make that decision do yourself a big favor and buy this! You will not be disappointed!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This movie had plenty of good action sequences, hot women,and the best kid fight i ever seen in film history. 5 stars no question.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|This album was long in the making, and after years of secrecy and tentative release dates coming and going, Whitney Houston's new album was finally released.  There was speculation over how the final product would turn out, especially with word that her voice had lost much of its power and luster.  Would it be amazing, or would it be a bust?  In my opinion, it is somewhere in between.    There is a lot of good that I can say about this album.  For one thing, the material is fantastic.  \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" is a very catchy and nostalgic dance track, \\"Worth It\\" is a sweet and sexy mid-tempo love song that, if released in the late 90s, would be considered a classic, and my favorite track, \\"Like I Never Left\\" is a smooth, breezy song that is essentially an apology to her fans camouflaged as a love song.  Furthermore, her voice sounds a lot better than it did on Just Whitney, which with enough listens starts to sound like a studio creation.    But like I said, this isn't a perfect album.  For one thing, there are no ballads that really grab you and move you (even Just Whitney had one).  They're all decent, but they seem to be nothing more than filler.  The closest to being in the company of \\"You Give Good Love\\" or \\"You'll Never Stand Alone\\" is the title track, but it's still in the far realm of reaching that place.  \\"A Song for You\\" is a good idea that isn't executed as well (going from ballad to dance song).  And \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" has a very weak melody, and Whitney sounds choppy when she sings it.  Another thing I feel disappointed about is that the album is not as personal as it could be.  A lot of the songs allude to her problems, but in such a vague way that she seems like she's being coy rather than revealing.  Finally, I can't help but feel that her amazing singing is a result of some studio trickery.  \\"Million Dollar Bill\\"'s opening note sounds like the same trick used for the \\"It's Not Right But It's Okay\\" remix in the late 90s, and \\"Nothing ButLove,\\" while an uplifting track, also does not sound like her natural singing voice.  It sounds like it was autotuned like crazy.    It is easy to pick the album apart, and find flaws.  But it is still a pleasant listening experience, and I'm glad I bought it.  I think if Whitney chooses to record another album after this, it will be the true return that she pursued here (and I'm not sure she really had her heart in this comeback, but this isn't the place for that).  This isn't a completely successful comeback album, but it's a step in the right direction.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I loved the Watchmen and will get one of the two versions, either the Ultimate Cut or the Director's Cut. Why is it though that the Director's Cut is 2.40:1 and the Ultimate Cut is 1.77:1?
B000002VSN|4.0|That's what I'd call this release from Whitney Houston.  The soundtrack to her last motion picture to date, I had bought it about 10 years ago to complete my Whitney Houston discography, only to feel that it was probably her worst album (I even thought Just Whitney was better!)  But I listened to it the other day, and found that a lot of the material on this release is actually very good.    Some of my favorite songs on this are \\"I Believe in You and Me\\" (a sweet ballad that could be a great wedding song), \\"Step By Step\\" (irresistibly catchy), \\"I Go to the Rock\\" (the chorus gives me chills), \\"You Were Loved\\" (a beautiful and moving song that is my favorite on this album), and \\"Somebody Bigger than You and I\\" (a fantastic collaboration).  But the album as a whole has a very uplifting feel to it, and just gives you faith when you're feeling down.  I'm not a very religious person, but even I feel spiritual when hearing some of these songs.    Admittedly, though, Whitney sounds a bit detached throughout the duration of the album.  To be honest, I think she did this more for the money than for the art of it.  Also, gospel is a more esoteric genre of music than her pop/r&b/adult contemporary niche, which makes it hard to have as broad a fan base as her past material.    But still, if you give the album time to grow on you, you may find it to be one of the obscure classics of the 90s, even it was more about the money this time around.  As for the movie, well, it's pleasant but it's no Gone With the Wind.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  Includes some songs I hadn't heard in years with a personal twist.  Sarah McLachlan has a beautiful voice and this is now one of my all time favourite Christmas Albums alongside Celine Dion's 'These are Special times'.
0385504225|2.0|The plot reads like it was generated by a computer.  It appears to be a rehash of old themes.  I was disappointed.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I was just complaining that there are no shows of substance on anymore when I read something about In Treatment.  We do not have HBO because why pay extra for more channels airing inane reality shows.  So I was absolutely engrossed in this show!  I try to watch one at a time, but I can't.  I have to watch the entire week (1 disc) before I can walk away.  I have to find out what each character is going to say or do next. I actually think about and worry about them as if they were actual people/patients.  The little girl is an awesome actor!    I watch it alone at night with the lights out so I can completely immerse myself in it.  I LOVE this show!  And owning it on discs makes it so enjoyable. I have lent it to a friend and can't wait to discuss her impressions with her.    Thank you for providing these Season packages.  I am anxious to receive Season 2.
0385504225|1.0|I just finished reading this book. It wasn't easy because by about page 50, it was absolute nonsense. I mean really ridiculous stuff. Aside from the huge plot holes and silly scenes of CIA commandoes blowing down doors in the Library of Congress with magic explosives, or Red Dragon (oops, I mean Mal'ach) running naked around Washington DC to capture Robert Langdon, it was a quick read for your average Junior High videogamer. I only finished this book out of spite after buying it to pass the time on a Flight to Paris.  I feel like an abused wife who keeps blaming herself while expecting it to get better.
B000SINT52|1.0|A total waste of time and money. This movie is completely false and unsupported. Just him and his cronies views and no one else. The media, Hollywood and his views and antics are so far left, that as a Firefighter in the NYC area, I'm ashamed to call him a citizen! He should be referred to as Comrade. And now he's going after big business with his new movie. Hummm... I wonder if he'll disclose how much money he has made so far? I guess it's ok to go after capitalism, as long as you don't look at him and his cronies in Hollywood!
0156013983|5.0|The book was received earlier than expected delivery and the quality of the book is excellent (it's like new or never been used or read). Very satisfied.
B000TO0TB2|1.0|I just finished the first book of this series and enjoyed it. I wanted to get the other two, and thought the Kindle edition would be a nice way. $9.99 for it? A NEW paperback is 89 cents more. And I can give it to my mom/girlfriend/co-worker endless times...    Amazon, you need to fix this stupid pricing model.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATED:    Gosh, now that Penguin has gone batty, the $9.99 was a deal, hunh? I would have reviewed the book initially, but it took me a long time to track down a used paper copy.    For as much as I enjoyed City of Glass, the other two stories were a repetition of the same theme... I quickly grew tired of the \\"color\\" gimmick of Ghosts, and the story offered little else. The final story about Fanshawe might have been interesting, but it wasn't... it dragged on. And since the \\"point\\" of the story is the same as the first two stories, you're slogging through the writing to reach a place you've already been.    Each story trades on the tension that is created by your anticipation of what is going to happen... And then nothing does. It's brilliant once, but reading the entire trilogy is like going to a magic show where the magician does the same trick over and over again for two hours. It ceases to be entertaining.    I enjoyed the stories enough to read another Paul Auster at some point in the future... But since I do my reading on a Kindle and Penguin has decided they hate Kindle users, it will be only if I happen to stumble across one in a used book store. If I read a book I love, I usually read everything the author has... This was not a book I loved. This was a book that maybe kinda was good. I don't feel any need to run out and get 2 more books by Auster. There were things I liked about it, but the overall experience of reading this book is draining and dreary.    If I had it to do all over again, I would have skipped this entirely and gone with the Graphic Novel version of City of Glass.
B002GMNLLA|5.0|Insomnium was my little secret for a number of years... Not many folks in the metal scene knew them, and whenever I entertained metalheads (who are a very finicky bunch at times), I would always pull them out like a secret weapon and play them for my guests who were always jaw-droppingly amazed that so much talent slipped by them unnoticed. No more. These guys deserve it all, and I couldn't be more pleased to see they're still killing it. Get this and strike a death blow to metal mediocrity!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I enjoy this series a lot. This season is no exception. If you like this show and haven't seen this season, It wouldn't hurt to check it out.
0385504225|2.0|So what happens after you write two mega block busters?  Apparently, you leave all your good work on the table, and you write The Lost Symbol.  I am a huge Dan Brown fan, and I have been awaiting his latest book of this trilogy for almost two years.   I was first in line to pick a copy, and completely finished a mere 3 days.  However, I was left with a very sour taste in my mouth.  The book lacks the attraction of the Da Vinci Code...which I could barely put down.  The characters are not very likable, and the villain seems to be the same character as he has used before, strong, young, deranged killer... wow, that's earth shattering!  Mr. Brown, if you read this review, I am very sorry.  However, you have simply demonstrated how easy it is to reach the top, but how hard it is to remain.  Best of luck on the next novel.
1579128149|5.0|The Elements is a photographic tour de force of items from Theo Gray's personal collection of element samples. If he were to put on a museum show or do a PBS series, this would be the companion book.<br /><br />It is a beautiful book, with excellent photography and very high resolution printing on a semi-matte black paper which gives the pictures a floating-in-space quality. About my only gripe is that this is the sort of paper that tends to absorb oil from your fingers and acquire permanent fingerprints, so one has to take a bit of care to keep it looking nice.<br /><br />The bulk of the book consists of a two-page spread for each of elements 1 through 100. The left hand side of each spread will be a full-page image, typically of the element in its native mineral or a refined form, or some object constructed of the material etc. The right hand page contains a few paragraphs of interesting information/trivia about the element, as well as several images of items from the author's collection of objects made of, containing, or otherwise related to it.<br /><br />For each there are also some pertinent facts such as its position in the periodic table, and diagrams of the atomic emission spectrum, the melting and boiling points, electron order filling, crystal structure, and some basic numerical facts of atomic weight, density, and radius.<br /><br />There's also some introductory material and additional discussion of elements 101-118.<br /><br />This is not a formal reference work in any sense. It's a picture book along with interesting trivia and information. But it is also a fabulously entertaining tour of the elements that make up our world, and it's an absolute joy to curl up with and browse through. A very satisfying thing to possess.<br /><br />It also vividly demonstrates that there will still be a place for physical books for a long time, no matter how successful devices like the Kindle are. This is one you need to hold in your hands rather than read on some kindof screen (no matter how good).<br /><br />This book gets firmly placed on my list of must-haves for anyone interested in science and the nature of our world and the universe. Very appropriate for science fans of any age.
0385504225|4.0|I don't really understand the negative reviews.  This was a fast-paced, interesting story, that captured the essence of one of my favorite cities perfectly.  I wasn't expecting a DaVinci Code rehash.  This book peaked my interest in the Freemasons, and I will be taking a \\"Lost Symbol\\" tour when I go back to D.C. for the winter holidays.  Noetic Science is an amazing study - I got so much more out of this book than anticipated.  It was entertaining, and led me on some research paths.  What more can one ask for?
B001EN71DQ|5.0|My seven year old son loved the Prequel Trilogy as much as the original Star Wars Trilogy.  This is a must addition to the Star Wars Saga.
B00005T30L|5.0|I loved this flick. It's \\"Gen X: The Movie\\".    \\"So, Todd, what are you going to be when you grow up?\\"    \\"Well, I'm majoring in Business Administration, and thinking of minoring in Communications, so ...\\"    \\"See, that's exactly the type of thing we're trying to avoid.\\"      This nails the Gen X, Douglas Coupland, Seattle, Nirvana, early - mid '90s mood perfectly:  Indecision; disdain of corporate fakeness and conformity; nagging fear that you've somehow \\"missed the boat\\" in life; awareness that America is faltering, but yet nothing bad has really happened.    Yes, Scarlett Johansson went on to be a star, but Thora Birch steals the show.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I love that i can finally listen to them on a cd.  Love the remixed version and the price was awesome.  I ordered before the release date and didn't think I would get the cd on the release date, I live in a town that doesn't have a big box store, and the nearest one is 100 miles away.  I was so surprised that my cd arrived the same day as the release date!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|What in the world do some people expect from these videos?  As a fan of every genre from opera to broadway ( at age 66), I am amazed at the level of whining that is going on about this-on my plasma with a Yamaha YSP  900 sound processor and a B&W sub, the sound is great and the video is sharp and clear. I certainly dont need to critique the artist since I assume those reviewing on this thread are fans. I can only conclude that some so-called fans will never be happy and need an outlet for the \\"glass-half full\\" reviews!
0061251305|5.0|Rarely have I read a book that had as much to say about my day to day functioning as a leader and manager. I had the distinct impression that the authors had been following me around my workplace and were describing my dysfunctional myopia in great detail. Even more important, they provide very practical process oriented solutions to those specific points of pain that seem to be impeding optimal functioning. This is a very important book.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|Sliding right from a short run (if that) in theatres to DVD, the excellent \\"In the Electric Mist\\" is the quintessential \\"sleeper\\" film. Based on the James Lee Burke novel \\"In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead\\", the movie finds Burke's Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux once again hot on the trail of a brutal killer. In addition to dealing with the current killing of a young prostitute, Robicheaux must address troubling memories of a murder he witnessed more than 40 years ago as a boy. Throw in for good measure his daily grapple with alcoholism and bizarre visions of conversations with Civil War Confederate General John Bell Hood, who at best gives convoluted advice. Robicheaux (and the viewer) must decide if General Hood's presence in his life is represented by simple reveries brought on by alcohol, or a very real manifestation of the dead coming back to life in order to right a wrong. The latter assertion seems feasable, when one considers the mystical ethic of rural Louisiana where the story unfolds (focus on the last scene of the film for corroboration). Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as the troubled, flawed, yet highly effective Robicheaux. One can't think of a better choice of actor. Filmed rather beautifully on location, director Tavernier brings the requisite \\"other-world\\" atmosphere to the table.
0307155102|5.0|I got this for my 3 month old grandson as his mother (my daughter) grew up on it and so did her brother.  For some unknown reason, the kids just love it.  No story to it...just a lot of pictures which they stare at for minutes and really enjoy.  I think it helped my kids be early readers and early talkers.  I never forgot their fascination with the book.  My grandson does the same as his mom.  He is very little and looks for a few minutes as he gets older he will probably really get into it as his mom and uncle did.  I \\"read\\" the book to them by pointing at the many, many pictures and just said the words.  I was glad that I could still get a copy.  A one year old would love it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|What a great concept and great cast!  I missed the first season on FX but was told by numerous people that SoA was a great program.  I'm now calling them all and thanking them.  My wife and I spent 2 whole weekends watching this 4 disc set.  It 's compelling, it's vibrant, it's naughty, and it's as real as I can imagine!!<br /><br />I sometimes have a hard time believing that the police are as involved as portrayed, but that could be my naivete' coming through.  Other than that, it seems to me that between the outlaw material and the personal struggles, both in and out of the club, there's just so much going on.  The nice part is that none of it seems to get lost.  Story lines are run to completion, and things get tied up when it's time.<br /><br />I'm am a big fan and recommend this series to anyone that may be interested.  Season 2 is now running live on FX and I can't wait until Tuesday to see what's happening next!<br /><br />Thanks FX!!!
B0029LHW4U|3.0|I am a huge AIC fan, and I was excited to learn that the remainder of the band were recording again. Well, I would describe this album as sounding like an honest effort on their part, growing from the point of their last album -- Grind. However, as an audience we're missing all of the unmade records between this and Grind. It's like skipping from A to Z, and the effect is strange. The band sounds tight, but the songwriting is missing something -- perhaps Layne contributed more to their sound than I realized. The album also has a consistently dark mood surrounding it, but unlike Grind, none of the songs are very noteworthy. I'm glad to see them back making music, but I have to admit this record was a disappointment to me.
B000002KIT|5.0|My daughter just asked me for a Thin Lizzy CD. She's 27 and just had a baby two months ago. It's funny, she plays the CD ( Jailbreak) when her little baby girl needs lullabye music. I thought, that's odd - Thin Lizzy don't put me to sleep, they get me all fired up.  But good music is good music and who am I to judge someone else's response to it?   I told her that if she wants to hear the best Thin Lizzy album, then she's gotta hear Live and Dangerous. I only had it on vinyl so I just got it a few weeks ago on CD from Amazon. I had a hard time getting it out of my CD player because I was enjoying it so much.   Thin Lizzy have got to be one of the top 25 best rock bands ever. At least they are to me. And this is their best recording.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|A sad love story about a man who is trapped in solitude and ends up going mad over it. Gerard Butler did a fine job as the Phantom and Minni Driver did a great job as well as the Prime Madonna.  I cry everytime I watch this movie.
B0029XFNA8|3.0|This Blu-ray also states on the package of the disc itself that it has both the colorized version AND the black and white. I am not a fan of colorized films by any means but was curious to see what it would look like. I cannot find the colorized version anywhere on the disc so if that is a concern for buying it don't worry about it.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|This nifty old-school thriller pulled extremely mixed reviews when it landed in theaters last summer.  Because my two most trusted critics liked it (Ebert and Owen Gleiberman from EW), I went to see it and enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />Now that the film is on DVD (and now that I know the twist), I can appreciate the movie again from a fresh perspective, and I still think it's a first-class piece of suspense, as well as one of the best \\"evil child\\" movies I've ever seen.  (It also beats \\"Joshua\\" hands-down, despite what the critic Amazon cites above says.)<br /><br />Really, the script is tight, the direction is fine, and most of all, the performances are excellent.  Except for the fact that thrillers rarely get their due at Oscar time, Farmiga and Fuhrman both give Oscar-worthy performances, and CCH Pounder makes a memorable impression as well.<br /><br />But I must note two major caveats: the pace is slow and deliberate; folks with ADD will never make it all the way through the film, or they'll be fiddling with their Blackberries halfway through the first reel.  Those who like a well-crafted piece of suspense will settle in and enjoy the ride, however.<br /><br />The second caveat: under NO circumstance should children under 10 see this film!!!  In fact, I have to assume that the producers had counselors on the movie set to explain \\"this is just a story\\" to the child actors; little Esther really terrorizes her adopted siblings, as well as one unfortunate classmate!<br /><br />The only reason I have deducted one star is the lack of special features on the DVD.  There are some brief extra scenes plus an alternate ending (which is creepy but not as exciting as the regular ending), but that's it.  NO \\"making of\\" featurette, NO commentary.  In particular, I would have liked to have heard what Fuhrman and the other kids thought of the movie, whether they had nightmares, etc.<br /><br />So Warner Brothers, like the critics, did this chilling thriller a significant disservice.  Judging from the majority of favorable reviews here at Amazon, I have to believe that this film's reputation will improve over the years, and perhaps after a decade or two, WB will release a \\"Special Edition\\" with the extra features such a fine effort deserves.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!reviews here at Amazon, I have to believe that this film's reputation will improve over the years, and perhaps after a decade or two, WB will release a \\"Special Edition\\" with the extra features such a fine effort deserves.

0439023483|5.0|I loved this book! I was a bit skeptical when I picked this book up to buy, I didn't know if this would be my kind of book, but as soon as I read the first page I was addicted. I had a hard time putting it down and even took it to work and a 21st birthday party to read.<br />Its set in a different world to the one we live in now, but there is evidence that the world we live in was there worlds past.<br />There are 12 districts each known for a different skill and all ruled by The Capital. As punishment for past rebellions each year a girl and boy are picked from each districted to compete in \\"The Games\\" a game where the 24 contests are put into an arena and the last one surviving is the winner.<br />When Catness volunteer to go in to the arena instead of her little sister, she is thrown into a world full of selfish capital members, strange friendships, heart wrenching decisions and of course Love.<br />This book had me hooked from page one, I ended up buying it as a birthday present for my friend who now hates me cause I got her hooked before the trilogy was finished and she has to wait to find out what happens.<br />It's now my favorite book and one I can see myself reading again which in unusual for me.<br />You would not regret buying this book!

B00005UOKM|4.0|Bobby Hutcherson is one of those musician's musicians you just can't pin down, He starts his career doing hard bop. Turn around, he is as edgey as firebrand Archie Shepp when Shepp drafted the vibes player for his band. This avant garud.......wait a minute, he is cooking a soul jazz record, [[ASIN:B000005GWW San Francisco]]. A few months pass, and he is exploring race politics on Now with Gene McDaniels.<br /><br />Dialouge is classified as an avant-jazz record, and this does have its merits. There is some fantastic open jamming here. Listen to the fourth track. But this label also sells this album short. There are blues jams, a wonderfully errie march, and a hard bop cooker that opens Dialouge.<br /><br />Blue Note in 1965, when this was recorded, was an interesting record company. It did not have the firebrand reputation of Impulse!, where the heaviest of the heavies developed the \\"new thing.\\" But Blue Note allowed its hard bop roster to experiment with the avant gaurde as it became more and more dominent. By 1965, Coltrane had made Ascention, and the new thing was king. Cecil Taylor took this to the limit on Blue Note, but for most on the label, avant gaurde was only another spice for the stew.<br /><br />Dialouge is one of the best products of this brief window in jazz, where the floodgates opened and anything could musically happen, and usually did.<br /><br />Listen to this Dialouge happen.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I hadn't been able to find this movie anywhere so I came to Amazon.  The day we received it i put it in and my 3 1/2 yr old was in awe the whole way through.  She loves it and Ariel.  The dvd was in great condition.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|This movie has a lot of splatter but very little scares but that's okay.  It's an entertaining movie.  I haven't seen the first Evil Dead movie but from what I've read the plot is very similar.  On the audio commentary it is funny to hear Bruce Campbell talk about filming the movie and mention that it was pretty much the exact same cabin from the first movie.  Ash, that durn fool.  Why did he go back?  Seeing Ash put a chainsaw on his severed stump was pretty cool.  Another funny bit was when one of the female characters gets lost in the woods and the dumb fat guy forces the others to look for her shouting \\"BOBBY JOE!\\"  repeatedly.  For a few days after viewing the movie whenever I was looking for something be it keys or wallet I would yell \\"BOBBY JOE!\\"  It is a funny film with over the top energy.<br /><br />P.S.Ash didn't seem to show much hesitation in decapitating his girlfriend did he?  I mean she's clearly possessed but you would expect a little hand wringing before brutally murdering your lover not 'oh she's evil now...kill.'<br />P.P.S.\\"BOOOOBBBBYYYY JOOOOOOOEEEE!!!! Where are ya girl?  BOOOOOOBBBBBYYY JOOOOOOEEEE!\\"
0786838655|5.0|Nick Merino  10/2/09  L.A  Mrs.McReynolds  1st period  Book Review    I have been to New York a couple of times but it has never been so real than how Rick Riordain described it in the book The Lightning Thief. Also, the depiction of the Greek myth feels, so real, it is like I could just go out and touch it.     The main character in the book The Lightning Thief, Percy Jackson, is so life-like, he feels like a friend I have had for years. They say how he is dyslexia (just like me) and that he doesn't do very well in school. But that all changed, in the beginning of summer when his mom has to take him to Camp Half-Blood.     Camp Half-Blood is a very beautiful camp, full of nature and sun-shine. Camp Half-Blood isn't just like any other camp. Their camp is full of demi-gods or half-gods. At Camp Half-Blood. He meets a friend named Anne Chase, who is the daughter of Athena. Percy finds out about how there three major god are at war and how he is the son of one of the major gods, Poseidon. Also at camp he goes on a quest to get back the lightning bolt and give it to Zeus. It has action from beginning to end.   One thing I really like about the book is the characters. One of the characters is one of Percy's best friends, Grover. Grover is the person who took percy to Camp Half-Blood and helped him on his quest. He is also a satyr. Grover is very funny when he wants to be , but can be serious.     The book is one of the best book I have ever read. It kept me turning the page and I always want to read more. As you might, know it is harder for me to read the book because of my Dyslexia, but I kept reading because I love the book. I ask all the people reading to get the book. It is a 15/10
B0027G783W|4.0|Moby has always had a depressing side and this album is pretty much the epitome of it. None of the songs are really danceable, this is more like something you'd sit in a dark room and listen to, thinking about all the missed opportunities and failures in your life. Fortunately, it's also very pretty. A good bit of violin along with the synthesizers. I've listened to it several times since buying it. I find it enjoyable.
1423101472|5.0|When I read The Last Olympian by Rick Riordan I felt transported to New York and beyond. To a small camp where boys and girl went to train and be safe. Every page was full of excitement and adventure. I just could not stop reading. I read the others in the series and this was the best. It even had some humor.  When I was in sixth grade I was studying the Greeks and I knew almost everything about their mythology because of these books. It helped me understand the Greek folklore and I aced all my quizzes. I learned from these books to.  It also had a hidden message which I thought was amazing. \\"No matter what your dad is, Greek god or normal loving dad, you are his son and nothing you do can change that fact.\\" I found that very moving and what the books are mostly about. I it also goes the same for moms too. I think that the hidden message was very well written.  My favorite character was Grover and satyr. That means he is human from the waist up and goat from the waist down. I liked Grover because he was kind of the clown of them and was more grown up. He also is a goat boy for \\"Pete sakes\\" what could be cooler than that? I don't know but I found that Grover had a personality that I could relate to. That is why Grover is my favorite character.  I also liked how the author put humor in the titles of each chapter. My favorite was \\"The end of the world started when a Pegasus landed on the hood of my car.\\"I liked how he even had the silly chapter names to involve what happens in the chapter. I found this to be very funny and interesting.  I liked this book The Last Olympian because it had adventure and excitement in every page and you didn't have to build up set up because you already knew what is going on. I liked the author's writing style because he had a lot of cliff hangers and suspense that kept me reading and reading.  This book is about Percy Jackson a son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, and his battle against the evil Titian Lord Kronos. This book also tells of Percy and his fulfillment of the prophecy on his 16th birthday. In this book he is fighting to defend the Greek god's capital Mt. Olympus. Percy and all of his fellow demigods must team up to hold off the invading army until the gods arrive after the fight with a huge monster.  After reading this book my expectations were set a lot higher for books. I would recommend this book for anybody that likes action and adventure.  I also would recommend the rest of the series first but you can read them in any order. I felt that this book was a very great book and I felt that you should read it too.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is the first boxed set I purchased in Blu-ray and it is worth every penny.  Picture is amazing and sound quality is great.  However, I wish they would have used normal single disk holders as the box is really big and doesn't hold all of the movies very well.  It also got a little banged up in shipping but didn't affect the movies, so I didn't care.
B001GCUO16|5.0|This a great movie, well written, great plot and awesome acting.  Blue Ray is expectacular, but they are still very pricy.
B00028HBKC|3.0|I decided to give this film 3 stars, exactly in the middle of the rating system, because there were scenes of great beauty and insight and then there were scenes of torture that were excessive and made me question the motives of the film makers.<br /><br />After reading many of the reviews of this film, I am reflecting on the conception of the atonement in Christianity and whether this film supported or undermined that basic theme that undergirds Christian belief.<br /><br />The atonement is a process whereby a perfect sacrifice is made to God the Father for the sins of mankind. Since there is no perfection except in God, then God himself must be sacrificed, and this is done through the death of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, who is one with the Father and the Holy Ghost.  Thus mankind's sins would remain upon us unless this perfect atonement is made, offering the possibility of life everlasting in heaven with God.<br /><br />So the question arises, is all this torture necessary for the atonement to occur?  Must Christ have experienced this incredible gory and terrible torture to take the sins of the whole world upon him?  As the sacrificial lamb, must he endure considerable pain and loss of blood, to take the sins of the world on his shoulders? I think not. It is the death of the innocent lamb that is the sacrifice and atonement for the sins of the whole world, not the endurance of the considerable bloody torture that leads to the atonement. It is the giving of his life, a pure, perfect, sacrifice that is the atonement for all of mankind's sins.<br /><br />So this leads to the question of why so much blood and gore?  Was Gibson trying to say that mankind is so terrible that we do not deserve the sacrifice and atonement? Well there is no question there for surely we know mankind not to be deserving of complete and perfect grace upon our own merits, either as a species or individually. Was there some commentary about the religious and political establishment being made by the torture scenes?  Well, it was organized religion and organized political oppression that together brought about the torture and death, to be sure, but is Gibson trying to say that organized religion in partnership with an oppressive central government is capable of great cruelty to the innocent, even unto God in a human state of existence?  I never got the impression that the meaning of the film and sequence of scenes was really strategically thought through and thus in some ways this is only a terribly vicious, painful, gory snuff film with little reflection on the meaning of the sacrifice and atonement which are central concepts in Christianity and far more important than the nasty beating scenes where the flesh is literally pulled off the back and ribs of Christ.<br /><br />Does a sensationalistic portrayal of the passion of Christ do a service or disservice to Christianity? It really does neither for the movement of the Christ goes far beyond our ability to conceptualize the vast mystery of why atonement is necessary and why God himself, in the human form of Jesus, must make that sacrifice. For muddled thought and purpose, this film only gets 3 stars.
184856340X|3.0|By no means a bad comic. The graphic is outstanding though I would have enjoyed it a little more if printed on a thicker paper. The fight scenes are awsome and the ladies have very eye pleasing curvs. I repeat. The graphic is outstanding. The only thing I didn't enjoy as much is that despite it's suposed to be a detective stroy you catch on pretty quick. It's still enjoyable but I would have prefered a better mistery.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|Although \\"Strange Times\\" and \\"I Got Mine\\" are more upbeat than the album as a whole, if you like the singles you will probably enjoy Attack & Release. These guys certainly have more depth than your average trendy alt-rock single band. I've started working my way backwards through The Black Keys' catalog as a result of how good this album is - what better endorsement could a listener give?<br /><br />Not to judge, but I'd hazard a guess that the people rating this CD with 1 star are indier-than-thou listeners who feel some need to trash a release that's gotten air time. So far as I can tell, this is a great starting point for people interested in The Black Keys... but maybe I should reserve the right to edit this review after I've got Rubber Factory and decide that all other sounds are garbage by comparison!
B000ICL3CE|5.0|Where are all the reviews for The Head On The Door?  At the time I'm writing this, there are only six.  This is definitely the most unheralded album in The Cure's collection.  That's a shame, because this is a great, great album and a stellar representation of what The Cure was doing in the 80's.  I have the entire Cure studio discography, and I can say without hesitation that the song Push from this album is easily one of my very favorite Cure songs.  Other favorites on here include In Between Days, Screw and Sinking, with The Baby Screams getting an honorable mention.  In fact, everything about this album is brilliant in my opinion.  It's all over the place sonically, which is a good thing; it's The Cure branching out even more than usual, if that's possible.  In my opinion, 1984's The Top was one of The Cure's weaker efforts, and in 1987, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me dazzled all Cure fans.  And, of course, Kiss Me paved the way for one of the greatest albums ever released:  1989's Disintegration.  But in the middle of all that was this tiny masterpiece, which has been sadly overlooked since it's release.  This is outstanding stuff and, I think, one of The Cure's best albums, right behind Disintegration, Faith and Bloodflowers.  Please get this album, and then you may commence to kicking yourself for ignoring it for so long.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This album rules plain and simple. It is great from start to finish with no filler tracks. All 11 songs kick major ass. Megadeth had done it again. It's one of there best albums. Nothing could ever top Rust In Peace though because that album is the pinnacle of metal and is the album by which all metal albums are rated against. But endgame is def one of Megadeth's best behind RIP, Peace Sells, and CTE.    Dialectic Chaos (9/10) Great opening instrumental    This Day We Fight (10/10) This track is absolutely kicks ass. It's incredibly fast and ferocious with mind-blowing solos. This one def pumps you up.    44 Minutes (10/10) Very Catchy song with a great chorus and a beautifuly heavy main riff    1320 (10/10) Another speed metal fest with blistering solos    Bite The Hand (8/10) The ending is really great in this song    Bodies (10/10) One of my faves on the album. Sounds like CTE era Megadeth. Great chorus    Endgame (8/10) Strong chorus and great ending    Hardest Part of Letting Go (10/10) Incredible song, Starts slow then builds into a beast    Headcrusher (9/10) another brutal track    How The Story Ends (10/10) My fave track on the album. Great chorus and the riff after the solo is just unreal. It makes you wanna bang your head all night long    The Right To Go Insane. (9/10) Great lyrics. Anybody who works there ass off and is broke can relate to this one.    Overall (93/100) Incredible album. Best of 2009

B002L5GQGY|5.0|Watching this DVD, the same feeling kept washing over me, song after song.  It was a feeling of intense pride.  I've been witness to the ever expanding vision and hard work Joe Bonamassa has put into his music.  No artist over the last decade has captivated me quite like Joe has.  Each new release adds yet another layer.  And he never makes us wait too long for the next chapter.  I've been fortunate to see Joe perform live several times in a variety of venues.  Then came RAH.    It's the biggest show of Joe's life and he most certainly is up for the occasion.  The venue is magnificent.  The crowd is completely engaged.  The band is as tight as Bogie's snare.  And Joe is on fire.  Having everything come together after 20 years has obvious special meaning to Joe.  But watching this document of what he has accomplished in my 6+ years as a Joe Bonamassa fan holds special meaning to me as well.  I've been an avid record collector and concert goer for over 30 years. In that time, I've never felt more proud to be a fan than I felt while watching this DVD.    For the technical minded, you have the choice of 3 audio streams, Dolby stereo, Dolby 5.1 surround, Dolby DTS surround.  The intro sequence really builds up and sets the stage for the show.  Camera work is great and features not only well chosen shots of the artists, but within the context of an historic venue.  Edits/cuts/changes are appropriately restrained.  What may be most surprising of all is that they chose to not overly compress the video and cram it all on one disc.  230 minutes are spread across two discs.  This is how a music DVD should be!    After having watched this DVD a few times now, I'd like to add a little more about the performance itself:        - Joe translates live far, far better than most artists.  In my opinion, Joe is a brilliant live artist who happens to make great studio records too.  I can't decide if Joe's greatest strength is his phenomenal guitar playing or his amazing voice.  Both aresimply incredible on this DVD.        - I love what Carmine has added to the band over the last couple of years.  He brings a flowing musicality that perfectly complements rather than competes with Joe.  He is a talented veteran and it shows.  The Buddah statue is kinda cool too.        - I was a little nervous when Joe made keyboards a permanent part of the band.  I listen to guitar based music to hear . . . the guitar.  But Rick is one crafty son of a gun.  He doubles Joe's guitar harmonies, adds mood and texture to the background, and does some very nice vocal harmonies on several songs.  He steps out here and there with some tasty piano parts that are quite enjoyable.  Rick has been a GREAT addition to the band.        - Anyone who thinks the 2 drummer concept is gimicky needs to see this DVD.  Watching Bogie and Anton synchronize with each other was quite interesting.  It made me pay more attention to the drumming than I usually do, and gave me new found respect for the power and complexity that the drums add to Joe's music.        - Oops.  I almost forgot about the horn section.  It reminded me how much I enjoyed the early 90's Gary Moore tours that included the Midnight Horns.  Here they are used with restraint so as not to crowd the songs which were generally not written with horn parts.  The sax solo during Asking Around For You is expecially nice.    Great music DVDs need to complement the music with compelling visuals.  There are probably few scenes in the 200+ music DVDs I own that are as dramatic as when Joe climbs up on stage equipment and hoists the Flying V over his head at the conclusion of Just Got Paid with the camera shooting from behind him at floor level.  It gives me goose bumps every time I see it.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Purchased the x41's after owning the previous version (x4's). I knew from reading the reviews that it would have a couple hiccups when I got them and sure enough it did. The sound quality is amazing however the voice has a lot of buzz and feedback which is to be expected some with wireless. Overall great product!
0385737947|3.0|I'm a fan of 'Lord of the Flies'-esque stories, and I'm also a fan of the new trend of teen dystopian/sf writing, so I read 'The Maze Runner' not only with anticipation but with a finger in my mouth so I could chew on it nervously the whole time. I knew - I just KNEW - that the trajectory of this story would hurtle towards some kind of horrific end, or would reveal some kind of jaw-dropping revelation; I could just tell from the level of strange mystery pervading the first third of the book.<br /><br />Well, I was kind of wrong.<br /><br />I say 'kind of' because yes, there is a reveal at the end of this book, although, if you think about it hard enough, it's not exactly revelatory. And maybe if I were thirteen - and I don't mean that condescendingly at all - the plot of this book would be much more shocking, although I tend to think young readers have a solid level of sophistication (and, if any of them have ever seen an episode of 'Lost', they pretty much have it all figured out).<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with that, though, is that the set-up for this story is SO mysterious that my expectations went through the roof. In 'The Hunger Games,' those expectations of plot were recognized, but in 'The Maze Runner' all the tricky plot elements seem to be withheld for a sequel, which is a terribly weak way to tell a story. As I got towards the end of the book I kept wondering how the author was going to resolve the plot, and, as it turns out, he didn't bother. Come on! I felt more cheated by the conclusion of this book than I have in a long time.<br /><br />Now, that does indicate, though, that the rest of the book was enjoyable enough for me to feel cheated. I really enjoyed the grasp the author had on the voices of teen boys; the occasional stupid attitudes, the pushing and shoving and posturing, the attempts to be adult in the face of fear. I liked the construct of the Maze world and the 'Lost'-esque attempts to figure out where they were and what had happened to them. I just didn't like how all of those story and character elements were gathered together at the end and metaphorically thrown in the trash, as though the author didn't care enough for the structure of this book to give it a solid, intriguing end.how all of those story and character elements were gathered together at the end and metaphorically thrown in the trash, as though the author didn't care enough for the structure of this book to give it a solid, intriguing end.
B002C1BHJ8|5.0|Guess there isn't too much too say about an HDMI cable, though this thing is definitely solid and well-made.  From the feel of it, it's got shielding enough to withstand a electromagnetic pulse.  You could buy the [[ASIN:B001TH8UUA AmazonBasics  High Speed HDMI Cable (9.8 Feet / 3.0 Meters) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]]] for much less, but, for me, paying the extra for such a solid cable is worth it, and the price beats all the other \\"premium\\" HDMI cables.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This CD is incredible.  5th time I've purchased this recording, and it was worth every penny.      1st time was when the LP came out.  Became an instant favorite.  2nd time was when I purchased a cassette.  My brother moved out and took the worn-out LP with him.  3rd time was when the first CD version was released.  4th time was the 1995 remix.  Wow, it blew me away.  5th time was this Deluxe Edition.

0385504225|4.0|The Lost Opportunity         In the year 2005, Dan Brown released his fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code. It soon became a world-wide sensation, outsold only by J.K. Rowling's fifth Harry Potter novel, Order of the Phoenix. Still, The Da Vinci Code is one of the most widely read books ever written. Clearly Brown hit on some sort of secret formula of entertainment. The question is, can he do it again? Does his latest novel and Code follow-up, The Lost Symbol, live up to the legacy? Well, yes...unfortunately.    The first thing one notices about this book is the jacket. Simply put, this book is beautiful. The seal of the Masonic Scottish Rite is stamped in red \\"wax\\", directly above the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., which can be seen through a pyramidal rip in yellowed parchment. Layers of arcane symbols cover nearly every inch of the jacket, and the Washington Monument is visible through a keyhole on the spine. Nearly everything on the jacket has a meaning, including several hidden puzzles that the clever reader can decipher. They say not to judge a book by its cover, but if an exception was made for The Lost Symbol, then it would be a literary masterpiece.    But who cares how the book looks? What really matters is the story. Every Dan Brown novel centers on a secret society and its, well, secrets. This time it's the Freemasons, a world-wide organization whose roots stretch all the way back to the ancient Egyptians, and whose members range from your grandpa to the President of the United States (pick your favorite, they were all Masons). The Freemasons, however, are not so much a secret society as they are a \\"society with secrets\\", secrets that people would kill for.  The story starts with the usual shadowy ceremony, this time a mysterious tattooed man named Mal'akh being inducted into the 33rd degree of Freemasonry (this being the highest possible level). But, of course, Mal'akh has sinister, ulterior motives, as can be deduced by such interior monologues as, \\"They have opened their doors to me,\\" and \\"Soon you will lose that which you hold most dear.\\" Despite being something of a cookie-cutter villain, Mal'akh is actually quite terrifying, with an   intriguing back story and a knack for really ruining your day. He's also really full of himself, as can be deduced by such interior monologues as, \\"I am a masterpiece.\\" Mal'akh does a lot of interior monologues.  The story then jumps to returning Harvard \\"symbologist\\" (no, there is no such thing) and lover of turtle necks, Robert Langdon. Langdon receives an urgent call from his old mentor Peter Solomon and is asked to come to Washington, D.C. right away, where he is needed to give an emergency presentation on (whom else?) the Freemasons. He catches the next flight and speeds off. Naturally things don't go too well. One kidnapping, severed hand and sinister phone call later, Langdon is racing against a 12-hour clock to rescue Peter Solomon by solving the Ancient Mysteries of the Freemasons, all for the benefit of Mal'akh.  Brown's work has  been accused of using the exact same template, and The Lost Symbol is no exception. The great thing about The Lost Symbol, however, is that it manages to make a tired formula new and exciting. The tone and pace are tense and urgent as Langdon struggles to sort out the web of deception in order to save his mentor. The situations Mal'akh puts the characters through are nerve-wracking and sometimes disturbing. The puzzles and codes, being Brown's specialty, are excellently crafted and immensely fun to try and solve before Langdon. Then there are the locations. From the Masonic Temple to the Smithsonian Museum, each place that Langdon visits is a real location in Washington, and each is a fantastic set piece described in wonderful detail. Lots of surprising facts are revealed about the nation's capitol city. In fact, the entire story is full of detail that never becomes too overwhelming. There are also some small secrets (try dialing the phonenumber Langdon is given early in the story) and nods to the fans (a mention of one of Brown's earlier novels) that can be found throughout the story.  It's unfortunate, then, that the worst part is the ending. The Lost Symbol commits the same crime as The Da Vinci Code, by rewarding readers with--well, nothing. After the intense chase across Washington, after the deception and puzzle solving, when the Ancient Mysteries are finally revealed they don't live up to the grand name. The trouble gone through just doesn't seem worth it. Not only that, but the story rambles on when it feels like it should have ended 37 pages ago. The action comes to an abrupt halt, and suddenly the characters begin to wax philosophical. There's nothing wrong with some depth to a story, but the message Mr. Brown tries to convey seems to have been lost in translation. Even Langdon is left scratching his head at the confusing conjecture. It's tempting to recommend that readers simply stop reading after the final confrontation, but that would leave loose ends. It's a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise great story.  The Lost Symbol could have been better than The Da Vinci Code, and in some ways it is; the writing is better, the story is more skillfully crafted (and more historically accurate), and there's lots more action. But it ultimately loses points for an unsatisfactory finish and several pages of pointless rambling. Read the book and enjoy the ride, just don't expect too much at the end.
0385504225|1.0|Others have pointed out the \\"phone it in\\" quality of this book and rightly so. It is not his best effort by far. It was so predictable and reminded me of the later books by Robert Ludlum with his Bourne series and Jack Higgins with his Sean Dillon series - after the second book, there was never anything new. Unfortuately, the financial success of this book even prior to publication will only serve to continue this slide in quality unless Mr. Brown understands the disappointment his readers have experienced. I know I will be waiting for some reviews before I buy anything else he writes.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|I picked up my Stereo boxset on 5 October.  The first CD I decided to listen to, Beatles For Sale, had semi-dried glue blotches on the outer edge of the CD.  I then opened Past Masters, and found those 2 CDs to be perfect.  However, upon opening the rest of the CDs the following day, about half of them had glue blotches.  I wiped them off with a smooth towel, but you can still see the residual marking on the CDs.  I noticed in a post on the Stereo Box Set forum that rubbing acohol can clean them, so I might try that.  Regardless, the CDs all sound fine.  I did notice on the Magical Mystery Tour CD that it lists the Let It Be mini-documentary as the final track.  So, in summary, I am disappointed in the packaging of this very expensive Box Set.  Greater care should have been taken in the packing of the CDs, and, in looking over the final product.
1584282584|5.0|I used to be an \\"existing light\\" guy. I really hated the look of direct flash on a subject. I was having a nice chat with my brother-in-law when he told me about this website called planet neil. I read through it and I was amazed by this guy who talked about using flash in such a way that viewers wouldn't know that you used flash! I bookmarked it and told myself that I would throughly read it when I finally bought my flash.<br /><br />That moment came a few weeks ago. I bought a 430EXII and went through the website again. It had a ad about the site's author also writing a book. I bought the book as soon as Amazon released it and poured through its pages.<br /><br />I was just amazed at the amount of helpful information the book had. The author, Niel van Niekerk, was really obsessed about making sure that the subject didn't look like a flash was used on her. He showed a lot of examples of how a picture would look like if only existing light was used and how the lighting was greatly enhanced by using flash.<br /><br />I don't know but he made a believer out of me.<br /><br />He never suggested this but I went to a hobby store and bought a life-sized styrofoam head so I can practice bouncing the flash while creating a flattering kind of lighting. Sorry if this sounds weird but it is so hard for me to convince my wife to practice using the flash on her.<br /><br />I think this book would be very helpful for people new to using flash and also to people who already has some flash experience. He uses a lot of examples from his wedding shoots but his techniques can be applied to most situations. He talks about using flash in different types of lighting situations. He does so in a manner that is not very technical. In fact, he only used 1 chart in his entire book.<br /><br />If you want to read a bit about what he has to say, google \\"Planet Neil flash photography techniques\\". Like me, you will be amazed at what he has to say and you will probably buy the book too.<br /><br />I have already finished it and I will probably read it a couple more times.<br /><br />One last word about the author.

0545123267|3.0|Narrated in prose and alternated on two points of view, Shiver narrates Grace and Sam's love story. As a child, Grace is attacked by a pack of \\"wolves\\", but her life is saved by a yellow eyed \\"wolf\\". After this, the reader will have the opportunity to see pieces of what has happened with the years in the lives of our narrators. During this time Grace has developed an obsession with her \\"wolf\\" savior, it's after a classmate's death and a series of events that point to be caused by the \\"wolves\\" that Grace discovers her \\"wolf\\" being a shapeshifter named Sam. It's here where our narrated start developing a love relationship while trying to keep the Mercy Falls wolve's secret safe. Shiver possesses one of the most original shapeshifter bases I've recently read, an interesting idea. The romance story itself is beautiful, but however I have some points related to world building. The Mercy Falls wolve's rules don't seem totally developed, some of the questions remain unanswered and even though this is the first volume from a three book series, I understand the reader must be clear on understanding how the shifter's world works on the story. Some of the questions the reader will have are the same Grace will articulate during the story, but some will be answered with an \\"I don't know\\". In terms of character developing, the reader has the opportunity of knowing how our narrators really think, although in my humble opinion, their voices were not so teenage, much more like adults and complex. Secondary characters remain reduced to minimum moments where they appear without giving the reader an opportunity of maybe attaching to one of them with the exception of Isabel. One of my major problems with the book in the character aspects, where it seems that in Mercy Falls parents need a parenting dummy guide. I think this little aspect slipped a little out of the author's hand having the idea of a free field for her characters on certain situations. In my particular case, Shiver was a hard to read book because of the style it is written:  \\"purple prose\\" . All the poetic decoration distracted me. At some occasions I was asking if what I was reading was just a more verbal decoration or a hint and at some other line all the decoration scratched redundant. Even though, Grace and Sam's story was so tender that I submerged in their journey as hundreds of readers and it was worth it at the end. The end is beautiful and certainly explained why this title has had so much support.hard to read book because of the style it is written:  \\"purple prose\\" .

140004281X|5.0|Reading the prose of Alice Munro is like reading through glass into pure distillation of image. Her words disappear. Her words become window.<br /><br />Window into the lives of her characters. Window into our own lives.<br /><br />For me, the story that hit me like a sack in the stomach was Silence, easily my favorite of the stories in this collection. The story centers on a mother whose daughter makes a devastating decision. That's it, that simple. That's the turn that created what for me is a masterpiece.<br /><br />There are no plot contrivances. Nothing is plot-derived. There is only the gift of masterful storytelling and layered, complex characterization. Easy answers do not exist. There is no pat life. There is no rote happy ending after rote happy ending.<br /><br />Read her for her transparent prose. Read her for her gift of conveying the complexities of life in a language so deceptively plain you might think you could pull it off, too.<br /><br />For whatever reason, just read her.

Since receiving it, I have watched it at least 8 times and enjoy it more each time.    The video is excellent and the performance is superb!    Highly recommended.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This season is absolutely crucial for the entire series, not only plot wise but also in terms of characters. There is no episode where you don't get surprised or shocked by all the twists and turns that happen.

B002JM1VJG|5.0|i pre-ordered this and lost my appetite when I read reviews about the poor picture quality...when I got it, it's not as bad as some reviewers made it out to be.  The encoding is taylored for those 30\\" or less NTSC tv screen on a standard DVD player...on those, it will look fine...I didn't even notice any pixellation on a motion intensive video like Ray of Light..  but if you're going to watch it on hi-end equipment, big plasma widescreen TV, with upscaling and stretched to PAL dimensions.. I can understand that it will be a total disappointment because the encoding does seem like it's compressed to maximum for a 30\\" NTSC screen and will break into artifacts for anything with a higher resolution.    The contents itself is great, not much to complain about save a few missing videos.
B002M3SP28|5.0|Personally I have always been a fan of Jeffrey's writing and to me this in no exception. His love for the character and the metaphor of Icarus are on full display. Written with passion, joy, and evocative feeling this is one of those novels that I will remember for a long time.    If I had read the reviews prior to reading this I would have been deprived of this joy.    Although I can certainly understand the criticisms this shouldn't stop you from trying it out. After all you can always stop reading and if you are like me there is no hope of that!    My favorite line from the novel was the following which I thought was brilliant:    \\"A strange thought crossed his mind. He must remember to tell Clare that the top of Everest was about the same size as their dining-room table.\\"    I sat there after reading this line and it brought a tear to my eye.    I think the reason the appeal is so strong is that I am an entrepreneur and as such the dream of the impossible journey, the intrepidty of the characters and their indominitable spirit was obviously working on me at a subconscious level.
B00288KNL8|5.0|Based of Niel Gaimen's novel of the same name, Coraline follows the events of a girl who moves to Oregon and encounters a strange alternate world where everything is better than at home, but nothing is as it seems. Entirely stop-motion, this movie took over three years to create and animate entirely by hand. A triumph, although perhaps not a movie one would want to show to young children, Coraline delivers a lovely and playfully dark story.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This is a triumphant return for AIC. It is much better than I ever could have anticipated. It really does sound like a natural progression from AIC's last studio album. Are there times where I listen to a song and wait for Layne Staley to pop through all the guitars with his trademark voice? Sure. And that is hard to get over at first. I miss that. He was a great singer with a unique voice and style. AIC can never replace him and on Black Gives Way to Blue they do not try to replace him.    But this sounds like Alice in Chains. It doesn't sound like another Jerry Cantrell solo project at all. I was never as big a fan of Cantrell's solo work as I was his work in AIC. Cantrell always has been and always will be the creative force that drives AIC, but I think a ton of credit needs to go to the two guys who have always been overlooked: Mike Inez and Sean Kinney. If Cantrell is the key to the AIC sound, why has his solo stuff failed to live up to the high standards set by AIC? I think, as great a musician and songwriter Cantrell is, these two guys need some credit for allowing that AIC sound to come through.    But that's not to discredit Cantrell at all. To deny his talent is impossible. The guy simply knows how to create interesting riffs and write interesting songs. And his ability to weave vocal harmonies around and through a song is incredible. When you get past missing Staley's voice, you really appreciate the new duo of Cantrell and William DuVall. It's hard to call DuVall AIC's new singer when, in actuality, Cantrell handles the majority of the vocals -- or at least his is the most prominent voice on most songs. There are plenty of layered vocals with Cantrell's and DuVall's voices intertwining in classic AIC fashion. But the only real instance where DuVall stands out front with his voice is on 'Last of My Kind,' where he does a really excellent job of adding his own unique voice while staying true to AIC's signature sound. I believe AIC made a perfect choice inDuVall. While he maybe takes a back seat on this album to an extent, there are definitely enough signs to be excited about the direction AIC is headed.    Alice in Chains has produced an album which should satisfy most old fans, but they have also expanded their sound and head in a few new directions. They do no disservice to Layne Staley here. They were able to both honor his legacy and at the same time allow themselves the freedom to move on without him. That is no easy feat. There's no replacing a voice like Staley's. All AIC could do was try and push forward and they have done so exceedingly well with this album. Rejoice AIC fans. Layne Staley is gone, but Alice in Chains have proven they are very much alive and well. This is a fantastic album. It *is* Alice in Chains.

B000I5XOW8|3.0|The movie itself is a 5-star movie but I can only give this release three stars because of the simply horrid transfer afforded it. Until Amazon comes up with a different rating system that allows us to grade the technical quality of the product (transfer etc) and the product itself (the movie) I have to give it a lower score than the movie deserves.<br />The movie features Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man falsely accused of the murder of his wife. Escaping from captivity a manhunt is launched for Kimble, led by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (played in an Oscar winning performamce by Tommy Lee Jones). The ensuing action details Kimble's attempts to clear his name, all the while trying to evade his pursuers. Director Andrew Davis crafts a taught and exciting movie and delivers what is one of the best movies of the 1990s. But for all the movie does right Warner have seen fit to deliver it to Blu-ray in a transfer that is at times painful to watch with a soft and undefined image that contains large amounts of grain and is overall dull with a lack of detail. The Blu-ray fares somewhat better in the audio department however with a very active, if average by todays standards, track. Where Warner does deserve high marks is inclusion of all of the special features from the Special Edition DVD including a feature-length commentary track with Davis and Tommy Lee Jones that contains a lot of good information despite some long pauses. There os also a smattering of featurettes.<br />Overall a disappointing presentation of an exceptional movie. Here is hoping that Warner revisits this title soon

B002KH4KSY|1.0|The DVD version has a nude sex scene with two of the \\"children\\" getting it on (on top of a church altar) in front of an audience of 5 to 18 year olds.  How's that for classy?  I don't remember anything like that in Stephen King's original short story but the makers of this film swear they are being faithful to the source material.  In many ways they are but this film is so ineptly executed that it is an even bigger insult to Stephen King than the original (not so bad) film was.<br /><br />The only bright spot in this rancid remake is Daniel Newman as Malachi.  That guy can act and he gives Courtney Gaines a run for his money with his amazing and sympathetic portrayal of Malachi.  Aside from Newman the rest of the acting is simply awful, particularly from the \\"children\\" who seem barely able to speak english.  The kid playing Isaac isn't even elementary school play material.  This kid is an absolutely rotten actor.<br /><br />The script, while in theory is closer to the story, brings in all sorts of nonsense about Burt being a Viet Nam vet who is apparently experiencing post-traumatic stress in the corn field (and of course we get the obligatory flash back sequences). If you thought the original film was slow paced, try sitting through this snooze fest.  Burt and Vicki yack and yack with a dead body in the trunk and then Burt wanders through the corn for a half hour experiencing flash backs that are just pointless and sleep inducing.<br /><br />And guess what?  The original film had BETTER visual effects in it than this one since this remake has ABSOLUTELY NO visual effects whatsoever.  YOU WON'T SEE HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS IN THIS FILM.  Not even a glimpse.  Not even a big fluffy glowing cloud formation.  Not a gopher from hell in sight.  NOTHING.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER.<br />What a complete waste.  Yes the movie ends like the story with Burt and Vicki dead on crosses with their eyes gouged out but to see the actual end of the film you have to watch the credits all the way to the end and then the film picks up again with the children out in the corn field about to act out the finale of the film.  Why on earth this was done is a complete mystery.  Perhaps incompetent director Donald Borchers forgot to film any connecting scenes and decided to show the credits before inserting the final portion of the film.  Who knows.  It's all so amateurish, awful and absurd that you won't care and probably won't make it through more than a few minutes of this entirely terrible film.<br /><br />Well...maybe not entirely terrible as the set design in the church is a little better than in the first film and the haunting theme music of Johnathan Elias is retained for this version.  And of course there is the truly excellent performance by Daniel Newman as Malachi.  Still, a great score and one good actor can't save this truly worthless, wretched mess.

B001US29I2|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst design I have experienced from Lego.  It's so poor I'm embarrassed for them.  I was a faithful Lego lover in the 80's when I was a child, and am now enjoying them again with my son.  We have nearly every Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones set and most of them are decently thought out constructions, this one however, is not (the Temple of Doom is a poor design too, stay away from that set also).      Many of the large pieces and even sections are held together by just one or two Lego dots, if you gently lift and rotate it to an upside down position, or attempt to carefully transport it, there is little chance it will hold together.  You may have been lucky to have gotten pieces that fit slightly more tightly than our set, when held upside down ours definitely slips apart.  My son was not able to put this set together, and I enjoyed putting it together about as much as I have enjoyed constructing tedious models.    This set is not designed to the standard that I expect Lego to maintain.  There is a reason why Lego is more expensive than Mega Blocks or any other Lego impostor, and it's because they have maintained a high standard over the years.  This set is not at that standard.  The only good thing about this set is that it does come with a lot of figures.  The catapult is pretty good also.    Unless your child absolutely must have these figures I suggest spending your money on another set.

B002JTMNX2|4.0|It's only been a mere thirteen years since their last release 'Mr. Moonlight' which seems too much time has elasped between releases, barring any live or greatest hits compilations.  But, be that as it may, if you're a Foreigner fan you just have to wait.  While Mick Jones may be the only original member left from the original six, he does a good job here with this release.  Kelly Hanson does a great job in the vocal department and Mick provides, at times, that Foreigner sound, reminiscent of days gone by and most evident of the remake of 'Fool For You Anyway', the last track of the album.  While the opener is sure to hook you, the other tracks on this album provide some good listening.  While I would love to compare to past efforts (their first album which is their best and none since have even come close) it might not be fair here since Lou Gramm isn't present.  So, for the album itself you get what you get.  If you're expecting Gramm to pop out somewhere, just forget it and find his own band, 'The Lou Gramm Band' and his release this year which focuses more on the Christian side of things.  Overall, a good listen and certainly not worth the one star ratings here because those reviewers think its sacrilege to continue without Gramm.  Get over it.  Yes, I like Gramm better too, but bands and members move on.  Just look around today at all the bands that have.  The 2nd cd of 10 remixes of their hits which is a nice touch for further enjoyment and a little updating on those tracks if you don't have the 'No End in Sight' best of cd.  I can't rate the DVD since I purchased the download which doesn't come with the DVD.  Enjoy the new Foreigner and time will tell if they will last.
0547258305|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for one of my daughter's friends who is in the hospital.  I decided to page through it and flicking through, decided to go back and read from the beginning.  I devoured this book, neglecting work and household chores.    The story was riveting from the beginning and stayed true to character and focused till the end.  There is much to be said for using the relationship between the main characters to set an example for our modern age young people.  Katsa is a great role model for introspection, re-evaluating your life, setting new goals and maintaining your independence even while committing to a relationship you never thought you'd have.  Po sets a great example of selflessly putting others before himself.  The strengths, and weaknesses, of Cashore's main characters is outstandingly portrayed and explored.    I would love to read more books with these characters.  More of Po and Katsa, Raffin, Bitterblue.

I hope they have unlasting love..\\" BOY WAS I WRONG! That is her freakin brother! I don't care if they didnt grow up with each other, or if they never met, but beyond any idea, THEY HAVE THE SAME BLOOD, SAME MOTHER, AND SAME FATHER! what the heck? They fell in love and they are brother and sister. How tramatizing. At first I thought that the VAlentine guy was going to say, just kidding I have a spell of Jace to think that he is actually my son..BUT NO! Goodness, I am curious to read the next book in the series to see if maybe its not true, so watch out for my comments for the next book.......
B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|Before reviewing Foot of the Mountain, I have to start by saying that A-ha is one of my favorite groups of all time.  Few albums by any musical act have moved me as much as Scoundrel Days did, which ranks on my books as the best ever album by A-ha.  It epitomizes what I have always loved about them:  Dramatic and intensely-flourishing melodies, a perfect balance of melancholy & sweetness, and rock & pop, as well as meaningful lyrics.  Hunting High and Low, Stay On These Roads, and East of the Sun and West of the Moon were also very good albums.<br /><br />After East of the Sun and West of the Moon (their 4th studio album), for me it has been years of \\"just OK albums\\" with only a couple of good songs in each.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with Foot of the Mountain, which for me now ranks as the fifth best A-ha album.<br /><br />1- Scoundrel Days (A+)<br />2- Hunting High and Low (A)<br />3- Stay on These Roads (B+)<br />4- East of the Sun and West of the Moon (B+)<br />5- Foot of the Mountain (B+)<br /><br />I know it may be too soon to place it at number five (since the songs are still fresh), but I know it will probably always remain comparable to Stay on These Roads and East of the Sun.<br />Not bad after 19 years of disappointing albums!<br /><br />Foot of the Mountain sounds fresh and has some of the elements I mentioned above that I love about A-ha: Dramatic and intensely-flourishing melodies, a perfect balance of melancholy & sweetness, as well as meaningful lyrics.  Throughout, it has an `80s feel.  The production is clever and not half as distorted like Analogue (I did like the distortion on Analogue).  Some Keane and Coldplay fans will be able appreciate this album and realize how much A-ha influenced the two, as well as many others.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate the album a B+.<br /><br />Below is a short review of each of the songs:<br /><br />1- Foot of the Mountain - The song has one of the sweetest  melodies I have heard in years.  If produced differently (more `80s), it could be part Hunting High and Low.  It grows on you and stays fresh for quite a long time.  Morten's voice sounds perfect with its usual vulnerability and expressiveness.  It is my favorite song on the album. A+<br /><br />2- The Bandstand - The song on the album that took longer to hit me but probably one of the strongest songs once it did.  It has lasting quality.  A<br /><br />3- Mother Nature Goes to Heaven - The bridge on this song is climactic & heavenly, when Morten sings \\"And there will be no sadder day....when all the birds have flown away!\\"  Interestingly, there are a few parts on the song where Morten sounds very much like REM's Michael Stipe.  Bitter-sweet in nature.  A<br /><br />4- What There Is - Reminiscent of the Pet Shop Boys in melody form/notes.  It could have been on their album \\"Very\\".  It has that bitter-sweet repetitive, catchy feel that instantly gets to your head.  A<br /><br />5- Real Meaning - A little masterpiece.  Simple, beautiful, with a perfectly sweet melody and production.  A<br /><br />6- Nothing Is Keeping You Here - Another little sweet gem.  The only thing that bothers me is when Morten goes into falsetto towards the end of the song.  It sounds too forced and it shows too evidently the aging of his voice - not in a good way. A-<br /><br />7- Riding the Crest - At first I was turned off at the song's seemingly simple melody and lack of depth.  With time I grew to appreciate the very `80s feel, production, and fun atmospherics, as well as the lyrics that suit the whole thing very well.  B+<br /><br />8- Shadowside - A good song.  Like in Nothing is Keeping You Here, Morten's voice bothers me.  It sounds forced again, especially when he tries to hit the high notes. C<br /><br />9- Sunny Mystery - This song could have been on Scoundrel Days or Analogue, but the melody is not complimented by a dramatic production - so to me the whole thing sounds a bit flat & boring.  C<br /><br />10- Start the Simulator - The only song I don't like at all on the album.  With its `50s melody and feel, it sounds like Debbie Harry should be singing it on Blondie's Eat to the Beat album.  But she would have done the melody justice with her then-perfect-voice and Blondie would have probably produced it in a \\"beachy-surfy-California-sort-of-way\\" that would suit the melody much more.  DBlondie's Eat to the Beat album.  But she would have done the melody justice with her then-perfect-voice and Blondie would have probably produced it in a \\"beachy-surfy-California-sort-of-way\\" that would suit the melody much more.

B002POMLHY|5.0|OK .. so right.. check it out .. it's like this ...   I read all these reviews that were written , and I suppose I could be classified as bias.   I followed BB since their bar days before they released albums.   I love the new CD 'Dear Agony', and every CD before it.   I noticed many reviews have said it did not sound the same as the other songs,   but lets be honest if it sounded the same what fun would that be?  Furthermore isn't that the hopes of a new CD? to sound different in each one?  Ben is an amazing artist and skilled song writer.   Mark, Aaron and Chad are hands down kick a** and complete BB as a band  I am not going to break down the songs from the CD because I loved them all.  As a songwriter you write the songs from your perspective,   each person who listens to the song will interpret it and apply it differently.    BB has shown they can cover a musical spectrum and accelerate forward,   I wish them all continued success. Rock on guys and fellow BB fans!
0061730327|5.0|Other reviewers have more than adequately described this fascinating, first-person account of how William Kamkwamba, a fourteen year-old boy in a famine-plagued region of Southeastern Africa saved his family from hunger, vastly improved the lives of his neighbors and secured for himself an education by assembling a bespoke windmill and electrical generator out of part's scavenged from his family's subsistence farm.  I would like to draw two important lessons from this excellent autobiographical account.  First, in a lesson America once drew from the like of the fourteen-year old inventor of television, Philo Farnsworth, and accounts of Tom Swift and Thomas Edison, that self-taught and self made technology can often be more potent then all the efforts of silver-tongued politicians and their vast expenditures in solving the problems of human society. Secondly, as Mr. Kamkwanba himself notes on page 152 of this engaging memoir, he was not among the more distinguished students in conventional academic measures, but that his talents were only recognized in the results of his personal library study, tinkering and imagination in the benefits they drew for his family and nation.<br /><br />These lessons, that technology designed and built by self-motivated individuals can best solve human problems, and that the most talented among our population cannot be selected by only conventional measures are vital not only for Malawi, not only for Africa and the developing world but should be carried as object lessons for societal improvement in the US and in economically advanced nations through the coming decades<br /><br />--Ira Laefsky
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible was created during the Writer's Guild strike in 2008. Not content with simply sitting around and twiddling their thumbs, waiting for work to start again, the Whedon family came together to create a new form of viral entertainment - a wacky, evil, musical love story that challenges our preconceived notions of good and evil. Brilliant performances all around from Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day - who knew Nathan Fillion could sing? The sheer amount of success Dr. Horrible has achieved in such a short time should speak for itself. It's a home project that was born in the midst of a crisis and has gained critical acclaim. Dr. Horrible is a prime example of the power the internet has gained over the past few years and how effective word of mouth can be. Dr. Horrible is fun, bizarre, reflective, inspiring, and tragic - everything one has come to expect from Joss Whedon.
B002IM49IW|2.0|FREAKS is definitely an unusual movie and has an assured place in motion picture history. My 2-star rating is NOT for the film itself.<br /><br />The question here is product QUALITY.<br /><br />I've been checking out various offerings from this gray market dealer. Seems reviewers give their movies either 5 star or 1 star ratings. While one will laud their superior transfer quality the next absolutely trashes it as THE WORST. Very contradictory. VERY confusing! Also, I've seen a single new reviewer who's posted 5 reviews, four of which are five-star BIG D ones. That's too coincidental for me!<br /><br />I won't spend significant bucks to find out which is correct: the raves or the brickbats. There's too many viable options out there to take a chance, IMO.<br /><br />Caveat emptor, folks.
0439023483|5.0|The Story Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins takes place somewhere in the future and in what we know now as the United States. But after some economical failures it has been separated in to 12 districts that are all \\"ruled\\" or regulated by the capital. The first district being right outside the capital and the 12th being the furthest, as well as the poorest.  Katniss who is the main character in this story lives in district 12, after her father died in the coal mine; leaving her mother helpless and incapable of supporting a family Katniss was obligated to take the lead role in keeping her family alive.     Every year they choose two people from each district (chose randomly) to participate in their annual Hunger Games, where all the contestants will have to fight and kill for their lives. And this year they drew Prims name, Katniss' younger sister. But if someone would rather volunteer they can take place of the person who was drawn, so Katniss takes the place of Prim to save her younger sister.    So once the games begin all 24 of the participants are thrown into an arena and are on their own to try and be the last surviving person. When there is about 8 of them left, they announced a new rule that if the two remaining participants are from the same district they will both win. Katniss then finds Peeta, the boy from her district. They pair up and will fight to win this years game!     I fell in love with this book, just minutes after beginning to read it. The way Suzanne Collins described Katniss made me have an instant attachment to her, and for me, being someone who doesn't particularly love to read, having an emotional connection with the story makes it so much more enjoyable to read. I really liked her writing; it was an easy read, but not something that an adult would feel childish reading. I think being able to write a book that can entertain almost any age is a huge accomplishment and says a lot about how good of a writer you are. Some of the violence may be toexplicate for younger children, but besides that I think this book would reach the interests of any age group.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|A few weeks ago, two albums were released on the same day by two of my favorite bands: The Incident from Porcupine Tree, and The Resistance by Muse.  This should have been the best week of the year for me, as far as music is concerned.  The Incident wasn't bad; it was somewhat middling.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about Resistance.    I should preface this by mentioning that I own and adore all of Muse's previous releases.  The energy, creativity, and variety of all of their previous albums leaves little more to be desired.  What motivated them to come up with such an uninteresting, unfocused, and boring album is beyond me.    The best work on this album, MK Ultra and the title track, are good songs, to be sure.  As good as their best work on their first four albums?  Not even close.  There are also several adequate tracks (The Uprising, Unnatural Selection, The United States of Eurasia, Exogenesis) which aren't bad per se, but don't really give us any good reason to listen to them instead of everything they've done before now.  I suppose this is fine; most albums have some filler, anyways.    What really brings down this album are three tracks that are, to put it bluntly, garbage.  Undisclosed Desires is overproduced, under-thought pop drivel that should make Chris Cornell a little less ashamed of his latest album.  It is so bad that it does not even pass the lowest requirement of merely tolerable background noise, which is to not be irritating.  Guiding Light sounds like another superfluous power ballad that managed to escape from the lowest echelons of that horrid decade known as the 80s.  What made them think this tripe would be a good idea, I'll probably never know.  I Belong To You is a bit more of an enigma.  It feels like somewhere inside that unfocused mess, there's a good song trying to get out.  Ultimately, it's probably a song that was too bad for one of their older albums, but surfaced now because it was the only idea left.  They're scraping the bottom of the barrel, so to speak.    Despite those three awful tracks, this album could be reasonably decent if it weren't for the distracting lyrics.  They've certainly taken a step back in that department.  Instead of thought-provoking reflections on love, politics, and spirituality, we get conspiratorial ramblings along the lines of \\"THEY WILL NOT FOOOORCE US/THEY WILL STOP DEGRAAAAAADING US/THEY WILL NOT CONTROLLLLLL US/WE WILL BE VICTOOOOOOORIOUS!!!!\\"  I am as anti-establishment as anybody, but come on!  Put a little more effort into it...
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|poorly written  bad plot bloated  stupid premise  I would suggest Dawkins if you want the real story.    very disappointing followup to previous &#34;stories&#34;
B002BSHWUU|5.0|There are alot of reviews about this box set. And just like anyone else I also have some thoughts on this. I'd been waiting for it for 27 days. It came yesterday. I do believe they sound wonderful! I'm not saying that because its The Beatles. This review is not about the amazing talent and genius of The Beatles. We all know about that.    The Music does sound a bit louder then the 1987 remasters. It also sounds fresher, better clarity and crisp. I love it!!! The Booklets that come with each CD are excellent! I love the liner notes and there are alot of photos I had not seen before in them. Great Historical and Recording notes as well!     The box the Discs come in is also very nice. I know some reviewers don't like the storage box because they have to at times pull alot of the discs out in order to get to the one they want to hear. For me this is not a problem and I don't mind pulling them out.     Some other highlights - The Mini Documentaries are nice to have on one DVD. I think they are easier to watch that way. Also because not everyone has a computer to watch the one's on each CD.    The only thing that I did'nt like that much is something others stated as well. The discs in the White Album and Past Masters are kind of hard to get out. They are in there tighter then they should be. I don't want to mark up these discs with fingerprints or scratch them up. I think the standard Jewel case pop out-pop in the disc is a much better design. so the music side of the disc never touches anything.    But over all an excellent box set. If your a Beatles fan you can't go wrong with this! A must have!
0385504225|3.0|Yes...honestly...I'm glad I read this. In all likelihood, you will be too.  Dan Brown writes little chapters you could almost read during the average red light at an intersection.  They usually end with something like, \\"And then he couldn't believe what he just saw!\\" or \\"And then something really cool happened, but I'm not going to tell you until two chapters later!\\" You flip the page, and move on quickly. In this book, he exaggerates that tendency by telling the story in a \\"24\\"-like fashion. The events occur over one day.  You won't linger on his elegant phrasing or sentence structure, because they're not.  He's not a wit. His humor is mild; I like the line that Google does not equal research.  He's a simple story teller, and he keeps you continually \\"hooked\\" with the plot twists and fascinating trivia.  This is his style, love it or leave it. As a reader, you also will be lectured to, as well as being told a story. The former will irritate you more in this book than in his others, I feel.  Like most people, I got swept up in the Da Vinci frenzy, and enjoyed it. Then I checked out Angels, and was more impressed. Angels was better than Da Vinci for me, and I don't think I'm alone there.  If Angels was his \\"Rome\\" book, and Da Vinci his \\"Paris\\" book, then this is his \\"Washington DC\\" book.   The Lost Symbol was just a tad bit of a letdown; the ending wasn't the walk-off home run you wanted. Maybe a good, solid double for me.  I now know why you write \\"Sincerely\\" at the end of a letter, though. I think that's pretty cool.   There's a lot of \\"cool\\" stuff in here, but as a story, it doesn't feel completely thought out. There's a little of a \\"is that it?\\" feeling after reading the final page.  But does it really matter anymore? I know I'll be waiting for his next book just like a bazillion other folks out there...all the while looking at my dollar bills more carefully, etc.  Without wax,  Dr. Mo
B002Q5C4QK|5.0|I've been anticipating this CD for months.  Nick Carter threw out some teasers on his YouTube account, which only wet my appetite further.  This album has BSB written all over it.  A must have for any BSB fan.  I purchased the Deluxe edition at Target for $9.98.  My only gripe is that it did not have \\"Helpless\\" on it (bonus track in other countries).  It's a great song that should have been on there.
B0028K3192|5.0|I love this album! I am a true fan!  I attended the concert last night and he is just as captivating live as he is on the album!!! I'm so glad that he's back!  The album is short when compared to others, but let's not forget that this is the 1st CD of the trilogy. More is to come. Be patient, he is worth the wait!
0545123267|4.0|I am not a teen, and so I was skeptical when a friend told me I should read this book. I was pleasantly surprised by the Twilight series (up until the last book) and so I gave this book a try.  Just a few pages into it, I was intrigued.  About thirty pages in the book, I cared for these characters, and the odd separate species thing didn't even cross my mind at the time.  The love story is intense. In some scenes I related to my own adolescence, and my own relationship, and it brought those giddy feelings back.  If you liked Twilight, if you like impossible love stories, you should like this book.
0439023491|4.0|I fell in love with the characters of District 12 in the first book of the series. The names were a bit of a stretch, even for a futuristic community, but aside from that, the author tells a tale that is so winning and captivating that I was hooked immediately.<br />In the second book we find our heroine in a predicament, or several, depending on how you look at it. Katniss Everdeen is in love with Gale, but Peeta is who the Capital and the people believe she is in love with instead. The romance between all three of them is sad, and filled with moments of dread. The people around them in their own district, and the ones they visit are forlorn and weakened by the capital. This is not a heartwarming story.<br />I had hoped that this would be the conclusion of the story. It was a good sequel, but it did not keep me up at night as some readers have posted on here. I enjoyed it, and it had moments where I didn't want to put it down, but I could.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This is a spiritual experience and a beautiful look at a life fulfilled through music.  It is a gift to those who experienced the concert live or recorded.<br />Thank you, Leonard and extraordinary musicians.
B001OQCV9M|3.0|The movie was not bad and Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep were very good. However the Julie part should have been cut out as it reminds me of When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle in the kitchen. A note--I've seen a movie where the boom microphone is visible in so many scenes--sloppy editing.
B000002VMH|5.0|Talent as sweeping and supreme as Annie Lennox's is getting rare. With powerful lyrics and inspired musicality, brimming with energy and vitality, she has well earned her place in the spotlight. Classicaly trained, she is a very skilled pianist and songwriter. Her arrangements, in my opinion, are her greatest feature.      In her debut solo album, \\"Diva\\", she comes out in full force with powerful songs, instantly catchy hooks, and brilliant arrangements. She gives each song everything she has and you catch a glimpse of her spirit, realizing that this is what she was born to do. From the masterful handling of rythmms and instricacies to the wells of strength exhibited in her voice and music, this is essential Lennox.     My favorite tracks include:   \\"Why\\", the hit single that shows her extreme vulnerability and complexity as she tries to explain a relationship that's breaking down. It castes a spell on you and you have to stop dead in your tracks, no matter what your doing, as you're swept away her brilliance.   \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\", full of dynamic energy with immensely catchy piano and rythmm. This is such a fun song to listen to. One of the best arrangements I've heard.   \\"Money Can't Buy It\\", her powerful anti-materialism anthem, a message that needs to be heard with our society's infatuation with money and possessions. The rap half-way through is one of the highlights of the album.   \\"Little Bird\\", with its classic Lennox vibe. Sounds almost like a soul/gospel song about breaking free.    I also liked \\"Stay By Me\\" with its romantic, nostalgic melancholy. \\"The Gift\\" is the albums most subdued track, showcasing Lennox's beautiful introspective lyrics.      Honestly, by buying this album used from Amazon, you could change your life for the price of a Big Mac. It's very high on my favorites list and I admire Lennox's talent and creativity. I went on to buy two more of her albums after hearing this one and I don't regret it. You won't either.
0684847817|5.0|I love the illustration in this book. I wanted a book that I can sit down and read it with my daughter. (She loves Faeries)I got this book and the Faeries 25th aniversity book. Both are amazing. Brian had such fun writing this book. He gives detail on the faeries and what they do. I didn't know there was so many fae. This book was very interesting and I got to escape into my own little dimension.
0307408833|5.0|Erin you are a baking genius.  Thank you so much for creating these recipes.  My family and everyone on our block is obsessed with the banana bread.  I really enjoy making the recipes; however, you HAVE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS.  If the recipe calls for one cup of something it has to be exactly one cup or the recipe will not turn out.  Also, I live in a very small town outside of Seattle and I found almost all of the ingredients at my local QFC grocery store, and they were not expensive at all.      If you're ever in New York you have to stop by Babycakes and get the vanilla cupcake it is heavenly and the frosting is amazing.      Erin my family and I hope you write another book very soon!  Maybe one with the doughnut recipe?
0786868724|5.0|This is one of the only books that I've ever read that I couldn't put down!  Really!  If it had not been for the normal demands of life I would have finished it in one sitting.  Instead, I had to put it down for an evening and spend the next day waiting to be able to get my hands on it to finish it.  Mitch Albom is blessed with an incredible ability to capture thoughts and stories that touch the soul.  Have a Little Faith is one of the books that should be required reading for life; particularly now with so much going on in the world around us.  His conversations with two great, yet unknown, men of God are lessons in how to deal with the normal challenges and struggles of life.  Don't read this book if you're afraid to feel the urge to shed a few tears of joys but read this book if you want to understand the answers to the questions that you ponder daily from the perspective of two men who have answered them from paths of life that, although divergent, were filled with experiences that captured the essence of what life is all about.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|While there are some purists who may find these performances a bit on the romantic side, my wife and I found them to be enhanced by this facet.  If you have ever had the experience of listening to a piece of music and thinking \\"so that's how it is supposed to sound\\" because the rhythms, the melodic elements, and harmonies just fit then try this.  One the other hand, if you are interested in music scholarship perhaps you will find things to criticize here but will miss the beauty of these performances.

B001MVYUPC|5.0|Saw this movie decades ago when it first came out.  Blu Ray transfer was wonderful.  Even though it was filmed almost 25 years ago, was as compelling today as when I first saw it.  Video / audio quality very good but without today's \\"booming\\" sound effects.  Recommended.  Bonus material in form of interviews and reflections of original production crew interesting and filled in voids in creating the video.  A nice addition if you want more \\"soak\\" time with the historical perspectives of the movie.  Recommended.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|I love it, it is a very light and real life movie. John Cusack is a very natural actor and with Diane Lane they look real good. I already watch it at least 10 times.

Many of them are answered in 2010. The book was great reading. The author certainly knows a lot of science and the detail in the book is great. He also introduces some novel concepts and gives you a lot to think about. I am about to read 2061.

B000002UAX|1.0|This album is rubbish!! It's a shame I have to give it even one star.<br /><br />There's not one reference to snow, paper, talcum powder, dandruff or anything else white including Xmas!!!<br /><br />Nope, it's all over the show, no structure to the album at all, songs all jumbled up. I think The Beatles must have still been on drugs when they put this album together. Oh Bla Di, Oh Bla Da????? Oh Bloody Hell more like.<br /><br />Brian Epstein died just before this album was released, and personally, I think he had some insider knowledge as to how this album sounded. This album also coincides with Oh-no making an appearance. Something which must have put them all off their stride, judging by the sounds of it!!<br /><br />They even had to rope in Eric Clapton to try and make it sound better, but that failed miserably.<br /><br />Nope, this is a rubbish album by a rubbish band. The Monkees were the original boy band, were far better and produced better songs too.<br /><br />The beatless have become nothing more than a brand.

Music is bland and uninspiring, can't hear the instruments properly or clearly, singing is out of key.<br /><br />Nope, definite miss!!
B000UJ48XG|5.0|I know I've mentioned this disc under the R J Moss monicker, but I'm throwing another round of applause at it, given that nothing from American pop music has rivalled or excelled it. It's that good! Unpack the superlatives.. so finely calibrated as to be note perfect, from the conch call-to-arms  through to its finale. You make your own luck with this sense of timing, and my fear is that Condon will find this hard to top. It's up there with Astral Weeks, Highway 61 Revisited, Blue, A Walk Across The Rooftops(Blue Nile) in creating a visually and aurally compelling and alluring parallel world. Hyperboles aside, this is a disc to savour. For all its influences, well documented by reviewers, it transcends them all with a verve and nerve that is its author's alone.I'd pay the entry price for,'In The Mausoleum' on its own, but such pickiness is beside the point. 'Do yourself a favour'. Condon's resemblance to fin de siecle French Romantic, Arthur Rimbaud, per his video clips, intensify the Parisian ambience of the disc.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I recently purchased the Number Ones by Michael Jackson.  As soon as i received it in the mail by family and i were immediately dancing and singing to the tunes.  It is simply fabulous and i am very happy that i purchased this one.  I listened to the songs prior to buying it and there was one song in particular that i wanted to hear....\\"You are not alone\\" is one of my favorite hits from Michael Jackson.  It makes me think about him when i play that song.  You will not be disappointed with his album or any of them for that matter.  He truly was the King of Pop!
0439023483|5.0|Wow, wow, wow....it's hard to no where to begin. I was a major skeptic when I heard about this book. After reading the reviews I decided to risk it and give it a try. I am soooo glad I did!! This is by far one of the best books I have read in a very long time. It actually took me off guard by how good it was. Once I started reading I just couldn't put it down.....walking around with the book while cooking, getting ready for work, getting my kids ready for school...it was GREAT! All I have to say is, start early (or late, if you prefer) but don't plan on getting anything else done until you turn the last page. I give Collins a HUGE thumbs up on this! I hope her other books are like this one because I will be giving them a try.
1427207267|5.0|Many parents have applauded their young child as they master the wonderful story BROWN BROWN, BROWN BEAR, WHAT DO YOU SEE?  Now, Macmillan Young Listeners has taken the story one step further.  This collection contains the audio book read by the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as an oversized paperback copy of the famous story.<br /><br />The book contains all the wonderful and simple illustrations that Eric Carle is famous for.  It's the complete repetitive story of all the animals that are found, leading up to the surprising ending.<br /><br />However, what this package has that previous versions of the story had been lacking is the enchanting reading of the story by Ms. Paltrow.  Using her soft and flowing voice, the words that could be trying to a parent who has heard the story many, many times becomes a new and wonderful experience.<br /><br />The book and CD will surely keep little ones occupied.  Whether sitting on the bed or riding in the car, the repeating \\"what do you see\\" will keep them laughing and guessing for hours.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jaglvr
0756656230|5.0|I had this pre-ordered quite a while ago, and it finally showed up yesterday!<br />HEAVY, thick hard covers, in an even HEAVIER thick slip cover! Even the \\"bonus book\\" about the mini figure is the same wonderful quality. GREAT value for the money!<br /><br />What a brilliant look a the history of the LEGO brick and the company as a whole. For those looking for new and outrageous models you might be in for a bit of disappointment, as this is more of a visual history. I had so much fun remembering back with all the old sets they showed, and looking at the time line and thinking, \\"Was it REALLY 20 years ago I got that set for my birthday?\\"<br /><br />This book is all about the visual. There is a minimal amount of words per page, but they do a wonderful job at describing what is going on, and leading us through the journey, and not taking away from the well laid out pages.<br /><br />One other review complained that this was a \\"glorified catalog\\", but how else would you like to display almost 300 pages of toys? ANY book about a 50+ year line of toys will come off a bit catalog like, no matter how much you try to avoid that. I for one give kudos to the authors from cramming in so many sets and making sure the name and year of each set shown is displayed. These names and date help link the items to the time line, as well as give me a starting point to try and find an old copy of a set that this book brought out fond memories of!<br /><br />I love new and exciting builds as much as the next guy, that's why I am a Brick Journal subscriber (the compendiums are available here on Amazon, and well worth the money!), this book is not meant to do that. This book is a visual history of the entire LEGO system up to today. The book even included the current Space Police and Power Miners lines, and mentions the new Disney lines coming out next year, so you know the information is as up to date as possible in print form!
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol is a typical Dan Brown book, particularly a Dan Brown book about symbologist Robert Langdon.  Yes, it is formulaic ... but most authors do have a \\"formula\\" they follow.  Is it *too* formulaic? ... well, it's pretty close.    The first 300 pages kept me hooked.  I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  But the final 200 pages were disappointing - different \\"mood\\" to the book, dragged in many places, and I just about reached the point where my \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" was about to break. [And I wish I had the ability to \\"read\\" emotions in a person's eyes as well as Dan Brown ... anger, violence, fear, anxiety ... all telegraphed solely in the eys.]    As with his previous books, Brown has created an interesting story integrating history, religion, science, art, architecture, etc etc.  There was an interesting \\"twist\\" along the way that I didn't see coming (and now I may re-read the book to see if I can 'catch' the twist earlier).  Overall, a pretty good book .... typical Dan Brown.
B002DMJLTE|4.0|Although this movie is now over 10 years old, it still is as captivating as ever.  Deep Impact premiered in theatres along the same time as [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]] with a similar premise.  This film, however, has more heart and feels less like a summer blockbuster.  Add to that Morgan Freeman portraying the President, and you have a total package!  The transfer looks perfect and the acting is superb.  Only a few onscreen moments date this film:  specifically the technology the characters use.  Check it out to see Elijah in his pre-[[ASIN:B000X9FLKM The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]]] career!
B000A32KJQ|5.0|A remarkable surprise, exquisitely beautiful, hearkening back to the heydey of ECM yet at the same time quite new and vital. Dazzling ensemble work. Most startling to me is that Katche even gets Garbarek, who usually overpowers with the intensity of his trademark sound (which, since I've got many many albums with him playing on them, has become kinda wearing and predictable to me), to play in a much more nuanced and sensitive vein; I almost couldn't believe it was him on several tracks. Remarkable. And Stanko and Wasilewski: Wow to em both! But it's the compositions that ultimately have to be honored here: they're so damn fine, in fact drop dead gorgeous in the hands of these players. Thanks, Manu...
B00275EGWY|5.0|I soberly enjoyed this movie, and so did my wife--even with the violence.  No doubt that I will watch it many more times.  One of the many generals we seem to hear from so often, said something last year that I've not been able to forget.  Something like \\"..only the military is at war--the rest of America is sitting on their asses.\\"  The movie shows how it is to be young, with life threatening responsibilities far greater than most anyone will ever experience in a lifetime.  You are there and cannot think of anything else, but to 'do your time' and go home.  You come home, go to the super market and see thousands of breakfast cereals to select from--then head back [to the war] as fast as possible.    Purges the soul.
0385504225|2.0|I did not like the book but I will pay to see the movie if Linda Hunt gets the role of Sato.  My late Mother read all her life sometimes three to four books a week. In her later years she told me \\"Editors should not allow books to be longer than 350 pages. I suspect those writers who exceed that number are paid a great deal of money for each word.\\" It was at about page 35o, after I had already figured out the whole thing, with every turn of the page I whispered to myself and Dan Brown \\"you can stop now.\\" I finished it hoping I had been wrong all along. No such luck. A really lack luster book. The publisher must have had to shell out a lot of money for those last 159 pages as there are a lot of words there and so very many of them unnecessary.  Every writer should be forced to read Willa Cather. Not a wasted word. If you are looking for a great read try The Last Report on the Miracles of Little No Horse or The Plague of Doves both by Louise Erdrich.
B000000OAH|5.0|This album seems to get mixed reviews from a number of people, and I can't really understand it. From Mustapha to More of That Jazz, this album is Queen at its finest, to this fan's ears. You get theatrical, you get over the top, you get subtle and emotional, you get absurd, you get rocked incredibly hard, you get gently swayed, and through it all you get the band itself at full force. Freddy sings like it's his last album and the band is ferocious. Most of the songs are 5-star quality (with a couple of so-so filler tracks like Fun It...but not abysmal filler tracks!).<br /><br />Don't be swayed by some of the negative reviews here -- give Jazz a chance. I stand by the opinion that it is one of the finest Queen albums out there.
0723257639|5.0|I already knew I would love the books themselves as I was familiar with them. But I was extemely pleased with ordering them through Amazon!!

I will deal with Amazon again in the future as I have need!
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Before listening to Whitney's much anticipated's \\"I Look To You\\" i had prepared myself not to hear the masterpieces that where her first two albums. I had it in my mind that no matter how hard she tries she will never be able to recreate something with the mood and as timeless as those two albums, I had accepted that, But that doesn't exclude us fans from at least hoping that the nouveau direction and material would be praise-worthy.    That is not the case here. Yes, roughly about 85 percent of the material is listenable catchy tunes you could expect from Beyonce, or even Rihanna. The material is weak, although very listenable, it is nothing groundbraking. In fact i gain more enjoyment from Jennifer Lopez's This Is Me... Then album. Will i be listening to \\"I Look To You\\" in my car in recent months to come? Probably. Am i going to be listening to it two years from now? No, i don't think so.    I have just listened to Barbra Streisand's new album, and i was completly blown away, she only matured better with age, Something Whitney should've done instead of trying to please a mainstream crowd that will forget about her once all this \\"whitney comeback\\" fume blows out.    Album Highlights  Call You Tonight  I Got You  Nothin' But Love  I Didn't Know My Own Strenght
0446672653|5.0|This book was the perfect combination of Truth [from real accounts of the past life regressions of his patients.  A phenomenon that he was thrown into and that changed his life forever] Wisdom and a Love Story, all wrapped in one book!     Its beautifully written, not drawn out, just the right length  - I read this in 3 days! and it really helped to answer alot of questions I had surrounding an encounter.  All around LOVE THIS BOOK!
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I've always thought the original issue of RUBBER SOUL on CD sounds fine. Listening to this remaster on my mid-level system, I definitely hear improvement: the songs play louder (but not too loud) and Paul's bass is more prominent. I wouldn't say the improvement in sound quality is revelatory, though. It's nice, and I'm glad I bought the remaster, but if you are short of cash or not a hardcore audiophile I wouldn't necessarily recommend you toss your 1987 copy and buy this reissue.<br /><br />The songs, of course, are timeless. I never grow tired of listening to them.
1572816112|5.0|The Deviant Moon Tarot is a Moon theme RWS based deck.  The art appears  very abstract, medieval and is inspired by ancient Greek art.  It is a bit on the darker side, but I would not call this a dark deck.  It actually appears to be a very workable deck.  It will appeal to many, both Readers and Sitters  This deck will be especially attractive to those who are fond of the non-traditional or maybe even looking for something a little creepy.<br /><br />I particularly like what is going on in the background of each card.  There are many unique old-style buildings which look like old factories, churches and abandoned buildings.  There is a lot going on in each card.  All of which can apply easily to your readings.<br /><br />This deck measures 2 ¾ inches wide by 5 ¼ inches tall, which is a bit taller than standard.  There are narrow white borders.  Very nice cardstock with smooth finished edges.  A workable amount of laminate.  Easy to shuffle for those with a little larger hand.  The backs are an artistic compilation of moons and is reversible friendly.<br /><br />Justice is numbered eight and Strength is number eleven.  The Death card does not have a title.  All of the other Major Arcana have their original titles.  The Minors are of standard suit, Swords, Cups, Wands and Pentacles.<br /><br />The Little White Book included with this deck, gives meanings for the Majors and the Minors, in both upright and reversed positions.  Refreshingly enough, there is not Celtic Cross spread shown!  The spread in the back of the LWB is the Lunatic Spread, which is a ten card spread.  It's nice to see someone take some creativity with their LWB!<br /><br />Patrick Valenza created the Deviant Moon Tarot, basing it on childhood images and visions seen through his imagination and brought with him, into adulthood.  He was born in Long Island, New York.  He has had a love of art, since his childhood.  He discovered Tarot at a very early age and has studied it quite intensely.<br /><br />Patrick finds it easier to tell people stories with pictures instead of words.  He enjoys \\"tiptoeing\\" through 18th century graveyards and exploring abandoned buildings.<br /><br />His art ranges from detailed colored pencil and acrylic drawings to photographic manipulation that is used in combination with digital drawings, which was used to create this deck.  Each card began with a drawing, that was scanned into a computer, then they were manipulated.  The background buildings were created with photographs that he took of a local abandoned insane asylum.<br /><br />Patrick still lives on Long Island with his wife and two children.

0385504225|1.0|Its a struggle to read this book. And Brown should have paid me to have finished it before throwing it away in utter digust.     First of all, this book shows that Brown is actually a terrible writer. He has no sense of subtlety. The amount of times superlatives have been used in this book for literally everything is astounding. The italics drive you nuts too. The constant references to Ancient Mysteries and opposing dark forces makes the whole experience like reading an elementary school fairy tale.    Then comes the atrocious plot. If the stupidity of events does not put you off, the gore will (severed hands [what was the need for that?], dripping blood, drowning in ethanol, screwdrivers through the throat). Everything conveniently changes at the last second. Everything is about to collapse, until suddenly a savior walks in and saves the day. How immature, or rather how convenient. Brown should know that there is a difference between plot twists and a string of convenient happenstances. Even 1990s Bollywood was more believable.    The characters are probably the worst. A villain that is impossibly lucky, and yet motivated by the most non-sensical objective. Langdon comes across as an absolute baffoon, catching everything 30 minutes after the moment had passed. New characters enter with such frequency, you start reading about everyone with complete disinterest. Even those who interest you in the beginning (like the vicious CIA director) suddenly become hollow as you gain with the so-called plot.     And then, if there was a need to hate this book more, the ending was the capstone atop the garbage heap that is this book. Six minutes after the tragedy is over, people are chuckling and laughing and doing tourism as if nothing had happened, despite people missing a hand, having just gotten a second life, having almost bled to death etc.    And yet I have a bad feeling that some crazy studio is thinking about an adapted screenplay, not least b/c its obvious that Brown wrote the book with that ultimate intention. That movie would be like a cartoon.

0385504225|2.0|The book could have been 200 pages shorter and it still would only get 2 stars. I give it one star for mild suspense and the other star for using Washington DC as the setting. Overall I think the plot all over the place and had too many unneeded flashbacks. I know its fiction so I won't even discuss the unrealistic intelligence and security flaws that would never happen in DC. The so called climax did not occur until 50 pages before the end of the book and was over just a quick. I even noticed he took a comparison from Digital Fortress and brought it up again in the Lost Symbol which was totally irrlevant to this story. I guess he thought no one would notice since that book was written 11 years ago but since I just read Digital Fortress last month it stood out and in a bad way. At that point I felt like he was just writing this book to fullfill his contract. Skip the lost symbol for now or atleast wait until its on paperback or in the bargin bin.
B00000DCH9|5.0|It's been years since I had heard this cd- album. And I had forgot most of the songs. Well it will go back into the lineup again. Billy sure can play a piano!

B000093BDX|5.0|A much simpler time! America was strong, both physical and financial,nobody messed with the USA in those days,they knew better. We had real Presidents who made all the right decisions,and didn't talk to our enemies,or try to talk their way out of a fight! real men for real times! And we all had time to party and have fun! I sure miss those days where we could all sleep well at night, and made more money than it cost to live. AHHH the good ol' days,back then credit meant you didn't know how to manage your money, and were considered a bum if you had to charge something. Real men paid cash on the barrel head! You didn't owe jack to no one!And if you couldn't afford it, you did without like responsible adults! This cd will bring back those bygone days to refresh your memory of what made America great! Nothin like good vibrations to jog the mind back to reality. Thanks amazon!
B000063Y8F|5.0|This is absolutely the best garlic press available on the market and worth every penny.   Great design, heft and feel.   Easy to use and clean...others don't come close.  After I purchased it I found I already had Rosle's can opener....also a great product.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly. This movie is an hour and a half of great entertainment. I've seen the previous three x-men movies and I must say I like Wolverine the best. By a long shot.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I was skeptical of the reviews for a few weeks, but once I got this album in and heard the opener, I was hooked.  I can easily say this is an excellent Alice in Chains album, parallel to Dirt and not another Jerry Cantrell album.  Layne Staley will be missed, but his soul can be found slipping in and out of some of these songs.  Considering some of the other bands who were around in the mid 90's, these guys have held true to themselves and their audience.  The album was well worth the wait. The other positive reviewers on here are fairly accurate when describing the songs individually, so I won't waste my time breaking it down, but I will say the whole album is COMPLETE and well shaped by a group of artists who have risen high above their peers to give us all an album we only get once in a great while.  I'd be hard pressed to believe that another AIC album will be this good for a long time, but hey...you never know.
B0007KIFGO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all times.<br />It's so sad, but so beautiful.<br />Those who hasn't seen it, definitely should!

B001AQT11M|3.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is beautiful and wonderfully restored/updated, it alone deserves 5 stars. HOWEVER, I'll take off two stars as the packaging is a RIP OFF; Disney should be ashamed of their marketing technique. I am not a Blu-Ray owner nor will I ever become one, but I had to buy 3 discs in this Platinum edition, instead of only the one I needed. The film plays great and is a joy to watch, but there are no extra DVD features for me - there is a commentary (I don't consider that an extra), a sneak preview (is advertising really an extra?) and a music video by someone I never heard of and which I'll never watch. Apparently there are many more extras on the Blu-Ray discs but I can't see them.<br /><br />In this time when we all should be ecologically minded, Disney has produced two extra discs for many buyers who will never use them. What a waste, not to mention I PAID EXTRA FOR THEM. I'm glad Blu-Ray users will enjoy the extra spectacular picture and sound but what about other people?<br /><br />DISNEY IS DISHONEST on it's package by not describing the movie format correctly -  the graphic depiction of a movie frame is shown widescreen - but the movie is in STANDARD FRAME (1:1.33). A fact I knew but I found it only stated in very small print towards the bottom of the box. It is also MISLEADING in listing the extras as they don't say that the extras are for Blu-Ray ONLY. I would have loved to see Backstage Disney and the old extras contained on the earlier DVD version, nope, just for Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Disney has this \\"feature\\" called Fast Play - if you don't press the right button to proceed directly to the main menu, the DVD will play its collection of coming attractions - a device aimed at children to see more things they can get their parents to buy.<br /><br />I'm very upset by this waste of materials and the extra amount I paid for things I won't use. I was forced to do it if I wanted a copy of this movie I've waited years for, a digitally restored film which in itself is a beautiful work of art, but we should have a choice of what version we want to buy and Disney should be more responsible to the environment, after all they will sell many millions of this things.<br /><br />A big company like Disney should be more responsible but obviously they are thinking MONEY and how to make the most they can, rather than think of how best to serve its customer base (and the world).iful work of art, but we should have a choice of what version we want to buy and Disney should be more responsible to the environment, after all they will sell many millions of this things.

B001F12J48|4.0|Tom Hanks was excellent in this movie as he plays several different parts. The visuals were cool and breathtaking making it a excellent movie for the entire family. I first saw the IMAX 3D version of this movie which made you feel like you were part of the movie. However I was disappointed with the 3D video version. The 3D glasses provided did not seem to blend the separated colors together enough which made for a weak 3D effect. If they came out with a 3D version that was more similar to the theater version then I would consider buying. So if you consider buying this movie I would recommend the non-3D version instead.
0060558121|1.0|Absolute boring gibberish and nonsense.  Couldn't make it past halfway.  Is this just a runaway snowball of people all liking something because everybody else does?  It's just maddening trying to read this.  Makes me never want to read anything else by him.  I must not get it because everybody seems to love this book.  Ugh its like pulling teeth waiting for something to happen or something interesting to pique my interest or get me thinking....anything!  I can't think of a single good page in the half of the book I forced myself to read.  Garbage.
B00197X140|5.0|The standout track here is the rearranged \\"Are you There?\\" ...listening to this track in the car with crisp sound and mello subtlety is just a beautiful piece of ear candy to behold. Never has any song filled you with such a cool feeling of energy. The guitars rifts and steady melody puts you almost in a state of trance as you listen deeper into it. I found myself putting it on repeat listens even before i finished the rest of the album. I also loved each and every track as the beauty of the guitar is in full presentation here. Going alt rock is the best thing that has ever happened to this band. And I hope they continue this beautiful oath they are taking...there is literally not much like it in todays market.

0061719544|5.0|An amazingly frank, funny and inspirational autobiography blending humor, confession and inspiration in a charmingly written package.<br /><br />I was familiar with Craig Ferguson mostly through his late night TV show (and then realized I knew him from Drew Carey). I'd heard his self-deprecating references to his drinking and drug use, and knew he was in recovery, and was aware of his strong patriotic streak after choosing American citizenship. I regularly Tivo his shows, and then watch the monologues over the weekend.<br /><br />The laughs come early in this book (including in the captions of the obligatory photos). His descriptions of being introduced to Dick Cheney and George Bush at the White House correspondents' dinner are wickedly funny. But this book is more than gags; interspersed with the laughs are places of pathos and sadness that put a lump in my throat as he filled in the pre-Drew Carey blanks with careers as a rock and roll drummer, a electrical parts assembler, an illegal-alien sheetrock hanger, stand-up comedian and actor. He pulls no punches in describing the worst of his drinking and drug use, and avoids sanctimony in discussing his eventual recovery; he is respectful to a fault of the traditions of the original 12-step recovery program...which he doesn't name --so I won't guess- but assures us it can be found near the front of most phone books...<br /><br />If you want a small shot of confidence in the resilience of the human spirit wrapped around the dreams that can be fulfilled by the enduring promise of the American dream: read this book. You'll get wonderful doses of both.
1439102813|4.0|I usually write about the books that impressed me in some way- good or bad, and I couldn't but share my thought on this one, because I feel it's really important to let people know about it, read it, think about it and their lives.    This is not one of the books you love.  This is one of the books you appreciate exist. I highly recommend the book for the value of the author's experience shared on the pages,not for it's value as a piece of literature.    This is a book that every person should read, no matter personally affected or not by the disease and it's mandatory for the people who are experiencing the disease or have have relatives suffering from it.    However, the author is everything but a writer. The same topic would be better written by many other writers, without the scientific knowledge Lisa Genova offers. The characters are not likable and in places I felt like she treated them unfairly by forcing them to act unnaturally. This I think is due to a lack of experience in writing, maybe her next book will be better, who knows, but I really hope she writes with a co-author that writes better than her. She can contribute immensely to understanding the disease, but although you can see her compassion for the people who suffer from it, she can't recreate it in writing.    Her characters are mechanic, the emotions are like statements, overall the book feels like a raw material. Which is not necessary bad, if she improves her way of writing.    The book was engaging most of the time, although sometimes I felt like the author included scenes that she even wasn't sure why, just for the purpose of having them. They didn't build the character or benefit the book in any way.    The book is like one of those not-sugarcoated pills that you have to take and you know it's going to make you better ( and give you understanding in this case), but you'll have to taste the bitter wrapper of it.    Read it! You won't regret it!  Even if it's not the best piece of literature you've read, it might be the book that will change you forever!
0385340575|3.0|I came across the Jack Reacher series several years ago and have read them all, to the extant that I even purchase them in hard cover when they are published. However, I'm overdoing it. Yes, Jack Reacher is cool; yes, I would like to have Jack or someone like Jack as a friend; No, Jack is no pansy, not even close. He knows justice, he knows punishment and is not afraid to dish it out. Jack is however, somewhat repetitive. Jack needs a change of scenery or rather make that lifestyle. Settle down Jack, get married, enough of those one night stands of one to a book. jack, you're not getting any younger. Learn to grow old gracefully. Surely there must be something you can do besides wandering around the country, finding trouble without even trying, and not carrying any belongings. That's another thing. Jack, you mean to say you don't need any meds at all; your lifestyle has blessed you with only getting shot or stabbed or blown up but never high blood pressure or bunions or how about a rash?  Your teeth can't be that good in spite of the fact that you carry a toothbrush with you (but no toothpaste). I like you Jack; I wish you were my pal regardless of the fact that we would rarely even see each other. However, time to change the scenario. Your calculating mind and innate ability to disassemble villains in a few swift moves is bound to run out of steam one of these days. You can't out think or out run a well aimed bullet. Time to move on, but this time to a new horizon, something with staying power, i.e., the power to make you stay. Don't misunderstand me Jack, you can ride this wave for a long time, even have your children and grandchildren take up where you leave off but.... is that what you really want to do? I like you a lot Jack, now let me respect you, not as a superhero, but as a literary character who submits to normality, experiencing angst, pimples, farts, and all the aches and pains that go with being human.

0307269981|3.0|Who likes reading about sex, violent crime, and wealthy people with important sounding jobs-who wouldn't? The second book in Larsson's `Millennium' series delivers another bouquet of reminders as to why we'll never stop enjoying crime fiction. There's the domineering women and their ambivalent trophy husbands, a taser-happy protagonist looking to zap `the evil' out of those caught disrespecting women, and a healthy quota of lustily severed body parts. Who knew Sweden could be so much fun?<br /><br />Infact, somewhere between Millennium Magazine's big story/expose on the illegal Eastern-European sex slave-trade and parallel investigations into the execution-style murders which ensue, I began to wonder, why am I the only one who seems to be enjoying themselves?<br /><br />These are the people who are living the good lives, after all, the glamorous and the glorious, you know the drill: Devoted cops, loaded skinheads, sexy hackers, impudent journalists. You'd think they'd be having the time of their lives out there humping each other in the streets of Stockholm. Why is that everyone in Larsson's world acts as if their cat just died? Don't believe me? In 569 pages this book contains only five smiles and one instance of laughter-yes I took a tally.<br /><br />What ever happened to the joy of ferociously tattooing lurid graffiti across the abdomen of the man who assaulted and raped you? The thrill of lying dazed while a prize-fighting boxer dukes it out with a painless ex-Soviet trained German behemoth? When did these people forget the sheer humor of newspapers labeling your rock band from college a `lesbian Satanist cult,' or taking some guy out for friendly drinks after confessing your repeated and ongoing couplings with his wife?<br /><br />This presents slightly more serious problems for our leading lady, Lisbeth Salander. Right away we feel bad for her-a terrifying childhood, a lonely disposition. Her social bewilderment and apparent hatred for nearly everything is crystal clear but ignored in terms of her massively neglected emotional life-despair taking on the form of narrative languor. How are we to tell the difference?<br /><br />The fact is, while Larsson certainly takes us for a wild ride I came away from this book feeling mildly depressed. Has Stockholm's desire for a clearly defined sense of social propriety become so intense that they can't stop for half a second and laugh at their weird lives or maybe just cry a bit when they feel like it? I hope not-it could just be the book.rms of her massively neglected emotional life-despair taking on the form of narrative languor. How are we to tell the difference?

B0019LY5IM|3.0|While I may a voice from the wilderness, let us take a look at the facts!    season one 24 episodes  season two 23 episodes  season three 22 episodes  season four 13 episodes (writer's strike year)    Fact #1 ABC said that there were to be 7 seasons, now reduced to six.  Fact #2 ABC said that they would increase the amount of episodes to make up for the shortness of season 4. NOT  Fact #3 ABC aired two \\"NEW\\" episodes in season 5 that were no more than \\"previously on lost\\"    season five 16 episodes.  add season 1-4 divide by four equals 20.5 episodes. By my math season five should have 21 episodes, or more.    ABC has mis-managed this series so badly.  For example: in an effort to get public viewers they started LOST 4 or 5 minutes early (cutting Dances with the Stars short) and many times ran into the next show late to get people watching a \\"NEW series.  If you watched season one and two, you'll remember the six week breaks, then in season two ABC decides to start showing the Tail section 2 weeks into the 6 week break???    My point: I love the series LOST, I watch it over and over.  I can't wait for the DVD release of season five.  But, at what a cost to the long time viewers of LOST.  Only to be diappointed with short seasons and no seventh season.    conclusion: Dallas always had 28-30 shows a season, for 14 yrs.  Well the series \\"24\\" runs 24 episodes, you get your bang for the buck there.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|The Yakuza (1974) is a superb west meets east crime drama, set in Japan involving the shadowy organized crime hierarchy known as the Yakuza.  Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) served in the army in postwar Japan, and is returning to the land of the rising sun, for the first time in over twenty years, to help his old army buddy George Tanner (Brian Keith), recover his kidnapped daughter.<br /><br />Today, many Americans are familiar with some elements of the Japanese culture, like martial arts, ninjas, samurai warriors, and the Yakuza.  Much less was known about such things in 1974, when versatile director Sidney Pollack took on this challenging project, where about 95% of the action was shot in Japan.  Working with a Japanese film crew, and communicating through a translator, it was most fortunate that Pollack had a solid screenplay to work from.<br /><br />Rather than an all out action film, The Yakuza, has a real story with many subtle undertones.  As Japanese beliefs are very different from those in the west, a certain amount of cultural education was made a part of the film.  The story begins in postwar Japan, where Harry Kilmer with the military police, saves the life of Eiko Tanaka (Keiko Kishi) a young widow struggling to survive with her daughter Hanako.  Harry loves Eiko, but she refuses to marry him.  In 1951, Eiko`s brother Ken (Takakura Ken), thought to have been killed in the war, miraculously returns from the dead.  Harry helps Eiko to buy a bar as a farewell gift, before returning to America.<br /><br />Kilmer returns to Japan with Dusty Hoeskstra (Richard Jordan), along for added muscle.  They are staying at the home of Oliver Wheat (Herb Edelman), another army buddy who chose to stay in Japan.  Harry has a warm reunion with Eiko, and Hanako (Christina Kokubo) who is now a young woman.  George Tanner, always a wheeler dealer, made a deal to deliver guns to Tono, a member of the Yakuza, Japan's mysterious version of the mafia.  Tono kidnaps Tanner's daughter, when the deal goes sour.  Ken Tanaka is now a martial arts instructor, but at one time was a member of the Yakuza.  Harry contacts Ken, to request his help in freeing Tanner's daughter.  Firearm ownership was largely prohibited in Japan, but Wheat is a collector, and provides Kilmer and Dusty with guns.  The rescue mission is successful, but lives are lost, setting in motion a series of violent and tragic events, and revealing a twenty year old secret.<br /><br />With powerful understated performances by Mitchum, and Takakura Ken, the situation slowly builds to an inevitable confrontation, that mixes traditional Japanese sword fighting with firearms.  The final battle between Ken, and Tono's Yakuza gang members is very deliberate, and well choreographed by Pollack.  Slower paced than a traditional Japanese fight, the scene is quite effective, as tension is allowed to build, and each kill can be appreciated more.<br /><br />Even after the fighting is done, the ancient Japanese belief in `giri' (obligation), and the importance of honor, which has been the motivation for much that has occurred, continues to be the protocol that must be followed.  Kilmer eventually comes to believe that `giri' applies even to him, and in a remarkable gesture, responds in the traditional Japanese fashion.  For some, the Japanese perspective may forever remain a mystery.<br /><br />Sidney Pollack's commentary is full of insights about the production of this unique film.  Working with a crew and some cast, that did not speak English, making a movie that is both poignant, and with impressive action sequences, is a notable achievement.  Pollack's honesty is striking, when he says that the film belongs to the 70's, and that he is uncertain if he would make the film today.  This was one of the early bridges between eastern and western mainstream studios, in the action/crime genre.  Very credible, with great performances by all, extremely well-written, with many cultural nuances that the average westerner may not appreciate, it is more than a violent shoot/slice `em up.  This is the first of several Pollack films to be scored by jazz great Dave Grusin, and he does a fine job of melding smooth jazz with Asian elements.<br /><br />Although Mitchum was capable of greatness, Pollack says that like a mule, at times took some coaxing to get the best out of him.  Fortunately it appears that Pollack provided that coaxing, as Mitchum's performance is stellar, without pretense, and always ringing true, with even his pronunciation of Japanese smooth and natural.  A period piece perhaps, but Pollack's film is quite the insightful masterpiece.may not appreciate, it is more than a violent shoot/slice `em up.

B0002KVULG|5.0|[...]. I just want to add my thoughts on what I think is the single most scary scene in a movie adaption of Bram Stoker's classic so far. The scene were Van Helsing and Seward confront what was once Mina, Van Helsing's daughter in the catacombs underneath the graveyard scared the living hell out of me when I was a kid. Too bad they drained the color from the movie in its new version...All of you who know the original will know what I mean. This scene sent me and my buddy vampire hunting on our local cemetery with self made wooden pickets. When we entered the cemetery gates after dusk some graveyard candles that very much reminded us of Mina's glowing eyes in that particular scene sent us running homeward, [...]...A true classic :o)
B000WEH74G|4.0|This is the most cerebral version of this story that I have seen. It eschews the action seen in other versions and focuses on mood and character. I find it superior to those other versions which devote much time to the assault on Kira's home. The film moves slowly, building to the second half of part 2 which is memorable and moving. It is a film that rewards the patient viewer. This movie has been difficult to find in a clear version and while the images are a little soft the subtitles in yellow (while not always in perfect English) are very easy to read.
B00005QGAX|4.0|Michael Jackson, as well as Quincy Jones (:D) did an awesome job on this album. Although I don't like better than Thriller, this album is much more mature. My favorites include:   1. Liberian Girl, a quiet storm ballad driven by Michael's smooth vocals  2. Another Part of Me, an R&B dance track that is exhilarated by Michael's effortless delivery  3. I Just Can't Stop Loving You, a heart-wrenching ballad sang beautifully between Siedah and Michael  4. Dirty Diana, a rock groove that showcases Michael's dynamic vocals, as well as Steve Stevens guitar playing  5. Fly Away, words can't describe. How did this song NOT make the cut?  This album is a distinguishing land-mark in Michael Jackson's repertoire, and remains the only album to have 5 #1's. Epic could have been the second title for the album, because that's what it truly is.

B001PPLJIQ|3.0|Warning: this review contains adult content. But that's okay, because you really can't get a grip on the Holocaust until you've had a gynecologist's eye view of Kate Winslet's privates.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" is pretentious cheese. It isn't honest enough to be straightforward soft-core coming-of-age porn, or to be a hard-hitting, revelatory Holocaust movie. Rather, it's a clunky and silly film that attempts to graft the one onto the other and succeeds at neither. \\"The Reader\\" brings the viewer in, and then teases him, with a half hour of almost uninterrupted simulated bodily functions, combined with nude bathing. It's all a great big, high school literature class metaphor about the washing off of guilt, dontcha know. Then \\"The Reader\\" devotes its remaining hours to scenes of well-dressed, attractive young Germans sitting around asking and declaring, \\"Who's guilty? Aren't all our parents guilty? I hate my parents.\\" Overlaying every boring, banal, scene and vapid line of dialogue with ponderous, self-important gas, \\"The Reader\\" ultimately succeeds at neither serious discussion nor eroticism.<br /><br />From top to bottom, the cast is first rate. David Kross is achingly poignant as teenager Michael Berg, who, in the 1950s, loses his virginity in an affair with Hanna Schmitz, a 36-year-old, former SS concentration camp guard. Kross is both intimately human and vulnerable and also larger than life and every bit the compelling, big screen movie star. In that he reminds the viewer of the young Peter O'Toole. May Kross have a long and bountiful career.<br /><br />In the \\"deleted scenes\\" reel on the DVD, there are three fine scenes that could have served as centers of three fine movies. In the most gripping, Thomas Thieme is a truck driver who gives Kross a ride on a backwoods road where a large horse is transporting logs. Thieme is repulsive, so terrifying, and also clearly human and in need of understanding. In another deleted scene, in a conversation with his professor (the always brilliant Bruno Ganz) an attractive German boy admits that his father was an SS guard. In a third deleted scene, a prisoner painstakingly learns to read in a prison cell. That these three fabulous scenes were deleted, while endless scenes of nude bathing were kept, informs you of the filmmakers' eye on the box office.<br /><br />In the DVD commentary, the film's director Stephen Daldry, CBE (Commander of the British Empire), script writer David Hare, and novelist Bernhard Schlink smugly pat themselves on the back. Wearing professorial clothing, tweeds and nubbly sweaters, these graying white men express how mah-velous, perfectly mah-velous it is that they've made such a big, fat, profound film that will finally get people to engage in some serious thought about the Holocaust. Significantly, they never mention a single other of the, by now, millions of works of art that got to the topic before they did, nor do they ever address their pimping out Kate Winslet's privates to make their contribution to the body of Holocaust lit stand out.<br /><br />Check out online discussions of \\"The Reader.\\" Most threads are devoted to such deep and heavy topics as clinically detailed examinations of the tautness and firmness, pendulousness or sag of Kate Winslet's privates, the straightness or curvature and length of David Kross', the specific acts that the characters engage in, and what bodily orifices are employed.<br /><br />This review is not a protest against erotica; it's a protest against BS. This review isn't even a protest against the disturbingly burgeoning subgenre of Holocaust porn. In fact there is a brilliant, scathing, unforgettable scene in \\"Schindler's List\\" where Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) menaces his Jewish slave, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) as she bathes in a cramped basement. That scene is so powerful and unforgettable because it has two things \\"The Reader\\" completely lacks: psychological insight - the viewer knowsexactly who Goeth and Hirsch are and what their relationship is to each other, and, thus, complexity and depth, and stylistic sophistication - Goeth does all the talking.

B0029LHW4U|3.0|Fans have no business saying what kind of music artists can create or what name they should use. I have no problem with the remaining members recording a new album with a new vocalist. That being said, Black Gives Way to Blue doesn't sound like an Alice in Chains album to me. To me, Alice in Chains is a tortured, haunting, depressed sound that gets in your head, but still feels really good to listen to. The new album has a lot of the same type riffs and vocal harmonies, but is only similar on the surface. Duvall's a great singer, but his voice does not touch any of the qualities that in my opinion are vital to Alice in Chains' sound and vibe. I agree with the person who said this is like the Doors replacing Jim Morrison. I think the album has a lot of good moments, and is better than most current mainstream rock, but doesn't work for me overall because too much is missing in the atmosphere department.

He is also very verbose and talks about many random things that are unrelated to the topic of the book. The arguments look like obvious attempts to make money by deceiving the general public. By far, one of the poorest books I've read in a long time.
B00004RJ71|5.0|From the Beginning to end, this ranks as one of the best films to come out of the \\"hood\\".  It deals with street life, drugs, and Prison.  The storyteling is fabulous, and the actors all take their roles to heart.  There are some scenes which are graphic, but that makes it a good fit, because just when you think the movie is taking a dive into Drama, it hits you with some great action scenes.  Car chases, fist fights, stabbings and the like, all are found here.  If you don't buy it, it is your loss, but give it a chance, it is well worth it.
1400063515|4.0|When I reviewed Taleb's other book, Fooled By Randomness, I gave it 3 stars and later I thought I probably was too harsh. It was an important and interesting book but it just made me feel less than delighted. I figured it deserved a 4 probably even though it's innovative subject was easily a 5. I figured I could put things right by giving The Black Swan a 5. But again, the same thing happened. Basically Fooled By Randomness and The Black Swan could be considered two volumes of the same work. Taleb's premise is, in my humble opinion, pretty much right. He believes that \\"modern\\" statistical thinking is deeply flawed and little more than an intellectual scam. It takes a lot of guts to tell everybody in the self-appointed group of smartest people that they're being very dense and Taleb has what it takes to shrug off criticism. But after 300 or so pages, it just gets somewhat tedious. I don't hate his writing style and I tried to find the good in it just because I support people doing things differently, but by the end, you get the feeling that if we condensed this book to a kindergarten level, it would simply say \\"You're a pooface! Stop picking on me!\\" Now, you'll notice that I can just offer up vague criticism of this book. Well, how do you think I got in the mood to do that? Yes, this book is a textbook on whining. However, I can say that what he's trying to say is rather important. If you work with statistics, he's right, there's a great chance you're doing it wrong. That's pretty amazing really. But I don't think Taleb deserves some kind of heroic credit. I too noticed that something didn't seem quite right with the ordinary textbook version of statistical forecasting tools as I'm sure did many others. Taleb seems simply more confident in it than usual. What he doesn't offer, which I must say would be really cool, is a helpful alternative. All he's saying is, sorry guys, this knowing the future stuff is actually a bit harder than your statistics professor made it seem. Ok. Got it. The fact that the book is shockingly snobby doesn't help me get excited about the topic and towards the end, I was getting a little worn out reading it. I mention this because I think Taleb had tried to use a literary style to set himself apart from the opaque academics he has open contempt for. That's all well and good, but if someone's going to do that, my preference would be for a comic book form or an interpretive dance or *anything* before I'd want to see the material presented in the snobbiest way possible. I will say that it's certainly not typical. The book approaches an important topic. It does so in an unconventional way. However, it doesn't offer much in the way of a useful next step so it sort of lacks that aesthetic elegance the author seemed to want to impart. You don't make a book like this elegant by complaining in a fancy tone. You do so by showing the current situation wrong by offering a better one. Taleb would say that the current system is so wrong that just not doing anything would be better than current techniques. While I have a lot of skepticism, I'm not convinced that current techniques are so utterly useless that this book is as great as the author thinks.em. Ok. Got it.

The plot was intriguing and extremely unique, as was the author's voice.  Blomkvist and Salander seemed so real and were very likable, probably because they are not your typical hero and heroine.  I hope that the movie is made available to the US soon (w/ English subtitles) even though it could not possibly replicate the book.  A very satisfying read.  It is so sad that the praise and recognition for this author's work is posthumous.

Easy return with Amazon but am a little miffed that they still have not corrected this listing.  I can see from the postings that I'm not the only person that this happened to.  I mentioned the issue in my return as well as the fact that they try and pair it up with convincing you to buy a set of 3D glasses.  Glad I didn't fall for that as well since I thought the movie was to come with four glasses.  Anyway, cannot review movie as I haven't seen it but buyer beware if you are trying to get the 3D version!

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is the best depiction of men at war in the Infantry I have ever seen. Like real war, there is triumph and tragedy, and even humor. Without hollywood glorifiction, it shows the fatigue, mud & terror of war and yet presents the personalities that somehow gel into a unit, with men bonding to each other and to the unit in order to accomplish the units goals as a team.    The combat action is very realistic, and diverse personalities and their interactions very dramatic, and sometimes even funny just like real life.    The historical events depicted are true and accurate in their presentation.
1592401791|5.0|This is a great telling of the Fab Four at work in the studio and the recording process itself.  Short on gossip and lurid tales this book sticks to the facts and mainly covers the recording sessions and how they made those great tunes.  I'm amazed that Geoff has such detail after so many years but his descriptions match up with other sorces that I have researched.  Love the part about Lennon racing into the studio and hammering out the intro to Obla Di Obla Da in an apparently altered state of mind ... very funny!  The group dynamics was very telling and descriptive ... Paul the perfectionist and driven task master, John the passionate but, at times, intolerant and impatient one, George the quiet and loyal soldier (until the end when he took on a more assertive guise) and Ringo, well Ringo is as you would expect him to be. Great book - highly recommended.  Geoff, I'm glad you were there to record all those details.

0385504225|3.0|The book arrived in great condition and I have just finished reading it....not a good as the DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons, but still a good read.
0375413405|5.0|Whether you enjoy cooking or just enjoy reading about cooking, this is a great book. After seeing the movie, I immediately went online to purchase the book. I do enjoy cooking; but if I never prepare one of the recipes in the book, it was still worth the purchase price.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent miniseries on the life of John Adams, his wife Abigail, and other founding fathers of the United States. Great supplement to U.S. History classes or improving personal knowledge of the progression from the original 13 colonies to westward growth and the development of our nation. Included in this series are historical references to major players of the Declaration of Independence,the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Thomas Paine.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Interestingly, Joss Whedon and Co. have created something that works on 1) an internet level, 2) a television level, and 3) a musical level. It was originally released on the internet in small chunks, similar to the \\"blog\\" of the title. But it is best watched on the DVD, where you can enjoy the larger picture -- and the hidden gems all over the piece -- and play the music through a larger home theater setup. Finally, Joss gets musicals in a way that no other current songwriter/musical-composer does. Around the time of Rodgers and Hammerstein, plot and song began to get mixed together in ways never before attempted, and it changed the face of musical theater forever. Joss Whedon understands how to weave plot throughout his songs, and that elevates this and the other Whedon musicals above most other current attempts at musical theater on the big and small screen (High School Musical, Fame, Glee).    That said, the unfortunate thing about this musical is how short it is. Maybe we need a second round? The songs are spectacular, the singing is wonderful, and the plot is vintage Joss Whedon. Highly recommended.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|This is a great biography of a truly gifted artist. It brings Paris to life in both its grand side and its seamy side.  It is a pg movie with a lot of information about laTrec and also the times and the reasons for his art and his death.  If you like Jose Ferrer, it is one of the two greatest movies in which he ever starred.  His other great movie is \\"Cyrano de Bergerac.\\"
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|After seeing this album performed live, I have to modify my originally sub-par review/rating of the CD. It's a solid 4.5 stars. It's got tremendous range and feeling - something that becomes much more clear when you see them do it live. Simply amazing.

B00129H7VS|5.0|Hi-def makes a big difference. I saw the marathon on regular cable TV and Blu-ray is definitely a lot better. Some scenes look like you're looking through a window or you're right there in the action. I don't buy a lot of DVDs but this def is worth the collection.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|Following their classic Leviathan (2004) and Blood Mountain (2006), Mastodon is back with Crack The Skye. Mastodon proves again why they are considered one of the greatest metal (prog-metal?) bands of today. Once again, the songs and feel of the album share some similarities with their previous record, so you recognize that this is a Mastodon album, but on the other hand, the direction and overall result is so different, that you wonder if it's a different band. I guess the word here is evolution.    The musicianship is superb. Guitar, bass and drums playing are top notch. Complex compositions, epic songs. The vocals are not on the \\"thrash/scream\\" side, on the contrary, they are clean, and again very different from what you could expect from this band.    Overall there is an eerie feeling to this album. Listen to the first track \\"Oblivion\\" and see if you don't feel the chills. The atmosphere remembers some kind of a long lost science fiction movie.    Now that Mastodon finally complete their \\"elements\\" albums (Remission = Fire; Leviathan = Water; Blood Mountain = Earth; Crack the Skye = Air), I'm eager to see and hear what they do next.
0691142165|5.0|Reinhart and Rogoff have managed to put together the most comprehensive review of the global financial crises with their characteristic sharp and scholarly insights.    This book provides academic and non-academic circles with tons of stylized facts about financial crises, debt crises, bunk runs, currency collapses, episodes of financial contagion and much more.    I specially like their study on the domestic dimension of the sovereign debt problem.    I definitively recommend this book...academics, policy makers, and anyone interested in international finance should have this book close at hand.

0394401522|5.0|In this day and age where we're constantly being convinced that 'old ways are bad' and 'technology' and 'new ways' are better, this book proves the complete opposite.  Good old-fashioned cooking as taught by Julia Childs gives you exquisite flavors and experiences and wholesome food, and there is true joy in following Julia Childs' recipes.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this book for the next 100 years!

I did level1 and was dripping with sweat within minutes.  The rest of the day I was so sore, in the good way.  I used muscles not normally used.  I have been using it for 3 weeks.  I do level 2 now, but it is tough.  I am scared of level3.  Try it out.  Jillian is inspiring and it is 20 minutes and makes you feel great for the rest of the day.  Go For It!!!
B0027REDK2|5.0|At long last, the Rio album is released in a format that allows you to program your CD player (or download your Ipod) with the complete version of the album that we in the US and Canada listened to in 82/83. Personally, I could never listen to the UK version issued on CD a few years ago. It just wasn't the same album.    And while you could cobble together most of the US version from various albums/compilations released over the years, as far as I know, up until now, the 5:33 version of Save a Prayer, and the US Remix of Lonely in Your Nightmare, were not available on CD.  They're both here, along with both US versions of Hungry Like the Wolf (the original US album version and the much better Night Version).    Sound quality is tremendous. It does seem like the US Remixes may have been taken from a vinyl copy, however; you can clearly hear noise at the beginning of Lonely in Your Nightmare and Rio; compare this to the absence of such noise in the UK versions.  But even if that is the case, the sound quality is still pretty good, and well beyond that of the vinyl copies from the 80's.
0385504225|1.0|This is a very disappointing book. The pace is slow and filled with repeating patterns of dialog and plot.  I generally don't expect much from a Dan Brown book and he exceeded my expectations.  When you get to the end of this book, you can't help but wonder why so much was made of this so called 'Secret'.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Way underrated TV serie and from far my favorite one : awesome main scenario, great music, lot of humor, awesome ideas for episodes scenarios, main actors are really making fun playing. Still laughing inside when I think about Dean screaming like a little girl...  This 4th season is a little bit darker than previous one.  I live in france and now have to wait about 1 year til now for next one to be available as import on Amazon.com, argh.
0061766089|5.0|The first part of Change by Design provides a high level introduction to the process of design with concrete examples of these processes interspersed throughout. All of these examples come from industry, particularly, clients of IDEO, the company that the author is the CEO of. I felt that the concepts, as presented, were easy to understand and became all the more clear when coupled with the examples mentioned above. The author's enthusiasm for the usefulness of design is infectious. I felt eager to try out the concepts presented such as: creating prototypes, freeing oneself from stereotypical thinking by doing research on the needs of the community being designed for, telling stories, and finally play acting the part of the consumer. The next part of the book the author wonders where the design process can be brought to next. He finds the coupling of entrepreneurship and design to be especially fruitful. He mentions, for example, Aravind, which offers health care to people in India at an affordable price. Everything Aravind does is designed to decrease cost without diminishing the quality of care. The author emphasizes that these efforts are not charity, rather, they are full fledged, profit making companies. What makes them stand out though is their emphasize on improving quality of life through entrepreneurship coupled with design. I feel that the combination of the authors' enthusiasm for his work, clear presentation of ideas, ample examples and focus on what could be the future of design made this book a very enlightening read and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the tenets of, and future of, the design process.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|Not a whole lot to add, except to say that I agree with most of the three-star reviews, simply because this album is merely OK to good, which is acceptable I guess for most bands, but not for PT. This band has the unenviable task of meeting their own standard with each release. Not to say this is a bad album...oh no. You have to understand where PT fans are coming from; we realize this band's worst effort will shine next to many bands' best, but there is a frustration here that for me, is based on Wilson's need to spread himself out to other projects. When I hear a great track like Once (from the lack-lustre Blackfield II) I can't help but believe that Wilson's best efforts aren't focused on PT anymore IMO. It is Wilson's band and his prerogative, but a tightly focused PT album is so much better than the several so-so side projects and maudlin solo attempt.
0385504225|3.0|After six years, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" -- author Dan Brown's long-awaited followup to his highly controversial international best-seller, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" -- was released Sept. 15 by Doubleday Books. The book continues Brown's penchant for puzzles, conspiracies and arcane history, offering fans exactly what they've come to expect from his novels ... and nothing more.  Like all four of Brown's previous novels, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" follows symbologist Robert Langdon, as he's called to deliver a last -minute lecture in Washington D.C. It doesn't take long for Langdon to realize the real reason he was summoned, pulling him into a national security conflict that has him running for his life.  Anyone familiar with Brown's predictable prose style will not be surprised with his latest work. Much of formula behind \\"The Lost Symbol\\" has been copied from books like \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"   Once again Langdon is called upon for his unique knowledge of symbols and secret societies. Here we replace Paris (or Rome) with Washington D.C.; Opus Dei (or the Illuminiati) with Freemasons; Sophie Neveu (or Vittoria Vetra) with Katherine Solomon, and Jacques Sauniere (or Leonardo Vetra) with Peter Solomon. Likewise, the archetype of Silas -- the pale-skinned albino assassin from \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" -- is equally represented in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" in the form of the grotesquely tattooed Mal'akh.  Brown is often panned by critics for going back to the same formula again and again, and he makes no attempt to prove them wrong in \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" Say what you will, though, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" alone has more than 80 million copies in print, and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" has an additional 5.6 million copies (2 million reportedly sold in its first week). Movies based upon his books have made $1.2 billion worldwide, and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is already planned to hit theaters in 2012. Dan Brown is worth an estimated $350 million.   These are not the credits of an unsuccessful author.  As formulaic as his books may in fact be, they are no less exciting. Fans accept his predictable formula in exchange for feeding their love of intricate puzzles, conspiracies, secret societies, and odd historical facts (like knowing that the practice of wearing neckties came from Roman orators who wore them to keep their throats warm before speaking). The story picks up quickly and his trademark short chapters help keep the reader turning pages, unable to set the book down.  What really sets \\"The Lost Symbol\\" apart from Langdon's earlier adventures is that it's far more philosophical than we've seen before. The story focuses largely on man's relationship with God. It's less about outward answers and more about looking for God inside ourselves and man's own apotheosis. This philosophical turn may catch some readers off guard.  What disappointed me most about \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was simply that I didn't feel like it lived up to its predecessor. Honestly, how could it?   I was hoping for even more strange tidbits about our nation's capital, its history, and our political system. There certainly was a lot of that here, but not nearly as much as I had expected. I also didn't feel the threat was as menacing as it was in \\"Da Vinci\\" or \\"Angels.\\"   It takes the reader more than 400 pages to learn what the national security threat is (I felt it was overstated), and then it's quickly played out within the next 20 pages. To be fair, the national security threat isn't what keeps readers interested anyway. It's more of a secondary plot. The final 50 pages of the book are reserved for bringing closure to the characters themselves, without any conflict, mystery, danger, or controversy. It's a rather slow, boring, and anti-climactic process. It took me just as long to read the last 15 pages as it took to read the previous 495 because I was so bored I set it down and walked away for a few days.  Though not nearly as good as his previous novels, if you're already a fan of Dan Brown's endlessoddities and can accept him for what he is, you probably will enjoy his latest work. If, however, you have trouble suffering his predictable, formulaic, and anticlimactic habits, you'll find little solace here.   \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is little more than an unapologetic regurgitation of what Dan Brown does best. Love it or leave it.    PORTSMOUTH DAILY TIMES  Portsmouth, Ohio; Oct. 9, 2009
B002JTMNX2|4.0|First of all, this album was just released last week exclusively at Walmart and sells for $12.00 there, so unless you don't have access to a Walmart, don't get gouged on the price here at Amazon. Now, as for the album, to start with, it's a CD of new material, plus a CD of remastered Foreigner hits, and finally, a DVD of Foreigner live in concert, with backstage interviews included. Three discs for $12.00 is pretty freakin' hard to beat. Say what you will about Walmart, but when these bands (like Foreigner, Kiss, Journey, the Eagles, etc.) sign these exclusive deals with Walmart, the customers REALLY benefit from it in terms of \\"bang for your buck\\".<br /><br />So anyway, CD 1 is the disc of all new material. For me, it's kind of hit & miss. There are 13 tracks on the disc, and I was surprised that 5 of them are ballads. I'm not really a ballad fan, but I did like \\"I\\"ll Be Home Tonight\\". As to the more uptempo stuff, the musicianship is top notch all the way, and unlike a lot of CDs coming out these days, this one doesn't have the volume cranked up to 11. I think that is SOOOOOO annoying, and takes away from the music terribly (of course, I think some bands NEED to have emphasis taken off the music, and that might be why they crank it up). But the sound is clean, level, and very well done. I've only listened to the CD one time through, but I think the first 2 tracks, \\"Can't Slow Down\\" and \\"In Pieces\\" stand out the most to me so far. There's nothing revolutionary in this new material, it's just the classic Foreigner sound, and it still sounds great, I just don't think the songs themselves really stand out.<br /><br />Disc 2 is 10 of Foreigner's biggest hits, including \\"Feels Like the First Time\\", \\"Hot Blooded\\", \\"Double Vision\\", \\"Dirty White Boy\\", \\"Head Games\\" & \\"Urgent\\". I was thinking these would be rerecorded versions of the originals, with Kelly Hansen on lead vocal, but they're actually Lou Gramm's original vocals. At first, this may not seem like much of an offering, but this remastering and remixing REALLY sounds great. I think it sounds better than any other remastering I've ever heard on any other album. It actually kind of caught me off guard to hear how sharp and well-defined everything sounded. It sounds so good, it really almost reinvents the song. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard it myself. I was blown away with how good this sounded, compliments of Marti Frederiksen.<br /><br />Disc 3 is a 10 song DVD of Foreigner live in concert around Europe. Once again, the production is top-notch, and I know it's a cliche, but seriously, the band sounds better than I've ever heard them. Hansen, Tom Gimbel, Jeff Pilson, Michael Bluestein, Brian Tichy, and the always underappreciated legend Mick Jones not only sound great live, but in their backstage interviews, they're all very laid back, with no \\"rock & roll posing\\" going on. They all come off as regular guys, very candid, mature, and aware of who they are and what Foreigner is meant to be. And they're all fine with it. There's something to be said for people who are comfortable in their own skin, and these guys appear that way. The highlight of the concert DVD is the song \\"Say You Will\\". This is not a song most people think of when they think of Foreigner, but it has always been one of my favorites, and I never really thought it could be improved upon. I was wrong. For me, that performance alone makes this set worth buying. These guys don't just rock, they can strip down and harmonize, and this version of \\"Say You Will\\" proves it.<br /><br />So I gave the album 4 stars, but it should probably be 4-and-a-half. The DVD and the remastered/remixed hits CD makes up for the \\"iffy\\" CD of new material. A few more listens might swing me into a 5 star rating, but if not, this set is STILL worth owning, without a second thought.

6305428042|4.0|Halloween around the corner, and so can these cinematic classics be far behind: THE EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET... and HOCUS POCUS? Well, okay, HOCUS POCUS isn't quite regarded as a vintage spinetingler, but I saw this when I was younger and more impressionable - and imprinting must've set in - because I sort of dig this movie. And this in spite of my not being a fan of Bette Midler.<br /><br />This is a Disney venture, so while the film flirts with spooky, it doesn't really come close to giving up legitimate scares. Bette Midler takes center stage as the oldest of three sister witches, the Sandersons, plying their witchy trade back in 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. In the midst of sucking the life force from a young girl, the Sanderson sisters are caught out by the outraged townspeople and promptly hanged. But not before Winifred (Midler) casts a last-second spell.<br /><br />300 years pass, and it's now the present (or, at least, 1993). The Sanderson sisters have become an urban legend, their alarming tale recounted down the centuries on many an armchair on All Hallow's Eve. Teen newcomer Max scoffs at all this, maybe because he's just moved from hip and jaded Los Angeles and he's just cool like that. Max is one of those irritating kids I've grown to dislike very much. He's here pretty much because the film needs a plot device to bring back the witches. Max is one of those surly alienated teens who'll do exactly what he's cautioned not to do. Trying to impress the rich local teen hottie, he lights the Black-Flamed Candle on Halloween night, the one single act which could resurrect the Sanderson sisters. So the daughters of darkness are back, and they're still looking to inhale the life forces from children. And the annoying Max, his likable younger sister, and the rich local teen hottie are all that stand between blah blah blah.<br /><br />HOCUS POCUS has become a cult flick over the past years. It certainly gets its share of airplay on the Disney Channel. There's enough of what could make little kids shiver here (Midler brings just enough malice to her role), and yet that's mitigated by Sarah Jessica Parker's cute dimbulb character (even if she does like to munch on bugs) and Kathy Najimy's irrepressibly cheery, child-sniffing performance. Much of the humor comes from the Sandersons being confounded by and trying to adapt to their new environs. Nothing underscores this more than that scene in which the Sanderson sisters think they've just met Satan. And, by the way, it's a bit disturbing having brother and sister Garry (dressed as Satan) and Penny Marshall playing an old married couple. But it's this sense of disorientation on the sisters' part which gives the kids a fighting chance, as Max comes up with several trick-'em-sideways ploys. He's annoying but, dammit, he's plucky, too.<br /><br />Bette Midler gets a chance to bust a tune, singing her own rollicking rendition of \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\" Sarah Jessica Parker is ethereal as she sings a snippet of the haunting \\"Come, Little Children.\\" I really wanted to hear more of that song.<br /><br />HOCUS POCUS having been released in 1993, its special effects are understandably no match for the fancy stuff in, say, the Harry Potter flicks. But it's not that bad for its time. Plus there's Thackery Binx, the talking colonial black cat.<br /><br />How much do I like this movie?  Enough to have that one incantation memorized, the one that transformed Thackery into an immortal feline: \\"Twist the bones and bend the back. Trim him of his baby fat. Give him fur black as black Just. Like. Thisssss...\\" Why, that's practically Shakespeare-like.Disney Channel.

031604461X|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with Breaking Dawn. The fact that Stephenie Meyers has referenced Romeo and Juliet, Wuthering Heights, and Merchant of Venice should have been a clue! I loved this series. I know a lot of people were disgusted by the battle that should have been. To them I say, hello!!!, were you paying attention to the first 3 books? Bella has always been compassionate, loving, and a sacrificing care-giver. I think Stephenie put in enough foreshadowing...the hints were there, did you pick up on them? I didn't, and I analyze regularly as part of my job! I laughed with the characters, and I cried when I thought there was no way out. I also took the time to visit the author's website for her explainations and backstory. Do I do this for every book? No, only those whose characters have captured my affection. Stephenie Meyer is no J.K. Rowlings; but she never claimed to be. Her writing has grown with the stories, and she gave me the closure I needed while leaving room for more adventures down the line. What more could you ask for???
B000ICXQF6|4.0|I don't write spoiler reviews. It's an OK film. Don't expect Armageddon-quality cinematography. It's lower budget. There are some holes in the plot development. There's also a huge blooper involving the central plot. However, I dig Brucie, & the female lead has pretty eyes... It's enjoyable. I give it a B/B-. Pitt actually does some acting in this. I normally can't stand that guy. Here, his character is pretty funny, though. The director had to have that game \\"Barrel Full Of Monkeys\\" when he was a kid. You'll see. Peace.
1556347308|5.0|you can start and end with just this book. Along with the wealth of free community and online support for GURPS, this is the most economic, broadest, and the most consolidated RPG system out there.

Less separate compartmentalization between your gaming life, studies, work, other hobbies, social skills and humanistic observation. You can just take the world as you see it and throw into this Game System as an RPG.     No other systems can do it this way, as well. You can work with a telescopic level of detail: shifting from high granularity to abstract the way your story telling forma dictates.

031606792X|4.0|WARNING;  SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY READ THIS BOOK.  I rarely write reviews but after I read so many hate filled reviews of disappointment in this final book I thought I would add my thoughts.  I just began the Twilight series 9 days ago and despite having to work 12 hour days 5 of those 9 days, I finished all four in this time frame.  The books are spellbinding and just draws you in, with me often choosing to finish a chapter rather than sleep.  So of course I began Breaking Dawn- the final book with sheer joy and excitement and was NOT disappointed.  The bigges criticism I see is that the ending was just too perfect, but after the never ending dramas of their love story was a fairytale ending to much too ask?  Must every great love story be bittersweet?  We gladly suffered the unbearable lows with Bella and Edward, can we not rejoice in their highs.  The next biggest complaints seems to be the feeling that the author contradicted herself.  Example one is that newborns are highly dangerous and need a year or two to adjust, and suddendly Bella comes out a perfect newborn with complete control.  Well the newborns they previously saw were created without their own desire to become a vampire.  Whereas Bella spent two yrs preparing for this, I thought Edward put it best when he said Bella was making Jasper question everything about himself and whether the newborn behavior was simply a given or more a matter of choice.  I mean you wake up after 2-3 days of unbearable pain and suddenly someone has changed your whole life and there is NO going back- I would be pissed too, whereas, Bella begged for this and woke up not confused and uncertain what to do with these emotions.  She had a loving family there she had spent two yrs loving, I hardly doubt the other newborns had this.  Furthermore, did newborn Carlise not do the very same thing bc he CHOSE to displine himself and do it. And you cant say vampires dont have that ability to choose- did the entireCullen family not choose to hunt totally differently than the norm.  Example two was that it had previously been said that vampires only have venom in thier body, so how could Edward have sperm to impregnant Bella.  Well since vampires usually mate with vampires the ability to realize they still have sperm would have been lost and since the characters had to go to the wilderness of south america to find another hybrid child, obviously this is not common- but to say it is unbelievable is unfair.  Now I am not going to say it is my favorite of the four, I did miss a lot of Edward's raw, passionate expressions of his love for Bella as were in the other three,  I thought too much time was spent on showing all the preparation for the fight, I thought all the development of Jacob and Leah's relationship was not cohesive to the story in that in the end we never really knew what became of her and whether or not Jacob would continue his pack or just stay with Nesse- but we can assume.  I was not the biggest fan of having it told from Jacob's point of view for a large portion of the book, but since Bella was on her death bed- it was nice having eyes look in on her to tell the story.  But even with those things it was still a great book and in my humble opinion left open for even another story as Nesse grows up and the Venturi comes back for another showdown or whatever Ms. Meyer may decide and I would happily read that book too.
B001EL6EH2|5.0|Already one of my favorite films. Great in Blu-Ray and the photo book, mini posters, passport case and luggage tag made it a super buy. Get it while you can!!
B001UW58YU|5.0|Josh has done it again!  Brought together great guests and wonderful, moving music.<br />His music is something to experience not only with the ears but with the eyes.  His humor and passion come through so strongly you feel the music as well.<br />I especially love Lucia Micarelli's skill on the violin.  Her version of Kashmir is one everyone should hear!<br />Overall, the DVD of the live concert fulfills a need for those who are unable to attend a concert.  Of course nothing is better than live but this DVD/blu-ray comes really close.
0385504225|5.0|This book never fails to entertain and keeps you at the edge. I'd say just as good as the Da Vinci code, if not, better. A well put together story and plot. Bold, exciting characters and enough detail in the plot to make it believable. For me, it was a page turner, I couldn't put it down!
031606792X|5.0|Wanted  the fourth book was ecstatic to receive, great condition, enjoyed the book.   Will not tell you about the book  There is only one part I was a let down with.  Their first 'encounter', no information, now I know this is for teenagers, but their encounter later down the road, much better. So if it could be done later, why not before?  Hmm.....thats all.  If you want more details, there are other reviews that will give you that.

1563899426|5.0|Bill Willingham's &quot;Fables&quot; is the most interesting concept in comics I've seen in the last few years.  &quot;Fables&quot; is right up there with Vaughan's &quot;Y The Last Man&quot; and &quot;Ex Machina.&quot;  The artwork by Lan Medina and Steve Leialoha is outstanding; it's detailed  and realistic.  The art moves the story along without being distracting.  Like all other Vertigo titles, it is not recommended for children - as an adult I find Fables extremely entertaining.<br /><br />Fabletown is a part of Manhattan where people and creatures from traditional fairy tales have gone into exile to escape &quot;the Adversary&quot; who has invaded their kingdoms.  The concept sounds childish and almost silly, but Willingham treats it in a very intelligent, edgy way.  These old fairy tales were actually quite gruesome when you look at them through an adult lens.  Moving the Fables from their own milieu to the world of modern Manhattan raises the stakes even further.  Like other great science-fiction, the author addresses real issues.<br /><br />Volume 1 is a murder mystery that introduces us to the cast of characters and tells us why they are in Fabletown.  The story moves along fast enough that it doesn't feel like the exposition that it really is.  Along the way, we find out how a smattering of detail of how they came to leave their homelands.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Off to Volume 2!

0545123267|3.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I enjoy the fantasy myths of vampires and werewolves and a good star-crossed romance is hard to beat.  Unfortunately, I feel like this book fell flat both in its interpretation of the myth of werewolves and in the romantic sense.  I never really connected with the anguish of the main characters, Grace and Sam, and then it felt like the ending was completely glossed over.  This story left me wanting more, but not in a good way.  I felt like all the reading I'd done for the past 390 pages had only left me unfulfilled.<br /><br />There were a lot of loose ends throughout the course of this story.  Items that should've required more explanation were ignored and then other areas were described in great detail (sometimes twice in one paragraph or on one page).  This book had a lot of potential, but at the end of the day it just felt like a piece that was produced quickly to accommodate the growing desire for teen fantasy romance novels in the marketplace - not for quality or true originality of plot.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Paramore keeps getting better with each album.  Their third album, Brand New Eyes, is simply amazing.  Hayley's vocals are top notch and she really puts them on display here.  The album is a good mix of hard rocking anthems sprinkled with a couple softer ballads.  Favorite song so far is Brick By Boring Brick but there isn't a single song on here that I don't love.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This product was shipped even faster than expected, arrived in excellent shape and worked without a hitch. I recommend it highly.
0593051580|3.0|Yep, I'm going to sit on the fence with this one and give it three stars. The reasons in a for and against format are as follows;<br /><br />In the positive we get the great enthusiasm of the author for his subject and the fact that he has a naval background has allowed him to capture many aspects of nautical wayfaring quite well and with some verve. Also he has a real passion not only for this part of his subject but a love of old maps and it is this that has such an important part to play in the early phases of the book. Further, the author has gone to a great deal of trouble to research sections of this book though I am concerned whether he has left out aspects that don't fit in with his hypothesis.<br /><br />What comes to light overall is the great potential for seaborne exploration possessed by the Chinese at this time. And many of the assertions the author makes are not necessarily out of step with traditional thought on waterborne endeavours. Growing up in Australia it's long been known that the Chinese almost certainly made landfall in Northern Australia - certainly trade went on between Indonesian peoples and indigenous peoples of the Australian top end and it's well known that Chinese built ships were ploughing the seas of South East Asia so it's pretty certain they had a rough knowledge of the area. Other areas where it's pretty understandable the Chinese would have gotten is the coast of modern day Alaska. After all, we all know that there were great fleets built for the Mongols to assault Japan with and we know that both Chinese and Korean shipyards were quite capable of building and equipping large fleets. It seems pretty likely that they did hit North America at some point, even if only the western most parts in their search for trading partners.<br /><br />And given we have the original source materials of people such as Marco Polo and others to verify the amount of trade that went on in the Indian ocean and via trade routes around the Indian subcontinent and onto the Middle East and down the East coast of Africa it's pretty easy to grasp Admiral Zhe getting himself or sending other Chinese fleets of exploration in these directions.<br /><br />The downsides start coming from the way the author then tries to make out that it was these Chinese fleets - the existence of which is archeologically verifiable - then went about exploring the rest of the planet. His assertions for their exploration of South America and the Caribbean seem a tad fanciful and one passage sticks out in my mind as he points out that there are X number of mounds he feels that if excavated would show up to be Chinese vessels. He then goes on to assert that X just happens to be the number of ships he feels a fleet of the time would lose trying to navigate those seas. The bind he has gotten himself into here, of verifying his own assertion, is obvious to all. And it's these more fanciful conclusions he comes to that damage his case so.<br /><br />One can only muse that had he done an expose on the voyages of Admiral Zhe and confined himself to a summation of all that was known and more reasonable assertions then he may have been on safer ground but of course it is unlikely he would have caused as much of a stir nor made as much money. I note that there is another book out about how the Chinese discovered America, presumably sales there were fairly good or at least promising so a follow up tome was required.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the exuberant style of this book. And really enjoyed the way it dangled such juicy possibilities before the reader. There is a lot of good research and much of it backed up in the bibliography and via notes and I just wish I could believe in it with more conviction though I'm still willing to be swayed as the Chinese certainly had the technology over their European counterparts in many areas at this stage of the game.le East and down the East coast of Africa it's pretty easy to grasp Admiral Zhe getting himself or sending other Chinese fleets of exploration in these directions.

0060557818|5.0|So much glowing praise has been written that I will only add this:  The BBC mini-series that Gaiman wrote, which led to this book, pales in comparison to the book itself. If you saw the film and are thinking \\"ahhh, saw it, don't need to read it\\" you are wrong. You will enjoy the book all the better. Pick it up.
B0027REDK2|2.0|Why a package design review? I'll leave it to the rest to fully review the audio--which is amazing, by the way. This a rare album that is solid from beginning to end. Nice to be able to do a DIY US version. The demos are nice to hear, as are the digital-only extra tracks. I do wish Simon's Christmas message was made into a separate unlisted track.    On to the package design: The canvas texture was a nice touch, but not really necessary. The haphazard placement of \\"2 CD LIMITED EDITION\\" should tip you off right away that the packaging was put together with little regard for the original Malcolm Garrett/Assorted iMaGes design. Even the bottom of the Nagel illustration is clipped. The typography on the back is sloppy (check the alignment of \\"Versions & Mixes\\" relative to the other subheadings). And the booklet... On page 6, yikes, what happened to the \\"Duran Duran\\" type? The liner notes are mostly fluff with little revelation (set in a font out of context with the artwork, by the way), and it would've been nice if the photos stuck to 1982 instead of covering their entire classic lineup era--this is about Rio, after all. Lastly, the final page with the images of the singles: these are the poorly re-created single cover images with the wrong fonts from the CD singles box set, the designer(s) couldn't be bothered to faithfully recreate (or at least re-scan) the original singles art--I did not need to be reminded of these abominations.    Shame. This is arguably THE most classic, iconic album cover of the early '80s (other than MJ's Thriller, perhaps) and it deserves a better design effort to honor the band and Malcolm Garrett.
0385504225|3.0|I have incredibly mixed feelings about this book. If you asked me my thoughts while I was reading it, they varied among \\"I love it!,\\" \\"It's really good!,\\" \\"I can't stop rolling my eyes!,\\" \\"When will it end?,\\" and \\"Well, it's not very good, but I really like it.\\" I completely understand why the ratings at Amazon are so disparate. There are parts of this book I would rate 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars and 5 stars. Different readers will place more importance on some parts than others, and with this book more than any other book I've read, I would find it impossible to predict a reader's reaction. Here's how I viewed the book:<br /><br />1 star elements: The ubiquitous italics; there are other ways to emphasize things you want the reader to pay attention too. As a reader, I abhor this technique. My eye tends to glance around the page and picks up on things that are different. The italics distract me, and they really serve no literary purpose here.<br /><br />The watches. I get it; Langdon has a Mickey Mouse watch. It's important to him; it's irrelevant after the first mention, and it's annoying in a suspenseful scene. The fact that Katherine also has a very special watch given to her by her parents is laughable, but at least it was only mentioned once. I suppose she wasn't as concerned with time as Langdon.<br /><br />The formulaic romance. I loved Angels and Demons (and I want to read it again to see if my opinion has changed), and I thought The DaVinci Code was mediocre at best (I credit growing up in both a church and intellectual community, but I found nothing shocking or outrageous in the book, and after Angels and Demons, it seemed formulaic). I am willing to suspend my sense of reality for the sake of a good mystery or adventure story. I am not willing to overlook the fact that for three books now, Robert Langdon happens to end up solving a very important mystery with a ridiculously intelligent, articulate and attractive woman who has some very close relation to the man (whom Langdon is also closely related to somehow). At least there was a quick mention of what happened to the Angels and Demons woman in The Da Vinci Code. Here: nada. As a woman who has a fondness for intelligent, worldly men, the idea of these women falling for Langdon seems improbable at best and laughable at worst.<br /><br />The sexism. Hearing alleged intellectuals walk around talking about \\"man's secrets\\" is infuriating. Hearing Katherine talking about mankind rather than humanity is worse. For a book so concerned with being forward thinking, Dan Brown could use a seminar in appropriate language and gender bias.<br /><br />2 star elements: The villain (I'll avoid specifics in case you haven't read it). He's too unbelievable. He's so unbelievable he wasn't scary. I like a villain with a few doses of humanity or something about him or her I can relate to.<br /><br />3 star elements: Although I liked parts of it, it was all too much. It was too long, too hard to maintain that much intensity for that many pages. The resolution was unsatisfying.<br /><br />4 star elements: The idea of this book is cool. I like adventure stories. The thrill of the chase was fun. For 80% of the book, I really enjoyed Katherine as a character. She was intelligent, open-minded and inspiring. I appreciate she got to make some discoveries instead of our intrepid hero, but as I said earlier, her use of mankind instead of humanity rubbed me the wrong way, and I don't think she would fall for Robert Langdon.<br /><br />This paragraph: \\"Is there? Is it not possible that we are still living in the Dark Ages, still mocking the suggestion of 'mystical' forces that we cannot see or comprehend. History, if it has taught us anything at all, has taught us that the strange ideas we deride today will one day be our celebrated truths. I claim I can transform the pyramid with a touch of my finer, and you question my sanity. I would expect more from an historian. History is replete with great minds who have all proclaimed the same thing...great mind who have all insisted that man possesses mystical abilities of which he is unaware.\\" p. 308<br /><br />5 star elements: Whether you consider it science fiction, science, an interesting religious view, or just unsettling, noetic science is intriguing and fascinating. The ideas in this book made me think, even if the book also made me groan. I'll give you this point, Dan Brown, I didn't tweet about noetics, but I am blogging about it.<br /><br />Will I read the next Dan Brown novel? Probably. Here's what I would like to see Dan Brown do: first, write children's books. Wouldn't it be fun to see a sixth-grade Robert Langdon solving little mysteries? The problems could be more elementary too, and it would fit perfectly. Another option would be to have Langdon have a daughter who suddenly appears and wants to get into symbology. A young adult heroine is born. She could follow him around the world learning and solving little puzzles. These formulas would work for children's books, but I find them getting old in adult books.<br /><br />I'm pretty much done with Langdon as a hero. If he comes back, I'd really like to see him in a more supporting role, or at least an equitable role. Katherine had the most to do of his female characters, but she still felt too much like a sidekick for someone who knew more than Langdon in many pivotal scenes. If Langdon comes back as the hero, and he inevitably will, can one of his three female sidekicks also return? I can't stand adding another one.<br /><br />I loved parts, and I enjoyed parts, but as a whole, it's mediocre and likable. Am I glad I read it? Absolutely. Would I recommend it?

055380684X|3.0|Lots of interesting stories about deep practice and how sustained effort create new neural pathways in the brain... but runs into a brick wall at the end when he uses the Raiders selecting JaMarcus Russell over Calvin Johnson as a great example of how a great \\"talent\\" scout brings all this together.      That pick has been disastrous for the Raiders.  Russell is the lowest ranked quarterback in the NFL and Johnson is wildly successful.  Frankly, this last example is so bad, it makes me question the conclusions drawn in the rest of the book!    I just had to add this in, from a recent article on NFL Draft Busts: \\"QB JaMarcus Russell, LSU: Could there be anyone else as out All-Bust starting quarterback? Taken first overall by the Raiders for his arm strength, Russell has been a hot mess in the NFL.\\"    5/5/10 -- just had to add this.  Raider's cut JaMarcus, and he's cited as the biggest bust in the history of the NFL.  Also, \\"lazy\\" and fat.  Nice work, Talent Code guy.    [...]
B001P9KR94|3.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" portrays the India that we were always told about as kids in the US - crowded and chaotic beyond belief, chock full of nothing but poverty and violence, filthy and disease-ridden, and full of people who wanted nothing more than to steal everything you had if you looked away for even a moment.  This is a portrayal of India at odds with the modern image in every way.  Having never visited, I couldn't tell you which is correct.  But it sure puts you off of any thoughts you ever had about going to the Taj Majal or anywhere else in the country.<br /><br />The majority of this movie is a oft-distressing downer, unrelenting in its grimness.  Nevertheless, the first part of the film starts to become unintentionally funny after a while.  As in \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\\" whatever our hero does, things always get worse for him, and you can count on a calamity whenever he starts to become comfortable or happy.  The ending is indeed uplifting and a Triumph of the Human Spirit, but it's ultimately too little, too late.<br /><br />So what's good about the film?  The performances are fantastic across the board, and we really buy into the characters.  The cinematography is colorful and spectacular.  You can always count on Boyle for great photography, whether in his best films like \\"28 Days Later\\" or his worst, \\"Sunshine.\\"  And, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is interesting, even if depressing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good-time Friday night movie, this is not what you want, despite how it was marketed.  Nevertheless, it's at least worth a rent.
B001O2MBMI|5.0|I stumbled upon Leona accidently. I was watching the Britain's Got Talent Susan Boyle videos on youtube and got interested in watching other BGT episodes - then discovered X-Factor videos. When I came across Leona, I was totally blown away. I watched all the videos posted with Leona and fell in love with her wonderful voice. I was so glad she won X-Factor, and really enjoyed seeing her guest perform on Simon Cowell's other shows (Britains Got Talent, America's Got Talent Finale American Idol, etc). Of all of her songs, I was most moved by her cover of Snow Patrol's 'Run'. 'Bleeding Love' and 'I Will' are also favorites of mine now.    I am looking forward to her new Album 'Echos' due out in November.    Leona has a very unique voice and it adds a special nuance to every song she does. You can always tell it is Leona signing - I do not know how to describe it, but she has a characteristic embelishment when she does high notes that turns the song into hers.  No other performer does it quite this way, which is one of the things I like about Leona - she transforms the song to make it uniquely hers.    I downloaded all the mp3s from Spirit, but now think I will order this Deluxe CD with the bonus DVD just to get her videos.

068484267X|5.0|If you listen to our daily podcasts, you heard us talk about the passing of Frank McCourt -- an event that was, shall we say, overshadowed by the deaths of people like Michael Jackson, Walter Cronkite and Ed McMahon. While he was not as well known as any of those three, McCourt was, in the world of book lovers, one of a kind. He spent most of his life as a school teacher before deciding one day to go ahead and write a memoir of his early life in the extreme poverty of Ireland. His was certainly not the first book on the subject, but it is, arguably, the most lyrical. You simply cannot read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" without hearing his voice. Literally. The Irish lilt comes through beautifully in the writing, making the book itself seem like a rambling reminiscence from a favorite uncle. (Unless your uncle happens to be from Estonia, in which case it probably doesn't.) Still, I defy anyone who claims to be literate and to enjoy reading good books to come away with anything but positive feelings for \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" It's the kind of book that reminds me why I love reading. And if you can read it without developing a bit of a lump in your throat and without laughing at the description of a kid \\"throwing up Jesus Christ,\\" there's probably something wrong with you.
0061730327|5.0|One of the stereotypical things Americans of my generation heard from their parents was, \\"Clean your plate.  There are starving children in Africa.\\"  These words had little meaning to children who didn't want to eat their peas, but The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind really puts a face on such famine.  William Kamkwamba's description of people who were willing to work but ended up nearly, or actually, starving to death cut me to the quick.  Here we are with so many kinds of food available to us, and the people William knew in Malawi deserved at least as much, yet ended up eating whatever they could find on the ground.  They sold their roofs so they could buy flour.  Even if they had decided to leave their country for someplace with more resources, they were too weak by the point at which that would've been an obvious choice.  They would have collapsed before making it to a place with more food.<br />William's determination to learn and to build a windmill--which he hoped would ultimately give his family electricity and the ability to pump enough water to fertilize another crop each year--was nothing short of astounding, especially given the lack of new materials and money.  We can all learn something about reducing, reusing, and recycling here!<br />I have great respect for William and his patience, and I hope that things continue to improve for him and his people in the future.<br />The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is an inspiring book--highly recommended!
B0000797IO|2.0|I wasn't crazy about this movie. It's more like an exploration of desperate people in a pathetic part of rural America. It's about how all the people in this situation can't escape from their situation. The plot involves Jennifer Aniston's attempt to find love through a crazy affair and find a new life. Sometimes though it gets a bit too depressing.     The acting isn't great. Jennifer Aniston tries to come across as a redneck with a southern accent, but just sounds odd. Jake Gyllenhaal is a bit too odd and psychotic. Oddly enough, I thought John C. Reilly, otherwise known for playing moronic clowns (like Step Brothers), actually fits his role really well.
0060763280|4.0|This is a good book.  I got a lot of \\"big ideas\\" from it, three of which I'll share later in this interview.  However, I also feel that it has more an its fair share of \\"pitch\\" in it.  The guy has to make a living, which I appreciate, but he's really pressing hard at getting you into his seminars and other Millionaire Mind stuff rather than letting the good ideas sell themselves.  If you can get past that, there is a lot in this book that is very valuable.    The big ideas I got:    1. Play to Win - Obvious, right?  A lot of people play \\"not to lose\\" though and there is a big difference.      2. \\"Tap Roots for Better Fruits\\" - Work on the foundation of your issue and you'll get much better results.    3. Work on yourself and your income will grow with you.    If you are into things like, this you'll love this book.  It is not a \\"make money system\\" but a way of life.  It will require some changes on your part.  I have found the changes worthwhile and very helpful.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I rented this movie on a lark, in spite of all the negative reviews, and expected to be disappointed. Instead, I was emotionally and intellectually moved. This movie is a deep commentary on the roles society expects us to play, healthy attitudes in the face of adversity, and truly meaningful relationships. It portrays how humans have a tendency to devalue something one day, only to find out later that it was the most valuable gift ever received. It celebrates empathy and compassion. I would give this movie 10 stars if I could.

I tried it on 2 different playback machines that were in perfect working condition and played other tapes just to see if the problem was in the machine or the tapes.

The speed of the tape was intermittant, that is is started out running too fast, changed back to a normal speed and then would speed up again.  It was not possible to adjust the tracking ( on either of the two players I tried).

B002QN7PU2|5.0|Dexter is an original thriller that goes beyond the imagination but in a realistic edge of your seat sort of way.  Everything works, the actors, storylines all of it.  What other show will make you root for a serial killer and hope he never gets caught?  We love it!!!
0765356139|4.0|Good continuation of the series. Compelling book, hard to put down. Yet there are flaws in the flow. ( Zane misleads Vin, yet she never questions his actions. Hard to believe an always suspicious thief suddenly becomes so naive. Apart from that, the rest of the story holds together (if you ignore the university professor rambling about religion/philosphy and all the frippery that really has no place in the story). Onto the last/final book
B0024HH32A|5.0|This a classic, this the best MASH, the TV version was too touchy feely, this is dark humor at it's best. Hilarious.
0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol is over written and under edited.  The plethora of aha! moments just become so what?
0446402397|5.0|I wasn't sure what this book was about when I picked it up, but was pleasantly surprised. From page one I was hooked. The story could have been boring, but Tom Rob Smith writes in a way that keeps the story flowing and interesting. He makes you care about certain characters and loath other ones. This book has a bit of history, love, mystery, suspense.<br />Looking forward to reading \\"The Secret Speech\\". Hopefully it will be as good as \\"Child 44\\".
0765350386|4.0|First of the mistborn series. It was a nice book to read, hard to put down. Made me want to pick up/read the second book immediately.
B0026ZNL80|5.0|Riverside was suggested as a band for those who prefer progressive rock and bands like Pink Floyd and Porcupine Tree - it was an excellent suggestion! Anno Domini High Definition is the third Riverside album I've purchased from Amazon, and it's another winner! The album deserves repeated listening, and it just keeps getting better each time.
0061537969|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!  Yes, it's got sad parts but you will finish this book with a smile on your face.  Definitely.  It's unlike any dog book I've ever read...and I've read a LOT!  I've bought many copies to give to friends and told them to \\"pay it forward\\" because this is one of those books that everyone needs to read.
0440236738|1.0|I enjoyed all of Harlan Coben's books except for \\"Long Lost\\" and this one, \\"Gone for Good\\". I couldn't get into the plot. It dragged on too much about Covenant House, prostitutes, how rough street life is. I didn't like or care for any of the characters.<br />Very disappointed.
B000JIHP88|4.0|We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old and he just loved it!  He's currently 7 months old and still enjoys looking at the bright colored animals but is now more interested in the music box that is attached to the side of the crib.  Overall it is very colorful and children will enjoy it.  The only drawback is that the music is sometime not loud enough.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This is an impressive cd and Whitney did a great job. Without referring to previously released music, I took the opportunity to listen to this cd with open mind. The songs didn't require her to \\"pull\\" the notes we might tend to characterize her with, but her voice went the distance in delivering. The cd consistently held to a high quality and I am pleased with my purchase. It cost me double since my mother now owns \\"my\\" copy and loving it.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Before I bought this product I wanted to see what all was included, well I got more then I bargained for, believe me this is very worth it. All of his best hits and then some, and then we come to the price of this product, wow! How could you pass this up. Then on top of it all you get a dvd with him in concert, that one is awesome.
0470477237|5.0|Not that long ago, a movie's opening box office weekend success was determined by, essentially, how much advertising & hype was put into the film by the studio.  Usually, a bomb went undetected for that first weekend of its release.  Nowadays, the honeymoon's over right away; if the movie stinks, millions of people read about it on Twitter, often, in the middle of the flop.<br /><br />Erik Qualman calls this phenomenon \\"socialnomics\\", and it's changing the landscape of the way businesses market themselves and it certainly changes the box office totals for most high profile movies.  Consumers know right away from their buddies if \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" was the real deal (it was) or if some other ridiculous sequel sucked, big time (it did).<br /><br />The smart companies realize the impact \\"socialnomics\\" has on their market share, and as a result, they focus more attention to the internet than commercial advertising.  That may have a profound effect on the television & radio industry, but that's simply 21st century reality; it's all about supply & demand.<br /><br />For anyone trying to market themselves, or their product, they'd better understand the significance of social media.  It can be a powerful tool if used, properly; if ignored, it can be their worst nightmare.
B00005JO20|4.0|Every Kong film has their ups and downs, but some of them can be a bit obvious. This new 2005 remake is probably slightly better than the original. Kong is given a more ferocious and more human appearance, while the CGI effects are top-notch. Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are absolutely amazing here (but they still can't top Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot). And the action is what you would expect from a Kong film, only that it's probably the most exciting we'll ever see when it comes to this version. But there are, as always, flaws. The sub-plot that involves Jimmy and Hayes was not needed at all: it slows the film down and it sometimes feels like it turns into a completely different movie. The references to the original 1933 film are clever, but there are too much of them in this film. They become irritating once we get into the third act. The music theme wasn't eerie and powerful enough; it could have been improved. And finally, having it all set in 1933 again makes it all a bit tedious. It could have been set in the late 30's or early 40's to make it look a bit unique.<br /><br />But still, this is an ultimate Kong remake. It's got great effects, wonderful jungle settings, and a new and improved look for the ape himself. All three films (1933, 1976, and 2005) do have their own ups and downs, but I still like all three of them.
0385504225|1.0|What a disappointment.  I had read all of Dan Brown's other novels, and looked forward to this one, despite the hype. Now I know why the hype was necessary. This book was unnecessarily long, boring, repetitive, and astonishingly predictable. And just when you thought you had slogged through the last annoyingly detailed scenario, Mr. Brown thought another few pages of ennui and anticlimax were in order. I read it on my Kindlie, and with 97% of the book under my belt, I gave up.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|My 10th grade son needed a series of movies for his US honors history class at school. Our whole family enjoyed sitting down watching this series. In fact I learned alot of historical facts about John Adams and his important role in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence. Some of the language did involve some curse words which was not essential to the movie.
0307454541|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  A really long novel, but the pages just flew by.<br />Geat combination of mystery and life in a different time and place.  Really looking forward to the sequel and wish there could be many more.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|First off, I want to say that this is an outstanding family film. Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci make an impressive duo as father and daughter, while the effects are especially realistic and outstanding. But . . . couldn't they have given Eric Idle a better purpose for this film? I mean, he's from MONTY PYTHON! At least give him some catchy wordplay! Here, in this movie, he isn't given much, but he should have been given a whole lot. He could have had a hysterical conversation with the ghostly trio or something like that. But anyway, this really is a good film, especially if you want to see the original animated Casper the Friendly Ghost turn into a full CGI character.
1906694176|5.0|Just as Tolkein's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is held up as the trilogy to which all fantasy trilogies are inevitably compared, I've little doubt that Larsson's Millenium series will play that benchmark role for mystery thrillers over the next few decades.    \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" is an incredibly worthy successor to the previous two books in the trilogy.  And toward the end, there will be moments when tears are brought to your eyes.  Larrson knew precisely how to play with timing, rhythm, and wording to pace the story and its ending just right.  I'm hard pressed to even guess how else he could have ended this series.    The story follows the natural conclusion of the events in the first two books as everything dovetails toward a \\"behind-closed-door\\" trial.  Larrson did a very good job of the first part of this book that takes place in the hospital where Lisbeth is recovering.  I really enjoyed reading things from her perspective, then spinning out to others involved and each of their limited pieces of the evolving puzzle.  And things just get better as the book moves along.    Frankly, once you hit part three of the book, it's almost impossible to put down.  I picked it up just once...just to read a chapter or two in the second half of the book...only to find that three hours had gone by and the book was over.    Larrson's tying up of many loose ends throughout the book - and this is key - throughout the book (not all in the last few chapters like so many other writers) is masterful.  And that emphasizes the one tragic aspect of this final book:  knowing that we will never again be graced with Larrson's storytelling mastery.
B00003CY0V|5.0|5 of 5 stars for this exciting suspense movie. The first 5 minutes of the movie is an amazing set of scenes acting as a kick-start for this high-tension, suspenseful action movie. Right down to the little ball-bearing rolling towards to camera covered in blood--amazing effects!<br /><br />Travolta's character is truly evil--calm, cool, collected but evil. Frankly, he is really a terrorist trying to sway events using violence. Ruthlessly cold, he doesn't mind killing people to get his way. For his purposes, he needs a top-class computer hacker (Jackman) who he recruits via Halle Berry's character.<br /><br />Thru the whole movie, there are twists and turns. Travolta even makes a speech to Jackman about how Harry Hudini did his tricks \\"mis-direction\\"! Several times, you learn things are not as they appeared to mis-direct efforts. Travolta is in total control.<br /><br />Lots of action scenes, chases, explosions, machine guns, RPGs, etc. The ending scenes have several surprise twists; remember, mis-direction!
B002G4FQI4|5.0|Wonderful CD.  Prompt communication, delivery and great product.  Exactly as described.  Great Seller.
B000244EMO|5.0|Even though I slightly prefer the sequel, the original is still creepy and entertaining. Here we are introduced to the \\"Predator,\\" an alien hunter who has crash-landed in the jungles of Central America. Little is known about this strange species; only that it'll kick your @** if you get in his way. Add in Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team of soldiers and you've got a bitter conflict between human and alien. I got to say that this is one of the few movies in which Arnold gives a very good performance. You get to see him in some well-done action sequences. The supporting cast is good as well: who would have thought that Jesse Ventura could act? The action is solid; the blood and gore aren't very excessive, but they're still tons to see. And of course, the \\"Predator\\" is the real star in this film; that, and the special effects (which still looks realistic today).
B0027G783W|5.0|I've had an occasional interest in Moby's music since back in the mid-90s, but wouldn't say I've ever been fully captured by his music.  This record however really strikes a chord.  Much of it does fit with what you might think of as \\"score music,\\" but not all of the record is that ambient.   It's not dancefloor stuff, certainly, and it's not just idle background music either.     There's a raw intimacy here that I wasn't expecting, though which Moby has always shown himself capable of in different places.      It's my favorite Moby album, yet.  A real creative piece that is immediately striking, but demands time to absorb.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|Though it sounds like teenage hyperbole, I rank this album up there with Sergeant Pepper.  It's that good.  And not only is it good, it's been every bit as inspirational and epoch-making as that Beatles classic.  Its musicality, spirituality, and political engagement transcend its original late-Eighties milieu to create an experience that crosses generations without diminishing its impact.<br /><br />This album kicks off with three classic tracks: \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" and \\"With Or Without You.\\"  All three were hit singles that remain in heavy rotation over twenty years after they were released.  And it's not hard to see why.  Not only are they musically and lyrically rich, they have a sing-along quality that radio audiences love.<br /><br />When you pass the singles, you reach what makes the album great.  Densely evocative tracks like \\"Bullet the Blue Sky,\\" \\"One Tree Hill,\\" and \\"Red Dirt Mining Town\\" aren't well known outside fan circles, but if anything they're more dense and impactful than the classic singles.  Politically engaged but not bullying, these songs ask the audience questions about itself that not all of us may be ready to answer.<br /><br />The celebrated desert that informs this album isn't always overt in the songs, but it's always there.  The musical austerity, with guitars and drums ringing like some animal calling off in the distance, remind us that the desert is a place of purity.  From Christ at Lent to John Wayne in \\"The Searchers,\\" this is the desert people seek when they want to be purged and made new.<br /><br />Most music released at the same time as this album was overproduced and virtually unlistenable.  Not so this.  \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is clean in its poetry, incisive in its music, and timeless in its impact.  It encourages both imitation and parody, the marks of a true classic.  And people still want to listen to it.  Over twenty years later, its power and impact remain undiminished.
B000065K5S|2.0|The Cider House Rules has nice cinematography and good acting, but it lacks a coherent plot and focus. Some things explored include the \\"grey\\" areas of life and how you can't always live by the rules; abortion; incest; coming of age; a romance between Charlize Theron's character and Tobey Maguire's character; the father/son-type relationship between Tobey Maguire and Michael Caine's character; and creating a family atmosphere in an orphanage. But it was unclear which of these themes was the main focus and how exactly they all connected.    Tobey Maguire's character leaves the orphanage he grew up in in rural Maine to find himself and explore the world. But he only gets as far as an apple farm in Maine, and apparently learns all he needs to know about life from some migrant apple pickers there. This just seems ridiculous to me, as his character barely gets out of his back yard when he's supposed to be striking out on his own and seeing the world.    The film really glorifies abortion as a positive thing, which is a turn-off. Michael Caine's character indicates repeatedly that he thinks the orphans he cares for and supposedly loves would have been better off aborted, which doesn't make sense to me. Charlize Theron's character is not the slightest bit shaken after undergoing her abortion, which again did not ring true. Erykah Badu's character, who was impregnated by her father, also undergoes an abortion, a relatively late-term one. We are supposed to sympathize with abortion in this case, but because it is late-term and her character is so flippant about it, I found myself disgusted.    Although the movie aims to celebrate moral relativism, I think it inadvertently shows the need to live by some rules...
B002JM1VJG|4.0|After getting the cd, I knew I had to get the dvd with the videos as well. I remember watching a majority of those videos on MTV and VH1, but there were some videos missing though. Videos like This Used To Be My Playground, and the video for the song from the Dick Tracy Soundtrack, and a few other ones too. I had no problems with pixilation or fuzziness from the dvd itself, but I did notice everything was put together rather cheaply though. Don't get me wrong, this is a great collection of videos and I really enjoy watching the videos too, but it is missing something (other than videos I mentioned). I bought other video collections from other artists I like that were horrible, horrible picture quality and sound quality, and I got nothing of the sorts from this dvd, so I dunno why other people are complaining about it. I have a big 50\\" HD Panasonic TV and just a normal progressive scan dvd player dvd recorder, and everything was fine.  Why only the 4 stars? Because of the missing videos and the missing something that should have been done to make the dvd more enjoyable while at the menu screen. A five star music video collection would be something like what the Beastie Boys had with their Video Anthology Criterion Collection. That was one of the most amazing, and well packaged collections ever. Not only did it have alternate viewing options for some of the videos, but it also featured alternative audio options as well. Like some songs had ac-cappella versions of some songs, and also the remixes and also commentary of the making of the videos as well.  Now if this video collection had something like that for this release, it would get more than five stars for sure. But all in all, I'm not complaining about this dvd at all, I love it, and Madonna looks real good, from her first video to the new Celebration video, she is one good looking woman! While at her web-site, I noticed the dvd is cheaper there than it is on Amazon.com, and Best Buy. I got it at FYE while on salefor 21.99 so I guess if you add the shipping and whatnot, it will come up to about 22 dollars. So either get it from FYE or her web-site, and don't listen to the nay-sayers about this dvd, it is a good video collection.  So to end this review, I LOVE THIS DVD, MADONNA IS A HOTTIE!
B000001E21|5.0|I listen to this one all the way thru with no skipping songs because they are all great songs!
B000L43AN4|4.0|Tom Waits' 2006 opus is an order of magnitude removed from much of the downloadable crap coming out of American music factories these days.  Its ambition, musical diversity, and artistic accomplishment make it stand out and demand listeners reevaluate what they think music is.  But its virtues feed into what is doubtless its greatest weakness: it is unbelievably long and demands listeners with sturdy constitutions.    Each of the three discs is unified by some theme, expressed musically rather than lyrically.  Disc 1, Brawlers, is comprised of blistering bluesy tracks like those that made Waits famous back in the Eighties.  Disc 2, Bawlers, is more sentimental and folksy, harkening back to his Grammy-winning \\"Mule Variations.\\"  Disc 3, Bastards, runs the gamut of experimental sound reminiscent of \\"Alice\\" and \\"Blood Money.\\"    \\"Orphans\\" is 56 tracks long, and each disc is packed to the limits of a CD.  Though they don't necessarily come together to comprise a whole like a concept album, they are a unified musical experience spotlighting the range of human emotions as felt by a musician.  And not just any musician: as always, Waits' mind runs very differently than yours or mine, with deeper insights and more tumultuous feelings.    Waits plays with sound in a way not everyone will like.  Most tracks are filtered to sound like someone's collection of treasured 78 RPM records; listeners weaned on CD-quality sound may dislike this muddiness.  And the Tin Pan Alley ethos that informs the instrumentation is not one that young listeners are accustomed to.  But these elements create the illusion of a bygone artist reminding us of truths we didn't know we'd forgotten.    Tom Waits albums have become perilously few and far between.  Once a one-man revolution factory, sightings of him have achieved the rarity of UFOs.  But that makes albums like this one only that much more valuable.  If we don't know when we'll hear from him next, four hours of pure Waits gold is worth the effort of listening.  It's really, really long, but it's really, really good.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|Along with the [[ASIN:B002HNA95E Celebration (2 CD) REMASTERED]] release, Warner Bros. Music also released Madonna's third music video collection on DVD. This set contains 2 DVD with 47 music videos spanning Madonna's 26 years in the music business. There are a lot of reviews of this product complaining of the quality of the video. Off hand, the first disc that contains her earliest videos (\\"Burning Up\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", \\"Borderline\\" for example) aren't the best quality. In fact, I felt that these videos were almost identical to the quality of the videos released on her first music video DVD, [[ASIN:6305459525 Madonna - The Immaculate Collection]]. I could only detect a slight different in the quality, but the older the video, the lower the quality it seemed to be. This did disappoint me a bit since the sticker on the front of the product boasts \\"digitally re-mastered from the original tapes!\\" Was this statement referring to the videos or the music tracks? As with many of the music tracks and edits from the 'Immaculate Collection' being placed on the CD edition of 'Celebration' I am feeling pretty confident that Warner Bros. lazily dropped the same videos (not remastered, not retouched, not enhanced) from the [[ASIN:6305459525 Madonna - The Immaculate Collection]] and [[ASIN:6305610444 Madonna - Video Collection 1993-99]]. It was a rather misleading statement on Warner Bros. part to lead the consumer to think every video contained on these 2 DVDs were going to be digitally restored and polished, looking better than ever. The only videos that really leaped off the screen were the newest ones (Disc 2 for the most part). That is a major point of criticism for me that keeps this from being a true 5-star product.<br /><br />The Good: I felt the DVD edition's strength is that it succeeds in acknowledging her entire career in some manner where as the CD companion (even the 2 CD edition) skipped around and left out many of the ballads, soundtrack hits and blurred the lines with what was a true hit and what may have been chosen by Warner Bros. just to fill disc space. It was a surprise that music videos of so many songs, even songs that were not true 'hits', made it onto the DVD. Seeing videos \\"True Blue\\", \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"Love Profusion\\" (to name a few) included made me feel the DVD definitely got more attention and is worth the money because of all the music and videos, diversity and mix of well-known and lesser-known tracks, this was a true 'celebration' of Madonna's career rather than just another ploy from Warner Bros. music to make money off of Madonna before she moves on to Live Nation. While the quality of the videos on Disc 1 left much to be desired, I felt Disc 2 great in quality and probably worth the purchase alone. This disc contains videos from the 'Music' era through 'Hard Candy' and even the video for \\"Celebration\\". This is where the last video collection left off and definitely is a nice buy for any Madonna fan who wants the videos of the 2000s all on DVD. These, unlike her earlier videos on Disc 1, are definitely high quality. Overall, I did not experience any of the pixelation issues or distorted picture that some reviews mentioned because my TV is not huge and isn't HD or fancy. I was pleased with the audio on both discs and felt the videos (with the exception of the first 8 on Disc 1) were either good or very stunning (\\"Rain\\" for example was very bright and vibrant, the colors in \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Jump\\" were rich and stunning).<br /><br />The Bad: As with the CD version, I was perplexed with some of the omissions. I understand Warner Bros. attempt to create a product that doesn't completely render the past two DVD collections pointless and not worth buying, but this is supposed to be some of Madonna's most iconic videos all in one set. It is supposed to be a 'celebration' of her great music video work and imagery, celebrating her artistic and visual performer side over the music. Why, I ask, did Warner Bros. leave off the cinematic video for \\"Bad Girl\\", or the most drastic re-invention/character she's ever played in a video, being the geisha in the video for \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"? Also, this would have been a great opportunity to showcase the original video for \\"American Life\\" that's been floating around the internet for years now. Also, some of these soundtrack videos are simply unnecessary. \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"Crazy for You\\", \\"Who's That Girl\\" are all great songs but c'mon, the videos are nothing more than clips from the movies. Those could have been eliminated to make room for the missing videos, or even iconic live performances (the 'Like a Virgin' 1984 performance, VMA 'Vogue' performance, the earth-shattering Britney/Madonna kiss). Some of the videos from her tours could have even been included as they are almost better than some of the official music videos. While I was glad to see \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Erotica\\" both included, Warner's choice to censor them with tacky black boxes over breasts and naughty bits just seemed tacky. We are all aware of these videos and what's being hidden; adults (for the most part) are buying the product. Stick a 'parental advistory' sticker on it and give the fans the full, unedited versions! The flaws struck me as laziness and business decisions made by Warner, not Madonna, to make a buck, save some time and grief and avoid controversy at all costs (being creativity and a quality product). I'm pretty sure Madonna herself had no hand in this since she's not a fan of the whole 'greatest hits' idea to begin with.<br /><br />In all, due to the nice spread of videos and both hit and lesser-known tracks, I definitely feel this is worth the purchase. Yes, there are flaws and this is by all means not a perfect product. Yet, I still feel this DVD collection is for the fans. If anything, we now (across 3 releases) have almost all of Madonna's videos on DVD. If the edited and watered-down CD release of 'Celebration' left a lot to be desired, I say put your money into this product. You'll not only get the music, but you'll get the videos to go along with them and that, in my opinion, is the 'definitive' and complete Madonna experience.id Warner Bros. leave off the cinematic video for \\"Bad Girl\\", or the most drastic re-invention/character she's ever played in a video, being the geisha in the video for \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"?

0307266303|5.0|I am a runner. I have been since I was about 5 years old. No kidding, I still have a picture of me holding the blue ribbon that I won in the 100 yard kids run at the Norm Higgins track meet in New London, Connecticut where I first saw Amby Burfoot race around the track elegantly and swiftly. (I didn't win - I think every tot got a blue ribbon.) But I did run solidly in high school and into my 20's strongly and enjoyably until I was sidelined with chondromalachia patella, leading to arthroscopic surgery, where my surgeon suggested \\"Don't run, ride a bike\\".  As I moved through my 30's I kept trying to get back into running, but every time I ran over a couple miles my 'bad' knee would ache, so I kept giving it up. I lifted weights instead, got into mountain biking, but always wanted to run again. About six months ago, at the age of 41, I started out slowly, bought a new pair of running shoes  - NB 769, nice, low to the ground, feet can spread out - worked my way up to a couple miles, ok, up to 4 miles, pain, moderate, I can handle it. Then I bought Born to Run, and besides being a wonderful read and amazing story it opened me up to something I never paid any attention to in my entire life of running: FORM. I started practicing better form, then tried barefooting, and now I'm running in Fivefingers and loving it - without injury! (Although the old hips and calves need to get used to this stuff.) This book is not a panacea, but rather a wake-up call for anyone interested in running, or health, diet, podiatry, anthropology, human evolution, masochism, or life.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Muse is awesome, and this album is definitely not their best, but they tried a little different with their rock symphony/Queen style rock out in the end, and it is still a great album. Certainly a great effort, I do love Muse and their unique sound and this album is a good buy.
B00007KWI9|5.0|I always like to say that when the stupid hippies were cavorting and making a mockery of themselves at Woodstock, some of the best bands in England were producing the most challenging and interesting rock music of any time.  The debut album of Yes came out in 1969, a banner year for creative bands to have their debuts: Strawbs, King Crimson, Genesis, and Led Zeppelin.  Because the Who produced \\"Tommy\\", I would exempt them from the statement above.    The first album of Yes comes at the wane of psychedelic rock and the beginning of progressive rock.  It included some covers which simply show what was influencing the group.  The Yes version of \\"Every Little Thing\\" is arguably the best Beatle cover.  They made it their own song.  It doesn't sound like the Beatles anymore, but it does give the listener a sense that Jon Anderson was influenced by the Beatles.    Imagine being there in 1969 and getting the Yes album for the first time, putting it on your turntable, and being amazed that this music was so different from anything else (apart from the aforementioned bands) including Pink Floyd, Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, and Frank Zappa.    In the personnel of Yes you have a singer with the highest male voice, a bass player who puts his Rickenbacker into a treble sound, a jazzy guitarist (who incidentally names the band), a wild organist, and a jazzy drummer who wants complicated timings.  Tony Kaye's competition at the time was probably only Keith Emerson of The Nice, or Jon Lord of Deep Purple.  Chris Squire, who plays with a pick, created bass runs that were better than anything done by Entwistle, Casady, Bruce, Lodge, Lesh, or McCartney.  Bill Bruford stands out as an exciting drummer who does more with two sticks than Ginger Baker, Mitch Mitchell, Keith Moon, Mick Avery, Graeme Edge, or Ringo.  We can't ignore Peter Banks, who injects jazz chords into rock songs, developing a sound that paves the way for his replacement two albums later.    I have been able to learn someof the songs on my 12-string guitar, but they're tough.  Even the romantic simple-sounding \\"Sweetness\\" has a key change.  The two truly progressive type songs are \\"Survival\\" and \\"Harold Land\\".  Having gone to Yes shows since 1979, I cannot recall a time when these songs were played.  Both songs have unique instrumental introductions.  Not many Yes fans ever mention \\"Harold Land\\" but they should for this is a song about war, principally a soldier.  This was not often seen in progressive rock apart from Roger Waters' \\"Corporal Clegg\\" or Greg Lake's \\"Lucky Man\\".  Yes would not tackle this subject again until \\"The Gates of Delirium\\".      Yes should be proud of their debut.  They should play these songs more often.  It turned fans on to a new sound (unheard from bands in the USA) and prepared them for the incredible second album of Yes.
1416594787|5.0|Richard Dawkins has done it again! Another home run grand slam for humanism and reason, providing the layman in the trenches with more weapons to use against the mindless hordes who suck at the teat of superstition. I too was at one time was a Young Earth Creationist who dabbled in Christian apologetics. In fact, it was my reading of anti-evolution books that kept me from casting off my faith sooner than what I did when I began questioning certain things. If you have never been indoctrinated into a Young Earth Creation movement you really wouldn't understand the leap it takes to even consider evolution as an option. Most people in Christianity don't want to give up their cozy belief system, no matter how inconvenient it may be on a day to day basis, because it is just more convenient to have someone spoon feed a world view to them rather than carve one out for themselves through a stimulation of their own gray matter. It was a book by Richard Dawkins that helped me make the leap from faith to reason. While The Selfish Gene didn't prove evolution in one giant stroke, it did prove to me that it was a system that was based on more than a few fossils and a lot of speculation.     The Greatest Show on Earth is probably the best book Dawkins has ever written. Until now, my personal favorite has been The Ancestors Tale. While I originally took to reading books on evolution to argue with Creationists, I have discovered a splendor equal to, or even exceeding the existential thrill gleaned from reading ancient idioms from leather bound creeds of yore. In Dawkin's latest book he has laid down such a convincing case that I am embarrassed to even admit I used to believe in a literal account of Biblical Creation. He leaves no stone unturned in discussing fossil evidence, evidence for unintelligent design and pointers that prove our earth is much older than some want us to believe. It is sad, but one can almost hear the steady cadence of keyboards typing out responses to Dawkin'sbook from Creationists (much like they did with The God Delusion) who haven't even given his work an honest reading. The real litmus test as to whether they actually read his book is whether they still harp on the Second Law of Thermodynamics; an argument Dawkins thoroughly decimates in The Greatest Show on Earth.     There is a book that theists could write in response to The Greatest Show on Earth that would have a bit of relevance to it. Since there are a great number of Christians who see no contradiction between faith in God and Evolution, how about a book explaining redemption theology in light of evolution. It is my belief that if I had been a member of a Christian group that accepted an old earth and evolution I might not have seen a contradiction and left the faith. I was taught that the events in the Garden of Eden had to be literal; the perfect creation, man's fall from perfection and need of a Savior and the advent of sin into the world bringing death with it. Romans 5:12 still stands out in my mind as a road block hindering the joining of Christian theology and evolution together. If evolution is true, death has been in the world since the beginning before man developed the ability to comprehend right from wrong and sin. Furthermore, if there was no literal Adam, how do we interpret Paul calling Jesus Christ the second Adam in 1 Corinthians 15? Rather than a pathetic book attempting to refute solid scientific facts I would like to see a book written on Christian theology aiming to reconcile these issues. Furthermore, I would like to see it written by some one with the ability to explain things clearly and concisely without confusing terminology created in ivory towers to confuse the simple. In short, lets see a book written as beautifully, clearly and as convincing as The Greatest Show on Earth.
1401323820|3.0|First the good...  It was a great fast paced little book.  The writing was tight, the dialog fast paced, and the characters really jumped off the pages.  Very visual.  Reading this, was like watching a great movie in my head.  There are a ton of characters, and somehow none of them get lost in the shuffle.  The writer really did a good job of keeping everything moving along.     Now the bad...   As soon as I heard that ABC was bringing out the Nikki Heat books that Richard Castle was writing, I thought it was Brilliant to piggy back the books on top of the show's success.  I read the first 3 chapters on line, and I was out of my skin excited.  I was picturing a novel about the size of the other Richard Castle books Detective Beckett handed out to her fellow detectives in the pilot episode, to help them track down the murderer who'd been copy-catting murders from the books.  I really expected it to be the type of book worthy of Richard Castle's name, a celebrated author who'd had 26 best sellers. Instead, it ended up being almost a book form of an episode.      If you really stop and think about what this book is supposed to represent, the beginning of a new character and series for Richard Castle based on a dynamic New York City Detective, you'll see what I'm trying to say.  This book would have a hard time standing on it's own without the show, and that's where I think ABC dropped the ball.  I think ABC could have given us a lot more credit for being able to read a full sized novel with strong characters based on Beckett and Castle and not confuse them with the characters on screen.  They could have made the characters varied enough that we would have seen the parallels and still been able to differentiate between Castle and Beckett and Rook and Heat.  And, given us the depth that can only be found in a novel.      After falling in love with Richard Castle on screen, I really wanted to read one of his books.  I wanted to see what kept him on the best selling list for 26 books.  I wanted to see the writing that Detective Beckett fell in love with and helped her heal after her mother's death.     Will I read the next one that comes out?  Yep.  I will.  Mainly because I'm a weak weak woman who's fallen in love with this irrepressible novelist, and will take whatever scraps are pushed my way.  I won't like myself because of it and will know that I'm settling, but alas, what's a girl to do?
B0013USZHG|5.0|Whether these selections of Latin American music or the magically exciting performance of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story Mambo are to your liking, there is no denying that Gustavo Dudamel understands the scores he conducts and is able to make them come alive.  Yes, there is considerable hype surrounding this young magician of a conductor, but spend some time with this recording or better yet attend a concert that he conducts and you will be astonished at just how musical he is.<br /><br />While the various podiums he occupies are before orchestra playing the classical repertoire, the fact that Dudamel would have the energy and foresight to place this recording before the public at the time when he is opening his first season as the conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic is yet another feather in his cap, a hat he happily wears before the youth orchestras of the world.  He is a dynamic force of nature and watching his rise in the world of the great conductors will be a pleasure.  Meanwhile, for sheer pleasure and excitement, join the throngs who have caught the fever so evident in this very fine recording with his own youth orchestra in Venezuela.  Grady Harp, October 09
B002NXSRX4|1.0|being a kid that grew up in the 80's surrounded by G.I joe toys and cartoons i was seriously looking forward to watching this film and when i finally did watch it boy was i disappointed.it was rubbish in every sense.it wasn't in any way true to the original concepts,far too much CGI(i hate too much CGI in movies),bad directing,awful acting (literally by everyone...shame on u dennis quaid as i am generally a fan),the villains scottish accent was over done and the whole \\"too cool\\" thing they were trying to go for really didnt work.The film didnt seem like it was a finished product and had a beta feel to it.Some CGI backgrounds were truly awful to watch.I am so disappointed and hope they do a sequel with new actors,a new director,better writer and most importantly less CGI.The dark knight,watchmen and Spiderman 2 are perhaps films to get some tips from as they were spot on and stayed true to the material.I usually would buy a movie like this just on principal as i was such a big fan of the cartoons and i also am a massive blu ray collector but this blu ray i just cannot purchase.it would be an embarrasment to own !!!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|The device came on time as promised by Amazon. Installation & setup was very easy. Documentation was good. The sound quality of SONY LX300USB is excellent for home use. The built-in pre-amp was good for connecting to the existing home theater. The only nagging thing I found was the audio cable attached to the device. The length of the cable was really short!!
B000J103WK|1.0|I returned this item because I did not realize that the HD DVD format would not play on my blueray player. I noticed later when I reordered that this item was no longer available and carried a big warning message. I have since reordered the regular DVD vesion and am happy with it. I hope I got credit for my return!
B0000047CW|4.0|Love the CD - the music is great for background at parties and for easy listening ay dinner.  Getz is always great!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Definitely worth having, if you're a metal fan. The songs are great--long, complicated, and interesting. That said, though, it isn't \\"amazing\\" like some of their earliest work was. Excuse the title of my review. I was listening to \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" when I wrote it, which does sound a lot like Slayer!
0920668372|5.0|I read it to my 5 years old, and I almost could not finished. It's mothers life review for a five years understand it!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I see reviews in here of people saying it's like alice in chains, it's like jerry cantrell, it's not really Alice in chains.     Big whatever    Honestly who cares what they call themselves or who they sound like.    This album is put together really well. It has rockers, slow songs, meaningful songs, silly radio play. The majority of the writing is very well done and we all know the quality of the people in the band, they aren't going to release a bunch of crap.      Very few times do I like an album right from the beginning, they have to grow on me. This one has been played constantly since I bought it. It's pretty damm good.
6305428042|1.0|Okay I have to admit this film has a interesting plot (witches return to Salam after 300 years), and some great special effects but the major cast 'sucked' the wind out of the film and that was why it failed at the theater. The \\"Divine Miss M\\" was attempting to switch from her Gay following to her Disney following which left both group's lost. SJP had not yet developed her S&TC following so she she thumped about 'smelling children'. And the last member (KN) which I guess was the \\"funny one\\" of the troop always got left out: i.e. having to ride a vacuum instead of a broom - ha, ha the first time. I felt like I was watching a remake of the 3 stooges. If I wanted to watch the 3S I would buy 3S and not some disney remake.    I felt sorry for the kids and some of the adults - both were really cute but were just overshadowed by the 'big stars'.
B002ELM5HY|4.0|This is not the very best Knopfler album ever -- not as good in my view as Golden Heart or Sailing to Philadelphia for example -- but very easy on the ears and I enjoyed it.

0321344758|5.0|The overriding theme to the book is that anything on your web page that takes more than a fraction of a second of thought is bad. When I worked at the Internal Revenue Service, we were never allowed to post anything that took less than a day of thought.    Sure - the topics in this book are obvious.  There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out yourself if you took the time to do so.  But that's the point - Krug took the time to assemble these obvious but numerous issues for you, so you don't have to think through all of the potential problems your web site is likely to have.  IRONICALLY, THE REAL VALUE OF THIS BOOK IS NOT IN ANY BRILLIANT INSIGHTS.  THE VALUE IS THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN WEB SITE AS YOU READ.  That is, simply by taking the time to drift through this light read, you can't help but to ponder how your own web site suffers from each of Krug's common web page problems.  You'll undoubtedly end up making a number of improvements to your own site.  Krug's small suggested improvements taken collectively really do end up making a big difference to your site.  I made at least ten changes to the web site that hawks my own cheesy book ([[ASIN:098230370X Web Service and SOA Technologies]]) based on Krug's very good advice.    Weakness #1 - The book's pace slows down at the end.  I can't help to wonder if Krug was  a little concerned that he wasn't going to have enough pages.  Do we really need an entire page that tells us that some people are naturally less patient than others?  But even at his slower pace, there are still many sentences that make you think (errr....even if you're not supposed to).     Weakness #2 - Why didn't Krug design a checklist of issues as the last page?  You can't use his table of contents as that checklist since his style is to use titles that don't mean anything without reading each chapter.  He needs a summary page like this:    * Is it obvious where you can click and where you cannot?  Are there \\"hotspots\\" on images that are not obvious?  * If a user were to squint and look at your web page, could they discern what each area on the page was most likely about?  * Does your search capability have confusing pulldowns?  * If a user arrives at any random page on your web site (say, from a search engine), can they figure out what site they are on, what the page name is, what are the major sections of the site, what are the best options on the page, where they are relative to the other pages, and how they can search?  * Do your user's eyes have to leap all over the page in order to figure it out?    * Does any operation ever take more than a few seconds to figure out?  * Does the reader ever have to read through instructions to figure something out?  (They won't.)  * Is information organized in a clear, visual hierarchy?  * Do you violate any web page conventions?  * Does your site have excessive images and flashy items on it?  * Are your pages reasonably short?  (that is, not too much scrolling required)  * Does the page have any text on it that isn't absolutely necessary?  (like this parenthetical note, for example)  * Navigation on your site has to be crystal clear.  If the user is \\"looking for a chainsaw\\", do they know if they should look in the \\"tools\\" section or in \\"lawn and garden\\"?  * If the user makes a bad guess when navigating your site, is it easy to recover from the error?  * Do any of your pages look so different from the others that the user might be confused if they've accidentally hyperlinked off your web site?  * When you analyze your site, have you spent the majority of your time thinking only about the higher level pages (rather than the low down, leaf node pages)?  * Does every page have a unique identifying name?  * Is every page name prominent?  * Does the page name ever not match the hyperlink that was used to arrive at that page?  * Have you favored the use of navigation tabs?  (Krug is a big proponent of tabs.)  * Does your home page establishthe site mission, hierarchy, and search method?  Do users immediately know why they should be on your site and not someone else's?  * What items appear \\"above the fold\\" on each page?  (that is, without having to scroll down)  * Does the site have any current references so users know they are not looking at an old, dead site?  * Does the company have a good, descriptive tag line?   * Is it clear where the user can search, browse, and find the best your company has to offer?  * Are you aware that display space devoted to promoting one item implicitly detracts from other items on the page?  * Have you ever observed a completely new user (with no introduction whatsoever) land on your site?  * Have you made the mistake of doing no user testing at all because comprehensive testing is too expensive?  * Did you perform usability testing very early in web development, like you should?  * Did you make the mistake of giving help to your new test user during your usability test?  * Does your site blatantly omit obvious information about your company because of embarrassment?  Does it conceal information like contact phone numbers?  * How quick and easy does your site service its most common request?  * How kind is your site to the vision impaired?  What happens if you change the browser font setting to \\"largest\\"?  Anything?  * Does every image have \\"alt text\\"?    You may think you don't need to read the book now, but remember the real value of the book is to force you to stop and think a while about each issue.  You can't do that blowing through this list in 10 seconds, especially without the examples in the book.      Overall - Despite some minor weaknesses, the book is great and offers enormous value. Don't Make Me Think has been one of the best sellers in software books since August 2005 and for good reason.  Krug's \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" really does warrant some thought.  If you have a web site, there's no question that you should buy this book.    Glenn Hostetler  Author,[[ASIN:098230370X Web Service and SOA Technologies]]
0684857219|5.0|This is a big, heavy book.  It is old school Arnold and goes into great detail on everything.  Certainly the pictures go back to Arnold's heyday and are not reflective of the real scary looking bodybuiders of today.  I recommend it to those of us who have out grown Arnold's slimmer bodybuilding for Men and want some more variations on appropriate exercises.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, as a fan of the cartoon series.  It was a fun film to behold.  I saw it twice in the theater.  I'll buy the Blu-Ray as soon as it's out.  The underwater base is far-fetched, but really helped catch the feel of the cartoon. I wasn't expecting a lot, but it was my favorite summer '09 movie.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a movie more about depression, loneliness, and desire for human connection with both friends and a lover.    If you watch this movie closely, you realize anti-corporate and anti-consumerism is just a red herring. These \\"ideals\\" are just a means for the main character to feel closer to other people and feel emotions more than whatever idealogy Fight Club stood for.

But it does the job.  Recommended, regardless.  Thank you!
B000002WU9|5.0|The original. Pre American Gangster, hands down this is the benchmark of cinematic hip hop. The CD is probably the most clear, concise movie that came out in 95/96. Don't tell me it's a CD, b/c Rae and Ghost paint such a vivid picture that you can see the movie in your mind. This is what Jay should have listened to before crafting American Gangster, seriously. The cd opens with Rae and Ghost discussing how they sick of the \\"game\\" and ready to leave it and the big city behind (I'm hanging this up if this don't work... get out of New York, bounce... move on to bigger and better)... They decide on, like every other gangster, one final big lick to set them up. What follows next is the movie in pure cinema classic. From losing a 3rd member in after a bank robbery, to discussing their former connect (Mike Lavona-Incarcerated Scarfaces) to maintaining their positions of power (Can it Be Pt. 2) to enjoying the spoils of their sucess via women (Ice Cream)... they even politic with other big time players (Nas), and send a stern warning to another K.O.N.Y. (Shark N-). They eventually evaluate their position (Heaven and Hell). The cd hits a finally as they call a retirement, but not before receiving a last bit of wisdom from Poppa Wu (North Star). In fact, that name is monumental, for as the North Star is the oldest and wisest star that guides and directs men home, so does Poppa Wu in guiding these young semi-proteges home. A beautiful masterpiece. Truly beautiful.
1582701709|5.0|The book the Secret by Rhonda Byrne's has taught me things about myself that I could not see or chose not to see. I read the book within one week, and I have started reading it again. I want to apply those principles that she has in her book to my life that I desparately need. It hurts me to learn that I always thought negative and didn't believe I deserve no more than what I had. I am so glad that someone recommended this book to me, because my negative thinking has been the downfall of my life. I have been my worst enemy throughout my entire life. But, I thank God that he always knows what to do and he knows exactly what is needed to free someone like me from the imprisonment of my own mind.    Thank you.
B00005TT77|4.0|It can be difficult to do a cover of a song, especially when the originals are done so well and become so ingrained, such as trying to cover songs by the Beatles.  I picked up this CD due to hearing Eddie Vedder's track, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, which turns out to be one of the best tracks, and probably in fact the best, on the CD.    He is able to bring a good version of the song to life.  Other tracks are pretty good, Golden Slumbers, Across the Universe for instance, which do not add to the originals or truly give them a fresh outlook while others fall short to me in the interpretation and performance.    So the record is a bit uneven, yet overall is worth it for some of the songs that are well done, and some of the tracks I did not like originally have grown on me on additional listen.  Perhpas my initial reaction was a bit off on some of these.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I have been reading fiction for 40 years. This is by far the best book ever. Not one denouement but too many to count. No American author has come close to what Larsson achieved in his too short writing career. What an aamazing legacy.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Cast names have changed since the first talkie submarine films were made some 80 years ago but the script and direction have not. All to the good. Each generation should relive these traditional films with actors and scriptwriters who use contemporary words and voices to convey a sense of what earlier generations aspired to even if they failed fully to achieve those aspirations. This is a well-contrived, well-acted film which focuses on the demands of leadership and the need for follower-ship. In the telling we are given traditional scenes of doubt, fear, bravery, and the awkwardness of the machine operated by fallible people. What we are not given are overblown scenes of rhetorical flourishes which are often self-defeating in these cynical times.It is also an old fashioned man-warrior vehicle which may soon become obsolete. I commend it to any who desire meaningful not romanticized action.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter shows more range in season three and the main plot is nice and twisted. Can't wait for season four.
0767836286|5.0|Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins do a fine job in this terrorist conspiracy theory thriller. The rest of the cast supports ably while the director keeps them all incisively moving allowing no lagging moments to break the pattern of suspense. The film makes the most of the paranoid nature of those involved and how uninvolved innocent people can be caught in their web of suspicions. Good viewing.
B002GU5V24|3.0|Overall I must say that the Genesis Boxsets have been amazing.  I myself own 1970 - 1975 and 1976 - 1982.  After purchasing a surround system I have been buying up anything I can that has been mixed in surround so these were logical purchases.  To my surprise I loved the bonus material on each DVD as much as I did the music from the albums themselves.<br /><br />So let me cut to the chase here.  I think they DTS versions of the live material were amazing.  They actually exceeded my expectations.  You really feel as though you are sitting there and you are listenting to Genesis live.  The bonus disc sound really surprised me.  I never figured anything that had been sitting in a vault for so long could have sounded so great and the setlist was fantastic too.  Makes you wonder why this was not previously released.  It would have been nice to obviously have Three Sides Live and The Way We Walk in DTS too but luckily for me my interest in the band kind of waned a little after Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett left.  Even the glitch on Seconds Out Live did not really bother because I could barely notice it.  Now keep in mind I never heard any other version of the album so I am not an expert on this glitch.<br /><br />Now here is the bad part.  I have been watching the official Genesis website for any news of this release when I heard it was coming out.  I did read that there would be over 6 hours of bonus material and since I loved all the other bonus material I have seen from the other sets I was very excited about it.  I was also looking forward to the interviews with all of the band members to get a different perspective on the music and learn some new info as I did with the other sets.  Much to my surprise there was nothing but the music on the DVDs and then I later see that they are releasing a movie boxset of their concerts.  It would have been nice to incorporate the concerts in as bonus material but money needs to be made so I am just dreaming here.  One could only wish.<br /><br />In the end would I recommend buying this boxset with what I know now?  Yes because the music itself is great and the sound is amazing.  If you are a completist then this is a must have.  However if you are not exactly sure about it I might recommend holding off for the time being or watch for deals.the end would I recommend buying this boxset with what I know now?

B000002OAZ|5.0|This is some good stuff. Wolf gives it his all and the band is super . The best part of this is the stop and start of red rooster . The band gets told how to play by Howlin' Wolf. You can hear the guys begging him to play with them .You can feel the love. I had this  back in the day 33 1/3 wore it out . I was very pleased to find it again . After 30 years I still dig every track.
B000025RHI|4.0|This truly is a classic reggae record. The songs really stand out from much of the records from the same era. Many great ones on here. Definately worth checking out. Although the package from the out of print Blood and fire version is much better. It has a second cd and a booklet with pictures and info about the recording. If you can't get a hold of the blood and fire version this one is still worth getting.
1851775722|5.0|This is a very unique fashion book because it doesn't just  show pictures of the fashions (which would be fine anyway) It takes it a step further by showing the individual details of the clothing worn in that period.

B001AR0D4A|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much because of the intense interaction with the characters.  You end up feeling like you know them and I watch the movie over and over.   When i first saw this movie I was so shocked about the ending.  It is so sad and depressing.  I keep thinking.  Why don't they wait a little longer.  So far in the movie they have been safe in shelter.  The land rover was sort of a shelter.  If only they waited maybe a little over 5 min they would of seen the tanks rolling up and knew they were saved and only then all that they have been through to try to surive would of not been in vain.  It is a very human story to the core which Frank Darabont focused on and in my opinion struck right to the human heart.  I loved the characters.  Never read the book.  Maybe 1 day I will buy the book and read it.   I bought the 2 disk collecter's edition and I recommend it as a MUST HAVE for any fan of this movie.  FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!! Still wish the last 5 characters made it though.  The ending will haunt me forever!!!  Thanks Frank Darabont!!  That was his intention all along.
076532413X|1.0|If you're planning to get this book because of the TV series, don't bother - the relationship is very tenuous and not worth either money or time to investigate.  I did get this because of the TV series and while the first 100 pages or so were quite good the story got mired down VERY quickly and basically goes nowhere.  It becomes very clear that the author has no philosophical skills or really any FEEL for philosophy.  The few more or less moral issues that come up are not examined in any depth and certainly not resolved.  Of course, you would not really EXPECT a sci fi writer to have philosophy chops, but the author would have done better to stick to a more science and thriller theme and left the highbrow stuff alone.  The end result is failure on all fronts.  I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather than spending money on it.
1563899426|4.0|I found the story well done.  You will recognize all of the characters, but don't assume any of them act the way they do in the stories you know.  It is an interesting twist on the characters and I found the book enjoyable to read.  The artwork was excellent and added to the story.  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was the ending.  How the crime was solved was interesting, but the way it was presented was a little weak.  Definitely a good start to the series.    The not for little ones comment is because even though the story is about fairy tale characters, it is written for an older crowd.  There are definite adult themes.

159448385X|3.0|I felt the book started well, with wonderful writing about the lives of the two female leads. However, the novel is unable to match those marvelous descriptions of the women's early years when it is time to depict the relationship between the women as adults. The relationship--as sister wives, as mother/daughter substitutes--is central to the novel, but the description is not convincing. Of course, by then, the novel has devolved into a description of the cruelties inflicted on these and other women by husbands, fathers, and Taliban.  I understand the need for the description, but it was done at the expense of the portrayal of the women's relationship, rather than as a part of it. Part of the problem in this part of the novel was the lack of a well-defined male character. The husband is merely an abuser, with no other characteristics, and a sympathetic orphanage director is a silhouette.<br /><br />The ending was a bit hackneyed, with too many things dovetailing too perfectly.<br /><br />I'm sure there was a great deal of allegory in this novel that escaped me, since given my unfamiliarity with Afghanistan's history, so perhaps the novel worked better on that level.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Sometimes you meet the exact tv show you've been looking for, for a long time.   I have always been attracted to the movie North By Northwest, because I loved the fifties, Cary GRANT, Eva-marie SAINT, men in suits and, of course, New York. and it was shot in 1959.    Since the very first minute I heard about Madmen, I knew I would be hypnotized by this program...NY, 1959, advertising business, women and men oh so elegant...    Not only this show is satisfying for the mind because of the looks, the atmosphere, but also the american society of the fifties, especially relations between men and women, is a character of its own right, if not THE main character of this show.    I could talk for hours about this show, but I would be wasting your time. Just be kind to yourself and find a quiet time, sit down and start to watch episode one.
0141182865|1.0|I read this when it first came out and hated it. I could not understand what the fuss was about so continued my excruciating reading to the bitter end. The main character is repulsive and un-engaging. Twenty years later a very intelligent and witty friend told me that it was his favorite book and I read it again to see what I'd missed. Nothing. I now think considerably less of my friend.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Having read Mr Browns first two books and having thoroughly enjoyed the pace and the information presented, I find myself dissapointed by this third. It was slow in parts. This may be because I was looking for the same pace as the first two. This book spent alot of time explaining theories and not telling the story. I finished wanting to know more about what happened and why the characters made certain decisions. It felt incomplete. At times it was boring and I found myself wishing the character would stop teaching. The idea of God being in all of us is one I can accept, but it does not explain the events in this book. Enjoyable but left me with questions not about theology but why the book went the way it did.

This creature goes on a killing rampage inflicting terror on those who come in contact with him. \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" went on to be a huge boxoffice smash making nearly $60,000,000 and spawning a sequel called \\"Jeppers Creepers 2\\" that was just as good as the original. Producers have stated that a Part 3 and Part 4 will be made in the very near future with Victor Salva coming aboard again as the writer and director. This 2 disc DVD set features a slew of bonuses including deleted and extended scenes, an alternate opening, director's audio commentary, a featurette called \\"A Collection Of Mini-Featurettes on the Making of The Film\\", original trailer, and more.

B00005QHV5|5.0|Certainly there are different styles of conducting. The key question always should be though \\"does it work musically?\\" The answer for Wand's Beethoven here in this set is yes. As solid a set of these symphonies as there is in circulation (possibly not for long though as it appears that RCA may have stopped printing the cd version of this set). Wand's conducting bridges old-school and modern. His tempos are contemporary in select passages, and then large and weighty in traditional ways in some others. A very interesting mix to my ears. But always consistent throughout to his overall vision at the time. And a highly successful vision on every level. That's the very definition of interpretation. Highly recommended performances in splendid recorded sound.
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|(Ed: As predicted in the following review from October 2009, \\"the Boys\\" have sold less than 250,000 units in the United States and less than 500,000 units worldwide as of late Feburary 2010. A horrible failure for a once 'relevant' group. Please enjoy my predictions below.)<br /><br />Ever since I listened to this since receiving it on October 4th, I am so suddenly reminded of every single boy band that I've heard coming out of Europe in the last 10-plus years - Westlife, Take That, Boyzone, O-Town and especially 5ive and Blue.<br /><br />And I'm sorry if so many of you so-in-touch Americans haven't heard of them, but you are the same Americans that never heard of Lady Gaga until early 2009 and Leona Lewis until she showed up on Oprah. Sad.<br /><br />The rest of the world's music is tons better than American music, hands down right now.<br /><br />Their disposable yet slightly infectious pop tunes and surgically crafted ballads designed to make 13-year-olds cry will work in Croydon and Scandanavia, and maybe even in Tokyo, but here in Chicago, or even New York or Los Angeles? The answer is as huge as the neon signs hanging off of our brick buildings.<br /><br />No.<br /><br />The copy I'm listening to is the imported version from Tokyo which has 11 songs and two bonus tracks, and here is my 10 second review for each song:<br /><br />1. Straight Through My Heart - Here is their first track... it's okay, but very European, which means it will chart in Europe for sure... but here? not so much.<br />2. Bigger - The song sounds very familiar, it sounds like year 2000 Backstreet Boys, and is this supposed to be a good thing?<br />3. Bye Bye Love - does EVERYBODY have to try and sound like Justin Timberlake? I mean, honestly... and the vocoder to make the voices sound \\"edgy\\"? So 2007.<br />4. All Of Your Life - The first Backstreet dance track, but it's a trick they've used - once again - in the PAST. This is 2009 guys, you need to really update your iPods...<br />5. If I Knew Then - more overdone heavily vocoder-influenced tripe. This is the low point of the album.<br />6. This Is Us - And then comes the official \\"ballad\\" of the album. someone needed to tell them that 1999 called and wants it's style back.<br />7. PDA - Finally, the first track that sounds almost modern - at least the subject matter is, the music still reminds me of 2003. They were close.<br />8. Masquerade - This track will be all over every discoteque in Europe and Asia very soon. It's a great track and very danceable, but it just won't work here in America unless you're playing it in some under-21 club - the subject matter is juvenile and has so many innuendos shoved into it it's only going to work for underage kids!<br />9. She's A Dream - Here's the official slow jam of the album - I just don't see anyone over the age of 18 enjoying this, but then maybe was that their intention? If that was, then you've got a hit!<br />10. Shattered - Another slow jam - more romantic goopy dribble layered on top of an overproduced synth track - ugh, my teeth hurt after biting into this syrupy one. It sounds like any other ballad that these kind of boy bands can only create.<br />11. Undone - I actually liked this track - even though most of their voices are lost under layers and layers of gauzy over-saturated music, I still could hear all four of them really trying to close out the album on a deeper note, and it works for me. I really did like it, because from what I could hear from them, the lyrics were adult (finally) and the sound was straight up 2009 Justin, which means this might become a third or fourth hit for them down the road, and only time will tell...<br /><br />Now for the bonus songs:<br /><br />12 - International Luv - Wow, I just did not like this track. Once again all I can say about 90% of this album is that it's overproduced, overvocalized and this song in particular - ugh, I just wanted to punch out the speaker. It's just plain bad and shows me why they should have stopped singing a few years ago.<br /><br />13 - Straight Through My Heart (Jason Nevins Mixshow Remix) - the remix of the first track, which will also be a pretty decent hit for them - in Europe. It has that \\"let's go dance in the disco, Ivan\\" sound to it, very \\"continental\\", but in America once again, it will hit with a huge thud.<br /><br />So, that's my review.<br /><br />I want to believe these guys, most of them in their mid-thirities, thought this \\"comeback\\" out very clearly. They hired out the best songwriters and music producers. And then they are going to have to go out and play for their fans - in small 1,000 seat arenas and clubs - definitely NOT like their glory days when they had 30,000 screaming prepubescents at their feet - these same girls all now go to work and night they sit back and watch VH-1 reality shows.<br /><br />Maybe after this album does some okay numbers (I'll predict 250,000 hard CD sales here in America in the first 6 months) they'll ditch the vocoders and synths and just play it straight and put together a real album worth listening to - Robbie Williams grew up, so can they.<br /><br />I give this album three stars, which means 1/4 star per song.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like, try out my other reviews, and sorry if I'm only being honest here, I've listened to thousands of albums spanning 70 years from over 100 countries - my ear isn't THAT tinny...emix of the first track, which will also be a pretty decent hit for them - in Europe.

B000E1NWJQ|4.0|I concur will all the reviewers who said this is one of the best \\"Pines of Rome\\" available. It still is yes. I never heard the third movement \\"Pines of the Janiculum\\" sound so fresh. \\"Fountains of Rome\\" also receives a great reading from the Reiner and the CSO. I'm withholding a star primarily for the mediocre reading of Debussy's \\"La Mer.\\" I'm afraid this piece has been bettered many times since this recording. Boulez, Martinon, Tortelier, and Dutoit own this composition as far as I'm concerned and I haven't heard it bettered by any other conductor.<br /><br />I would say that if you want to hear an outstanding \\"Pines of Rome\\" and \\"Fountians of Rome,\\" then you will find very little to complain about with this superlative recording.<br /><br />Note: I have not heard the SACD layer of this recording, but the CD layer sounds fantastic.
B000058T5E|5.0|I've noticed way too often that many people tend to judge artist from the point of their own musicial tastes. All I wish to add is this. NO ONE CAN PLAY THE GUITAR LIKE JEFF BECK, period. There are many great players out there, we all have our favorites, but it bothers me that some people who can't even play an instrument judge those who do as if their opinion actually means anything. I've played the guitar for many years and I think that Beck's playing is exceptional, Great! And those of us who have tried (hard), can't seem to come close to his mastery of his instrument. If he tries new things, fine. Most others don't, just reliving their past glory. If you like an idea that someone like Beck tries or not, that's okay. Just don't judge it as if you can play that well. Beck is one of a kind and NO ONE sounds like him. In my eyes, that makes him and his playing exceptional. One has to appreciate and respect that. \\"You had it coming\\", is a fine album! Play it and enjoy it! That's all..

B000002P2V|4.0|One of the most ironic songs in the history of rock has to be The Who's \\"The Music Must Change.\\"  The last album by The Who with Keith Moon on drums (and in my opinion, the last real Who album), it is ironic that one of its best songs featured no percussion (apart from some walking sounds that he provided) by Keith Moon.  Sadly, the music would change in ways that none of us would wish.  Moon's death was one of a seemingly unending number of rock and roll deaths that permeated the sixties and seventies.  His was a tragic one, since he OD'd on a drug taken to combat alcoholism.  Moon's addictions always took the form of binges.  Typically, instead of the three pills that Moon was supposed to take daily, over 30 were found in his system in his autopsy.  In the circles in which I ran, the debate was always Moon versus John Bonham, the brilliant creativity and manic energy of the one versus the technical brilliance of the other.  I personally sided very slightly with Moon, maybe the first drummer who occasionally made the drums a band's lead instrument.<br /><br />Unfortunately, WHO ARE YOU? is not a perfect album.  There are some weak cuts to go along with some brilliant ones.  \\"A Trick of the Light,\\" for instance, might be my second favorite John Entwistle song (after \\"My Wife\\").  And Townshend's best songs, like \\"Sister Disco,\\" \\"Love is Coming Down,\\" \\"New Song,\\" and \\"The Music Must Change,\\" are all splendid, but even all of those, collectively, are somewhat marred by increasingly cluttered arrangements.  The Who at their best was as the most instrumentally gifted rock quartet of all time, with arguably the greatest rhythm section ever (Entwistle would certainly win any poll for the greatest bass player ever, while it would be between Moon and Bonham on drums), while Roger Daltrey is one of the greatest frontmen and lead singers ever and Townshend an excellent guitarist, one of the most important synthesizer pioneers, and one of the great songwriters ever.  They were at their best playing hard driving rock and roll, not playing highly orchestrated, overly ornate.  Even TOMMY was best performed by just the four of them, not with a backing orchestra.  So WHO ARE YOU? often sounds like the augmented version of The Who.<br /><br />Still, while there are disappointing aspects to the album, there are enough absolutely outstanding songs to indicate that the band was still one of the world's greatest bands.  Whether they would have been able to pull out of their creative strain is a question that can't be answered.  Certainly they were showing signs of strain.  Moon's decade of excess led to his death, while much the same was true of Townshend and Entwistle.  And both of the latter were complaining of significant hearing problems.  So the band was definitely showing signs of wear.  At least the band went out more or less at the top of their game.ir best playing hard driving rock and roll, not playing highly orchestrated, overly ornate.

B001TOD92C|4.0|*No way to discuss this without some potential spoilers, so be warned*<br /><br />Randy the Ram's glory days were in the mid-80s, as the cheesy graphics in the opening credits remind us, the camera panning over old pictures and tear-sheets advertising his matches. Randy's a professional wrestler, an entertainer whose body is his business, as we're reminded over and over, sometimes subtly but most of the time fairly bluntly in this very heartfelt film about his life and potential redemption. And by extension, that of the former big star who plays Randy, Mickey Rourke.<br /><br />This is Rourke's film through and through and in a year with a great many very fine male lead performances - Sean Penn in MILK and Clint Eastwood in GRAN TORINO both managed some of their very best work - this might be the best. Rourke inhabits this role like a second skin, a bruised and bloodied steroid-enhanced skin with a mind under it that is active enough but still delusional, still the video-game-playing headbanging kid of the 70s and 80s despite the adult responsibilities that he just doesn't want to face. He's too old for this world, as a heart attack early on tells him; but he's also not fit for the \\"straight\\" life of working in a grocery store and being a father either.<br /><br />Shot on Super 16MM film with a low-budget grungy vibe throughout, THE WRESTLER doesn't really do anything new apart from being (apparently) the first Hollywood drama about professional wrestling; you could slap most of the well-worn clich&eacute;s here into most films about boxing, drag racing, etc and they'd be right at home. And a lot of the subtext is pretty obvious too; when Randy falls for a stripper (Marisa Tomei who must have made a pact with the devil to look the way she does at 44) we can see pretty readily that, unspoken or not, the themes of performance vs real life, acting a part and knowing when to stop acting, responsibility in the midst of still playing the childhood dream of being the macho guy or the gorgeous babe are going to reflect equally on both stars. And Randy's attempted reconciliation with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is similarly predictable, though the scene where they go to the deserted and decrepit seaside town is pretty moving anyway.<br /><br />I really didn't like Darren Aronofsky's previous film, THE FOUNTAIN at all: pretentious, pretty for the sake of being pretty, full of grandiose ideas never really developed.  THE WRESTLER is no question an attempt to take the opposite tack, and some people are calling it pretentious for the very reason that the director is trying something different! A ludicrous criticism if you ask me, and this film has a lot in common with both the gritty street scenes of his first two films (PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM) and the overt redemptive story lines of REQUIEM.  It doesn't reach as far or as wide as any of his previous work, but in a great many respects it succeeds more fully in what it does attempt.<br /><br />So you don't go into this for originality, you go into it for great acting and verisimilitude in the decaying Jersey atmosphere, and it succeeds phenomenally in those regards. The ending will disappoint some who want easy resolutions, but if it does they weren't paying attention; there are no easy answers here, and the choice of Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song at the end ought to make that much clear. Life is hard; all Randy can do, finally, is narrow it down to the one thing he loves that never let him down, whether it kills him or not, and all we can do is savor the moment.going to reflect equally on both stars.

B000001ELB|5.0|By 1978, KISS became one of the world's biggest rock and roll bands. That April, their record label Casablanca Records issued a 2-LP best of to commemorate KISS' fifth anniversary as a recording and touring act entitled Double Platinum.<br />Double Platinum happened because tensions within KISS were at an all time high with rumors of the band breaking up. Casablanca Records chief Neil Bogart wanted to put out something to commemorate KISS' five years as a band so they went and recorded a new version of \\"Strutter\\" for this double greatest hits package. It's not a bad re-make. I always like it.<br />As for the rest of the collection, you get the original versions of \\"Do You Love Me?\\", \\"Let Me Go Rock and Roll\\", \\"God of Thunder\\", \\"Hotter Than Hell\\", \\"I Want You\\", \\"Deuce\\", \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\", \\"Beth\\", \\"Makin' Love\\", \\"C'mon and Love Me\\" and \\"Cold Gin\\".<br />Then some of the tracks are either remixes or sped up versions. The excellent re-mixes are \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" (Peter's singing at the end differed than original) \\"Calling Dr Love\\" (different outro and intro), \\"Firehouse\\" (which is a semi-tone faster and sans the sirens at the end), \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"She\\" (interspersed with Rock Bottom intro and ending with repeat of first section) and \\"Black Diamond\\" which IMHO is better than version on first KISS album IMHO.<br />After its completion, lead guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss toyed with leaving the band for solo careers as the band was filming the made for TV movie KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park that spring (it debuted in October, 1978 on NBC). Ace no-showed some scenes during filming and Peter refused to show up to re-record his voice for the movie. Then manager Bill Aucoin, Casablanca Records chief Neil Bogart and rhythm guitarist/singer Paul Stanley and bass Player Gene Simmons got together and told Ace and Peter not to resign but all four members of KISS make solo albums. Criss and Frehley liked the idea and stayed in the band.<br />Double Platinum was released in April 1978. It quickly went Platinum, reached the US Top 20 and also helped squelch rumors that the band was breaking up.<br />Want the best of KISS, buy either this or KISS Gold 1974-82.

0375836675|4.0|Markus Zusak is a very gifted man who has excellent control of imagery in his writing. I enjoyed this novel simply for his talent and style. As he did in his much better \\"The Book Thief\\" Zusak writes some sentences that are nothing short of breathtaking.<br />However, unlike \\"The Book Thief\\" this is not a novel that held my rapt attention. I enjoyed the book, and at times found some of its messages rather inspiring, but I just was not gripped. I am still not sure why, and the fault may be with me and not the text at all?<br />One of the major strengths of this novel is the voice of its protagonist Ed Kennedy. Ed is a great first person narrator and he and his wonderfully crafted dog, the Doorman, are the book's main strengths. Ed's dry sense of humor is at times hysterical. The subtle changes in Ed's speech and actions as he becomes a better person throughout the novel is also well done, and artfully rendered. Ed becomes a better person by degrees, which is how it usually happens.<br />The let down of the text is the didactic ending. It is a clever premise, despite what some reviews posted have said, but it just comes across as too preachy.<br />Regardless, this is advertised as a young adult novel, and I think that less mature readers would love it. Plus, it has a good message, and the world cannot get enough of those.

0385737947|4.0|Let me start off by asserting that I'm an adult, and this book is aimed at teen readers.     The book centers around a boy, Thomas, who is placed into the Glade: an area at the center of a maze, where there are other boys living. None of them can remember who they are or any details about their lives or where they came from.    I found the story to be clever, and engrossing. It's a strange place and situation, and somewhat paradoxical. A place where the boys have to govern and care for themselves, and where the (currently unknown) people who placed them there do care for them somewhat, sending supplies etc. as needed. However, these same people allow bad things to happen to the boys. Awful creatures roam the maze, injuring or killing any boy that happens to get too close. Many boys die, horribly, in their efforts to solve and exit the maze. What kind of society allows this to happen to children? Why are they doing this? What's so special about these kids in the first place? There is a lot to think about, and most questions aren't answered by the books end. I imagine that many people will obtain the sequels when available.    The book gets off to a rough start. That is, the writing style felt rough. I don't know if this is because the author took a little while to \\"find his groove\\", as the saying goes, or if it's done deliberately, as a reflection of the confusion Thomas feels when he is first placed into the Glade. Regardless, things smooth out and the story picks up. I did find the author's choice of vocabulary to be a little awkward. In particular, the characters use the work \\"klunk\\" in place of the \\"s-word\\", and \\"shuck\\" is apparently used in place of the \\"f-word\\". I'm assuming this is done so there is no obscenity in the book, and I applaud the author for making the effort. However, it didn't fit. While the kids in the Glade can't remember their past, they can pretty much remember everything else (like what pizza is, for instance). You can't convince me that a bunch of teenage boys would in a short period of time decide to forgo traditional swear words and create new ones.    The book also progresses at what felt to me like a rapid pace. Again, I don't know if this is just the author's style or a reflection on how life in the Glade \\"picks up\\" and things start changing quickly, once Thomas arrives.    All in all, I think it's a great story. I'm looking forward to the sequels.

B0017ANAZO|3.0|\\"The Women\\" was a dollar rental from that trusty RedBox that our grocery stores around here have.  What a relief!  The story is centered around Meg Ryan's character- who finds out that her loving and doting husband is cheating on her.  Meg Ryan and her beautiful hair and angelic face- cheating on HER?  Meg has a band of girlfriends including gruff and streetwise Jada Pinkett-Smith, goofy Debra Messing and smart and sophisticated Annette Benning.  So, where does that leave the other famous actress on the cover?  Eva Mendes is the mistress.  Of course.  With those curves and that mouth... Fine, I can see why.<br /><br />But!  Meg Ryan's girls flock around her and push her to do the dirty work that she is usually too feeble to do.  She screams and swears and gets her nails done!  Meg Ryan has always been a little aloof in her movies, but I'd be okay to admit that this movie is one of her finer performances.  I think between her and Annette Benning, I'm hard pressed who made this film the measely 3 stars that it is.  Without them, the whole thing would have been a disaster.<br /><br />The story is overdone and we've seen all angles of this thing, but... I was willing to watch someone do it one more time.  \\"The Women\\" didn't show me anything new.  Nothing surprised me.  Meg Ryan did a stellar performance of being the doting and happy wife, to the angry and depressed, yet ANGRY adulteree (is that a word?).  I enjoyed watching her transformation.<br /><br />The director did not use Debra Messing's natural ability to entertain, make jokes (yes), but also to offer insight.  I usually enjoy Messing's work, but this one just left me thinking she is entirely too quirky and had no serious moments in the entire movie.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, I'll admit, I haven't seen her in many movies, but this one was overacted and I couldn't wait for her to get off the screen.  Obviously she isn't a street person in real life, but I am not supposed to know that, as the viewer.  Not a good performance at all.  The few times that Eva Mendes was on screen, she seemed surly and pouting, and at times bitchy- but rarely did I see her account for her actions- especially when Meg Ryan actually confronts her.  Eva is hardly in the movie at all, which for this particular film, is a blessing.  She would have only botched it up more.<br /><br />This gets a three stars.  If Meg Ryan and Annette Benning hadn't done such a great job, it would have gotten a two stars for the script writing and the others overacting.  It was bearable, but not something I will probably ever watch again.imes that Eva Mendes was on screen, she seemed surly and pouting, and at times bitchy- but rarely did I see her account for her actions- especially when Meg Ryan actually confronts her.

0439023483|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins was a wonderful book.  I immediately loved Katniss Everdeen, the 16 year old narrator who hunts and provides for her mother and sister after a tragic accident that took her father's life.  Katniss is strong, smart, and curious about the world.  She lives in a coal miner's village in a time in the future where the government as we know it is replaced by the Capital: a rich and very powerful group of people who dictate which districts perform which tasks and who will live and die.  Defy the Capital, and you will surely be punished.  Between giving your tongue, losing your already small rations of food, or death.<br /><br />To express their power, the Capital holds annual Hunger Games where they choose 24 entrants (tributes) in total, two from each 12 districts across the country- ages 12 to 18 on a random name-drawing action. Depending on your age and the need to volunteer more \\"raffle tickets\\" with your name on them to provide more food for your family, your name can be entered as low as 1 to as high as 60 times per year.  Doesn't sound too bad, does it?<br /><br />But these aren't average games.  They're called the Hunger Games.  People all over the country watch live footage as the tributes have to fight to the death.  Only one survivor is allowed.  The bloodier, the better.  The tributes are in training for about one- two weeks before they are thrown into an arena and expected to put on a good show.  Some kids are from district 1, which is loaded with rich and well-off people.  Some kids are from district 12, which is full of skin-and-bones people and lack of food.  But, in the Hunger Games- it is definitely survival of the fittest.  You either have to outweigh, out throw, or out smart the others to win the challenge.  If you don't win, you are dead.  Not only are you dead, but your entire family and village back home must watch as you are killed.<br /><br />Picture the ancient times of the Colleseum, Gladiator, etc.  People are dying for entertainment, and to prove that the Capital is still in charge of your life.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is full of twists and turns that I did not expect.  Human compassion is expressed very well, and so are the confused feelings of teenagers.  The book was very fast paced and full of surprises.  I was fully engaged through the whole story and obviously crave more when I was done.<br /><br />Book 2 is on its way in the mail to me as we speak. :)nt, and to prove that the Capital is still in charge of your life.    \\"The Hunger Games\\" is full of twists and turns that I did not expect.

0312370849|4.0|I commend the author for shedding light on these horrific events of 1942 and educating people about the part French government took in assisting Nazis in killing thousands of Jews and showing indifference and ignorance of people.      The first half of the book was emotionally difficult to read as the story was told through the eyes of a little Jewish girl Sarah and described the unimaginable horror Jews were put through.  The second half of the book lost the voice of Sarah and the rest of the story was told by Julia (an American living in Paris).      Putting Holocaust side by side with some banal marital drama of the main character Julia trivialized the events.  It diluted the main focus of the book - the events of 1942, with too much of irrelevant drama of Julia's life. Who cares about Julia's cheating husband when previous chapters just described babies being ripped out of mothers' arms, and thousands sent to die.  I found myself skipping ahead and trying to find out what happened to Sarah and her family.      However, it is a very important book and everyone needs to read it.

B00009XITP|5.0|I loved this movie.  Much more than I expected and have watched it more than several times.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|First, the music: It sounds like the natural progression/evolution of Jerry Cantrell. I love it. I love everything about it. Mostly forceful, sometimes gentle, always powerful. Whale sized hooks. I've always loved Jerry's voice, and now I'm really digging Williams's, but the best part is how they blend. I actually like it better than how Jerry & Layne sounded together. This is not \\"I'm right/you're wrong\\", it's my opinion. I'm not a lyrics guy. Haven't been since high school. I listen to the instrument of the voice. One of THE main reasons, (among others), that AIC and King's X are two of my favorite bands is they can be so heavy, but they have an incredibly melodic vocal style. To me there's stuff reminiscent of classic AIC, of Jerry's solo work, and then new sounds. At least part of the new stuff has to be a direct result of William's involvement. I look forward to hearing more original stuff from him. But however the music got to where it is, it's a positive. Four guys making great music. I have to give ups to Sean & Mike. Great ryhthm section. I play bass & drums, and I can testify that their contribution to the overall sound is substantial.    Now for the baggage: I'm truly sorry Layne died. But when a band goes on without or replaces a key member, I try to judge the new incarnation on it's own. AC/DC - good either way, Deep Puple - like 'em WAY better w/Steve Morse, Faith No More - like 'em better without Jim Martin, David Lee over Sammy, and my favorite band, (who you've probably never heard of), Spock's Beard - still love 'em, but I wish Neal was still there. I think The Beatles are the only band for which I couldn't have dealt with a lineup change. Alice in Chains - just one album into Mach II, I'd call it even so far. But for some people this is obviously hallowed ground. I respect them for being such ardent fans. But please try to take into account the other guys contribution to the original Alice In Chains, especially the fact the Jerry wrote more than anybody else, and was responsible for a large part of their vocal sound. These guys gave us all a wealth of meaningful music, for which I'm still very much appreciative. They may or may not go by AIC for name recognition. I don't care. AT ALL. IF they are, they have the right. They deserve to do whatever they can to provide for their own. But if you can't relate to that, then just remember if they make money making good music, then they can afford to KEEP making good music.
0393316041|4.0|I liked this book so much that I bought a copy for my son.  The book provides an insight into the workings of our scientific community as well as this particular scientist.  Mr. Feynman's curiousity, persistence and intelligence demonstrated in his choices were inspiring.  It's a great read.
0385504225|2.0|I have been intrigued by Dan Brown's previous works but this one left me flat.  It is a compendium of old New Age beliefs and a rehashing of perhaps America's oldest conspiracy theory groups: the Masons.  The professional reviews cited earlier reveal that most professional critics have not read much more than the title page, back cover, and opening chapter paragraphs.  The formula for plot and character is now trite: take the lead man (Robert Langdon), get the uber-smart woman (Katherine), the mysterious friend (Peter), and a psychopathic enemy (the vengeful deluded son of Peter) and plop them all down pat in a new but all to familiar setting.  Mr. Brown is much to young in the book world to set a P. D. James pattern of sameness earned by long years of mystery writing.      The convoluted information may be new to many readers concerning the pseudo-science of Noetics and paranormal research.  The PEAR project was shut down some time ago due to a lack of any verifiablle scientific findings and being a waste of valuable research dollars.  Noetics takes a non-natural subject matter and subjects it to the verifiable testing tenants of naturalistic materialistic science and asks us to suspend our belief in the verifiable world to adopt a pseudo-belief in those things that cannot and will most likely never be proved or serve any value.  Reader beware: Mr. Brown makes the human the edifice of evolution's accidental artifice and rehashes the now discreited maxim that ancient human thinkers were capable of far more than their world context and understanding allowed.  Weighing the supposed \\"soul\\" of the human, come on Mr. Brown!      The best things to arise from this work are: (1) an increased U. S. Capitol tour business; (2) the continued flowering of solipsistic, tragic, and non-skeptical belief in pseudo-science; and (3) the explanation of the derivation of \\"sincere.\\"  As to this book, it does not fit the term \\"sincere\\" as there is much too much wax stuck in the cracks ofthis paltry underlying sculpture not yet fit for public viewing. It represents the author's only goal of taking the money to the bank through profiteering on cheap literary devices, conspiracy theories, pseudo-science, and Barnum's \\"there's one [a fool] born every minute\\" philosopy.  Well, I've been fooled enough by Dan Brown.  This will be the last time I spend money to read such drivel and banality.

B0029XFNA8|1.0|Many individuals at FOX and AMAZON don't know how to treat a classic film - especially a Christmas Classic!!! Amazon fails to list the major stars in the film but lists minor characters that most people would not even recognize. When I first read the actors I though it was the wrong film but did remember that Jack  Albertson was in the film a brief minute at the Post Office and in 1947 was not a major star or well known.    The film is listed on the holder as the colorized version - it is not - thank goodness. But, why didn't Fox include both the colorized version for those who prefer this and the BW version as the soon to be released IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE!    The Blu-Ray version is a rip-off. The transfer is not as good as the standard version. The opening scene is so dark. It was actually difficult to get the disc to start. The set up is awakard and difficult to select different choices available.    I realy big disappointment!!! I hope Fox does a better job on the thousands of classics they still need to release in Blu-Ray. Waiting to see the sky in Leave Her to Heaven as Gene Tierney spreads her fathers ashes in HD.
B002JTMNX2|4.0|After a few years of touring, Mick Jones has finally got the reformed \\"Foreigner\\" in the studio to record new music. For \\"Can't Slow Down\\" they went the Walmart exclusive route. Besides giving us a cd a new material, you also get a live dvd from the 2009 european tour, looks like it was part of a festival show cause it's daylight most of their set. You also get a greatest hits disc, with 10 classic Foreigner songs remixed. So, you get a lot of bang for your buck. The new album is good, sounds good while it's playing. It's not as memorable as Foreigner first four albums, but it's better than the ones that followed. There's also a rerecording of \\"Fool for You Anyway\\", a song that originally appeared on the first album. Overrall, between the two cds and dvds any Foreigner should be happy with this purchase, cause for the price even if you don't like the new album you'll enjoy the dvd or the old hits.

From the arena rock song 'You Don't Belong' to the catchy club song 'Supernatural' to the most awesome song 'September' Daughtry returns with the most amazing CD yet, yes, it beats their deluxe edition CD of their last album. All the songs you will love, you don't need to skip any of the songs. I think the songs which are the best are You Don't Belong, Life After You, No Surprise, Every Time You Turn Around, September, What I Meant to Say, Open Up Your Eyes, Tennessee Line, Ghost of Me, Learn My Lesson, Call Your Name and Supernatural.  :)     Buy this album! It's Amazing.

1594488878|4.0|Nick Hornby's newest novel, Juliet, Naked, is about has-been musician Tucker, Duncan, the man who's obsessed with him, and Annie, Duncan's long-term girlfriend, who finds herself in the middle.<br /><br />Hornbyesque:<br />- As always, Hornby puts a great deal of care and effort into constructing realistic, dynamic characters. I recently saw him at a reading, and I could tell how much he thought about each of them, even the most minor, like Annie's friend Ros. He knows them, and has created them, as actual people.<br />- Also character related, is the fact that everyone can connect to someone in the novel. Perhaps you've been been a crazed fan, someone who failed to reach their potential, or stuck in a dead-end relationship. Above all, everyone knows what it feels like to have made mistakes and want to fix them before it's too late.<br />- The sly wit reminiscent of High Fidelity and How to Be Good is once again present (I felt it took a bit of a hiatus in the last novel, A Long Way Down). Smart, British, biting humor.<br />- Hornby writes with an intelligent simplicity- he respects his readers enough to realize that they don't need three pages describing the dreary sea or the seaside museum Annie works in. He realizes they have brains and allows them the freedom to create their own pictures.<br /><br />But...<br />- I feel Juliet, Naked slightly misses the bar raised so very high by High Fidelity, About a Boy, and How to Be Good.<br />- I don't want to give anything away, but I had a few issues with the ending. I realize the point (so don't start lambasting me under the comments for \\"not getting it\\"), but I just didn't appreciate it.<br /><br />Great read for those who love Hornby and those who are reading him for the first time. Also, if you ever get a chance to attend a reading I recommend you go.

The \\"deleted scenes\\" the \\"alternate ending\\" and other material make this a well-worth purchase for any film buff or persons interested in Disney and animation.

B000EHSVSC|5.0|When the United States was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill broke open a bottle of champagne and asked the men with him to toast with him to victory.  His men were stunned and thought he was crazy.  Finally, one of them asked him why.<br /><br />Churchill responded, \\"America is like a giant boiler. Light a fire under it, and there is no limit to the amount of heat that it can generate.\\"<br /><br />Of course, every boiler needs to be lighted, and December 7, 1941, the \\"Day that would live in infamy\\" would be the event that would nudge neutral America into World War II.<br /><br />There have been several films made about the attack on Pearl Harbor, but to my mind, none parallel the authenticity of \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"  Perhaps one of the biggest reasons why it was such a successful, and for the most part, historically accurate film, is because the film was a collaboration of American and Japanese film-makers. In short, you got the perspective and events from BOTH sides.  This has rarely happened in film, and it is what makes \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" stand apart from all the rest.<br /><br />It seems that war is inevitable, and the United States have invoked an embargo against Japan for actions taken in China.  This becomes a critical issue for Japan, since they desperately need these resources to keep their war effort going.  While the United States is attempting to resolve the matter peacefully, it becomes apparent to Japan that war is inevitable; and perhaps even to members of the intelligence community in the U.S., war is becoming more and more evident for America too.<br /><br />Japan realizes that their only chance to defeat the United States is to first wipe out the American Pacific Fleet, which has since been moved from San Diego to Honolulu, Hawaii.  Therefore, and elaborate plan is called for, and Japan calls upon one of their master strategists to plan for such an attack.  Everything is carefully calculated down to the last detail.  It's actually very intriguing to see how the plan was devised from the Japanese perspective.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Americans are more concerned about sabotage from local Japanese than they are about an actual attack.  Therefore, the airfields have moved their planes closer together, to make it more difficult for a saboteur to attack.  However, the U.S. intelligence community is gathering evidence that suggests that Japan is going to attack.  Ironically, Lt. Colonel Bratton is initially off by one week.  There are so many instances and evidence to suggest that the U.S. had ample evidence to presume that there would be an attack, and yet so many precautions were never implemented.  In short, Japan would catch the U.S. with their pants down.<br /><br />The film has a top-rate cast on both sides, from Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel to Jason Robards as General Short, and So Yamamura as Admiral Yamamoto to Takahiro Tamura as flight Commander, Fuchida who leads the air strike.  Yamamoto is a man who studied in the U.S. and desperately asks his men not to underestimate the Americans.  He predicts that they can fight the United States for about a year.  Yamamoto understood that when Americans come together, there is nothing to stop them (thus, the giant boiler!).<br /><br />The film expertly moves back and forth between the Americans and the Japanese.  It's like watching a chess match, and seeing each side make their moves which finally lead up to the conclusion of the Japanese surprise attack.<br /><br />Many veterans of the the attack from both sides were consulted to try and make the film as accurate as possible.<br /><br />The only viable success that America could claim from the attack was that none of their aircraft carriers were present.  Yamamoto already understood that victory in naval battles was nearly entirely dependent upon the airplane.  Battleship battles were a thing of the past, and you can see his disappointment in hearing that, although they wreaked extensive damage, the primary targets were not there, which leads him to utter his famous words of, \\"I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant, and fill him with a terrible resolve.\\"<br /><br />If you truly want to bask in the historical accuracy of a film about Pearl Harbor, you can't do any better then \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"  At nearly 3 hours, the film leaves nothing out.  There isn't a single scene that does not belong, and even though we already know what is going to happen, and what the conclusion will be, the film keeps the suspense and intrigue building and building right up to the attack.  Now, that's brilliant film-making!ter his famous words of, \\"I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant, and fill him with a terrible resolve.\\"    If you truly want to bask in the historical accuracy of a film about Pearl Harbor, you can't do any better then \\"Tora!

B0012Q732O|3.0|If you can get past the facts of history, the movie can be entertaining. Sabre tooth tigers and wooley mammoths were long extinct when the pyramids were built, after 10,000 B.C. The graphics were fun and the hero of the film comes out ok. So to enjoy this flick, just let go of the facts, like Hollywood and the major networks news organizations do.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ray, you are the best thing!! There's really nothing more to say. Love this album. It's a shame Ray isn't more widely heard and appreciated.. because his music is simply awesome.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|this new cd is titled Quite nights and is a great late nite listen.  this new cd is not supposed to get you on your feet dancing, it is a mood cd excellant for late nite relaxing or romancing.all of these songs are classics and Diana does her usual professional take on each one.if you need more exitement some of her previous cd's  should do the trick otherwise this is a great stress buster.  thanks Diane.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|A logical step for this incredible band. When a band is as consistently awesome as DT is, it's no longer a matter of better or worse, per se. What IS important is their uncanny ability to continue surprising their listeners while remaining within the realm of their style, genre, etc. Unfortunately, I feel that many fans of this band fail to recognize this and end up getting fussy and even indignant when DT doesn't COMPLETELY reinvent itself with each forthcoming album. For those of you who haven't yet purchased this record on account of the negative reviews, hesitate no longer. This is a terrific record which displays Dream Theater's constant evolution.     For a while, the lyrics for Count of Tuscany ruined the song for me, but I've since changed my mind about that and now fully appreciate what the song is about.    P.S. Best band photo of DT, period.
0385504225|5.0|This is Dan Brown's best work ever, I found it riviting, didn't want to put it down, lots of twists and turns, give you new aspect on our founding fathers, facts in front, you pick the fiction.
B002C6K7NU|2.0|As a fan of the 'riginal Skynyrd, I find this album to be mediocre, but it fits right in with today's music.  Don't let me deter you from getting it though, whatever floats your boat.  (Jumpin' on the bandwagon sells albums, I guess.)    They should probably write an angry answer song to Ronnie's \\"Saturday Night Special\\" or \\"All I Can Do Is Write About It\\", because this band has completely morphed into something completely devoid of the spirit of the original Skynyrd.    Rossington and Collins had it right, originally, retiring the Skynyrd name.  Then, the 10-anniversary rolled around...    (I would suggest [[ASIN:B00001XDS6 Solo Flytes]] instead of this album, for a REALLY good overview of post-Skynyrd songs.)    I wonder what Ronnie would say?    R.I.P. Lynyrd Skynyrd 1970-1977    \\"Well, hand guns are made for killin'  They ain't no good for nothin' else  And if you like to drink your whiskey  You might even shoot yourself  So why don't we dump 'em people  To the bottom of the sea  Before some ole fool come around here  Wanna shoot either you or me\\"
B000003N7Y|5.0|Many albums by this master have an overriding concept. Take [[ASIN:B000003N81 The Black Saint & The Sinner Lady]]. This album, recorded in 1963 as was Black Saint does not.<br /><br />Which does not reduce it one bit. This may \\"just\\" a group of songs, but with Mingus, that is ample to chew. This features blues and Ellington covers. Mingus also rerecorded \\"Better Get It In Yer Soul,\\" a blues he had first cut for Atlantic in the 1950s with a small group.<br /><br />Like Ray Chalres and John Coltrane, Mingus must have realized ABC--who then owned Impulse!--had more money to spread than Atlantic, a New York indie labal in 1963. This is a big band album. The writting is great, but it is the lush orchestrations that warm Mingus' pieces.<br /><br />This is one of the best and most cozy big band sessions I have ever heard. Remember that most music buffs-apt to buy this-were using tube amps in their homes in the early 60s, and this is tailored as such. If you are fortunate enough to still use tubes--now a niche for audiophiles--you should get this for sound reasons alone.<br /><br />But if you have a Micky Mouse record player, you still want this to be spinning on it.
B002K0WBYG|4.0|I had a fun time watching this movie, and the film has the kind of recognition that EVERY single customer that saw it screening knew they wanted to watch it (again for most of them). The Blu is definitely a mixed bag though. I believe everyone knows of the story by now, and watching these two popular eye-candy actors do their thing keeps the masses entertained as they fall from hate to love of one another.<br /><br />The Blu clarity has the high budget feel throughout, but in this case to a fault. The green screen coloration is prevalent in any outdoor scene, at times almost appearing deliberately fake (the boat scene after she falls in the water was so apparent you just end up looking past it and focus on the heartfelt moment as was intended). On the second viewing I listened to the writer/director commentary to find out why they shot in Massachusetts instead of Alaska, and as usual it boiled down to money. They did get a few mountain panoramas but the 1080 only gets to show the real ones for a minute or two total. The 5.1 DTS sounds great and gets utilized the best during the strip/bar scene (hilarious sequence). The supplements are bittersweet and include:<br />* The alternate ending. A way different style of ending that had some hilarious actor(s) completely deleted from the film. It is without the effects so you immediately notice how much green screen was being used - we are talking walls and cranes worth.<br />* 6 minutes of deleted scenes. Understandable.<br />* Set Antics as hosted by Aasif Mandvi. 6 minutes worth, you might get a couple chuckles out of it.<br />* Digital copy of the film on disc 2.<br />* Commentary by Fletcher and Chiarelli. They get some (sporadic) decent material on there, and by their own admission they admit theirs is how not to do a commentary, but I had to hear all the whys on filming location and volumes of effects for a romcom.<br />The menu is a corny animated style, but all of the selections have an on/off for commentaries.<br /><br />I laughed and enjoyed the film, but the solid clarity shows all of the fine line failings throughout as each window background and exterior shot involving mountains becomes glaringly fake at the seams. Not a 5-star benchmark Blu (what should have been had it actually been filmed in Alaska) so four for the film and supplements., but the solid clarity shows all of the fine line failings throughout as each window background and exterior shot involving mountains becomes glaringly fake at the seams.

0307386171|4.0|Once again McEwan demonstrates his considerable literary talent in this short novel. McEwan  is a master at developing an armature or structure in his novels on which he fully explores the emotions and aspirations of his characters but also allows for a building of suspense. In this novel he does this by starting at the honeymoon of a young couple but then constructing their pasts and motivations step by step to take us back to the scene of their first night together on their honeymoon.  The two primary characters are described so well as to making the reader feel they know them both, but the reader is also given knowledge of their pasts and their state of mind that the couple has not share with each other. Edward is from modest means who  is very bright and has earned an academic degree whereas Florence is from a more prominent family with social and economic connections. This is especially the case for Florence for she holds back a secret from Edward throughout their courtship that could have disastrous results. The marital partnership requires more candor and knowing of the other party than Florence is able to muster. The twist to this novel is that McEwan is able to keep the reader on the knife edge between break-through reconciliation and frustrated exasperation in the case of this young couple.    This young couple professes to love one another but McEwan explores how that love may in fact be projections of the self, of imagination, of loving an image or dream of another person but not the full person. Sexual intercourse is a prerequisite for full knowledge and McEwan explores how sexual knowledge can break through the dreamy projections one may have built in their mind of their loved one.  By saving sexual intercourse until after a long courtship, this couple has put too many chips onto one roll of the dice.   As is the case with all McEwan's novels, it is beautifully written. When I read his work it is almost feels effortless to me, as if I am reading my ownthoughts. He does this by careful words crafting where in the final piece, not a single word is out of place or ill chosen. That he combines this skill with masterful character development and sequencing of plot makes him one of the most outstanding living writers.
0446402397|5.0|Someone is killing children in Stalinist Russia. At that time news of a mass murderer of children wouldn't look good in the government run state so it is ignored or classified as individual crimes.<br />Leo Davidov is an officer of the Misistry of State Security. One of his men tell him that the man's son has been murdered and found naked, by the train tracks. When Leo begins his investigation, he's ordered to pay the situation no mind.<br /><br />Vasili Nikiyin is Leo's conniving assistant. Whatever he could do to get ahead, he'd do. This Machiavelian approach didn't stop at lies and misdirections.  He manages to get Leo and Leo's wife, Raisa, ordered out of Moscow and sent to a lowly job in the outlying district.<br /><br />Here, Leo finds two more murdered children. He persuades his superior, Maj. Kuzmin to allow him to continue his investigation. Kuzmin tells Leo that he's on his own if he gets caught but Kuzmin makes unoffical stops at towns along the railroad and finds that 44 children have been murdered.<br />Leo is progressing with his investigation and someone denounces him. Vasili puts them on a train with other people sent to hard labor camps.<br />How will Leo survive this disgrace and solve the crime?<br />Will Vasili have his complete revenge and see that Leo is murdered?<br />These are some of the questions that are answered in the conclusion of this excellent thriller.<br /><br />Leo is one of the best protagonists that I've ever enjoyed reading. Vasili is such an evil protagonist, I'm surprised I didn't begin hissing when he made his way on the pages.<br />The book has been nominated or won so many awards that critics agree with my assessment.<br />Here is a list of awards:<br />\\"Los Angeles Times\\" Book Prize<br />Booker Prize - Longlist<br />\\"The Strand\\" Critics Award<br />Anthony Award - nominee<br />Barry Award - nominee<br />Dilys Award - nominee<br />Thriller Award best 1st Novel.
0385504225|5.0|I think this is a great book! In my opinion The Lost Symbol is just as good as The Da Vinci Code and Angels And Demons. This book is a real page-turner. I actually like the short chapters because Dan Brown always leaves you wanting to read the next chapter and find out what happens next. That is why his books are page-turners. I am definitely satisfied with this book!
0061706620|4.0|The book provides a good background for understanding the reasons behind what the boys had to grow up with and gives an interesting insight to things 'SUPERNATURAL' If you love the series as I do,the book is a worthwhile purchase,especially while we are waiting for the new series to come over here.
B002CAWNEM|4.0|This movie wasn't the greatest movie.  The plot has been done time and time again.  None of the actors other than Beyonce and Ali Larter went above and beyond performance wise.  They were believable, I actually believed Ali Larter was crazy and Beyonce was going to kill her.  Those two actors and their performances is the reason I am giving it a 4, if they weren't in it, it would never of made theaters.  I have seen that guy Idris in a couple of English movies, as well as RockNRolla, he's done some good stuff.  He did a decent job in this movie but it looks like he is to aware of the camera's.  You will have to watch his face and see what you think.  I must add Jerry O'Connell is a tool and it is shows why he doesn't get much work.  He plays the same part in every single movie, it gets annoying    The movie was all right, it kept my attention the entire film and I would recommend seeing it.  If you are either a Beyonce or Ali Larter fan you will like this movie and I recommend buying it.    If you are not, get it on netflix or wait until it comes out on cable.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|Yet another beautiful recording by Mark Knopfler.  I can't say anything that hasn't already been said by previous reviewers, so I'll just tell you to buy it.  In fact, buy all of his music (solo, Dire Straits and soundtracks).  It is some of the most beautiful music you will ever hear.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|As the ultimate Madonna fan that i believe myself to be i felt it my duty to review this item. First of all i notice alot of customers complaining about the picture quality...personally i thought it was pretty damn good...i notice alot of u guys saying you watched yours on a blue ray player now i'm not a big techno buff but i'm guessing a regular DVD is probably not that compatible with a blu ray player..and that may be your problem.    Second of all i notice alot of complaints because there are still several music videos missing.But even with the missing videos we're still getting over 3 hours worth of entertainment that alone is worth the price. I think there is something to be said about the fact that even with the missing videos this is still the longest and most thorough video collection for a recording artist that i've ever seen and believe me i've bought quite a few.    All complaints aside i am extremly happy to finally have almost all of my favorite Madonna videos in one place..i will however agree with the people who said the packaging looked kinda generic...it does i wasn't very impressed.     P.S. I saw some complaints in particular for the pic quality in the Erotica video..its supposed to be grainy like that its supposed to have like and underground, snuff film kinda vibe...if i'm not mistaken most of it was shot with a handheld while she was taking pics for the SEX book.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was very disappointed in Dan Brown's latest book.  I felt he had fallen into the trap of becoming a \\"formula writer.\\"  The characters were just recreations of those in \\"The DiVinci Code.\\"  He spent the first half of the book wandering around in a maze and the second half chronicling an obvious madman.  Even his \\"the god within\\" secret was anticlimactic and disappointingly unoriginal.
B00005R23Z|1.0|Let me come right out and say it--I hated this movie.  Hated, hated, hated.  Okay, that might be a little too harsh.  After all, it's not as bad as genital herpes, swallowing cat piss, or watching a Michael Bay flick.  But as far as genius sci-fi goes, this is inferior, an imposter, an in-valid.<br /><br />Gattaca does have an excellent premise, and has garnered quite a cult following.  Manipulating genetics to form the perfect human being is an intriguing concept.  Utilizing Science to eliminate birth defects and create a person less susceptible to diseases or illnesses is a possibility that many might consider justifiable.  On the other hand, tampering with nature is bound to have its repurcussions.<br /><br />My main problem with this story is the fact it tries to pound one element into your head over and over again and never offers much of anything else.  A man born all-naturale wants to have the same priviledges as his genetic superiors.  For the first half, it worked admirably.  Then it started to get pretty dang stagnant.  Still it kept riding this one-trick pony till the cows came home.  Not sure what that means really, except I was annoyed and bored to freakin tears.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke does a decent job.  But how many fingerprint id's, blood samples, and heart tests can a man fake?  Then they had his face plastered EVERYWHERE, and nobody could make the connection he was a murder suspect?  PLEASE!!!!  I don't care how blind your ego makes you, it is completely obvious!<br /><br />Plus the differences between the valids &n in-valids were blown way outta proportion.  Granted, he shouldn't be able to run as fast or swim as far.  But he can't cross the freakin street?  This movie might be making a statement how ridiculous prejudices are, which does of course carry some merit.  But I felt this was way too heavy-handed.<br /><br />And possibly one of the worst scenes I can recall off the top of my head--the party date with Uma.  She realizes he is a murder suspect and has been deceiving her, watches him beat down some cop, forces her to run off with him, and then they make love under a gorgeous starlit sky.  Atrocious!<br /><br />Another thing I didn't care for--this had relatively few cool futuristic gadgets and gizmos.  The cars looked retro, but they made a cool humming sound as they sped past.  The cops didn't have any laser guns or sweet tracking devices.  Nobody had cell phones.  No teleportation tubes with dialethium crystals or electronic floatation devices?  Nothing really.  Bummer.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm sorry.  I'm rambling.  But seriously, I don't put this anywhere close to the elite sci-fi masterpieces.  In fact, it is one of my least favorites of the genre.him beat down some cop, forces her to run off with him, and then they make love under a gorgeous starlit sky.  Atrocious!

0385504225|5.0|This book is set in Washington DC and deals with Masonic lore and myth.  Mr. Brown dealt fairly with this great organization and for that I am grateful. If you are a Dan Brown fan, then I don't need to sell you on this book, but if you haven't read Mr. Brown and like a good solid mystery, then this book will hold your attention and keep you interested right to the end of the book.  It's a keeper.
1906694176|4.0|Good to see the entrepreneurial spirit hasn't been beaten out of Americans yet and people are importing the British version. What were the publishers thinking? That we would wait passively for this until next July when it's available in the UK in October 09 in English. Ask your friends to pick it up for you at Heathrow, request it for Christmas.

B002JTMNX2|4.0|I have been fan since 1977, so yep, I am an oldster, but I would still put many of their efforts up against a lot of the garbage that masquerades as music today.     Not many bands 32 years after their initial release still tour let alone make records that people want to go to or buy.     This is still Foreigner because of Mick and I saw these guys earlier this year in Rhode Island and they absolutely smoked, real musicians that don't act like they invented music, they just do it well.    Give me their first CD and Head games and I can crack a cold one and be a happy dude all night.     Best tunes are Can't slow down, In Pieces (not bad for a midtempo song) is catchy, Living in a dream, Ready, Too late (was great in concert) and Give me a sign and the ballad When it comes to love is getting airplay. I prefer the rockers to the ballads, but I never cared for the ballads anyway.     Soul Doctor and Prisoner of love would have fit nicely here and cut out a couple of ballads.     The remixes have more heft to them and the DVD is A+++++, though it doesen't have Cold as ice on it (or Women but......).     For 12 dollars you can't BEAT THIS.     Is it their best effort, nope, but a worthy add to the collection.     Download Give me a sign, Ready and Can't slow down, Too late good stuff.

B001S2QNNC|1.0|This is not a commentary on the content of the book per se but rather on the kindle version.    All Kindle books I've read to date have been \\"text\\" which display great on my iPhone. This book is not. Rather it is the scanned images of the words that are strung together across the page. Apart from horrendous alignment issues (words divided with space in between them etc), it also leads to low quality of the actual text since the font used in the book is not ideal for reading on screen.    Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling this as digital content without a big warning sign.
B00164KYV4|3.0|`He's Just Not That Into You' is proof positive that it takes more than good looks and star power to make a good movie.  It takes even more than talent, which all of these actresses actually have, to make a good movie.  It takes chemistry (haven't I said this before) and it takes at least a certain level of intelligence.  `He's Just Not That Into You' lacks a lot of chemistry, which is surprising considering the cast, and it also plays things rather ignorant, which creates a very stupefied film that fails to live up to what it promised to deliver.<br /><br />It's funny, because the film thinks it's really smart; but it's not.<br /><br />Instead of attempting to flesh out the real drama of finding that special someone, the film pretty much throws everything at us with reckless abandonment and hopes that something, anything, is going to stick.  You have the cheating husband, the `just friends', the desperately single leech, the `living together but never getting married' and then you have the men and women who filter in and out of their lives.  Some actresses (and or actors) grab a hold of their roles better than other, but overall the experience is far too sporadic and unorganized to make any real impact.<br /><br />If you are looking at this film for any other purpose other than brainless entertainment then you should look elsewhere.<br /><br />I didn't expect this movie to be genius, for it is a romantic comedy, but I did expect it to have some sort of guidance.  It just seemed rather haphazard the way they just through scenario after scenario at us and then claimed to resolve it all with the wise words of a womanizer (since when is Justin Long a womanizer?).  It just makes no sense.<br /><br />And yet it was still, in some ways, enjoyable.<br /><br />A whose-who of talented actresses line the cast; from the ever-so-lovely Scarlett Johansson to the underrated and totally lovable Ginnifer Goodwin to Hollywood A-listers Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Aniston and even Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, not to mention Ben Affleck, Kevin Connelly and new heartthrob Bradley Cooper.  Even Kris Kristofferson shows up here!  Of the cast, Aniston and Connelly take the acting cake for me; especially Connelly who understands how to infuse the right amount of humor into her despair to make her frustrated wife believable.  I really wish that Scarlett Johansson would stop getting typecast as the flirtatious man-eater.  Yes, she is the most beautiful woman on the planet and every man wants to `get' with her, me included, but she has so much talent that it is being wasted on roles beneath her.  Goodwin, I just adore, but here she is just annoying.  I think it is more her character, but she really could have made her character at least relatable.  She's just messy here.  Barrymore is underused (she is such a luminous presence I wish she were in everything) here, and the film almost seems uninterested in her.<br /><br />If you want a brainless comedy that has some laughs, some tears and some entertainment value, or if you are a die-hard fan of any of the ladies in the cast, then by all means did in; but if you want something with a little more meat then you should look elsewhere.car winner Jennifer Connelly, not to mention Ben Affleck, Kevin Connelly and new heartthrob Bradley Cooper.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|This is my first exposure to Muse. I heard of them because of a Digg article about Glenn Beck praising them and them asking for a retraction. The retraction part turned out to be a joke, but I was still intrigued. (Not a Glenn Beck fan BTW)<br /><br />Researching this album and band this album seemed to be right up my alley. A Conspiracy Theory oriented alternative album. First let me make a few statements:<br /><br />1) Alternative to what really? This sounds like old School Techno Rock of the mid to late Seventies to Eighties. Like ELO with a weak message. There is nothing groundbreaking here IMHO.<br />2) A Concept album on the 2000's? WOW! This type of compilation will be impossible in the near future when CD's become a thing of the past and people will only download selected MP3 tracks. This album SHOULD be listened to in it's entirety. I applaud their efforts. They are swimming against the stream.<br />3) Some of the tracks contained are truly brilliant. United States of Eurasia\\" is a stand out. Uprising is like the Doctor Who soundtrack written by Gary Glitter, and I like it. Unnatural Selection and the Exogenesis Symphony tracks are also quite good. I think they were only broken into three separate tracks for additional MP3 revenue.<br /><br />I will probably not buy any more Muse albums, as they are not really my cup of tea. For me this is something I will play in the background while doing something else. This album seems written to be be listened to more intently. I believe this album is a work by very talented people that should be rewarded. I especially appreciate the creation of an ACTUAL ALBUM to be listened to as a COMPILATION and not just a few select tracks. Kudos to Matthew Bellamy!

I was also in heaven bumping this soundtrack up in my bedroom pretending to be a Monstar and totally rapping to every word of `Hit 'Em High', which is still the best track on the album.  Sitting back and looking at the soundtrack a good thirteen years later, I am flushed with a good amount of nostalgia, but I am also able to see it for what it is, and while it is a pretty solid collection of 90's hip-hop and R&B, it also contains a fair amount of material that doesn't hold up so well now (and I'm kind of shocked it ever did).<br /><br />I still really like this soundtrack for the most part, but there are some tracks that leave me scratching my head.<br /><br />Let's take a stab at this.<br /><br />Of course, the R&B singles were all stellar, and they soaked up a deserved amount of radio play as well.  Seal's `Fly Like an Eagle' and R. Kelly's `I Believe I Can Fly' are still stunning thirteen years later.  Fantastic R&B classic's that raise the spirits and contain stunning vocals.  Monica's `For You I Will' is a basic yet beautifully done ballad.  I've always been a huge fan of Monica, and this was one of my favorite songs from her.  All-4-One was one of my favorite groups in the 90's and so I was stoked they were on the soundtrack.  Personally, `I Turn to You' is one of those tracks that hasn't aged well, and it is rather standard and has a familiar (not in a good way) feel to it.<br /><br />`Hit 'Em High' is the best thing on here.  I was not big into rap at the tender age of eleven, but I knew who these guys were because my older sisters were all corrupting me (haha) so I already loved Busta Rhymes and actually would hide in my closet to listen to this song since my dad had banned all rap music from the house.<br /><br />I still love this song.<br /><br />Quad City DJ's were pretty big (\\"ride that choo-choo\\") and `Space Jam' is just as fun (if not regurgitated) as their other music at that point.  Much less fun is Robyn S.'s `Givin U All That I've Got'.  Yeah, it has that BASKETBALL GAME feel to it, but it's kind of `blah' if you ask me (and completely 90's with no modern appeal at all).  I loathe Biz Markie, so his collaboration with The Spin Doctors is atrocious, especially since the original was fine on it's own.<br /><br />Consider me a fan of Salt-N-Pepa, so I LOVE that they are here and there track is wonderful!  I was a big fan of Coolio at the time (`Gangsters Paradise' was my favorite song at the time, thanks to major radio play) but `Winner' is kind of weak if you ask me.  I also loved Changing Faces and think their compliment to the soundtrack is one of the best here.  I have never really gotten the love for D'Angelo, and I just find `I Found My Smile Again' to be an out-of-place track on the album.<br /><br />The humorous tracks included (Bugs's rap and Chris Rock's spoken `Basketball Jones') are both great additions and still make me chuckle.<br /><br />So, all-in-all this is a pretty solid effort and it is one of the best compilations of 90's R&B/Hip-Hip available (and from a Looney Toons movie no less!) so you really can't go wrong with this.  In hindsight they could have done a little better, but it's hard to fault them for corralling together a slew of hits that represent a time in music history without taking away from the funky freshness of the films subject.at I've Got'.

0061348198|5.0|I have now become a Jodi Picoult ultimate fan.  I ordered all of her books and started from when she first published a book and am now going in a sequence up.  I did read a couple of her new books and she seems to only get better.  The Pact was really intense and I was so happy (yet sad for some of the characters)to have read it!  She makes the reader feel like they are actually there or looking at the event taking place.  Please Jodi!  Keep writing!
B00001W9G0|5.0|For any Sex and the city lovers out there, Carrie and her friends referred to this movie when Big ran off and married another women.  After watching that particular episode for the 100th time I found this movie on Amazon.  Hell if you want to find anything it can be found on Amazon.  Back to the movie, I wasn't even born when this came out and after watching it.  It is by far one of the best love movies I have ever seen.  Actually, I'm still unable to cry about the ending but I feel it coming.  Excellent purchase.  Thank you Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda.
081095415X|5.0|Yet another masterpiece from Nick Brandt!!  For any of his devotees such as myself, I have been patiently awaiting his followup to \\"On This Earth\\" and he certainly did not disappoint!  The images are absolutely beautiful and surreal and haunting.  It is a definite reminder to us all that the African wildlife he depicts in his books are both stunning and sadly doomed at the same time.  Every accolade that Nick Brandt receives is completely deserved.  He is an absolute master behind the camera and we are all lucky to be able to see Africa through his eyes.  If you purchased \\"On This Earth\\" you MUST buy \\"A Shadow Falls\\" too! Absolutely my favorite present-day artist.
B00003CXB4|5.0|DVD arrived in perfect condition and much sooner that we expected.  Thank you very much. If you have anything else of interest to my family or to me, I will definitely purchase from you again. Lion King was my eldest granddaughter's favorite movie...In fact, we also went to the play. She is now 17! My daughter has been blessed with two more \\"surprise\\" babies, 10 months' apart [ages almost three (b'day 10/12/09 and almost four (b'day 12/08/09)]. It is now THEIR favorite movie. Since Disney has put it back in the archives, I was so grateful to get a copy, and appreciate the reasonable rate and service. Thanks again, Kathryn, Westlake Village, California
1594488878|5.0|Nick Hornby has a bit of a reputation as a writer whose appeal is largely to young, pop culturally-obsessed men. While it's true that his earlier novels do focus on not-yet-fully-formed young men and their often unsolicited journeys towards adulthood, I always thought he was a writer remarkably sensitive and sympathetic to all his characters, male or female.    Hornby's newest novel, Juliet, Naked, is a wonderful, sweet book. The story focuses on three characters approaching or exiting middle aged, and how they deal with the regret of unfulfilled lives.    Duncan is a teacher who only comes to life when talking, listening to or writing about reclusive singer-songwriter Tucker Crowe. Annie is in a dead-end long-term relationship with Duncan and in a dead-end job as a seaside museum curator. And then there's Tucker Crowe, who has not recorded in over two decades and has been a disinterested observer of his own withdrawal from both his creative life.    I'll leave for you to discover how a small, uncharacteristically assertive action of Annie's - a dissenting post on Duncan's all-things-Tucker-Crowe website - sets into motion a series of events that forces all of these characters out of their respective ruts.    What's wonderful about Hornby's writing is that he understands and is compassionate towards all of his characters. You can think that Duncan is a sad, small man whose obsessive expertise regarding Crowe's small catalogue is a poor excuse for an actual life, but Hornby lets you understand how he got that way, and respects Duncan's intelligence and passion, however misapplied.    (I understand Duncan - his core belief that you can judge the value of people by the value of their cultural taste - and while I'd like to think (please, please) that I've never taken his road, I understand all too well how someone might make the mistakes he's made.)    I also love the way Hornby presents what seems to be a very British worldview - pessimism combined with unfailing politeness. His characters manage to give pointed, incisive criticism to each other, yet retain a social propriety that you may find charming or frustrating, depending I suspect on whether you are or are not British. Either way, though, the characters are human and alive and just like people you know.    Finally, although Juliet, Naked is not a music book, Hornby writes about music with the expertise of someone who, like Duncan, has given a lot of thought about art, and artists. Here, he writes with command about the mindset of the cult fan, the \\"more-obscure-the-better\\" value model the cult fan embraces, and where, exactly, the cult artist himself fits in this ecosystem (hint: artists generate great work but may not be the best judges of their worth).    Hornby is a rare writer who crafts literary novels for mass audiences. He is proof of an argument he has made about many great recording artists in his music writing - that you can create art of great, lasting value while remaining a crowd-pleaser. In that respect, he doesn't aspire to be Tucker Crowe, prototypical cult artist - he wants to be the Beatles.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|My reaction to the new Beatles reissues is \\"holy moly.\\"    The difference is difficult to describe. You won't confuse these recordings with current state-of-the-art production. The specific changes are not dramatic. But the sound of every album, going back to the original Please Please Me, is undeniably improved in a bunch of little ways that, taken together, lead to vastly improved clarity. You can hear instruments or vocals way in the background that you barely heard before. Each instrument just seems more there. Lead vocals have a greater presence, character and detail, revealing little crags and edges. The lower end of the recordings has more muscle. And it's all accomplished without changing the overall feel of the original recordings.    After you've heard a favorite song thousands of time, you may stop hearing each component - the recording becomes a single, familiar slab of sound. (When I watched the wonderful documentary, Standing in the Shadows of Motown, it was a shock, strange as it seems, to realize that the famous Motown Sound was the product of specific, real people - which was really one of the points of the film.)     The effect of the Beatles remasters is to remind you that these recordings were made by individual people, sitting in a room, contributing their separate parts to the song. Listen, there's the piano. Over there's a drummer. Here's a guy singing harmony. Isn't that a nice guitar fill. The overall effect is to humanize these recordings all over again.     It would be going too far to say that the remastering has brought these songs back to life, because they were doing pretty well already and they never depended on perfect sound to reveal their greatness. But it is fair to say that the respectful, thoughtful, loving care given to this remastering project will cause you to take fresh notice of songs you know so well and perhaps took for granted.
B00004CZVT|5.0|I just watched this Australian TV classic again, on a home-made DVD conversion from a VCR.    Despite the poorish quality, it is still one of the best movies ever made, much-much better than the English movie version.    It truly begs to be released as a re-mastered DVD
B001TH16DI|3.0|All of the films should have been expertly restored, possibly with some special effects re-created (to look just like the original only with flaws fixed, see some of the technical issues others reviewers have pointed out), visible make-up could possibly be improved with colour alteration on selected scenes, and much more. The bottom line is Paramount just don't want to spend the money required to do this, so that they can maximise their profits. Just take a look at the excellent restoration job done on Blade Runner, Original film cleaned, scanned at highest possible resolution, each scene carefully looked at and restored, for example one shots shows a hovering police car that previously you could see the wires supporting it, now carefully painted out. Had the same care and attention (and money) been spent on restoring each of the Star Trek films, they would no doubt look a lot better. At least KHAN was restored, but not to the same degree that Blade Runner was.    The Studio may do a restoration at a later date so they can sell it to us all again. Look at the way Paramount has consistantly milked fans of their money with so many different releases of the Star Trek Series and Films, what a contrast to Star Wars, yes there have been a few versions over the years as improvements were made, but on DVD, basically one quality release of each film with plenty of extras at a fair price. Respect to George Lucas for not over milking us of our money. Shame on you Paramount, you are charging enough for the Blu-Rays and you have made huge profits from Star Trek over the years, give a little back by spending the required ammount to do the best possible restorations, you owe it to the film makers and the fans!    Show Paramount that you agree by clicking that this review was helpful (below).
B000005K31|1.0|Recently searched for an original Sticky Fingers, zipper cover, vinyl LP.  This item was being sold as such. In reality it was a later sold  \\"Original Masters Recording\\" version of the same LP, not the original zipper cover album. This version has an embossed zipper on the outer sleeve NOT the original working zipper. Album also DID NOT have the inside sleeve which had the cotton briefs photo. Cover also had more wear than suggested, LP itself however IS in excellent condition. Overall was HUGELY disappointed with the product. What it was suggested to be with regard to what it actually was, and especially for the price paid.   [[ASIN:B001AV5BUW Sticky Fingers (Zipper Cover)]]
B000001ELB|5.0|One thing most people fail to mention is these tracks were REMIXED by KISS in 1978, you can hear differences in the songs than to the originals, some minor, some major.<br />Strutter'78 was a brand new recording for the album, infact, the original idea was to re-record all the songs, not sure why, but the band wasnt getting along too good and they took a long break after just recording Strutter and went off to do their Solo albums....it remains as the only song KiSS recorded in 1978.<br />Great song selection covering songs from their first album up to Love Gun.

0385504225|5.0|Where THE DA VINCE CODE took the reader on a search for the Holy Grail, the hidden feminine, Dan Brown's latest creation takes us on a search for the LOST WORD.  We become seekers of the evolution of the soul through the Ancinet Mysteries of the Freemasons and through Noetic Sciences, with this fast paced, fascinating thriller.    THE DA VINCE CODE left us wanting more, THE LOST SYMBOL satifies!
0385504225|4.0|Had I read this book before having read \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" I would probably give it five stars.  It's in the Dan Brown formula, and that formula works.  But the novelty is gone.  There are also a few unnecessary pages as several folks have pointed out. I still highly recommend it, though.  It'll suck you in, and you'll have a good ride.(g)  If you're not into metaphysics (& physics) it may also open your eyes to some new ideas. In any case, read and enjoy.
B000SXOK0A|5.0|This album got me through hell - specifically, my first year of law school. (If you've survived that you know what I'm talking about.)  I spent many post-studying late nights with this CD, playing cards on the laptop (something to occupy my eyes but not my strained brain) while dissolving into the glorious gloom and despair swirling around in my headphones. And strangely loving it - there's something about wallowing in misery that's oddly freeing.     I know Yorke & Co. have denied it had any expressly political overtones, but part of the album's impact at the time (at least for me) was its ability to articulate a sense of the anxiousness surrounding the invasion of Iraq.  Whether you thought we should be there or not (I didn't), it was gonna happen and you felt powerless to do much about it. Bigger forces than you were at work in the post 9/11 world, and those feelings of inevitability, confusion, irrelevance, and dread were expressed in the repetition of the lyrics and percussive instrumentation (punctuated with the occasional glorious chaotic noise) and connected with me much more than anything on Kid A or Amnesiac.  'There There' was a decent enough single, but it takes on a whole new character in the context of the album - a melodic release of tension that's exuberant, while still dark. And the handclaps on 'We Suck Young Blood' are just awesomely creepy.    Listening to it again now, long after Iraq has ceased to be the dominant issue of the day, the album holds up even better than I remember it - a sign that it's truly a work of art capable of reflecting whatever the listener needs to project onto it. It's almost operatic. The Bends will always be my favorite Radiohead disc, and there's no denying the perfection of OK Computer, but Hail to the Thief might be their best work.
044011120X|5.0|I had originally read Joseph Heller's \\"Catch 22\\" many many years ago while in High School.  At the time, I greatly enjoyed the book, and it's telling that over 30 years later, I still remember many of the characters very clearly today.  I recently decided to re-read the book, although not without some misgivings, as I was afraid that, like many things in life, it might be better left in memory than revisiting in reality.  I needn't have been concerned.    Catch 22 is a classic novel, combining many disparate elements ... slapstick, biting sarcasm, tragedy, the darkest of black humor ... into something larger than the sum of its parts.  The story follows Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian, a bombadier in a B-25 bomber in Italy.  Yossarian and his fellow pilots have been pushed well beyond their limits of endurance by an incompetent and uncaring superior, and Yossarian has lost his nerve to continue fighting, along with maybe a large part of his sanity.  He desperately trys to avoid flying any more combat missions, but the military bureaucracy always manages to stay one step ahead of him.  Yossarian's story, as well as those of the multitude of colorful and flawed characters around him, make for a good read.    They say you should write what you know, and like his character Yossarian, Mr. Heller was a B-25 Bombadier in Italy, where he flew 60 combat missions.  The book shines on many levels ... as pure entertainment, as an anti-war novel, as an inditement against mindless bureaucracy ... and stands up well almost 50 years after it was first published.  Strongly recommended.
B001EAWMGA|2.0|This movie had a lot of promise (alien crashes on earth during the viking times!) but squandered it.  It's hard to pin down exactly how, but the action sequences were pretty boring.  In addition, and this is true of pretty much any movie I see involving aliens, if they can )(&*@)($# fly billions of light years, why don't they have some badass weapons?  I mean, wouldn't an advanced alien race's warriors have like mini-energy gattling guns implanted in their fingers or something?  Instead, this alien has 1 standard issue energy weapon which he promptly loses.  Uh... ok so alien's are clumsy too.  Some of the pacing of the plot lags too, leaving you to twiddle your thumbs or fast forward to the action scenes.

B0025KVLTM|4.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonelty Hearts Club Band [Remastered] is a very pleasurable album to listen to.  The remastering is absolutely wonderful.  I am still surprised by some of the instruments that I never noticed before have been brought up in the mixes thanks to cleaning.  Many of these \\"lost\\" instruments have always been there, but with as many tape reductions as the Beatles did on this album, we are lucky that the engineers spent so much time clearing this as well as they did.  Sonically the album is more powerful than ever.    From the opening strains of the \\"orchestra\\" tuning and warming up to the final creshendo of the E major chord (played by four people on different pianos), this album is a treat to one's ears.  For the time in 1967, this was earth shattering.    That said, there are a few songs that are not my personal favorites such as When I'm 64, Good Morning, and She's Leaving Home, but it is still a mighty fine album with Ringo's finest vocal performance EVER in With a Little Help From My Friends, one of the high lights of John's career - A Day in the Life, and a host of other songs that are quite pleasurable.  This album was ground breaking and now it's a sonic masterpiece with this remastering.  If we could do 1/2 stars to me it would be 4 1/2.  Recommended.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|This is the time-honored story of a princess (voiced by Adriana Caselotti) whose blossoming beauty disturbs her insecure stepmother, the Queen (Lucille La Verne). Each day, the Queen asks a mysterious magic mirror (Moroni Olsen) the question: \\"Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\\" For years, the mirror answers the Queen's name, but when it suddenly says Snow White, the evil woman begins her quest to kill the young girl so she may once again be the fairest of them all.    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has the distinction of being the first full-length animated feature in movie history, which was a major milestone in 1937, and its success allowed Walt Disney to build an empire. Regrettably, I think it's a bore. From a technical perspective, I have to hand it to Disney for creating a masterpiece, but its glacial pacing puts me to sleep every time. In fact, from the time I was seven years old, I've referred to the film as \\"Snore White.\\"    Dubbed by Disney as the first title in its \\"Diamond Collection,\\" Snow White certainly impresses in 1080p with a fantastic AVC encode. Colors are very strong, particularly the blue and red in Snow White's dress, and black levels are inky and deep. Contrast wavers occasionally, which may be a result of the animated cells themselves, but the intricate details are mesmerizing, especially in the characters' facial expressions and the textures in the background.    The DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack captures the essence of the original mono track. Dialog is clear and intelligible, although the shrill voice of Snow White can be excruciating, especially when she hits a high note. Surprisingly, the LFE channel packs some punch, especially during the rain storm, and the musical numbers have never sounded better. The surround speakers provide suitable ambience, and the occasional discrete effect and the pans around the room are smooth and natural.    Disney treats the cinematic masterpiece with a new twist on retail offerings.There are two three-disc sets available, one with DVD packaging and the other in a Blu-ray case, but each includes the same three discs--two Blu-rays and a DVD copy of the feature film. The first Blu-ray disc offers the movie with an optional commentary from film historian John Canemaker; the remainder of the supplements are on disc two. The DVD has the same commentary as well as an all-new music video from Tiffany Thornton and a sneak peak at The Princess and the Frog (also on the Blu-ray).    The Blu-ray supplements includes \\"Hyperion Studios,\\" in which users are digitally transported to 1937 to learn firsthand where Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was conceived. With 13 rooms to choose from, this interactive feature contains archival photos, never-before-heard animator recordings, archival transcripts, and rare footage of Walt Disney and his animators. Other supplements include newly found storyboards, which hint that Disney considered a sequel to the film, some games, and a retrospective featurette entitled \\"The One That Started It All,\\" which explains the historical significance of Snow White.    I realize I'm in the minority with my feelings about the film, but even with its short 84-minute runtime, it drags too much. Still, considering when it was made, it certainly deserves praise as a pioneering film, and it looks outstanding on Blu-ray. Recommended for fans.     [...]
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Easy to see why this is called by many \\"the greatest Western ever made\\".  It sure gets my vote.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|A long, long time ago I swore I would never to see another Sandra Bullock \\"romantic comedy\\". After TWO WEEKS NOTICE, FORCES OF NATURE, MISS CONGENIALITY and so forth I thought enough was enough. Then THE PROPOSAL came along and, asides from a couple of good reviews, I also heard some pretty good word of mouth on it. Too bad, frankly speaking, word of mouth should have kept its mouth shut, THE PROPOSAL is just as bad as anything Bullock has ever done in the past. Then there's lovable granny who takes Sandra to a strip joint for a never ending private dance and the love birds taking off their clothes (unaware of each other's presence), walking in reverse and ending up accidentally embracing each other naked in plain daylight (I guess the true odds of that were a bit remote). THE PROPOSAL is for undiscriminating romantic comedy lovers only, others beware !
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Listening to \\"With the Beatles\\" remastered was a beautiful experience, especially through headphones.  I could really hear a dramatic difference between the remastered version and the 1988 original CD of \\"With the Beatles.\\"  For one thing, the remastered version is in two-channel stereo, rather than the mono of the original CD.  So was the original \\"Meet the Beatles\\" American version of the LP that I bought and listened to so avidly back in 1964.  It was great to hear that music in stereo once again.  And so clear!  I felt I was in the studio engineer's booth, listening to a \\"live\\" performance on studio monitoring headphones.  The final song, \\"Money\\" is offered in full stereo, something never heard previously.    There is also a fascinating little video where you see the Beatles at the time they were making the album, and they actually talk about making \\"With the Beatles \\"  The photos and liner notes that come with the disc are superb.  I plan to add at least two more remastered CDs in this series to my collection because I was so pleased with the new \\"With the Beatles\\" package, even though I already own all the Beatles titles on the 1988 CDs.  My suggestion would be to pick out your favorite Beatles album, purchse the remastered version from Amazon.com (good price!), sit back, relax, and listen, especially if you've got headphones (and I don't mean ear-buds) to enhance the experience.  I don't see how you could go wrong.
6305327041|2.0|I bought this film specifically for the Robert Rodriguez segment. For me it was the only amusing one. The music by Esquivel was too busy, intrusive and tiresome. I'v begun to hate \\"clever\\" animated opening credits...unless they are truly clever. Tim Roth can blaze in the right role. In this film he enters the ham zone.

It seems with most modern culture when an element is introduced you have an idea where they are going with it, with Hornby you never know.

B0021L8UXU|2.0|With releases over the past few years of movies like Shaun of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and I Am Legend, it would appear that the zombie-genre is here to stay.  People like seeing zombies getting killed, simple as that.  I'm no exception either. Give me an interesting storyline, some witty dialogue, couple hot girls, bunch of zombies getting slaughtered and I'm a happy camper. Which leads us to Zombieland; Witty dialogue? Check. Hot girls? Check. Zombies getting killed? Check.  So why didn't Zombieland work for me? For one, the zombies were basically just a backdrop in the movie. Besides the occasional kill, they didn't really have much purpose. They weren't really running from them, they weren't trying to hunt them down--they were just there.  Call me old fashioned, but I like a little story line to go along with my zombie-killing.<br /><br />  The film follows \\"Tallahassee\\", (the four main characters are each named after where they're from) played by Woody Harrelson, who is more or less the \\"zombie-killing expert\\", who meets up with \\"Columbus\\", (Jessie Eisenberg) as they try to fend off the rest of the general population, which now consists mainly of blood-thirsty zombies. They encounter these zombies on their journey to... well, nowhere in particular. They start out driving east towards their respective home states, until they encounter \\"Wichita\\" (Emma Stone) and \\"Little Rock\\" (Abigail Breslin), who are on their way to Pacific Playland, which is supposedly a \\"zombie-free\\" area.  From here is where things go from boring, to boring and predictable. The journey to Pacific Playland becomes an afterthought and the rest of the movie becomes four uninteresting, smug characters killing a few zombies (who are basically non-existent now until the last scene), and having monotonous and dull conversations. But wait--there's a love story mixed in!  Amidst this aimless wandering, the neurotic and socially awkward `Ohio' is falling for the hot, edgy and would-be unattainable `Wichita'. And you know what that means...awkward sexual tension!<br /><br />  For as much time as these characters spend bickering back and forth at each other, almost no time whatsoever is spent establishing the setting of this movie. It's supposed to be a Zombieland, yet the zombie appearances are scarce and scattered throughout the film. There is no atmosphere, no tone, no feeling to this world they inhabit. This is one of the areas where similar films like the aforementioned Shaun of the Dead and the I Am Legend succeeded, and where this film, ultimately fails.<br /><br />  With its many faults, Zombieland does have some plus sides.  Eisenberg, despite being a poor man's Michael Cera, has a couple of funny one-liners, there's an awesome zombie-cameo mid-way through the film, and unlike their relationships with any of the other characters, Eisenberg and Stone actually share some decent on-camera chemistry. (Oh, and Emma Stone is really purrty). Despite these few bright spots, Zombieland is ultimately a horror-comedy that has few scares and even fewer laughs.<br /><br />5.0/10<br /><br />[...]ld-be unattainable `Wichita'.

B000055Y0X|5.0|I give the movie, itself, a 5-Star rating.  It is one of the best movies ever made.  But I give the DVD a 4-Star rating.  I love how the DVD is formated to the specs of the actual theatrical release (4x3 video, mono audio), but I take off points for not cleaning up the edge noise, dust particles and sprocket registration shakes.  However, it's like actually seeing it in the theaters on the second week of its release.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Just finished the book this morning - I must blame Dan Brown on my lack of sleep the past few weeks...Just as I knew would happen - I'd reach a point where I wanted to call it a night and head to bed, but Mr. Brown had other ideas.    The story was interesting, I enjoyed following another Langdon adventure, and I was impressed with the thought-provoking nature of the story!  Not often do I find myself doing side research while I read so that I can have a greater understanding of the background story, but this was one of those cases.    As with many stories, there were portions that puzzled me, and parts I didn't necessarily enjoy, but in terms of the story overall - a fantastic read - one which I would happily read again!

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This was an entertaining book to read.  I have read all three books and the first book is a good introduction to a really great story.  The second and third book were almost impossible to put down.  Can't wait for the fourth book to come out, but it looks like it's going to be a while.

0385504225|2.0|If you've read The Da Vinci Code, well... The Lost Symbol is just a superficial rehash of that story. The setting changes from Paris and Rome to Washington, but we have the same pedestrian over-dramatic writing (\\"his blue eyes flashed\\"), sloppy editing, overuse of italics, a super-villain with inhuman strength and apparently unlimited resources plus an uncanny ability to outwit everyone around him, sinister plots in high places, Masonry at the wheels of power in every institution, etc. It was all somewhat interesting and amusing the first time around, but now it's just predictable and boring and a little sad. If you have a Kindle, download the sample chapter first, and I doubt that you'll want to actually buy the book by the time you finish that. If you don't have a Kindle, wait a few months and buy it on the remainder tables.

0452295548|5.0|I thought this would be a good read, but I didn't expect it to change my life. It did. I have now read and reread it 5 times and will continue to reread it until it is completely absorbed. For me, it connected dots from many things I have read or watched, such as the dvd What the Bleep Do We Know? and the Dalai Lama's Mind/Life series of books. I bought 3 copies so I could loan out 2 and still have 1 to read, but I loaned out mine, too. I so think that others need to know about our right brain function. Now I guess I'll buy another. =)

Gorgeous overdub harmonies and jangly folk guitar chords come together in an impressionist portrait of a broken heart. It works merely heard in the background as well as listened to with your eyes closed and the headphones on.  If you haven't picked it up yet, don't wait further. Buy now.
1552091090|1.0|Hard to add to what has been said in the other 1-star reviews...this book is deeply creepy and totally unsettling.  Tonight my son decided he wanted to read something we hadn't read before and pulled it off the shelf.  Ours was a MIL gift and, regrettably, I hadn't pre-screened it -- the title \\"Love you forever\\" seemed safe enough that I didn't think it necessary.  Rats!  My son sat silently as I read it and at the end his only comment was \\"Why is the mom holding the man like he's still a baby?\\" Good question.  This one is going up on the high shelf of the closet.

B00005JPTK|1.0|Have you all read the book? Once you read it, believe me, you will all vomit after seing the movie. This darn film starts well and almost everybody will have fun watching it. But damn it! Why didn't they stick to the novel for the TWIST? The whole idea behind the title is this incredible twist which is a complete change of point of view! The hero is alone battling vampires. he kills them without any remorse. You think he is justified to do so. At the end, when he is caught. You realize with him that in fact, HE IS the monster. Not them. To the vampires, he is the BOOGEY MAN. He's been killing their vampire kids, wives and husbands for years! To the vampires, HE IS A LEGEND! Now, that's the novel! Plus, in the novel, and the later screenplays that never were used, one of the woman vampire takes a special drug in order to look more human and passes herself off as a wanderer. The hero befriends her and learns to trust her. There is hope for a romance between them. But she will betray him only to have remorse after. She will help him get away.    Now, that's all in the novel. So why haven't they kept that in the film? ARE THEY STUPID OR WHAT? You have all this good material and you cut it to do... to do what? Once you know the novel, it's impossible to not feel sad after seing the film. Impossible. I can't believe the writer, the director and all of the people involved haven't once said: \\"Wait a minute. The novel is awesome. Let's stick to that\\".    That is what happens when a writer and a director think as themselves as better than the author. They want to make it \\"better\\"...    This film is a let down. A missed opportunity. So sad.

0385504225|1.0|I had high hopes for Mr Brown, after reading his Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress and Deception Point, and I must say I am utterly disappointed with this book. It's hard to believe that this book took him 6 years. First, it was painfully slow, and 2 thirds of the book is repetitive (dialogues, plots and scenes) and the ending? Duh?! It makes me wonder if Mr Brown is banking on the success of DVC and A&D.  Page after page on Mal'akh's physical descriptions, secret tunnels and staircases, the Vow of Secrecy, biblical quotes, the symbols. The writing is horrible, Langdon has evolved into an idiot, always insisted that he was right about the symbols, and proceed to be shocked when he discovered that he is not (again and again). The Big Mystery? Behold the Bible! How original! *roll eyes* Oh PLEASE! 'The Lost Symbol', yes I am totally lost. I can't wait to get my hands on this book when it's released, now I can't wait to finish it.  Should have read the reviews before I bought it, and I wasted good money on a hardcover book that is 'lost'. 'The Lost Symbol', indeed.  Ok,I'm off to read other good book...

0786868724|4.0|I've been reading lot of things on health, psychology and spirituality recently. I enjoyed the structure of book and how it builds the story and takes a person to view the life a whole. The storytelling of the author is amazing and whenever I took breaks from the reading the book, the thought of going back to finish reading kept coming in mind. The only issue have with spiritual books and this one also is build a viewpoint comparing too many variation of religions available all around us. I'm glad recently I read [[ASIN:0981192106 Mylife Framework: A Model For A Successful Life Based On The Yoga Principles]] which helped me stay anchored on the basics of spirituality and life in general, while evaluating my thoughts, feelings and faith. Overall a very good read, go for it.

It still manages to magically contain 36 solid songs that make this collection a must have for any Pop music Fan.<br /><br />The Remastering is done really well here and its amazing how I turn up the volume on my iPod for some songs and then turn it down when I play Celebration.<br /><br />Bottom line: A Must have!
B001CQONKY|3.0|The first 7 seasons were always entertaining, the stories were always engaging, but with this Season 8, I felt a bit disappointed, Louise Lombard(female blond detective) & the other male detective(can't remember his name) are gone leaving only Brass as the lead detective who of course never fails to make me laugh with his one-liners, Sara Sidle(Jorja Fox) departs which was disappointing, Fox is what got me watching in the first place, never got tired of watching her, & Grissom who has always been somewhat one-dimensional becomes even more so, don't get me wrong I really like William Peterson as an actor, but his Grissom never seems to ever have the flair that David Caruso & Gary Sinise's characters have in the spin-offs \\"Miami\\" & \\"New York\\", not that this season is bad, it just to me wasn't engaging, I mean when people are bleeding what appears to be green blood, you know the show has run its course, or the one where Katy Segal is a muredered Hollywood star who had her assistant look like her & both were involved with a not-so-bright producer, & the episode itself plays like a sitcom, maybe the writer's strike had somthing to do with this, I don't know, & why do we always have to see a dead person's brain??? the spin-offs \\"Miami & NY\\" don't ever show this, why does this one??? somtimes I think the producers have a twisted sense of humor, the previous seasons did this too, enough with the brains already!!!!, also Warrick dies in the last episode, you know when cast members start leaving it can only mean that they feel the same way as I do, Warrick & Sara are two of my favorites on this show, & I am not even sure Season 9 is worth watching, especially considering that Grissom even leaves in Season 9, again this one has run its course, unlike its spin-offs which have not(yet), but unfortunately CBS is going to milk this show to death even though \\"Miami & NY\\" which have not run out of engaging stories(yet) could just as easily carry the network, but again, networks havelost their creative edge & can't really come up with anything new anyway, so they are going to milk the original C.S.I. to no end, there are some good episodes, the \\"Without a Trace\\" two-part episode is good as is the first 4 episodes of the season \\"Dead Doll\\", \\"a-la-cart\\", ETC, but the last few are just ridiculous.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|Even though this is a smaller flash, the pictures taken with it are great. I have the Nikon SB600, a larger flash. For most situation the result from this flash and the SB600 is the same.  This flash is lighter and more portable so I will be using this more often then the SB600. This flash is so light that I leave the flash on the camera. So I get great pictures more often with this smaller unit than the bigger SB600. I learned that a flash that you can use more often is more important than the size/power of the flash. The best thing about this flash is the bounce feature. You can use flip the flash head 60 to 90 degree. This give you a nice picture with natural light instead of the bright flash. This feature is going to make your picture much nicer than without an external flash. You can never get this kind of picture with the built in flash.

This Complete Series offering is only slightly more expensive than a single season DVD set I bought early on.  Had I known that everything would be available as one set now at this price, I would have waited and saved several hundred dollars.  If you are a fan of good wholesome family television, then buy this set immediately because this price is unbelievably great.  There is nothing on television anymore that compares to shows like this one, The Waltons, or Little House on the Prairie.  I wonder if there will ever be another program like these given the vulgar nature of most TV shows now.  Treat yourself and enjoy a classic TV series that wasn't full of foul language, sex and violence.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I love, Muse, I really do, but I'm not such a fan of this album.  Go ahead and listen and see what you think, but call me disappointed.  The fellas from Muse said in the recent Rolling Stone interview that they were \\"having a laugh\\" recording \\"United States of Eurasia.\\"  The joke didn't fly because I'd already made up my mind.  If you can make it through tracks 2, 3, and 4 (track one is the single and doesn't belong on the album), then you can begin to forgive them.  Overlook the horrible rhyme of \\"commotion\\" and \\"ocean\\" then perhaps you can make it to the last three tracks which are very lovely.      Incidentally, I'd preordered this album through Amazon expecting to receive it on the day it was available in stores.  FOUR DAYS LATER, it came in the mail with no fanfare or apology.  I shan't waste my time preordering from Amazon in the future.

0385504225|3.0|I anxiously awaited the new Dan Brown book, the Lost Symbol. It was a bit slow to start off. Once you get into the middle of the book it became very apparent that this book was written with the thoughts of being made into a movie. In The DaVinci Code the book had depth and believability, and a great amount of information. The information allowed you to use your own imagination, leading some to investigate more on the topic.It left you thinking could there be some truth to it. In the Lost Symbol there was nothing left to wonder, no sense of depth to the concept. Once I got to the end I was disappointed and felt let down, there was no pondering over the book and its contents. I must say this was nice to read but not on the level of the DaVinci Code.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|At first glance, Hard Candy seems a bit contrived--a pop icon in her fifties trying to win over a younger audience by enlisting big names like Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, and Pharrell.  Most of the negative reviews I've read about this album mostly focus on this particular aspect of the album, criticizing Madonna's choice to work with big names rather than unknowns like she has on previous albums (Music and Ray of Light).  However, pop stars working with big names is nothing new, even for Madonna.  The question is, \\"is the music good?\\"    The tone gets set early with \\"Candy Shop,\\" which recalls the sound of her first album, both in terms of production and lyrical content.  Madonna sounds sexier than she has in years and Pharrell brings the song to life with a vibrant, uncluttered production that puts her voice front and center.    \\"4 Minutes\\" is clearly meant to be the \\"Madonna's back!\\" 1st single, with it's ominous horns trumpeting her arrival.  Madonna has been known to bring out the best in her producers, and this song is proof of that.  \\"4 Minutes\\" is a blast of pure energy that we haven't heard from Timbaland in awhile.  Justin Timberlake and Madonna have great chemistry; they share the song without trying to overpower the other.  At times the bass threatens to drown out the singing, but it's a stylistic choice that works in this case.  Lyrically, it's a bit of a throwaway, but a fun song regardless.  Madonna fans that were turned off by \\"4 Minutes\\" due to it's commercial viability will probably say \\"all is forgiven!\\" after hearing \\"Give it 2 Me.\\"  Usually by track three Madonna takes her listeners to dance heaven and this is a great slice of it. Rollingstone magazine pointed out that the creative friction between Madonna and Pharrell worked for this album, and I believe that friction is most evident here, as the song blends Madonna's dance sensibility and Pharrell's hip-hop point of view to great effect.  One of the album's best moments!  \\"Heartbeat\\" is themost retro moment of the album.  It sounds like a song that she wrote for her first album, brought to life by modern production.  On the surface it sounds like a fun throwaway song about feeling alive on the dancefloor, but there's a world-weariness that sneaks into the song, especially when she sings \\"it may feel old to you but to me it feels new.\\" You sense that Madonna is thinking about her own relevance, a feeling brewing just under the surface of this simple song, thus elevating it's artistic complexity.  The real meat and potatoes of this album comes in the following trio of songs, \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"She's Not Me,\\" and \\"Incredible.\\"  Madonna's divorce has been no secret in the press, and although she hasn't gone public about what went wrong, these songs seem the most inspired by it.    \\"Miles Away\\" is another brilliant blend of acoustic pop akin to \\"Don't Tell Me.\\"  However, \\"Miles Away\\" hits much harder than it's predecessor.  It's a song about how the man in her life seems more comfortable with their relationship when they're separated from one another (\\"you always have the biggest heart/when we're 6,000 miles apart\\").  It's a bit of cutting truth that we've come to expect from Madonna, with a beautifully atmospheric production to boot.    \\"She's Not Me\\" is actually a fun song, and she could be talking about her man cheating on her or her competition in the pop world (ie. Britney Spears).  Sonically, the song has a fun disco vibe over a throbbing bassline.  It's not clear as to whom she is talking about, but sandwiched between \\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Incredible\\" the song gains more gravitas as a  deft pop song about infidelity.  \\"Incredible\\" is the album's showstopper:  it's a grandiose slab of pop that builds and builds into pop experimentation and lyrically goes from sad and fragile to fierce and determined.  In it, she sings about how wonderful and exciting relationships are at the beginning and her desire to bring her relationship back into that territory.  At first she doesn't know what to do (\\"can't get my head around it/I need to think about it\\") and by the end of the song (an unchained bit of dance euphoria reminiscent of the dance breaks in the \\"Erotica\\" album) she's proclaiming \\"I don't want this to end/ I'm missing my best friend\\". . .\\"sex with you is incredible!\\"  By the end of the song you hope that those crazy kids work it out after the drama of the two songs that preceded it.    After \\"Incredible,\\" the album loosens up for a few songs.  \\"Beat Goes On\\" brings Madonna back to familiar lyrical territory--life is short, live it--in the same vein as \\"Jump\\" off her last album.  The tinkling bells sound in the song gives it a \\"Lucky Star\\" 2008/Sex and the City soundtrack kind of vibe and is a strong contender for being a single.  Kanye West doesn't add too much to the song, though he doesn't sound out of place either, which is a kind of victory in and of itself. One of the albums strongest tracks!  \\"Dance 2Night\\" is by far the loosest song on the album.  It's as though Justin and Madonna went into the studio and freestyled while the producer did his thing.  Definitely not the most memorable song on the album, but it's nice to hear a more relaxed moment on such a tightly-composed album.  Fun and forgettable!  \\"Spanish Lesson\\" is the worst thing Madonna has done in a long time, with its \\"I'm Madonna doing my Spanish shtick\\" repertoire that she has done more effectively in the past.  A glaring misstep on this otherwise great album.  \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" is an intriguing ballad that again seems to reference Madonna's divorce.  Lyrically, it's stunning: \\"The steps that edge along the ledge/It's much higher than it seems/That I've been on that ledge before/  You can't hide yourself from me.\\"  Madonna sells it with a restrained vocal that matches the moodiness of the production.  However, the production has a couple of problems that distract from the song's beauty.  First, it's very similar to \\"Cry Me a River\\" by Justin Timberlake, and second, Timbaland had a very heavy hand on this song and it can sound a bit overproduced (particularly the rubbery/bubbly sound effect buried in the song).  These are minor quibbles though, as this song is still a strong ballad.  \\"Voices\\" ends this multifaceted album, and it takes no prisoners.  Thunderous and ominous, this song is a clear indictment of the male protagonist referenced in the other songs:  \\"so you claim madness like it's convenient/you do it so often that you start to believe it/you have demons so no one can blame you/but who is the master and who is the slave?\\" Madonna is in full diva mode, as she lacerates with sarcasm in a way we haven't heard since \\"Waiting\\" from the \\"Erotica\\" album.  Timbaland is still a bit heavy-handed on the bass, but it works here.    A great ending to a deceptively powerful album.   All in all, Madonna delivers the goods yet again, going from fun and poppy to whistful and sarcastic often within the same song.  Almost 30 years into her career, Madonna hasn't lost her edge or talent.  Don't be fooled by her choice of producers or the sauciness of the album cover, this is an album that, like its predecessors, is a fantastic balance of fun and depth.  Here's looking forward to the next album!
B000005JA8|5.0|If I were stuck on a desert with one record to play...music buffs like myself often ask this question.  While I can think of many worthwhile candidates (Pet Sounds, Rubber Soul, Zeppelin II, etc.) I just might pick Trout Mask Replica.  I agree with several reviewers...one in particular who said he could never play it when his girlfriend is around.  Trout Mask is one of those albums I listen to driving to work by myself.  It is a difficult listen for most people.  Some people (actually many) absolutely hate it.  However, I happen to be on the other side...the side who finds immense beauty amidst all of the chaos.  When Big Joan Sets Up has a great guitar feel...I can't put it into words...but between that and Beefheart's Howlin' Wolf caterwauling...it's beautiful.  Bills Corpse is the same.  I love the odd drumming...I wish I could articulate more clearly how much this album has impacted my musical views.  Suffice it to say it is a masterpiece that will never be duplicated and will remain reviled as much as it is adored.  However, if you want to truly see all of music's possibilities, you owe it to yourself to listen to Trout Mask Replica.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I almost didn't buy this album after the abysmal \\"Just Whitney\\" album that came before it.  However, good reviews started to pour in so I decided to take another look.  It's sort of sad I had to think twice because Whitney's voice was the first I ever really gave my full attention to, circa \\"The Bodyguard Soundtrack.\\"  I don't believe there has ever been a voice so precise and clear in pop music before or after Whitney Houston; a voice that was somewhat absent in the \\"Just Whitney\\" album.    From the first note of this album you realize, \\"the voice is back!\\"  \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" was probably the perfect way to begin what can only be called a comeback for diva.  It's loose and fun (and funky) in a way we haven't heard her in years.  Whereas everything on \\"Just Whitney\\" felt stiff and contrived, this feels fresh, like she's having fun with her songs again.  Another thing about this song is that it feels removed from the trends of current pop music, which ironically makes the song feel current. Alicia Keys must've listened to her copy of \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight,\\" as the mood of this song feels closest to that album.  Whitney continues the momentum with \\"Nothin' But Love,\\" perhaps the most viable chance of a hit single on this album.  She's clearly addressing her tribulations of the past few years, \\"I could hold onto pain but that ain't what my life's about/ I ain't blamin' nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out.\\"  She does hit a few rough notes on this song, perhaps due to age or her use of drugs over the years, but for the most part her vocals are front and center and sound great amidst the club-twinged beats. My personal fave on this album.  \\"Call You Tonight\\" is another song reminiscent of the \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" album, though updated for 2009.  It has a slight country feel that helps give the song personality, but it's Whitney's vocal that makes this song that gives this song persona.  In another singer's hands it might have sounded trite, but she gives enough soul that makes it feel like a love song for adults.  Probably not a single, but a definite highlight.  First single, \\"I Look to You,\\" was reportedly written for Houston ten years ago by R. Kelly, and it sounds it, but in a good way.  It evokes memories of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" in terms of song construction, but this is a lesser song.  Her voice sounds good, particularly in the lower range, but it also demonstrates how her voice has deteriorated (particularly on the weak bridge).  It's still a nice song with a good lyric, but it feels a bit stiff after the fun of the first three tracks.  \\"Like I Never Left\\" resumes the relaxed feel that came before \\"I Look to You.\\"  It's a refreshing duet with Akon, adopting his breezy, caribbean style to great effect.  Whitney hits some great notes and there is some single potential here, despite both singers' diminished popularity on the charts.    The only song I didn't really get into on this album was \\"A Song for You.\\"  Whitney oversings here and the production feels a bit dated and forced.  She's pandering to her audience by covering this song and it may very well sound great live, but here it sounds stiff, perhaps because it wasn't written for her specifically like the other songs.  If there was a classic Whitney number in this bunch it would be \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength.\\"  This is a much more affecting ballad than \\"I Look to You.\\"  Whitney plays with her vocals so it doesn't sound like she's trying too hard or trying to hit notes she can't hit anymore.  Lyrically it delivers what we liked about Whitney:  songs about self-empowerment a'la \\"The Greatest Love of All.\\" Could be a hit among the adult contemporary crowd.  One theme that seems present in this album is reclaiming old flames, and the next few songs epitomize that.  \\"Worth it\\" is another song that will probably work well live with it's shout-outs to love and lovers, but on album it's a tad boring and restrained compared to the other material here.  It's smooth R&B that goes down easy but unlikely to be an album favorite for anyone.  \\"For the Lovers\\" explores the same territory as \\"Worth it,\\" but is far more exciting and bouncy.  Here Whitney sounds like she's having fun again and her voice commands the song.  The production has a pleasant edge that was needed at this point in the album after the cool down of the last two songs.  Should work really well live.  \\"I Got You\\" brings Whitney back to reggae-ish territory much like \\"My Love is Your Love.\\"  The theme is good:  just because a couple is apart doesn't mean they're separated spiritually.  Hopefully this doesn't mean a Bobby Brown reunion!  This song has the relaxed feel of the bulk of this album and is a pleasant way of approaching the end of the album.  \\"Salute\\" ends the album effectively, bringing her back to the same emotional territory as the \\"My Love is Your Love\\" album.  This kiss-off of a song, though potent, has a couple problems.  The backup singers dominate the chorus, and Whitney's voice sounds rough when she hits a few notes, but on the whole it's one of her best album-ending songs yet.    This is the female R&B album to compete with this year, a happy surprise that I don't think anyone anticipated at this point.  Bravo!

B0002NRRAG|5.0|This album is definitely not over-rated.  It's beautiful and relaxing all at the same time.  I play it in my office to create that coffee shop atmosphere.  I'm going to be purchasing her next album.  \\"Lonesome Road\\" reminds me so much of walking in a big city and seeing the homeless trying to make it, it reminds me of sacrifices with struggling in life (you don't have to be homeless to be struggling)... it's sweet yet humble.

Well done once again, Dan Brown!!
B001EB5B5I|3.0|Beano plus....this package is a must for Eric Clapton fans., November 30, 2006  By  Peter E. Hefford (Sydney, Australia) -        This is a two-disc deluxe edition of the famous & influential \\"Beano\\" album. Disc one contains both the mono original release (1966) and the stereo version (1969) of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton album.    For a review of disc one, I would refer you to many existing reviews of the original release of this important album. I can add little to all that's been said before, other than to say listen carefully to Have You Heard and Stepping Out. And Ramblin' On My Mind features a young Eric on vocals in the style he came to develop in his solo career.    Disc two (the reason I bought the deluxe edition) contains 19 extra tracks, and is the interesting part if, like me, you already own the original version of the Bluesbreakers album on CD. Extra tracks 1-13 are both live and in the studio. For instance, there are some BBC radio live in the studio broadcasts from 1965 & early 1966 and some recording studio session tracks, which predated the album. Sound quality is quite good on tracks 1-13 and a couple of those tracks highlight (even at that early stage) Eric Clapton's playing in the style he is known for.    But best of all, extra tracks 14 to 19 were recorded live at the Flamingo Club in London in March & April 1966. Those recordings are often primitive, raw, muddy & distorted, but you'll hear some of Clapton's most fiery and fluid playing on the blues guitar standards 14.They Call It Stormy Monday, 17.Have You Ever Loved A Woman and 19.Hoochie Coochie Man. Stormy Monday is the same track that's on John Mayall's Looking Back, and tracks 17 & 19 (above), amongst others, are the same tracks that were released on John Mayall's Primal Solos. There are nevertheless 9 unreleased tracks on disc 2.    This album is from the era when Eric Clapton played a Gibson Les Paul and developed his reputation as \\"God\\". It's a must-have album for Eric Clapton fans, and this deluxe edition, packaging the original album, 19 extra tracks and a 20 page booklet, gives you the best comprehension of how it all happened. As they say, the rest is history.    .....and whilst I have praised Clapton as the musical giant he was to become, credit should be given to John Mayall for being an astute & influential band-leader, mentor to a young Eric and a catalyst of the London blues scene.    Part TWO       1.0 out of 5 stars Great Album - Disappointing Reissue, January 7, 2007  By  spice-the-cat (Ontario, Canada) -     Another attempt to issue the definitive edition of the legendary Bluesbreakers album that falls slightly short of the mark. The mono and stereo mixes on disc 1 are excellently done but simply replicate the single disc issue featuring the same material released a few years ago. This, therefore, sheds no new light on this fertile period of the second British blues boom. Disc 2 features some BBC sessions along with the familiar Immediate and Purdah 45's and half a dozen live tracks, in poor sound quality, that have been available before.    This is a big disappointment and is a missed opportunity which could have been avoided if the compilers had made any attempt to research the easily available archive information from this time. John Mayall himself was known to have kept meticulous records of sessions, gigs, personnel and recording dates and I'm sure would have been more than happy to contribute his knowledge in order to preserve his legacy in the best possible manner.    Anyone expecting to hear more of Clapton's stunning guitar work from this time is in for a big disappointment. Many of the songs from the BBC sessions presented here have nothing more than rhythm guitar low in the mix. This is the case with the first three songs on disc 2 and despite the session date given being after the point where Clapton joined the band, I suspect it was actually recorded earlier with Roger Dean on guitar. The three songsfrom the October 25th session are from the time when Clapton had taken a sabbatical and had been replaced by Geoff Krivit. The third BBC session featured on the disc includes only two songs out of at least five, and possibly six, which are known to have been recorded with Clapton in the band, one of those missing being a rare live version of the instrumental, Hideaway. This session has been bootlegged in excellent sound quality and so it's omission from this set is inexcusable.    All in all the \\"Deluxe\\" edition does nothing to enhance the importance and excitement of this classic album and the poor selection of additional material on disc 2 turns what should have been a worthy project into a complete waste of time and money. Five stars for the original album - 1 star for this reissue
1400063736|3.0|I don't agree this is brilliant or best ever as I've read here. I'll voice my opinion but note I'm prejudiced because he teaches where I also used to teach (different department -- never met him).   The book feels like a collection of short stories that were tweaked until they became a bunch of short stories loosely held together. One can pretty much identify the parts that appear added to link them.      I liked much of the writing, in parts it flew, in parts it seemed a bit contrived. McCann certainly does not possess the Tolstoy-an espertise for knowing just how long to make a section. Most of the characters end up speaking about the same as one another with a few different words but a pacing and line length that blends into one voice, that of the author. One chapter and voice is different because it starts out slangily but then it shifts in and out of the slang as the chapter continues.    It's not bad at all, but it's not really great either.  It is a mildly amusing plodding along story.  The design of the plot of stories all centering around the wire walk is really wonderful. Overall though about half the stories strike a daring balance on the high wire, the other ones...well don't look down.
0385504225|3.0|The Da Vinci code was great, Angels and Demons was good, the Lost Symbol...hmm....it was ok. Yes, the book was too long and drawn out (and way too repetitive.) But the biggest problem was the ending -- rather unsatisfying -- don't want to blow it for anyone who hasn;t read this yet, but the problem was he set himself up to deliver an end result that was impossible to deliver on.....nice try. I'll give you another chance Dan.
0385504225|2.0|AS I turned the last page - finally - all I could think was \\"Why did I buy this?\\".  We all know why; Dan Brown wrote The Da Vinci Code.  Despite all the carping about Brown's writing and the repeated denials of validity by those who care about such things, the theme was fascinating.  Sure, the book wandered around in church history, fighting off a very weird anti-protagonist, placing our hero in dire straits, and rescuing him.      But, it was fun to read, fun to imagine if it were true, fun to talk about with others.  The Lost Symbol has none of those \\"fun\\" qualities.  Readers don't buy Brown's books for aid in obtaining a doctorate; they're bought to enjoy reading.  Unfortunately, The Lost Symbol brings to the fore all of the lacunae in Brown's writing skills without a payoff in the end. Being preached at from the tallest spot in Washington for what seemed to be endless pages was NOT what I expected or wanted. You know the drill - seemingly wicked CIA official with the endless repetitions of her smoking, her size, her appearance, and her wickedness, admirable and intelligent hero but here there are two and one gets mangled for specious reasons, the last minute breakthroughs of Langdon's decoding skills,the miraculous resurrection plus the wooden dialogue tucked between historical travelogues and Biblical meanderings.  Masonic rituals?  Please.    When Langdon actually gives the \\"bad guy\\" what he wants, my wanting to believe or be interested in The Lost Symbol died. No one with a brain much less this \\"celebrated Harvard symbologist\\" would have done this.  No one with a brain would have kept saying or being told \\"He promised he would let Peter go\\" or \\"He gave his word\\" and ACTUALLY BELIEVING IT.  When the premise is super-knowledgeable and intelligent hero versus evil, if the hero isn't acting intelligently, the book dies.      To have multiple heroes/heroines do this is inane; other reviewers have given the examples such as Katherine's inviting the destroyer into the secret lab based on a faked text message.  If that weren't bad enough, she'd already stated that the sender did not know how to text message.      This book's page after page of the anti-hero's looking at himself and the descriptions of his tattooed body, descriptions of the inner tunnels and stairwells/stairs of Washington's buildings, repeated descriptions of the fine qualities of Peter's character, repeated digressions into mind over matter and the technology with which this is being \\"tested\\", repeated Biblical phrases and the nature of God - boring.    I kept reading and waiting - turned out to be waiting for the book to end.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|When I found out this book was coming out, all I could think of was how poorly \\"Angels and Demons\\" ended, and how much I liked \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"  So I bought into the hype and figured, \\"Hey, I've got a 50/50 chance of getting a good story.\\"  Boy, was I wrong.  Having finished the book, I have to say that Dan Brown has outdone himself in the bad ending department.  This book was a HUGE LETDOWN!  I seriously think I could write a better book (given six years), and I am NOT a writer!  I agree with the one poster on this comment board;  do yourself a favor, and just stop reading the book at about page 450, because the rest of the book is almost like watching one of those firework \\"snakes\\" (you light it and expect a roman candle-like display with all the accompanying oooohs and aaaaahs; but all it ends up doing is smoking for a while, then petering out and turning to ash; just like this book).  The book was just a huge waste of 10 hours of my life that I'll never get back...  If you still decide to read this \\"novel\\", at least wait until it makes it to the \\"bargain books\\" section of Borders.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is one of the best WWII productions I have ever seen would recomend to anyone.
031606792X|5.0|I really liked the first book in the series. It introduced the characters very well, I love Bella's character (other than her sexual promiscuity) and Edward sounds God-like. The 2nd and 3rd books really were not that good. They were really slow and SHOULD have been condensed into 1/3 of the pages that they were. I could have lived without the whole Jacob saga... and Bella is WAY too over-dramatic about losing Edward... seriously hundreds of pages of her pining. Enough is enough!!!! Also the 4th book leaves you hanging in relation to Jacob. Anyway, I almost put the series down for good. I am a finisher and just had to get to the end though - which I'm glad I did! The 4th book is freaking AWESOME!!! It's fast-paced with great romance and love (some of the sexual scenes were too much though... especially for a younger audience).     It appalls me that these books are for \\"young adults.\\" It upsets me that the heroine of the book, Bella, is constantly throwing herself sexually at Edward, and HE is the one to want to wait until marriage. Come on... there are lots of moral women out there. It's sad that Stephanie Meyer didn't create a more moral character that our teenage girls could look up to. I am not going to let my teenagers read these books just for that reason. I think the whole series was way too over-hyped. I'm not sure if I'll ever read them again, but if I do I will just quickly skim the 2nd and 3rd book.     I have recently found an author that does portray moral upright values that I want in my daughters. I highly recommend these books to young adult/teenagers but really anyone at any age would love them. #1 Where the Wind Sings #2 Witch Way - both of these are by Robyn M. Schow.

B000025ZVK|4.0|If you dont know why Metallica's Ride The Lightning is the album that put them on the map then you need to buy this album immediately. Its amazing that this album came out in the early 80's and metal bands are still trying to steal their sound 20+ years later.    However, my used copy from somewhere in Las Vegas was a copy made in South America. The booklet appeared to be color photo copied with Spanish instead of English in the insert. The cd played fine but I couldnt help but think something looks a little unusual about this cd. Hence 4 stars instead of 5
B0025KVLS8|5.0|This particular remaster sounds excellent. It also doesn't suffer from the left and right balancing problem that other albums suffer from on the stereo. I really enjoy this album more now.
0439882826|4.0|This is not your standard pop-up book. These are intricate designs that explode out of the page at you. Some of the coloring is off. Most of the pages are a bit delicate for the grabbing hands of the little ones who want to read it and turn the pages.
B002NY731U|3.0|I'll start off by saying I loved the last 4 songs on the album much more than I enjoyed the rest of the album. Those 4 songs saved it for me personally.     The rest of the album felt like a great attempt at hitting close to their roots but as bands so often prove, you just can't ever quite get there. It's why that phrase \\"you can't go home again\\" must have been made. You can try, you can come close, but you can never quite reach all that you were, or had, as before.     This is not a bad album. It's just not enough, for me personally, to get excited about. I didn't have to hear any song again. None of them made me fall in love with them at that moment like when I heard Peace Sells for the first time.   And maybe it's my fault for measuring them against their best stuff but that is human nature I think. I also think it's human nature to be less critical of something that you've really loved for a long time.     But alas, it's music and music is something that is similar to beauty; it's in the ear of the beholder as opposed to the eye.

B002CLBJPK|4.0|Oh where to start of what part I like in this delightful movie, which is far from the book, I am assuming the author must be happy and unhappy at this version of their book that was made into a musical. However it is Disney and they just strip out what they think works, and at the time that this was beginning to start Walt had passed away...., however this is still charming for the child in all of us. Angela Lansbury is a gem in this and truly a great reason to own this movie. I myself had seen Angela in Sweeney Todd when it reopen at the time the New Wang Theater once know as the metropolitan Music Box theater...., She was a wonderful performer and a delight to what on stage, and I am grateful that she was in the wonderful Blithe Spirit. However if you have this already there is nothing new here on this disc it is the same one that you already had, the Blue rey is none better, if your going to make a new box add something to it, a in-depth look at making it like the Mary poppins, which also like snow white is the same as the 60th anniversary one. Wizard of Oz did the same thing put out a beatufil box set then this year they  reissued it in a new 75th anniversary box, but nothing new...., so if you own this already and unless it is really old then yes by all means get this
B001O2ZW1A|2.0|If you are an Open-Minded & Multi-Genre Connoisseur of REAL music, there is almost nothing Steven Wilson creates that isn't a pleasurable & mind-expanding experience to listen to.<br />Even the early Porcupine Tree stuff is fabulous for a proper state of meditation, and the odd occassion of fun & frolic, when the correct mood strikes you.<br />PT, No-Man, IEM, Bass Communion & Blackfield projects are full of Drama, Emotion, Beauty, Exploration, Originality & Mastery of Color worthy of Ghogan's Palette. If you are a Musician, then you are likely familiar with the term \\"Using the Entire Spice Rack\\" ! Steven Wilson does have quite a Tasty Menu to offer.  Music that takes the Listener on a Journey;<br />--is another fine way of describing it.<br />  I absolutely tip my hat to Steve Wilson, and I am damned grateful for the rare opportunity that anyone came along and picked up the torch from where it was dropped on the lifeless, overtilled soil by groups like Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, The Doors, & King Crimson, etc.  There are many bands out there that were weaned on Progressive, and now present their own attempts at continuing the Genre, but FEW have been able to truly expand on that style of Rock Music in such a meaningful and enjoyable manner as Steven Wilson & Porcupine Tree. They make it feel & sound like true Destiny, or Spiritually Harmonic Convergence of The Universe--which is indeed the most magical & rare quality for any musicians to capture and demonstrate. That elusive & mystical spark of Mystery and Adventure is what made Progressive Rock so exciting to begin with.<br />  That being said, expectations for the 1st Official, Full-length Solo Release from Mr. Wilson were quite high, to say the least !  Sadly, he used the opportunity to fulfill his own self-indulgent interests of Studio Sound Experimentation, instead of making a product that his actual audience would enjoy listening to. With the exception of the Opening Track, and a few other scattered moments of awe & beauty, the album sounds like Steven's been spending WAY too much time hanging out with Robert Fripp, or trying to impress him ! This disc is not the usual tasty snack, nor does it take you on a journey anywhere but straight into a BRICK WALL, and then make a weak attempt at apologizing ! It's dank, dark, industrial, devoid of harmony or rhythm, and sounds almost deliberately aimless and unstructured. Gee, I guess he wanted to SURPRISE us for a change !?<br />I suppose one could hail it as a brilliant sonic accomplishment, but it CERTAINLY aint enjoyable to listen to ! Feels like swimming through the La Brea Tarpits, or having a 600-pound Fat Lady sit on your chest and fart in your face ! I like the other REVIEW here, where somebody compared it to a day in the Dentist's Chair without Novacaine !  LMAO !

I was SO excited to hear the new Porcupine Tree album, \\"The Incident\\",<br />only to discover that it also suffered a similar treatment as this solo album :<br /> 1 great song, a few highlights,<br />then pointless rambling exercises in self-loathing aural vomit. What the Hell happened to writing GROOVIN'-[...]SONGS ?! Are we bored of that now ? If I wanna feel miserable, I'll turn on the NEWS, Thank You !<br />  Most Fans know that The Beach Boys are one of SW's most cherished Muses. That element of simple joyful pop and sing-along harmony is what seems to so powerfully balance the contrast against the \\"Darker\\" flavors of SW/PT music; It has always been a Trademark part of their sound & style; yet seems to be increasingly more absent from recent releases.<br /> I guess nothing wonderful ever lasts forever,<br />as the old cliche goes.

0321344758|4.0|A little short, I know that was the objective of the author, keeping it so short that it can be read on a plane. Right, it should be cheaper then... anyway, even though it's a book from 2005, the usability analysis is valid even 4 years later: the usability principles and guidelines described in the book are often not followed by designers, despite the evolution of the web.

0061537934|5.0|The novel has a lot of heart and soul. All genuine stories are about loss, and this one treats the subject honestly and without flinching. My only complaint is that the story dwells a bit too much on the difficult and painful issues, especially with the \\"evil twins\\". The passages about racing were authentic. I would have liked to read more about them; perhaps having Denny take Enzo for a track walk.

True, you can hear the bass line a little better here, Lennon's harmony there, but unless you're a Beatles junkie it's not worth the price.

B0028K3192|4.0|Maxwell's audience always anticipates his comeback because they know their expectations will be met. Since he debuted with \\"Urban Hang Suite\\", he has been delivering nothing but the goods. Songs such as \\"Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder)\\", \\"Whenever, Wherever, Whatever\\", \\"Lifetime\\" and the Kate Bush remake, \\"This Woman's Work\\" are nothing less than timeless classics. Fast forward to 2009 and BOOM! Maxwell blesses radio stations with the smash hit \\"Pretty Wings\\" which is loved by most. It may take some time to get into, but this song will get you good after a few listens, as will the rest of \\"Black Summer's Night\\", if you give it the opportunity.  As always, there is live instrumentation all throughout the album, Maxwell doing great things with his voice like falsetto, and lyrics worth picking apart. So many of Maxwell's songs have hidden meanings; that's part of what makes him so wonderful. The elementary lyrics found on urban radio grow old really quickly. Thank goodness there are artists like Maxwell, Jill Scott, Babyface, India Arie and Dwele to give us a great escape.<br /><br />For this album, just press play!

068484267X|4.0|This is one heart wrenching story. Told mostly in the first person, little Frank mcCourt is talking to you, and when you listen (whether you like it or not, you listen), you get transported to New York with him and then to Ireland. He truly is a gifted story teller, his simple words paint a picture of his life and you feel the pain and hunger he talks about.

His alcoholic father can't seem to keep a job and when he does, he spends most of the money drinking in pubs, whilst his children are left starving and cold. The family moves to Limmirck, Ireland, and the father keeps his old ways - you know the father means well, Frank knows it and he loves him despite the circumstances they're in, but you can't forgive him for what he's doing to his family. Frank takes you with him as he grows up, you take in the surroundings, the utter hunger they feel, the house the live in, his mother's grief, and the sole lavotary in the lane which is right outside their kitchen window.<br /><br />For the longest time after finishing the book, I'd still hear the little boy talking in my head. His humor, and way with words stay with you long, and you'll forever see Limirick as the city he saw, and experienced.

Coraline Jones, the explorer, goes through the house and yard and discovers the well she's been told not to go close to and the abandoned tennis court.<br /><br />Coraline finds a locked door in their parlour but when her mother opens it, they find that it leads to nowhere - just a wall. One day, when her mum and dad are out, she unlocks the door and finds that it has changed into a corridor. She goes in and at the other side finds another house, like hers, with the 'other' mother and father.<br /><br />The other mother and father look like her parents but have black buttons for eyes. Their hosue is almost similar except for a few differences. Coraline leaves them and goes back to her house, but then returns. And when she returns, the other mother locks the door, and now Coraline needs to find a way to get back home.<br /><br />This was my firs Gaiman book.

Sure, I cried, but it wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />Fransesca, a rural housewife has a week to herself when her husband and kids go to a nearby town. During this week she meets Robert, a photographer who is on an assignemnet in Madison County. Both instantly feel the other person is the person they should be with when Robert stops by Fransesca's house for directions. They spend 4 days together, and what starts as love under the pretext of friendship quickly turns into what its supposed to be. After these four days they don't meet or talk again. They both want to, but responsibilities and guilt make that impossible.<br /><br />A tale of love found and lost. Sad read. Maybe I didn't like this book because of it's ending. Or maybe the writing style bothered me more than I thought it would
B001MYIXAC|3.0|I liked it, unique twist on a vampire tale but it was hard to tell what was going on. I didnt quite get a good understanding of the characters, maybe due to the dubbed dialogue which I do not like. I tried to get the subtitles via the menu but for some reason that did not work.<br />I loved the lead boy, he was very good.<br />Excellent cinematography, and proof that you do not need a high superstar over blown budget and megacelebrity actors in order to tell a very compelling tale.<br />I can not give it away...but i have to say, the very last scene was fantastic.
0141182504|3.0|The Outsider/The Stranger is the story of young Mersault, a man, apparently devoid of emotions. The plot is simple. Mersault talks to us about his boring job, shows us that he doesn't love his girlfriend and doesn't grieve when he is told his mother just died in the home he sent her to a few years ago.<br /><br />After the funeral service, he meets a young lady that used to work with him. They watch a movie, go to the beach and meet again the next day. He is invited to a weekend's getaway to the beach with his girlfriend and neighbor, and there he unintentionally gets involved in his neighbor's problem with two men. He kills one of them after the problem is semi resolved and gets sent to prison.<br /><br />The second part of the book deals with his trial, and with his apathetic nature which leaves lawyers at ends about how to defend him. He doesn't try to defend himself, he admits he killed the man. He says it was a mistake. They dwell on the fact that he did not grieve for his mother. He reasons his existence, and while you follow what he is saying, you can't fully justify his killing the man, him condemning himself like that.<br /><br />I don't know if I completely got Mersault. Most probably I didn't. But to me, he seemed like a shell of a man, the remains of someone who was. Nothing is said of his past, nothing is hinted, but yet, I feel that there must be something, some event, that made him so apathetic. I was left wanting to know the whys of his life.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|\\"Taking life. Seriously\\"--The motto for this show sums the premise well.  More than just about a vigilante serial killer and his crimes, this show analyzes and at times, mocks the inner Freudian Id in all of us...the darkness of human nature.  I can't believe that the writer, Melissa Rosenberg is the same writer who wrote the screenplay for cheesy teen flicks like \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Step Up\\".  She obviously found her niche here.  As other reviewers have stated, this is the best Showtime series yet.  I'm usually not a fan of crime fiction, but I'm definitely a fan of Dexter.  Excellent cast choice, acting, and writing.  To those who think the premise is hokey, first of all this is fictional entertainment. Secondly, there are parallels to real serial killers such as the famous Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer.

1594202249|2.0|I know Pynchon's rep. Incredible all encompassing works stuffed full of sly references to everything under the sun so that reading them gives you membership in an exclusive club where everyone is in on the same joke. I know all that. That being said this book is just a painfully bad read, a very shallow story with dialogue that sounds like a freshman creative writing student's. If this wasn't Pynchon it never would have been published.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Michael Buble's new CD does little to impress if you're not already a fan. However, if you're into the modernized version of the smooth lounge singer with a little attitude, this is right up your alley. Covers of old-time songs like Georgia on My Mind and Stardust (both well-known Hoagy Carmichael tunes) fit so well in Buble's warm, silky voice, the listener will probably want to slow-dance. Faster numbers like All I Do is Dream of You and Heartache Tonight sound a little cheesy in this style, but not for lack of talent or effort. The title song is charming and well done, but shouldn't be compared to the more delightfully sensual Aaron Neville version. Where Buble really excels are classics like All of Me and You're Nobody, and it should be noted that the song Hold On is sincere and passionate. Baby (You've Got... ) is also a fun song with awesome guest singer Sharon Jones. The two voices compliment each other perfectly in this song. Incredibly talented singers and extremely talented musicians make this CD worth listening to while drinking a Pink Lady.

B0029LHW4U|4.0|A new album from Alice In Chains has always seemed like a doomed proposition, seeing as how many define the band by the powerful vocals of the late Layne Staley. Still, there's more to a band than the singer if the band is any good, and this release seems to confirm that. Black Gives Way To Blue is a fine addition to the AIC catalog. Many negative reviews seem to be trapped in the loss of Staley, but this is really a pretty unfair standard. The band didn't kick him out, he fell to addiction. In spite of that, there's still this accusation of betrayal that the rest of the group would dare continue without him. It's a bit juvenile, and worse it instantly rules out a true evaluation of the record. It is a true shame that Staley fell to his demons, but it's also true that this new album is still a worthy entry for AIC. Fans will certainly have those moments of missing Staley's vocals, but after time (at least for me) the music becomes the true focus. Here's a short breakdown of my opinion of the album:<br /><br />1. All Secrets Known - A solid, heavy opening track that brings that old AIC sound back.<br />2. Check My Brain - A fantastic single, and a good track to judge the new vocal dynamic by.<br />3. Last Of My Kind - Classic AIC, made me think of 'Dam That River' right away.<br />4. Your Decision - the inevitable comparisons to 'No Excuses' are everywhere, and while this track doesn't equal that classic it's still good, slower AIC.<br />5. A Looking In View - Reminded me of 'Sickman' for some reason, some very good vocals in here.<br />6. When The Sun Rose Again - a track that is growing on me, this could easily have been mistaken for an outtake from the original AIC Unplugged.<br />7. Acid Bubble - This track starts off great, heavy and meditative, but tonal shift for the chorus was a letdown. The weakest track for me.<br />8. Lesson Learned - While not outstanding, still a solid track and very listenable.<br />9. Take Her Out - Slow and deliberating, something about this makes it memorable for me. A good way to begin the finish to the album.<br />10. Private Hell - Another step to the end of the album, slow and haunting.<br />11. Black Gives Way To Blue - A fantastic final song, a great requiem piece.<br /><br />In summary, the best part of this album is that while it's clearly a step forward for the band, it's obvious they aren't forgetting the past. There's no way to being Staley back, but in my opinion he would be happy to see the group continue to push their signature sound in the future.d way to begin the finish to the album.  10.

031237593X|5.0|This was a wonderfully detailed story of Richard III and Edward IV and a good place to start if you want to read fiction about the war of the roses.  This was not an easy read for me as I usually devour books, even a lengthy novel such as this one.  I found that I could only get through 30 to 50 pages a night as I have to go back and think about what I read and take in the details of the story as I went along.  That being said this was one of the best books I have read and I very highly recommend it.
0307454541|4.0|I'm not going to rehash the plot, as many others have done so. I really enjoyed this book, and am looking forward to reading the 2 sequels. And then sadly, no more, as the author died unexpectedly before the publication of his books.<br /><br />While some things do become obvious in the story, there are a lot of twists and turns, and the plot is fresh and unusual, even if it does get a bit gory. I skipped all of the descriptions of graphic violence, including Salander's rape by her \\"guardian.\\" And it helps that I have spent considerable time in Scandinavia, so I am familiar with Swedish names, geography, politics, etc.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 for two main reasons:<br /><br />1) The translation. I realize that this is not the author's fault, but surely they could have found a native English speaker, or at least one who is more fluent in English nuances, to translate the book. Or at least, have a good editor go through it and correct errors in syntax and grammar, and just do some rewriting to make it sound like a real English dialogue. Also, the translator mixed up British and American English, and couldn't seem to decide which to go with--like using Fahrenheit instead of Celsius (when it was obvious he meant Celsius), rucksacks instead of backpacks--but then using American English for other descriptions. You generally can't translate literally from one language to another, unless they are really close, but this translator seemed to have no idea how to translate and yet put some spark into the narration. I hope they get a better translator for the next two books.<br /><br />2) The pacing needed to be better, when it came to switching back and forth between characters. Early on, it was difficult to say who was going to be the main character--Lisbeth or Mikael. But very soon, it became Mikael's story as the plot began to move around the Vangers and the unsolved crime. Lisbeth and Mikael still remained separate stories for at least 300 pages, and I found the switch to backstories with Lisbeth very annoying. I didn't dislike her character, but I quickly became bored with hearing over and over how anti-social she was, and all of her past traumas, etc. The switch away from the main plot was distracting and didn't add anything to the story, and I found myself quickly skimming the Lisbeth portions (I only glanced at them to make sure that it wasn't leading up to her involvement in the case) and then moved back to Mikael and the main plot.<br /><br />I also didn't see any need for Mikael and Lisbeth to get involved, and certainly, it was completely out of character for Lisbeth to initiate it.

B002B4OVWG|2.0|I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews and thought this may be something to help my little one sleep. We tried lots of different pacifiers, but he never really took to any one style. I thought I would try this because of the idea that it could help stay in his mouth. However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product. I was also a bit hesitant because of the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the plush toy but I was willing to deal with it at the time. However, it really would be a much better product if there was a way to separate for cleaning.
B000TRXN6W|4.0|Download an entire album for $3 is amazing. Who is going to hesitate at the price? I'm sure that the artist can earn more if the business is set up right, and the fat cats are cut out of the process.    I hope this might be a sign of things to come. Like the Apple App Store, providing great products at a great price means high volume and more earnings for the producers.    A very nice album by the way.

141654917X|1.0|I was curious about this author, and wanted to see what the brouhaha was all about.<br /><br />I know now that Jodi Picoult is laughing all the way to the bank, but this was a piece of crap, cover to cover.  The premise was good; everything else was not.  In more able hands, this could have been a riveting novel, hinging on the ethical dilemma of what is right and what is wrong.  Instead, the book is peppered with unfathomable characters (come on, when was the last time you met a 13 year old that talked like she was 43?), sappy memories, bitter memories (Jesse pulling his braces with a fork because his mom and dad didn't want to take him to practice his skateboard), an assortment of morons (like the lawyers, still not over their high-school breakup).  And it goes on and on and on.  Yes, I had to finish this garbage, so i unfortunately read the cop-out of an ending.  Unbelievable, and the easy route for the author.<br /><br />Please don't read this.  Crap novels like this one rot the brain.  I beg you, walk away.  This is possibly the worst book i have ever read.

0793518326|4.0|Sometime down the road, there will be a new edition of this book of \\"scores\\".  Not soon though, as there are, no doubt, quite a few copies of this edition left.  No, it'll be not long after the last musician, eager to either finally break the code of \\"that song\\", which has been gnawing away at his or her curiosity, or the new convert, tired of the derivations, who has successfully found the source and purchased the last copy of this edition.  Then will come the announcement: \\"Released this week, the NEW, UPGRADED...\\"    Why? Because there is at least one mistake in this edition, and it occurs in \\"Blackbird\\", the very first song I checked. Previously, there have been a number of fingering methods portrayed as a true reflection of what McCartney did in '67, when he wrote and recorded this song.  I'm talking specifically about bar 5, and all subsequent bars which contain the C - Cdim - D - Ddim changes which underlay \\"take these broken wings...\\".  I'm surprised that the transcriber wouldn't have either checked with the source, or even checked a couple of YouTube videos which clearly show McCartney playing what are both simpler, and more manageable versions of the fingering of these notes.   This is what McCartney plays: 3rd fret on 5th string (1st finger) with 5th fret on 2nd string (4th finger), 4th on 5th (4th finger) with 3rd on 1st (1st finger),5th on 5th (1st) with 7th on 2nd (4th), 6th on 5th (4th) with 5th on 1st (1st), 7th on 5th with 8th on 2nd.  These are natural and sensible changes, in contrast with what the guitar TAB transcriber has written, and no editor picked up on.    Pedantic? Well, hundreds of thousands of guitarists will now use the score version, believing that's what McCartney wrote. What's scored is more convoluted and doesn't reflect the fingering used, nor style of writing the author clearly shows in a YouTube video of him doing a sound check during a tour of Russia from some years ago.    So, song one... mistake. Great introduction. I'd imagine you'd be hard pressed to find too many others, but I guarantee many fingers will flip straight to page 359 to see what the transcribers made of the opening chord to \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", and... it's not a bad take on the chord, however it's not complete, as it doesn't contain the opening piano chord played by George Martin.     Is it asking too much to have these already-documented elements included? Well, the book says \\"Full transcriptions from the original recordings\\". \\"FULL TRANSCRIPTIONS\\" of some of the most popular songs musicians and music students are determined to play correctly.  So, don't be surprised if the publishers, sometime around 2015 or so, after collating all the necessary mistakes reviews such as this one, have pointed out, have the new edition of these scores available...\\"THE ABSOLUTE FINAL, WE REALLY GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME EDITION!\\"    Nevertheless, this is a welcome addition to any musician music teacher or student's library of music. Some people have complained about the size of the staves/notes etc, but they're not that bad, certainly adequate enough to enable one to learn a song.    And, the packaging is excellent. A glossy hard-cardboard outer cover that the scores book, which also sports a strong hard cover, resides within. Given the thickness of the book, it's been well manufactured, with a spine that allows it stay open at most internal pages without having the covers flip closed.  I'm giving it 4 out of 5, for the reasons already stated.     If you're at all interested in taking Beatles songs apart, there isn't a better set of scores available....yet.
157912688X|5.0|Though not one of Christie's more famous novels, this is one of her darkest because the murderer is among the three or four most reprehensible in the Christie canon. ('The Body in the Library', 'Mrs. McGinty's Dead', and 'The ABC Murders' also feature particularly loathsome killers.)  In Christie stories as in most murder mysteries killers are rarely sympathetic characters, though sometimes a murderer's crime is mitigated by his motive, such as fear of financial ruin, to silence a blackmailer, to prevent exposure of some secret, or even love.<br /><br />In 'Sad Cypress', however, the murderer's motive is entirely venal and his diabolical, near-perfect scheme to evade discovery earns him a place among Christie's most notorious villains, despite the fact that he succeeds in murdering 'only' two people.<br /><br />Indeed, the killer is so clever that no hint of suspicion touches him until Poirot -- in one of his more challenging cases -- unmasks him.  Also, as in 'The ABC Murders' the reader cannot help but be aware of how close the murderer comes to getting an innocent person hanged in his place.<br /><br />Readers can also enjoy the superb British TV adaptation of 'Sad Cypress' featuring David Suchet.
B00081912E|4.0|I've seen this hilarious, inventive, fast, crazy, and delightful comedy many times and it never bores me. It makes my eyes pop up and my jaw drop down not unlike Jim Carrey's Mask persona in one of the film's many incredible scenes. This is the perfect movie for Jim Carrey's talents in physical comedy. He sure had a lot of fun and improvised in many scenes doing the parodies and paying the homage to the famous movies and characters in recognizable and hilarious way. The movie made me laugh all the time; it is a perfect fun for the whole family which does not happen too often. All supporting players made the film even more enjoyable but one actor who did impossible and almost stole the central spot from Carrey was the dog, the Jack Russell Milo. What a great performance! If they ever gave the Oscars for the best animal performance, Milo would be the one to receive it. The Mask also marked the film debut for an ex- model, 22 years old Cameron Diaz, and I believe that it was one of the most stunning debuts ever. The moment, she stepped in Stanley Ipcus's (Jim Carrey) bank and his life, the new star was born. I've never seen her as beautiful as in her first movie, and her dance with Carrey at the night club has proved that she could keep up with the most amazing physical comedian of our time. Great fun. Oh yes - how could I forget the Oscar nominated special effects that made Carrey's transformations from a shy clerk to a superhero absolutely amazing. I think that this comedy is timeless and it would delight the viewers of all ages for many years.
B001N26GFC|5.0|The Maria McKee song I've paraphrased in the review title should be Happy Go Lucky's soundtrack.  Its world is set from the earliest moments of the movie when Poppy, unrelentingly cheerful, returns to where she has locked her bicycle only to find it stolen.  Her reaction?  She says aloud that she's sorry she didn't get to say goodbye.  That's your movie right there; all the rest is filling in the details (and trying to understand the North London accents).  And at the end of the the journey -- slight spoiler here -- if Poppy has found that she cannot bring cheer to those who will not accept it, nor will she let the sometimes bitter and unrewarding world she inhabits consume her.  That wasn't enough for a number of other reviewers here.  I'm not sure why.  Poppy's is not an unexamined life.  Rather, she's examined it and found it works for her.  More than most movies, Happy Go Lucky must, I think, be taken on its own terms to be appreciated.  Not much happens; not much changes.  Poppy tries to make a difference and whatever happens, she carries on.  I liked her and her movie, a lot.
B000784WMW|5.0|This version is the benchmark by which I judge all other versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\". Timothy Dalton is the way I imagined Mr. Rochester the first time I read the novel. And Zelah Clarke is just perfect as Jane. Wonderful acting, wonderful scenery. It doesn't get any better than this!
B0014JLYPQ|5.0|I bought these shoes to work at the restaurant.  I have Plantar fasciitis and working at the restaurant kills my feet.  I had read all about the shoes and decided to give it a try.  There was some great information regarding the shoes and this condition.    Before I was complaining by hour 6 of how badly my feet hurt.  AT the end of my 8 hour shift, I could barely walk.  My feet were so swollen and so achy.  I would wrap them in a cold cloth and massage them with the foot massager.  It was absolutely horrible. After a 20 minute stint of driving, I would barely be able to walk into the house. I tried numerous foot insoles with no success. Heel that pain, dr. schols, and a few others.  Heel that pain was the worst.  No help at all.     Well, I love the shoes, my feet are still a little sore after working but the change is phenomenal. I can finish my shift now. When I drive home and get out of the car I can walk into the house.  It is such a great change.      The only bad side is your feet get really wet.  I have to wash the floors and there is no way to keep your feet from getting wet.  But it is totally worth it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Just say the name of this movie & everyone knows what you are talking about.  Mel Gibson has done a \\"Wonderful\\" Job.  This is by far a \\"movie\\" that can be easily put into the caategory of \\"greats\\" such as \\"The Ten Commandments\\".      I have never watched a movie that is \\"as it should be written\\" straight from the script (the Bible).  Mel Gibson was sure to get as close to the actual facts as needed, so that the entire \\"truth\\" could be told.    If you are looking to see Glamorous actors with \\"airbrushed\\" skin, \\"simplistic movie lines\\" and \\"Romantic Encounters\\" this will not wet your appetite; however, if you are looking for a movie that will capture your attention from the begining to the very end, you will not be dissapointed.    Actors & Actresses = A+  Use of Language - Aramic, Latin & Hebrew = A+  Waldrobe Costumes = A+  Film Quality & Camera Work = A+    Definitely worth the \\"purchase\\" for your \\"Movie Collection\\".
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I loved GI JOE as a kid, and when I saw the first trailer for this movie I thought 'This is GI JOE?  It doesn't look anything like the GI JOE I remember?'  It looked like they were taking too many liberties from the cartoon series I loved as a kid and I was planning on skipping it in the theater and waiting to check out the Blu-ray.    Well, I changed my mind and convinced my wife to come see it with me.  Initially, I thought I loved it because I went in with such low expectations?  Well, I've seen it 3 times in the theater, (I don't think I've done that w/ any other movie???) and I love it even more and I'm pre-ordering the Blu-ray because I can't wait to see it again!    OK, it's not perfect, but it is a WHOLE LOTTA FUN!!!  IMO, it's what a blockbuster summer movie should be - an escape, and extremely entertaining.  The gadgets are over the top and so are the explosions, but as a kid - isn't that what I was imaginging in the backyard and bathtub with these characters???      Duke's Acting is pretty poor and some of the CG feels a little forced (2 or 3 shots), but that doesn't detract from the overall feeling and fun of the movie for me.  If you can imagine everyone on screen as an action figure (and that's basically what GI JOE is - a vehicle to sell toys), it's great fun!  The back stories are pretty good and I was surprisingly impressed w/ Marlon Wayans portrayal of Ripcord (one of my favorites as a kid).  If you didn't see it in the theater, I highly recommend checking it out!
0385504225|3.0|I've read everyhting of Dan's to date and typically love his stuff. Especially DaVinci and Angels. This book is no exception. Really. I did like it.     The negative is that it is somewhat cookie cutter and straight out of the other two books in terms of plot lines. A little too predictable.     The positives are that it is a story based upon a very intersting subject - Masonic Lore. It also gives you plenty to think about in terms of how the subject matter applies to you (\\"me\\") as a person. I like that very much about Dan's book and writing.    I'd like to see him change up the plot line a bit when he comes out with his next book.
B000YMBBH0|3.0|Jason Bourne rocks, however this HD-DVD format was dead so I have this Trilogy for nothing, can't watch now.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love Michael, have for 7 or 8 years, own every album and single I can lay hands on.  I think he's amazing, and I'm not disappointed with this album.  I think it's fantastic!    It opens with Cry Me A River, and I had goosebumps listening to it the first time.  It is definitely an original take on the song, a little dark, but isn't that the mood of the lyrics?  And At This Moment, a favorite of mine forever, is wonderful as well.    Every album I've ever owned by an artist always has one or two songs that aren't as good as the rest.  For me on this album, it would be Whatever It Takes.      I love the original songs, Hold On and Haven't Met You Yet.    All in all, a perfect album, and I can't wait till he starts touring for it now!
0743496736|5.0|Loved this book.  Very nice transitioning from character to character.  Nice twists and turns to keep you into the story.      Definitely recommend reading.  Completely different and interesting ending.
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed the book from first page to the last page of the book. The book diffferent from all the movies.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|I'm not a huge Slipknot fan or a fan of nu-metal per se (whatever that is) but I have generally liked a few tracks on each of Slipknot's past albums, usually the more mellow ones.  This album is easily their most accessible to date and I really dig most of it.  SNUFF is the stand-out ballad and worth the price alone.  As a fan of more traditional metal styles, I can say this is a good modern metal record for those who don't necessarily dig new stuff.  I'm sure all the kids already own it!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Worth the $10 for the kindle version. If you liked his other books, it's not going to disappoint.
B002APNQF4|5.0|Wonderful cd/dvd combo, music on the cd-some live, videos on the dvd, some not normally seen by most unless you are a devoted WS fan.  Would recommend getting to anyone who loves WS!!!!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|My 8 year old daughter watched this with me and we both loved it. There are so many seasons out there for kids and some for adults. I like this one because it is for both. Can't wait for season 2 and season 1 blueray...
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I bought this movie for my grand-daughter but the whole family enjoyed it.  Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens made this movie just like they did in the 1st one.  Their romance is very touching.  The music and dancing is fantastic.  All the actors and actresses played great roles.
0316779237|2.0|This is the first David Sedaris book I've purchased and attempted to read. The first couple of chapters were interesting and funny but didn't have anything to do with dealing with family. It was about his Christmas job. I didn't necessarily like his view of families and children in which the humor was a little too dark for my taste. Halfway through, there was really more mundane daily stuff that didn't hold my attention. I didn't have any interest in finishing this book.
0316166685|3.0|I also was looking forward to reading this book.  Seeing how a movie will be made of it soon, I wanted to read the book first.  I was very perplexed that the only \\"second\\" chance that Susie had when she came back to earth she didn't help to find her killer, explain how she was killed, or where she was buried so her family could finally rest knowing what happened to her.  I also was disappointed at how the murderer met his fate.  I thought it lacked imagination.      I would recommend this book as a quick read, but it wasn't as intense and thought provoking as I had hoped.
B002APNQEU|5.0|This is another great addition to the WS collection, always loved the song anyway.  Would recommend to any devoted WS fans!!!!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|If you missed any of the TV shows, then you can watch the DVD.  It is a great show, my husband loves it.  I also bought it for a friend who had heard about the show but had not watched it. He said that it was the best show he had watched in years. Katey Sagal plays an awesome part
0385504225|3.0|I did enjoy The Lost Symbol, and I think it's Brown's best book.  It was an entertaining thriller, although it got sadistic at some points, thanks to a very sick villain.      I loved the Masonic references, although I was amused by all of the high ranking government people who were 33rd degree Masons in the novel.  My husband is a 33rd degree Mason, and I said to him, \\"don't you wish?\\"  He says that Brown got some of the details about Freemasonry wrong, but he could not tell if that was deliberate--after all the book is fiction--or careless research.  I have visited the House of the Temple in Washington, and it is a fascinating building.    The weakest part of the novel was the concern about the details of Masonic degrees going public.  As a previous reviewer indicated, not many people would care.      Brown attempts some philosophy, and it's only an attempt, but at least it might get people to think about some of the ultimate questions of life.  And that's not bad.
B000002R0P|5.0|First off I'd like to state that a lot of people on different websites and places, for some reason, believe that the least enjoyable track on this record is \\"Give It Back\\" and I really don't know why. I find it to be by far one of the most enjoyable in the whole of Gentle Giant's catalog.    Anyway, the surprising thing about this version of the album, is that this \\"old\\" or \\"outdated\\" and out of print version of this record actually has really outstanding quality. All the instruments seem to have their own channel. If anyone's looking to buy the reissue, paying a bit extra for good quality, you may want to consider just getting this one. It's surprisingly good.     As for the actual music itself, like all Gentle Giant albums, very stimulating. The album starts off with a very stern and harsh song called \\"Interview\\". It seems that, overtime, this album grows more melodic. As I stated earlier, one of the most enjoyable (I find) is the track \\"Give It Back\\" which at its core, has the feel of a reggae song, but has beautiful depth and really nice time, tempo, and chord changes.     Another highlight of the album is the song \\"Timing\\". It is upbeat, but often times quite melodic. It is just a colorful forest of all sorts of instruments. Plus it's got a really killer guitar solo, along with great teamwork between the guitar and keyboards to create a driving riff.     My personal favorite track off of this album is the last, entitled \\"I lost my head\\". Something about the flute in this song just really settles itself straight into your heart.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|This album is so lame I can't believe it was ever released.  MB is nothing but a \\"Pretty Boy Poser\\".  Who told this guy he could sing?  He sounds absolutely soul-less and root-less.  The arrangements are so boring and uninventive. Enough Said!
B0007XT87G|5.0|I'm a somewhat new fan to Porcupine Tree and in the last few years have managed to get several of their albums. To me this one just rocks. It's heavy at times and mellow in others. I think it's an album to get someone interested in PT who's never heard them before.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I loved the first season of \\"Fringe\\". So I wanted the extras that DVD offers. This set doesn't disappoint.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|If you like the music of Woodstock, or if you're interested in music history, this is a must have. Beautifully presemnted, and excellent content.
B00001OH7V|5.0|David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" captures its time and place like few other albums of the 1970s.  The Cold War angst of a divided Berlin permeates the album; however, Bowie offers hope in the classic title song, \\"Heroes.\\"  The combination of Bowie's eclecticism as a composer and lyricist (and as a singer, since he adopts several different voices) with Alomar, Eno, and Fripp's work as programmers, players, and co-writers made for music that is progressive, with strange, eerie sound effects interwoven with pop-ish melodies.  The sound quality on the CD reissue is quite good and well balanced throughout the spectrum.  There have been so many highly detailed reviews and analyses of this fine album over the years, that I won't detail all the songs.  Suffice it to say that it is an album of its time; however, it is also an album with timeless enough themes and intriguing enough music that it remains highly relevant.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I'm ashamed to say I didn't see this movie until 2000, but when I did I was utterly blown away by the power of it.  While movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, Shawshank does the opposite by putting the viewer in a harsh reality with seemingly no escape from it...yet Andy Dufresne manages to find a way.    While both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins had some memorable roles before and after this movie, their roles as Red and Andy, respectively, are career-defining roles.  In any time period, one can see those who have thrown in the towel after life has dealt them a harsh hand, while others hold onto boundless optimism in spit of the bad hand life has given them so far.  The dual story arcs of the prison break, combined with Red's conversion and redemption is a remarkable storytelling achievement.    This movie has personally resonated with me ever since I first saw it nine years ago.  Any time I'm down, I'm able to remember and watch Shawshank and ultimately become inspired and full of hope again.  I'm grateful that this movie was made, and it's easily my favorite movie.
1554073847|4.0|My daughter is having a hard time potty training the 2 year old.  The two year old just loves this book and CD.  Every time they returned it to the library, she would cry.  So I had to buy it for her to own.  She'll sit with it and pretend she's reading it and talk to the little girl in the book.  Keeping my fingers crossed that she'll be completely potty trained soon.  It really is a cute book.
0385504225|5.0|This was a great read. If you liked the other boks by Dan you should enjoy this one.  I am shocked anyone doesnt like it.
031604461X|1.0|I am not 17 anymore, but reading New Moon I was a teenager again. I started reading the Twilight saga with book number 2 and I fell in love with the vampire that Edward portrayed in the story, his extreme beauty, his sexiness, his level of adoration for Bella. Who doesn't want to be loved in such a way? All the foreplay in the three previous books when Edward and Bella were close to intimacy, made most of the women I know got goosebumps. We finally had in our hands a character that mixed the best of Mr. Darcy with the security that his privileged status provided (very important for a woman) and the sexiness and superpowers of a vampire. Wow! I felt in love with Edward. I wanted to be Bella and be loved in such a way that just the thought of being next to someone like him would make you have an out of body experience.   Although I had loved New Moon and Eclipse, my disappointment began in the first few chapters of Breaking Dawn.  After building in the readers the anticipation of Edward and Bella consummating their love, we were left with nothing. How could Meyers do that to us? Did she write this book in a hurry? Was she awake when she wrote this book? Anyway, I kept reading thinking that it would have to get better -big mistake. In the following chapters Bella gets pregnant with a monster that is bound to kill her and Edward's response to the pregnancy is becoming frozen sitting on the floor? Where was his chivalry, his romanticism, his wonderful love for his now wife, his superpowers to fix everything around Bella's life? During the following days in the book he is nothing but a sack of potatoes that only worries and suffers. I don't want to be with a guy like that. The idea of Edward was broken in my mind and never got repaired again in the rest of the book. For me, he was never the Edward that I had fallen in love in the other books.     Here are some other problems I found in the story:    SEX  I was under the impression that the book was written for a young audience. Why would Meyers convey to the youth that sex is such a painful endeavor and that the results will be getting pregnant with a little monster? Not only that, but Bella is virgin at almost 19! That is more surreal than the idea of vampires running through the forests of Washington State. If I had a daughter, I don't think I would let them read this book. The whole sex subject is developed around pain, suffering and guilt.     GORE  Oh, but it gets worse! The pregnancy and delivery chapters are full of blood, gore and just plain weird. Every paged I finished it was turned with disgust in my face. The little creature was in my mind like the alien in the movie with Sigourney Weaver. The thing was unlovable! I sided with Edward. It was nothing but a...thing.    RENEESME  The thing was named Reneesme. What an ugly name! Really Meyers? Did Meyers think so little of her readers? It is not even a harmonious name! How could she pretend that her readers would fall in love with a character that was so destructive, monstrous and brutal as Reneesme? I heated the child. I could feel every word of Jacob's character towards the little thing like it was escaping from my own mouth.     JACOB  Loser and pedophile! I had cried for him in the chapter that talks about the wedding. His nobility and love for Bella were his best qualities, but after a while it just got plain old. He kept taking and taking it from Bella. What did she have anyway? I didn't want to be Bella anymore.   However, the scandalous part for me was when Jacob fell in love with a toddler! I saw it coming in the previous chapters but I kept hoping that the \\"imprinting\\" thing was going to be directed to Leah. I think this sends the wrong message -again- for all the youth.    BELLA  She was the worst of all the characters in Breaking Dawn. She not only becomes beautiful but with superpowers, but her superpowers surpass all of the old vampires. She now is a combination of Marvel characters. Please! Where is the pain of the consequences that would bring her decision of becoming a vampire? She never goes through all the agony that she needed to go as a newborn. Her little vampire life is just perfect. Any more sunny up in Forks and she could have been in the cover of Better Homes and Gardens Magazine. She not only has a wonderful and handsome husband, but she has the whole perfect package: A wonderful child who also has superpowers and is beautiful, a beautiful cottage, a Ferrari, a Mercedes extra rare car, a closet the size of a bedroom, enough money to pay the salary of any CEO from Enron for an eternity, blah, blah, blah!     WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. I want a re-write and my money back!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|Hot Fuzz is a great movie, truly. However despite a sticker on the front of the bluray box proclaiming its compatibility with playstation3 I found that the disc played with the video and audio tracks significantly out of sync. I own one of the original pre-slim PS3s with up-to-date firmware and am using an HDMI cable to the TV. Be aware that if your are using a PS3 to watch this disc you may experience the same problems.

0385504225|2.0|i found about 20% of this book enjoyable. the other 80% was fluff, repetitive fluff at that. blah blah noetics blah blah symbolon blah blah masons...400 pages worth. i thought about putting it back on the shelf at page 300, but i pushed on...for what i'm not sure (the paragraph describing a huge, tattooed sex organ...that seemed unnecessary, since he already went to lengths about the castration. actually, a friend tricked me into it. he said he had to have someone to suffer with. jerk.) i was very excited about this book, and ended up dissapointed. [...]. like i said, about 20% of the book was enjoyable, the rest, in my opinion, could be torn from the spine. this book had no chance of being on the level of the davinci code, or angels and demons (my favorite), and i didnt expect it to be. i only had the hope of an enjoyable, fast read. i never expected it to be a complete waste of my time.     i recommend against buying this book. borrow it, there will be no shortage of people willing to part with their copy.     [...]?    thanks.
0307387178|5.0|The movie was absolutely captivating; so I had to have the book. Normally, I find disappointment when I both read a book and watch a movie based on the book. Not so with Jon Krakauer's \\"Into the Wild\\". His basic motivation for writing the book seems to be to understand the character, Chris McCandless. Despite, numerous comments about Chris's death, ranging from he was trying to kill himself to he was simply an idealist on an adventure, Mr. Krakauer probes possible scenerios, compares Chris's actions to others of similar bent including himself, and interviews both Chris's family and the people whose lives Chris touched during his two years of travels before going to Alaska. He, along with a couple of buddies, goes to the scene \\"in the wild\\"  where Chris lived and died. His analysis is both probative and sensitive. I found the book to be excellent. It is no wonder than Sean Penn wrote a screenplay and produced the movie, with the active consultation of Jon Krakauer, based on this well written and researched book. However, most of all, both the book and the movie ask the question: Why? Why indeed? Because it is part of the human condition to engage the ultimate riddle: life/death.
0385504225|3.0|I've loved all of Dan Brown's books--except this one. Ever so slowly, the story evolves requiring the reader to wade through copious lectures and discourses about freemasonry, historical symbols, religions, and other arcane subjects. Brown's books are always filled with a myriad of detail and \\"stuff\\"--but in the past, I found such passages absorbing as Brown cites \\"fictional fact\\" that comes across as non-fiction. In his latest book, the \\"stuff\\" outweighs the story line as the book staggers to an ending by attempting to reinvigorate religious conviction. Afterward, I found myself dog-tired as though I had sat through one of Professor Langdon's very long and very dry Harvard lectures. Come on Dan, I've faith in you; try again.

B00000DCHI|5.0|It has been years since I've listened to Billy Joel - had tapes that died, but never got replaced.  My new CD is wonderful, I've been bopping and singing along for days now to songs I had forgotten I knew.  This has cheered the heck out of me in the gloomy days of Autumn, it's a really great compilation.
B000002L61|5.0|Ronnie James Dio ruled in the 80's and Last in Line is his second best work only to Holy Diver.  That album can never be outdone, but Last in Line comes real close.  There are many good tracks on this album.  A good rocking album, very enjoyable. Check out the MTV video for Last in Line - awesome. Highly recommended.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I love this CD.  David Cook sounds alot like Alex Band from the Calling so if you like his voice and that type of music this CD is for you.  Since I place alot of value on the words int he song I was pleasantly surprised that his songs were true to point and not just words.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I'm not usually a big fan of books or movies that \\"rewrite\\" Austen's works. It's not that I'm a rabid Austen fan or anything. I just find that few can do it adequately. But this video really does it - not only adequately - but quite well.<br /><br />Interestingly, our heroine is a modern day Londoner who is in love with the world of Austen's creation. Specifically, Pride & Prejudice. I can get being so into a book that you read it over and over. But wanting to live in that time period? Why would any modern woman want to go back to that time? Yet I did believe that Amanda was truly in love with the book, the characters, that world.<br /><br />I love the faithfulness to Austen's original work with little bits tweaked just enough to fit Amanda in. It really draws you into the story - so much so that I watched the entire thing in (mostly) one sitting - and was annoyed when I had to pause to go do other things briefly.<br /><br />If you're an Austen fan at all, I really think you'll enjoy this movie. It's a must see.
0385737947|5.0|Wow! Talk about a thrill ride! If you're looking for a book that you cannot put down, The Maze Runner is what you need. You will start reading The Maze Runner and forget to eat, bath, or feed your cats. You will not be able to put the book down until the very last page. I cannot stress this enough. I know because it took all of my self-control to take breaks from reading. The Maze Runner had everything that I love in a good science fiction novel, thought provoking scenarios, engaging characters, and a suspenseful plot.<br /><br />The voice of Thomas sucked me into the story from the very beginning. I wanted to find out what was going to happen to him. Why are all these boys trapped in a maze? What does it all mean? Who put them there? I felt like I was standing right beside Thomas while he was trying to figure all of these things out. I also thought that the secondary characters were vivid and believable. Chuck in particular was one of my other favorite secondary characters. I hate to use the word secondary to describe Chuck, because he was such a huge part of the story. I just loved him though.<br /><br />The fast pace of The Maze Runner kept me rapidly turning to pages. The half animal half technology Grievers scared the bejesus out of me! As I read along each new discovery left me feeling shocked, disturbed, and very often both.<br /><br />The ending just about killed me. I'm dying to get my hands on the sequel now to find out what happens. Some big questions are unanswered, but most are not. I might have to camp outside James Dashner's home until he throw a manuscript out to me.<br /><br />I would recommend The Maze Runner to anyone who loves thrilling science fiction novels.
B001AUKUTU|5.0|Great Dio album.  Still one of my favorites.  Strong vocals and guitars.  Better than Sacred Heart.  Dio's last really good album.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes soft rock/pop.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The title of my review says it all, and represents the quality of music on this CD. Also the Lyrics written for the music are far beyond her young tender years of experience walking top side on the face of this earth .. Therefore hats off for ALL of the musicians that made this music possible.    Greatheart - Rockville, MD
B000068R1X|5.0|His best. Yes, people- not the guitar playing. We all know about Rhoads' genius. And hey- Jake is NO SLOUCH. But as far as the SONGWRITING MATURITY, and the execution as far as being cohesive, or what people call \\"tightness\\", this is his best. Maybe not the classic previous two albums as far as being groundbreaking, but EVERYTHING being considered, this is my favorite. Other fans of the album know what I'm talking about......And a note to producers- I can dig an album being remixed and remastered, but please people- don't re-record albums. Bring the drums up, get the bass down, etc. etc.-- but down recreate the thing from scratch. That's called cheating.
B001EO748M|5.0|I feel so many people before me have said it well enough before me.  This season has it high moments but overall last season surpassed it.  However, it is still worth buying and watching.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell is always interesting and informative, with a gift for recognizing patterns that nobody else seems to notice.  Based on his previous books, I picked up \\"Outliers\\" with great anticipation--I was not disappointed.  Once again, Gladwell has recognized the thread that runs through the lives of the great people in our world.  Surprisingly, it has very little to do with innate ability, but instead a combination of unique opportunity and extraordinary hard work.    The \\"take away\\":  10,000 hours.  This was the factoid that has stuck with me for weeks since reading this--the great people who have changed the world (Bill Gates) are the ones who invested 10,000 hours in their craft. But that's not enough: Bill Gates wouldn't have been famous if he been born ten years later, after somebody else had invented an operating system.  He put in the hours so that at that one moment when the world of computers was waiting to make a quantum leap, he was ready.    An absolute must-read that will leave you thinking for weeks.
B000002VTE|4.0|Ladies & Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space being Spiritualized 3rd studio album and their 1997 release can be said to be a mix of post rock, Britt rock and space rock. The album was hailed by the critics when it was released and The Guardian, Allmusic and NME all gave it high marks. The booklet is very neat and resembles a prescription for a medicine. The lyrics are not included in the booklet but we get a list of whom plays what. Not easy listening but a very cerebral experience and it sounds a bit like Bowie and late Beatles. 4/5.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I have to agree with the previous reviewers about the historical inaccuracies in the series but overall if you are not going to watch it for it's historical accuracy watch it as a very entertaining soap opera based on facts of Tudor England.  The acting is top notch, JRM is wonderful as Henry VIII even though he doesnt look a bit like him.  He exudes the necessary emotion, intelligence and ruthlessness that makes us over time believe he truly is Henry.  All the other actors of this season have the same aura of credibility.  The costuming is opulent and modern....however its modernity does not detract from the period authenicity but gives it a current cutting edge flavor....Overall I love it
B0029LHW4U|2.0|It's been a long time since anyone has heard from this band and then suddenly they re-emerge on the scene with Black Gives Way To Blue. There was a lot of hype and hope around this albums release and I am sure that the die hard starving fan is eternally greatful for this latest offering by Alice. But the sad truth is, this album starts off with a bang, giving us three great songs that make you sit up and take notice. Your ears perk up and you think perhaps you are hearing the greatest Alice In Chains album since Dirt. However, after the first three impressive melodies, this album fades into uneventful music that you have to make a conscious effort to listen too. It lulls you into a daydreaming state where you are thinking about everything except the cd that is playing. It sounds like Alice In Chains, but a very boring Alice In Chains. I predict some will love it and some will hate it.. I didn't hate it, but I had to continually slap myself in the face to stay awake while I spun this disk. It made me want to give way to the blackness of blessed sleep.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack.   Many of the songs focus on death and dying, albeit sweetly and harmoniously.
B0027REDK2|5.0|I have always felt that \\"Rio\\" was a classic album - from the iconic cover to the briliant songs and the memorable videos.  But I have hardly listened to it in recent years because until now all of the CD issues contained the original UK versions of the songs.  Purists can feel free to scorn me for preferring the glossy US remixes that I was familiar with on my vinyl and cassette, but the original versions just don't shimmer for me like the remixes.  I never thought I would see them put out on a cd, but here they are!<br /><br />The US album versions have been tacked on to the end of the first disc after the original UK version, allowing you to program your CD player to reproduce the US version of the album.  Actually, they probably should have included the Night Version of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" on disc 1 as well, since many (if not most) of the US albums had this instead of the early album version.<br /><br />Still, I can't complain about being able to hear the sparkling US album versions of \\"Rio\\", \\"My Own Way\\", \\"Lonely In Your Nightmare\\", \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" in all of their high-gloss glory.  The second disc includes four early demos, singles, remixes and b-sides.  The remastering is very sharp, and the whole thing sounds fantastic.<br /><br />The CD comes in the form of a clothbound hardcover booklet.  The two discs are stored in the front and back endpapers.  The color booklet itself is over 50 pages and includes the story of the making of the album, the album lyrics and numerous photos.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised to see all of the criticism of the packaging.  While it's true that more effort could have been made to maintain the style of the original artwork throughout the package, it didn't offend me.  I won't lose sleep over a sliver of the bottom the original artwork being removed.  The CD cover is approximately 5\\" by 5.5\\" - at that size, I don't see that it very much matters.  Despite its flaws, it's actually much nicer than many other so-called \\"Collectors Editions\\" that I have seen, and really can't be beat at a price of just over $20.00.<br /><br />Personally, I was just happy to have the US versions on a CD, and found the packaging (and even the second disc) to be an nice extra.ors Editions\\" that I have seen, and really can't be beat at a price of just over $20.00.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Very well written, directed, acted, and filmed.  After seeing it twice on the Big Screen, bought it for my DVD collection.  It's most definitely a keeper.
B00005LOLD|1.0|The one star is to bring attention to the DVD transfer quality.  This is a fantastic film!  Brando is, as usual, unbelievable!!  The greatest actor of all time, in my book, for sure!!!    This DVD, however, is unforgivable, an embarrassment to the studio, the movie, and to home video itself.  It is 16:9 letterboxed onto 4:3, making it tiny and grainy on a widescreen TV, and the transfer itself is washed out and dull.  This is especially annoying since a good HD transfer does exist; I saw it on HDNet movies on DirecTV.  That transfer is beautiful.    Come on, MGM, bring the HD transfer to Blu-ray!
B002C6K7N0|4.0|This is a victory for fans of Megadeth, seeking greatness but not finding it in some of their most recent releases.  Megadeth is making a strong statement here, showcasing their excellence.  I say that this album is not as catchy as Youthanasia, nor as impactful as Rust In Peace, but is still a necessary addition to the collections of all Megadeth fans.  While the lyrics aren't groundbreaking, the instrumental contribution is strong and elevates this release above Risk, The World Needs A Hero, and United Abominations.  The solos are excellent, and we get to hear some strength and power in the instrumental contributions as well as some trademark thrashiness.  All in all, not a perfect metal album, but a worthwhile addition to the annals of music in the genre.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|The poor sales of the dvd and cd is proof that fans are fed up with Madonna and WB Records. Negative word of mouth and disappointed fan reviews have spreaded so fast, I am sure both Madonna and WB records heads are spinning! Even though some fans claim that Madonna had nothing to do with the quality of her Celebration dvd, I beg to differ. SHe signed off on this along with WB because I suspect they plan to release a BETTER version of Madonna videos in the future. The quality of this dvd is just T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E! The tracks sound awful! Justify My Love and Erotica are both censured (can you believe that?)!!Plus, its missing key videos!    My motto is: \\"If you do something, do it RIGHT the first time\\"! Clearly WB and Madonna dropped the ball on this release!

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|When I heard that Steven Wilson was writing a 50+ minute song (song cycle), I just didn't know what to expect, as this is often hard to pull off. I thought that his solo record Insurgentes was all right, but I wasn't too crazy about it. At the same time, I really thought that Fear of a Blank Planet was a fantastic album.    I will admit that this album is a bit of a grower, and it's still growing. It really does need to be listened to in one sitting, although I know that it's sometimes hard for people to find 50+ minute chunks of time to listen to music.     I think that the use of contrasts is what makes this record great for me. I am a casual Nine Inch Nails fan, but I love how Steven Wilson uses some of their elements in the title track but then makes it something completely different. He starts off with a really ominous sounding piece, which evolves into a beautiful \\"dreamy\\" ending.    Similarly, Octane Twisted starts off with some nice guitar strumming and harmony vocals, only to be dissolved into that really cool dark riff.    I even like how those shorter tracks are purposefully underdeveloped, and leave you wanting more. However, they blend well together, creating a nice continuous piece of music - Great Expectations, Kneel and Disconnect and Drawing the Line flow really well together, for me, at least.    Finally, I too saw the band perform this whole thing live, and it was an awesome experience. Only time will tell how this will rank against other PT albums, but so far, it is the album of the year for me.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Can't really get tired of this. I only wish that they would make more episodes.
1881273873|4.0|Gary Chapman does a good job of weaving together stories and anecdotes to illustrate each of the five love languages.  This book is relevant for all relationships, not just those who are dating.  I would recommend this read to anyone who wants to communicate better with the important people in his or her life!
0596007124|5.0|OK - So all the reviews here point out the book's presentation is stunning and brilliant.  But what about the actual content?    If you look at the negative reviews of this book, they are, almost without exception, all from people who prefer to have their computer books boring.  Fair enough.  Some folks have had their senses of humor surgically removed.  Nevertheless, few reviews here actually seem to comment on the content of the book. So here's some feedback on the actual content:    WARNING #1 - THE WEAKNESSES OF EACH PATTERN ARE VERY LIGHTLY DISCUSSED OR NOT MENTIONED AT ALL.    All of these patterns have weaknesses, but there's almost no coverage of the drawbacks.  The book never tells you, for example, \\"the Strategy Pattern comes at the cost of many new classes and can inhibit understandability\\".  The book would have been greatly improved with a small box at the end of each chapter that tells the reader when they might not want to use the pattern.  The authors do provide some analysis of a few patterns, but not until the very end of the book in the \\"Leftover Patterns\\" appendix.  They should have done this for every pattern in the main portion of the book - not just for the small patterns in the Appendix.  Understanding the weaknesses is as important as understanding the strengths of any pattern.  There's also some discussion of trade offs in the final chapter, but the book does so only at a high philosophical level.  It never specifically highlights the weaknesses of the patterns it covered in the first 500 pages.    WARNING #2 - THE BOOK DOES NOT PRIORITIZE THE PATTERNS.    The reader is never told which patterns are very common and which are seldom used.  That would be nice to know.  The Decorator pattern is not often used, and when it is, the results can almost always be achieved using some other pattern. They should have presented the patterns in the order of their importance.      WARNING #3 - INDUSTRY DOESN'T DO IT THAT WAY.    These patterns have been around for a long time.  Collectively, they form much of the basis for all those grand code-reuse promises we received 20 years ago in the C++ era.  Those promises were never realized.  Yes - theoretically, if you follow the patterns in this book, you really can achieve a lot more code reuse.  But in practice, industry just doesn't follow these patterns - or at least, not over time.  It's just too tempting to use concrete classes where you should be using abstract classes, for example.  It would have been very valuable had the authors offered some observations about how and where these patterns typically degenerate over time.  There are techniques to combat such degeneration.  And the reader should know what to look out for.    Bottom Line?    The book is absolutely fantastic despite these shortcomings.  If I compare the book to some non-existent ridiculously idealized notion of the perfect book, this book comes up short.  Of course, that's not really a good way to measure a book.  If you compare this book to other similar books that really exist, it's utterly fantastic!  They've made learning about as fun as it can be.     The highly creative and entertaining presentation in this book is what makes it so special. You can even see the style in the cover.  The rest of the book is just like the cover - goofy images and lots of humor.  The book would be half the size if you removed all the fun parts, but few people would read it cover to cover.     A PROGRAMMER WHO IS NOT AWARE OF THESE PATTHERNS IS LIKE AN AUTHOR WHO NOT KNOW GRAMMAR.    Glenn Hostetler  Author, [[ASIN:098230370X Web Service and SOA Technologies]]
B0006IIPIK|4.0|If the concept of an action filled comic book style adventure leaves you cold avoid this picture. If it can amuse and entertain you, then this will be satisfying. The characters are consistent, well formed, and authentic within the logic of its generic type; that is, they act logically in terms of the premise. Stunts are quite well done while the hardware is anything but penny-board masquerading as space ships. All looks as it should look in such an adventure. I have no idea of which age and sex groups it will most interest, but is is certain to have wide appeal.
0385504225|2.0|I agree with other reviewers' remarks in that it is just like re-reading his other two books, A&D and the DV Code.  If I had not read those books, I might have a different opinion and would rate \\"The Lost Symbol\\" higher.  Dan Brown's formula worked in his previous novels, but as with anything/everything else, it gets old real fast.
1439560803|5.0|This was by far one of the more refreshing and exciting fantasy books that I've read in a long time. I read it the same way I might eat a favorite dessert or a good cold bottle of Woodchuck Cider. As I neared the end, I wanted to slow down and enjoy it longer, but couldn't make myself since I was being pulled along by the story. Mr. Rothfuss's approach of having the main character tell the story, while interjecting \\"present time\\" events, feels original and sets an nice pace to the overall story. I especially like the fact that Kvothe is not the typical hero or even a typical anti-hero. He seems as real a person as you might find in the world that has been created.<br /><br />If you like fantasy, but look for a \\"new\\" approach to the genre, this is the book you need to read.
B002HNAAZ8|3.0|I'm a big fan of Ted Poley-era D2. The debut was great and the follow-up \\"Screw it!\\" is probably the best hair metal album of the early 90s. So I was absolutely psyched to see Poley's back at the mic. No Andy Timmons, but Rob Marcello's no slouch on the guitar and a worthy replacement.    From a production standpoint the album sounds like a million bucks. Rob's guitar solos are fingerlickin' good! The songs all have big choruses and are very radio-friendly as you might expect.    So what's the problem?    It's missing that spark, that tongue-in-cheek humor, the zest for life and  attitude that marked the first two albums. It's just all a bit \\"laidback\\" and \\"flat\\" and the melodies are much to dark. The sound could've been a lot brighter, with more presence. Ted's vocals (even though on pitch) even don't sound very inspired.    Point being: when I play \\"Screw It!\\" it's like a triple shot of espresso. It starts my heart pumping and puts a great, big, fat smile on my face.    Revolve kind of makes me want to hop back into bed to catch some z's. So far I've not been able to bring myself to be interested enough to listen to the entire album in one sitting.    Two and 1/2 stars for me. I had high hopes, but Revolve doesn't cut the mustard for me.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Installed the Hyper 212+ on a Gigabyte P55-UD4p with Shin-Etsu thermal paste and an i5 750.  With the stock fan, voltage was increased to 1.375 and the blclk was raised to 190, yielding 3.8Ghz per core.  The 212+ maintains 61 C at full load under these settings.  This is an excellent value heatsink that is capable of keeping a high end chip cool under overclocking conditions. The Hyper 212+ also made the top 10 heatsinks at [...].      Kudos to Coolermaster for having this cooler available at the i5 launch. Amazon \\"free shipping\\" was painfully slow though.  Bad Amazon.
1595141715|5.0|On my way from VA to NY over the summer, I started this book.  I started it on the first plane and, by the time I got to the airport, couldn't put it down.  The characters grabbed my attention so much that I couldn't even sleep that night without finding out what happened to them.      Hannah started out as an innocent little girl, but quickly became a depressed teenager.  She didn't suffer any major crimes, but the black hole that this girl became opened a little wider with each incident.  My heart really went out to her as she suffered through the social hierarchy that is high school.  I flinched at the idea that she exhibited so many symptoms of depression and no one noticed.     Clay started out as a mystery.  There was nothing to base my feelings toward his character on, but by the third chapter, I wanted to know all about him.  By the end, I sympathized with Clay more than Hannah.  He was completely in love with her, but now couldn't do anything about it.  He is the only character that, given the chance, I would give a hug and an opportunity to talk.      At times, the characters seemed to be rather two-dimensional, but by the end of the book, they may as well have been my friends.  If nothing else, this book is worth the read just for Clay and Hannah's sake.

B0029LHW4U|3.0|I've been a big Alice in Chains fan since \\"Man in the Box\\" came out.  I listened to them all through the '90s, they were one of my favorite bands of the decade.  I was listening to them before most of you were.  I'm not bragging, I'm giving credibility to my review.  When Layne died, I was heartbroken of course, like all big AIC fans were.  More so upset because he died than knowing that we probably wouldn't get another AIC album.  But who could be a good enough singer to replace Layne if Jerry wanted AIC to keep going...?  That was the problem.  Well William Duvall has put an end to that question.  The man is a great singer... Is he as good as Layne was?  No.  Layne had more power and soul in his voice.  But Duvall lives up to the standard Layne set as much as anyone else could.    The real problem wasn't finding a singer to replace Layne afterall.  The real problem is that Jerry Cantrell and the rest of AIC have lost the ability to write great songs.    I remember when Jerry said that Alice in Chains was a mix of blues, country, metal, etc...  He was right.  When I listen to Sap, or Jar of Flies, or Dirt... I can hear the blues in the music - it's everywhere. I can hear the country on their first album especially.  Alice in Chains were really a mix of different styles... They weren't just a metal band. That's what made them so good.    \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" proves they aren't a mix of different styles anymore.  I don't hear the blues in their music - it's gone.  I don't hear the little lovable country twang they used to have fun with in their songs - it's gone. The MEMORABLE hooks are gone.  What's left is just the hard rock/metal part of AIC.    There isn't a single song on this album that's as good as \\"Down in a Hole\\", \\"Nutshell\\", \\"Shame in You\\", \\"Man in the Box\\", \\"Would?\\", \\"Don't Follow\\"... etc... I could go on.    In truth, I don't think a single song on this album is great... I don't even think any of them are all that good.  That pains me to say it, because I was as big of an AIC fan as anyone.  The difference between me and most of the AIC fans here writing reviews, is that I'm not gonna bother lying to myself about it.      The reason there's a lot of 5 star reviews for this album, is because of the nostaglia so many of us feel for AIC.  I believe their last album was 1996... It's been well over 10 years.  A lot of us missed them deeply... When Black Gives Way to Blue came out, so many AIC fans were so happy just to have a new album, that in a way it overshadowed the actual songwriting on the album.  AIC fans are excited, and they want to show their support.  But the people giving this album 5 stars are also well aware they're both lying to themselves and to you.  We know the songwriting isn't nearly as good as it used to be.  The songs for the most part are forgettable... The lyrics aren't very good.  \\"Your Decision\\" tries to capture the soul of \\"Got Me Wrong\\" and it doesn't come close at all.    You can say this is my opinion... No it's not.  Black Gives Way to Blue doesn't come close to Dirt, it doesn't come close to Tripid, and even Facelift is quite a bit better.  This new AIC album is by far... By far the most generic, ordinary, uncreative AIC album to date.  All these AIC fans writing 5 star reviews will most likely be bored of this album within a few months.    I hate Godsmack... I always thought they were AIC wannabes.  Sadly, most songs I've heard from Godsmack are more memorable and catchy than the songs on this album.    Jerry has gotten old... He can't write songs like he used to.  I understand that.  There's no point in lying to yourself about it.    Well I can look at the bright side... Before Black Gives Way to Blue came out, I didn't know which AIC album was the \\"worst\\"... Now Black Gives Way to Blue easily answers that question.  Is it a bad album?  No... But it doesn't come close to the quality AIC had before.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|While the Magical Mystery Tour film project attracted very mixed reviews, there's certainly no complaints about this album. I'm generally not a fan of the \\"Americanised\\" versions of Beatle albums, but this is one where they clearly got it right. In addition to the original six tracks from the film, the album includes 5 non-album tracks from 1967; 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane', 'Hello Goodbye', plus 'All You Need Is Love' and its B-side 'Baby You're A Rich Man'. In this way, what was an \\"okay\\" EP is transformed into a full-length release that can hold its place among the best Beatle albums.    Of the six sountrack songs, the highlight is obviously the psychadelic masterpiece 'I Am The Walrus', which has enough amazing ideas to fill about five different songs. The title track and 'You're Mother Should Know' are catchy singalongs, while 'The Fool On The Hill' is probably the most under-rated of McCartney's moody ballads. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the instrumental 'Flying' or Harrison's droning 'Blue Jay Way', but they're interesting enough diversions that don't wear out their welcome too much.    The album really takes off in the second half. What more can be said about 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane', and 'All You Need Is Love', apart from the fact that these are three of the best Beatle tracks, and three of the best songs of all time. The first two represent a distinctively British take on psychadelia, while the latter is a universal call for peace, love and understanding. 'Baby You're A Rich Man' is a real hidden gem; dreamy psychadelic verses giving way to a forceful singalong chorus, and that wobbly Eastern-tinged keyboard line. And if 'Hello Goodbye' seems a bit straightforward compared to the others, it's still an extremely catchy and infectious song.     Seek this one out, even if you were underwhelmed by the film. The sheer number of outstanding singles collected here make this album essential for every Beatle fan.
0439023491|5.0|This book is the sequel to The Hunger Games and is electrifying! My fiance and I took turns reading to each other on a recent road trip and we couldn't put it down. We had to know what happened next and we were enthralled by the story down to the very last word on the very last page. Katniss fears retribution from the Capitol because of her stunt with Peeta at the Hunger Games. Now, the country is practically pulsing with the desire to rebel against the Capitol and end the atrocities the Districts are forced to endure for the entertainment of others. This years' Quarter Quell, the special Hunger Games that happens every 25 years, is a shocking twist in an already twisted form of punishment the Districts and Tributes are forced to endure for their rebellion decades ago. If you haven't already read The Hunger Games, read it to find out what Katniss did to shock the Capitol and make sure to pre-order the next book in The Hunger Games Trilogy (title has not been released yet).
1401323820|5.0|No, I don't watch Castle on TV. Not because I don't want to - I have writing class and don't get home until after it is over.<br />I AM drawn to the man who plays Richard Castle, and wish he would be a prolific writer and do the old tag-along with some of New York's finest and write about them. I'd buy every single one.<br />This tie-in to the TV series features Jameson Rook in the Castle role, and is partnered with a sexy, tough cop, Nikki Heat. Feeling she has to babysit a journalist instead of doing her job is a bother to her, but she deals with it.<br />Heat Wave deals with the brown outs that NYC deal with in the summer when there is such a pull on the energy source that little works, and is hothothot in the apartments, etc. It is also a wonderful chemical heat reaction between Heat and Rook. The combination of action dealing with a nasty Russian villian and the 'heat' between Nikki and Rook is a joy to read.<br />It's ok by me for them to keep writing these books based on the series - they are fun, sexy and have great chemistry of cops, as well as the romantic edge of Rook and Nikki.<br />I would pick up these books in a New York minute!<br />Great read and great tie-in.
1416583408|1.0|Like a number of previous reviewers, I was sorry to see the glaring lapses in this book.  I won't go over them all again.  I agree with them.  What I will comment on is the poor science involved in drawing some of the conclusions the author does from the evidence she cites.  In particular, I find it disturbing that someone can write, on the one hand, about the extraordinary sensory abilities dogs have, and on the other, fail to see the probability that an owner faking a heart attack will most likely not succeed in deceiving the animal.  No olafactory fear cues.  Duh?  Isn't it plausible that what the experiment shows is that dogs are not that easily taken in?<br /><br />Obviously, it is not easy to do this experiment properly.  But no one said these things should be easy.  I suggest the author submit her book to her students at Barnard with the assignment to present counter-arguments to as many of her findings as they can.  I think this would be a worthy exercise in training students to engage in scientific thinking.
0307454541|2.0|The first half of the book = lots of boring, statistical data. Third quarter started off interestingly enough - made me think for a bit that it was worth dredging through the bulky first half. Then, it quickly turned into grizzly mutilations of women, with one of the most obvious suspects of all time - no surprise whatsoever.  Then, back to more boring, statistical data.  Even the best characters are so morally flawed it's difficult to sympathize with any of them, and moreover, the writing - or perhaps the translator's writing, was weak.  I was so disappointed.  This book came so highly recommended to me that I put it on my book club's reading list.  We've read all variety of books over the last ten years, so it wasn't that the genre was not acceptable - it was just poorly written, in my opinion. Bummer.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|The old-time saying \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" may apply to traditional pop crooner Michael Buble.  Indeed, Michael Buble's albums have remained conservative, maintaining the sanctity of classic standards and pop songs. 2009's follow-up 2007's extremely successful [[ASIN:B000NVIXDW Call Me Irresponsible]] does maintain a sense of classicism that has come to define Buble, but there are some risks taken this go around. Sure, he doesn't ruin or over interpret the classics, but as far as arrangements, orchestrations, and vocal nuances, Buble keeps the classics 'fresh' while also keeping them 'classic.' The album isn't perfect, but it is consistent and bodes well to keep Buble's career afloat.  Buble never compromises himself on this album.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Cry Me A River\\", instantly, one hears that Buble wishes to exploit a slightly more adventurous side without 'rocking the boat' too much.  The orchestrations here are different but brilliant and add just the right amount of change without ruining the sanctity of the classic standard. Buble, as always sounds top-rate as a vocalist.<br /><br />\\"All of Me\\" scales down the experimentation of \\"Cry Me A River\\", seeking to balance between 'innovation' and 'classicism'.  While the performance is another 'home-run' for Buble, it doesn't trump the excellent, cutting-edge \\"Cry Me A River\\".  \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", on the other hand, finds Michael Buble at his very best, bringing new, pitch-perfect nuance to the classic that helped to shape Ray Charles' career. \\"Crazy Love\\", the title track continues a hot streak for Buble.<br /><br />Perhaps most unique is \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\", which most likely will received mixed reactions from Buble fans.  Personally, I think it is a departure for Buble and lays well, though it doesn't necessarily trump Buble's beautiful interpretations of standards and classic pop songs.  Good, but no my favorite.  \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" continues to differentiate from previous Buble album. It does so convincingly, given a soulful-sound that hearkens the 1950s.<br /><br />\\"Hold On\\" proves to be a clear valedictory performance on Crazy Love, finding Buble at his most sensitive and best. The acoustic guitar here at the forefront gives this track more a modern pop tinge as opposed to hearkening back to classic pop. The strings are beautiful orchestrated here.<br /><br />\\"Heartache Tonight\\" contrasts the slow, sensitive nature of \\"Hold On\\", solidly, though it is the Sharon Jones and Dap-Kings feature on \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\" that steals the show.  Funky and just overall sensational, \\"Baby\\" is certainly like nothing else from previous Michael Buble albums. \\"At This Moment\\" finds Michael Buble among the bluesiest I've ever heard.  Produced by the phenomenal pop producer David Foster, it is a showstopping performance by all means.<br /><br />The album closes strongly with \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Whatever It Takes (feat.Ron Sexsmith)\\". Neither tracks captivate the way that \\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Georgia\\" or some of the 'best of the best do', but both are solid and above par.<br /><br />While 'Crazy Love' isn't revolutionary pop per say, it does find the crooner extending his scope slightly, which is a positive thing.  4 stars.ngly, given a soulful-sound that hearkens the 1950s.      \\"Hold On\\" proves to be a clear valedictory performance on Crazy Love, finding Buble at his most sensitive and best.

1592802974|5.0|For anyone familiar with the vast amount of investment literature out there, I'm sure you've come across a book written in the first half of the twentieth century called \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.\\" This classic tome is widely considered to be the \\"Bible\\" of trading, and it has been referenced directly or indirectly in many of the other popular books in the genre. You may have even read it yourself. For years it has been THE book to have influenced the world's top traders, but now, Jack Schwager has created the next classic work to fill recommended reading lists.<br /><br />\\"Reminiscences...\\" is mentioned in several of the interviews with the \\"Wizards\\", so it is no surprise that many of the same themes are echoed throughout the book. Chronicled are anecdotes and philosophies from some of the world's greatest traders, and to have them all gathered for the reader in one place is amazingly stimulating. More than any other book, \\"Market Wizards\\" has helped me become a profitable trader. Investors routinely pay hundreds, even thousands of dollars to attend trading seminars, but don't learn nearly as much readers will soak up from these pages. I make a habit to go back and regularly review the collection of tips in the back of the book, and nothing helps me break out of a trading slump like rereading a few select chapters.<br /><br />For those looking for a step-by-step trading system, you may be disappointed, but if you're interested in learning from the best of the best, then there's no other choice. The interview format makes for a quick read, and it's interesting to get a glimpse of how these great men live and trade. I highly recommend \\"Market Wizards\\" and its sequel \\"The New Market Wizards\\" to anyone wanting to take the next step toward trading success.
B0013FYTA8|3.0|When TOAD first came out they had a very distinct blues oriented sound which made them listenable and original.  \\"Gasoline\\", their second effort, re-fortified the essence of the band and gave them pop status.  Whether this is what they wanted I am not for sure.  Now we have \\"Scars and Souvenirs\\" which I was really anxious to hear.  What a let down.  They have abandoned their trade mark blues tainted grunge for pop insensitivity.  There are two songs that sound original, Little Smirk and End of the Summer, and the rest.....oh my.  The only thing I can think of is that the record reps must have squeezed their tater tots until they cried uncle.  Lets hope their next effort gets back to basics. And, stop trying to sound like other bands too!

B002EQA0Y4|5.0|One Eyed Jacks, along with A Streetcar Named Desire, represent the very best of the genius of Brando.  He not only starred in One Eyed Jacks, but directed it.  It is a classic Western in theme, but is surprisingly romantic.  He is Rio, a bank robber and gunman, on a path of revenge.  It has a beautiful score and was shot in Monterey, CA, and is both sweeping and gritty.  Brando's performance is sexy, powerful, magnetic and compelling.  There is lack of continuity in several insert shots, so unfortunately it has a rough cut feel in some places.  It has not been digitally remastered and restored.  This is an important film that deserves to be updated so that its beauty can be fully enjoyed.
B001GCUO16|2.0|I'm a big fan of comic genre movies, and love the original X-Men movie, and thought 2 and 3 were ok.  This one unfortunately isn't at par with many of the other high quality franchises being produced including the previous X-Men, Iron Man, Spiderman, and recent Batman movies.  The story is a bit contrived - but I can get over that.  It's based on a comic book after all.  What is unforgivable is the poor quality of the CGI effects.  Green screen shots were extremely obvious, where lighting looked off making everyone appear artificial against the backgrounds.  Some of the background shots seemed almost cartoonish.  Makeup effects weren't great.  And worst of all Logan's claws even looked bad, where it seemed the effects animators had a difficult time keeping the claw appearance against the skin on his hands difficult.    I happened to see the \\"pre-release\\" version earlier this year that was floating around the Internet and had the studios in a tizzie.  I think now having seen both the pre-release and production versions that those studio execs were worried because the pre-release version and final cut are actually much closer in finish and polish than they wanted anyone to think.  Now some of this may not be as obvious on DVD, vs. high definition.  But we're in a high definition world now and the producers should be ashamed of themselves for letting the visual quality control go to the dogs on this one.
B002POMLHY|5.0|These guys rock...the music...the lyrics...the total package.  I think Dear Agony, Anthem of the Angels,  I Will Not Bow, and Give Me A Sign are some of their best songs to date.  If you love their previous albums with Ben's brooding verses and stiff guitar riffs then you will love this album too.  Some critics (cynics) have said the album doesn't \\"branch out\\" enough.  If you listen to all their albums from Saturate to Dear Agony there is very discernable growth in the band as whole including lyrics, vocals, and music; just because they don't completely reinvent themselves for each new album is not to me a valid criticism and usually alienates fans leaving them waiting for the next record where the band hopefully regains some of its identity.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Excellent show with excellent actors and actresses.  Once you start watching the DVD, it's hard to stop with each episode better than the last.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Before my take on the set, I'll give my history as a Beatles fan so there is some perspective. I'm 33 and the last time I listened to the Beatles was...NEVER. I'm familiar with the music, but never LISTENED. I would even admit to being a hater. I'm a metal guy at heart.    So I'm riding in my mom's car and she has an above average stereo in her car with the \\"Help!\\" remaster playing. It sounded amazing. There were so many sounds that I'd never heard on the radio or in movies and commercials. And the more I hear the less popular (not less good) songs, I'm just floored at the level of excellence across the board. Nevermind the very short period in which all of this was released, how well it holds up or that they were laying the foundation of both rock and pop music. The quality of the recordings still maintains that humm or buzz that you would expect on vinyl, but there are so many sounds that permeate each song. And it is all crystal clear. I love the packaging, brief stories and mini-docs with each disc. I'm not getting a Phd. in Beatles History, so this is plenty of goodness for me.    If you're a 30 something and haven't really checked the Beatles out, at the very least, grab the White Album and Abbey Road. Those two releases could come out tomorrow and absolutley crush anything Coldplay or Oasis could ever hope to come up with. The variety from album to album and even within each disc on the later material is stunning.     If you gave this box set 1 star because the mixing of Paul's bass was tuned to 1.35ghz and the treble level was adjusted to 11 instead of 10 with a triple overdub, YOU ARE LAME. For an average, or even above average music fan (where I would consider myself to be), it is impossible to say this is anything less than tremendous. So I will concede this - if you own the vinyl and a 10 thousand dollar system or are massive audiophile/Beatles expert, you already have all of this music. But in my case it serves its purpose in offering ultra high qualitymusic to a generation that may only be familiar with the hits and not the rest of their stunning catalouge. Giving this 1 star is either ignorant or just an opportunity for someone to flex their \\"I know more than you about music\\" muscle.

0812977246|4.0|Sometimes when one picks up a book of this genre the cliches and nuances become almost nauseating; \\"Gorky Park,\\" however, graciously avoids these labels.

Yes, it is a fluff read, but it is on the more intellectually stimulating side of that category!
B00000DC7J|5.0|I'm new to Piazolla - this is only my 2nd CD. The first was [[ASIN:B000005J0M Piazzolla: Five Tango Sensations]] and though it is very good if you're only getting one I'd recommend starting with this one. Of the two, Piazolla's originality is more in evidence on this one. (Also, if you already have the Kronos, you might try [[ASIN:B00022UTP2 Tango Sensations: Alban Berg Quartet]], which I've seen in the store but haven't heard yet.)<br /><br />In musical sensibility, Piazolla's tango has a lot in common with jazz and classical music. His music is about innovation, the unexpected; the more you listen to it the more surprises and nuances it reveals.<br /><br />My third Piazolla disk will be Yo-Yo Ma's [[ASIN:B0000029XQ Soul of the Tango: The Music of Astor Piazzolla]]. If you're richer than I am you might get all of these at once; if you're as poor as I then start with Tango: Zero Hour.

0385504225|2.0|I didn't hate the book.  It kept me sane during an intercontinental flight.  But the writing is just bad, in a way that I don't remember in The DaVinci Code.  The Lost Symbol is a fun plot inadequately supported by shallow characters and silly, frustrating dialogue.  The wonderful sense of being lost in a book never happens.  The plot keeps you turning the pages, but it's like eating candy for dinner.  Not satisfying.  I won't spoil the plot, but I have to say that the last chapter was just weird, containing a long, lecturing dialogue about religion that neither character would enjoy if they had seriously endured the events of the previous chapters.

B00005JKZV|2.0|THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING     (USA/New Zealand - 2001)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS-ES / SDDS    Somewhere in Middle Earth, an unassuming hobbit (Elijah Wood) comes into possession of a powerful ring coveted by evil forces throughout the land, and he embarks on a quest with elves, humans and fellow hobbits to destroy the ring once and for all.    The first in a trilogy of fantasy films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novels, helmed by the unlikely figure of Peter Jackson (previously responsible for splatterfests like BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD). Despite a three hour running time, the film is invigorated by strong production values, excellent performances (especially Ian McKellen as a helpful wizard, Viggo Mortensen as a brave mortal who joins forces with his otherworldly brethren, and Wood as the hapless hobbit entrusted with a sacred mission) and a breakneck pace which remains faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's endeavors.     The computer generated castles and landscapes are breathtaking in places, but Jackson is forced to overplay his hand in this respect, and the trickery loses some of its impact after a while, but there's no denying the craftsmanship and dedication of the production team. Christopher Lee plays the central villain with frightening gravitas, and there's a wealth of fine supporting players, including Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, amongst many others. An extended version of the film has since appeared on home video.     Followed by THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002).
0439796636|5.0|In London on September 17, 2009, I saw the sensational and deeply moving hit play \\"War Horse\\" which was adapted from Michael Morpurgo's novel. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in the theater, an epic theater happening, yet a drama with a very moving intimate family core story. Huge seven foot horse puppets had been constructed. They are operated by two people inside the body and one outside operating the head actions. They move exactly like real horses, sound like real horses, and very early in the play audience members come to believe in them as real horses.<br /> The play is performed on a thrust stage with the audience flanking three sides. At various times a puppet goose on wheels delights the audience, a huge menacing tank rolls across the stage, and birds fly on tall poles. There are up to six horse puppets that appear as part of the cavalry. Sound, light, and music coalesce to create a total theater experience.<br /> \\"War Horse,\\" (1982) the novel upon which the play is based is told in the first person by the horse himself, a device that was used in \\"Black Beauty.\\" Considerable changes were made in plot and dialogue to turn the novel into a theater piece. The story is a very touching one about a boy, Albert, who finds that his father, in one of his drunken bouts, has bought a colt at auction. Albert develops a deep love for the horse and raises him with great tenderness. The book starts in Devon, England before the start of World War I. The father forces Albert to train Joey to be a plough horse; again the father in a drunken state had made a bet that Joey could be a plough horse in a week.<br />When the war in Europe envelops England, Albert's father sells the horse to the army which needs cavalry horses. Albert is grief stricken over the loss of Joey and vows to get him back after what he thinks will be a brief war. Training for army service, Joey becomes a close friend to the bigger, stronger black stallion Topthorn. Together as close companions they go through some horrible battlefield experiences.<br />Captain Nicholls takes care of Joey and paints his portrait. Soon Joey and Topthorn are in the heat of battle. They fall into German hands, and are saved when they pull ambulance carts for the Germans. An old man and his daughter protect them on their farm for a time until they are taken back by the Germans to pull artillery carts. They are befriended by old Friederick. Soon they are overwhelmed by the grim battlefield conditions such as the savage barbed wire.<br />This novel and play are a very strong indictments of war. In World War I over six million horses died from all sorts of causes. The human death toll has been estimated at ten million. The anti-war theme is driven home more poignantly when you see the suffering of the horses on stage and on the printed page; witness man's inhumanity toward man, and man's cruelty and disdain for animals.they go through some horrible battlefield experiences.

0385737947|5.0|If I had to describe this book in few words I would say it's a... wild ride. I am beyond amazed and stunned at Dashner's ability to keep me helplessly glued to the pages. I don't think I've ever been so glued to any book as I was to this one. Despite the fact that this has none of the qualities I normally like in a book, I think this was an incredible reading.    The action in the plot is infinite. My heart was racing the whole time. I think I even had trouble breathing in some parts. Seriously. On top of that the writing was impeccable. I loved the new Glade-slang he threw in there. The characters were great, and I really enjoyed that they were all male, with only one exception. It was really interesting to see boys interact among themselves without women around and under pressure.    The cover is fitting and draws attention. I definitely recommend this book. In overall, it was awesome. If you loved the Hunger Games series, you will love this trilogy. I am desperate for the next book!
B000EGFVQS|4.0|After so many reviews, no need to repeat the plot here. About halfway through reading I realized a movie was in process and checked IMDB to find out about it. Finding that Susan Sarandon had been cast as Grandma Lynn added greatly to my pleasure as I finished the book--perfect casting! I mostly very much enjoyed the book and thought it was well written. Particularly good were Sebold's portrayals of young teenagers, who so often are shown these days as empty-headed, video-gaming, smart-a**es. These kids were serious, conflicted, and thoughtful, which I think is realistic. I also liked the author's take on what one's heaven might be like and found hilarious its having an \\"intake counselor\\" to guide the way.    [Spoilers] A couple of things did bother me. When Mr. Harvey came back to the neighborhood late in the book and was questioned by two policemen, I found it incredible that he was not picked up then after having told them that he used to live there. I started getting nervous when Ruth and Ray were hanging around the sinkhole, especially when an appliance came to the surface, and I felt like I was being teased--was that grisly safe going to pop up or not? A manipulative ploy, and an annoying one. And, like so many others, I found gratuitous the Susie/Ruth body-trading stunt, but maybe not for the same reasons. Susie died in the early 1970s, a more innocent time than now; most 14-year-old girls then probably were quite interested in being kissed, but were probably still at the stage when they found the idea of sex gross. To me, what was implied was that, once Susie had sex, she could relax and let earth go. That seems trite and simplistic and the book had, until that point, seemed so much more important.

1400079179|1.0|One of the worst, if not THE worst book I've read, ever. With Brown's new one out, I'm afraid even more people will be tempted to read this thing.<br /><br />I'll admit that at first, as a conspiracy-nut since the Kennedy assassination, I was intrigued by the idea of a systematic cover-up of the feminine role in the Church. And the idea of a non-celibate Jesus is interesting in the light of abuse scandals involving the said-to-be celibate priesthood. But it didn't take long for the flat dialogue and wooden characters to put me to sleep--especially Langdon, with his pedantic lecturing to the unfortunate Sophie (if I'd have been Sophie, I'd have knocked him one upside the head when he ran on and on and on, ad nauseum). And she wasn't a whole lot more interesting, even when you find out, if you hadn't already guessed it very early on, the (gasp!) secret of her heritage. Brown couldn't seem to decide whether she is a powerful, take-charge kind of woman (one who lead the hapless Langdon to safety outside the Louvre) or an insipid, adoring girl sitting at the feet of her hero. And don't get me started on old grand pere! What a sensitive, cuddly, surrogate parent he must have been: he takes in a child traumatized by the deaths of her entire family and what does he do? All Brown tells us is that he taught her to solve puzzles and crack codes. These people have absolutely no personalities and I never could make myself care what happened to them. Even Tom Hanks, bless him, was unable to make this clown interesting in the movie.<br /><br />Can we believe that Sophie was so immature that she cut off all communication with her beloved grandfather for ten years because she witnessed a weird sexual ritual? A woman smart enough to have become a cryptologist certainly would have been able to confront him at some point and deal with it. She gives up her only living relative over this? Come on! I was expecting human sacrifice or something equally horrifying.<br /><br />The characters seem incredibly naïve (if not downright stupid). I could have told them not to go back into the gallery when they were already nearly safely out of the Louvre; surely they would have sensed the danger in that move. While being chased by Interpol, the French police, Opus Dei, and The Priori, shouldn't they have at least had some sense of the urgency of their situation? Instead, they seem to take a lot of cryptology breaks and indulge in more theoretical discussions, which certainly could have waited until they were safe somewhere. Having been inside Westminster Abbey, it is obvious to me that their approach to the knight's tomb could have been made in a much less conspicuous manner than straight across the massive, wide-open nave. How about down the dark aisles? Did they actually forget that they weren't the only ones looking for the Grail? Jeesh!<br /><br />How neatly Brown deals with the sinister Bezu Fache (one of the few somewhat interesting characters) at the very end! Was 454 pages Brown's limit? Did he really need to tie it all up in such a tidy little package? Couldn't he have given us a clue as to Fache's epiphany? Or did he just run out of space?<br /><br />My objections to this book have nothing whatever to do with the many religious, historical, or artistic arguments it seems to have ignited. I didn't find the themes the least bit offensive, and, yes, I knew it was fiction. The book simply isn't good enough to make me care.if not downright stupid).

B0009MAO46|5.0|The family loves this movie.  A very interesting story well presented.  My 3 yr old granddaughter especially loves to watch it.  One of the new classic animation movies.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This is a lovely adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels! The day I first watched it, I wasn't sure if I was in the mood for a stuffy storyline, but this is anything but! While showing you the deep complexities of life back then, it also has such witty moments, I laughed out loud. I loved this story and highly recommend it to any Jane Austen fan.
0307269981|5.0|This book is fantastic. I couldn't put it down. That was a problem because I have two young children, a dog, and spouse who all count on me to get things done.  So I was forced to read late into the night and spend the day after in a blary-eyed state.  Still, in the end it was worth the sleep deprivation.  This one is better than the first. So good, in fact, that in my eagerness to acquire the third and final book in the series, I went to Amazon's UK site and ordered it from there (since the US release is not scheduled to until mid 2010).
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The Star Trek Movie was awesome. I saw it 4 times. JJ Abrams did an awesome job. As soon as I heard he was doing the movie I knew there was something to look forward to. One of the things I enjoyed about the Original Star Trek was everyone working together for a common goal. Usually saving themselves of later in the movies saving earth. And of course in this movie saving earth again. The movie had plenty of action and villian and who can forget time travel. JJ took the movie story line in a whole new direction. You might say he gave it a rebirth. This guy is a genus!  Way to go JJ!
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown has struck again. But this time he has missed the mark.  The Lost Symbol is NOT the DaVinci Code.  In the latter, he took on one of the most sacred institutions in the West. In this one, he takes on the ... Masons.  Who cares? I didn't. I expect most of us don't.  Sure the research is great.  The hidden symbols that Mr. Brown has constructed are extraordinarily clever.  But it's a plot that makes a good book. And the plot is, well, boring.  Moreover, the level of sadism in this book is, in my opinion, gratuitous to a fault.
B00008NEQM|5.0|I first heard this music in a video on line. And when I found out the name of the music and the group, I sent for a couple of their CD's. I like the music very much and have found something new to listen to.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Disclaimer: I Am A Serious Fan.<br />  And I always have been, ever since I saw the video for Alive on MTV when I was 14. As an emotionally abused, rebellious, no tears, fight back kind of kid, that song got my attention before the first chorus. I saw this little long haired dude, and I heard this immensely powerful vibration of deep sound that I seemed to somehow feel in my chest, and I had a hard time believing that one small young man was the source. Eddie Vedder. Wow.<br />  So of course I've got all the albums (personal favorite is Vitalogy). Seen 'em live more than once. Got around 25 official (& not so official) bootlegs. So I consider myself a bit of an expert on Pearl Jam.<br />  The new album, Backspacer, is a great no frills, in your face rock n' roll album. For anyone who knows what real rock n' roll is supposed to sound like, I highly recommend this cd. However, if your favorite band is Third Eye Blind (go change your tampon), or Papa Roach (yuck), or Nickelback, or Creed, or Sum 41, or something like that, then I invite you to stay away and please don't even think about writing a review of Backspacer.<br />  Gonna See My Friend is one of the best simple pure rock songs I have ever heard, and Got Some aint far behind it. Unthought Known is my personal favorite off this album; it's rough, raw, soaring and gorgeous, the kind of song only Pearl Jam could do, and only Eddie could sing. Just Breathe will tug your heart strings, yet is dignified because this band is far above writing a sappy love song. The End is about a husband dying of cancer and telling of his guilt for leaving his wife alone to raise the kids, and his fear of dying. It's absolutely haunting.<br />  For all you people who are complaining that each record isn't Ten or that Eddie doesn't sing the way he used to, please shut up, you're all idiots. How could a group of guys with this much integrity ever justify repeating just one sound over and over simply because it is popular? They grew up; you should, too.<br />  And yes, eddie sounds different. But he also sounds the same. And in my opinion, he still has the most distinctive, and the best, voice in rock today. The difference is that now he doesn't have to blow his vocal chords out at every other show the way he used to, which means the band doesn't have to cancel shows, which means us concert goers get to enjoy extended setlists at Pearl Jam shows.<br />  And that's a good thing..

You can open up to any page and find words of wisdom and encouragement.  When I begin to feel like I'm fighting with life, I pick up The Secret.
141654917X|5.0|I thought this book was way better than expected. I always think that books with a 'sick' character are going to be the same and boring, but this one was not. It focused more on Anna than Kate and the ending was a complete shock I had to reread it to be sure I didn't miss something. This was a awesome book and will be reading it again.  By the way if you saw the movie first the book is way better and totally different, in a good way.
B000077VR3|5.0|People hate this movie; I mean really, really loathe it.  You know what the funny thing is?  I totally understand.  `Moulin Rouge!' is hardly a film for everyone.  It claims to be a revival of sorts for the musical genre (and it was) but it is really far removed from anything the genre has ever seen before.  Baz Luhrmann is an acquired taste, a man full of vision (one of our generation's greatest auteur) and that vision, no matter how grand, doesn't translate for everyone.  With buckets of style lavishly emptied on every frame, there are many detractors who view Luhrmann's `simple plot meets overtly dramatized delivery' to be distracting to put it nicely.<br /><br />This is a `busy' movie.<br /><br />For every ten or so people who despise this film and consider it an overrated disaster, there is one person who absolutely adores it and relishes in all of its haphazard and chaotic magnificence.<br /><br />Yes, `Moulin Rouge!' is a simple film, plot-wise.  You have a writer, Christian, who falls in love with a woman of the night, Satine, only to be pretty much banned from her affections by her boss who has promised her to a wealthy man, The Duke.  Stealing time together, the two work on a massive production in The Duke's honor, but there is a dark secret (a predictable one really) that may prevent Satine and Christian from ever really being `together'.<br /><br />That's it; but it's how it is strung together that makes all the difference.<br /><br />`Moulin Rouge!' for me is one of those rare films where everything comes together just right.  The singing is spectacular (especially Ewan McGregor, who can really, REALLY sing), the acting is tremendous (especially Jim Broadbent, who won the Oscar that year for the WRONG film) and the sequences are dazzling (especially thanks to Nicole Kidman, who has never been so beautiful).  The sets are brilliantly constructed and add so much vibrancy and emotional weight to the scenes.  The musical numbers may be all over the place, spliced together with attention deficiency in mind, but they work in harmony with Luhrmann's vision.  Really, if you are familiar with his work (`Strictly Ballroom' and `Romeo + Juliet') then you know how he develops his visual opus, and this is no different.  This is Luhrmann at his most creative and engaging (even if I slightly prefer `Romeo + Juliet' as a whole).<br /><br />So, hopefully, if you haven't yet, you will give this one a try.  If you hate it, I understand, for it has qualities that cannot be appreciated by everyone; but if you're lucky you'll see something here that is rarely seen in cinema, and that alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Besides, this is one of the most debatable and thus the most interesting films in recent cinema.y in mind, but they work in harmony with Luhrmann's vision.

0061841935|5.0|After reading (and loving) the book, I had to get the audiobook.  It's even better hearing Ferguson tell his own story than it is reading it.  I'm a huge Ferguson fan, and this is a must-buy for any of his fans.  Yes, it's more expensive than the book, but it's worth every penny.    One odd thing about the packaging:  On the box, it says \\"9 hours, 7 CD's\\", but it's actually a bit over 7 hours on 6 CD's.  That's a rather sloppy mistake, but it certainly didn't detract from the pleasure of listening to this wonderful work.  Buy it!
0756405890|5.0|This was a wonderful novel - can you believe I was sorry when my flight landed and I had to put it down!    This is the best Swords & Socery novel I have read in 10 years.  There is something wonderfully evocative about it - similar to the way the Lord of the Rings resonates back to a collective memory of a mystical era.      Patrick - please write the rest quickly!
0385340575|4.0|I have read all the Reacher books and am a big fan. The last one ([[ASIN:B002KAOSEW Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher, No. 12)]]) was really boring. But Gone Tomorrow is pure fun. As usual Reacher is coldly logical. In general that works out pretty well. However, at some places in the story, where he is deducting places in NewYork based on his knowledge of the city, the logic gets a bit far-fetched. Hence the 4 stars. Perhaps Child could have developed the story a bit more and given Reacher little more to work with. Still, Reacher is in his usual [...]-kicking form taking the reader along for the journey.    The book makes the reader think and reason alongside Reacher - that has generally been the hallmark of Child's writing. I'm not awarding 5 stars because subway\NewYork details could have been reduced a bit and the plot details could have been developed with some more twists.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown should join James Patterson, Jodi Picoult and other writers who create the same book time after time, with a genre that does nothing but insult a curious mind.  Perhaps I am guilty of continuing to read what is really written for the uneducated.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael does'nt disappoint with this new cd.  I've only had a chance to listen to the preview of the songs but I'm loving it.  I can hardly wait to get my cd and listen to all of it.  It's been a long time coming, but worth the wait.<br /><br />My favorites on the cd are Cry Me A River, At This Moment and Stardust.
0385504225|2.0|I don't know what was more disappointing.  The anticipation that I personally felt for this book and the incredible letdown about 2/3 of the way through, or the evangelicalizing of one Mr. Dan Brown.  Now to be fair it's been a few years since I read the previous 2 Langdon books, but I don't recall this much proselytizing or natutally assumed beliefs in either of them.  For no reason at all Brown has decided to bring Noetic science to the fore-front as a legitimate scientific dicipline.  To call this absured science-fiction would be to insult Star Trek geeks every where.  For crying out loud, one character devices a machine that can weigh the human soul!!  And my personal favorite moment of \\"I really do believe in god\\"  is the first hand account we are given of one character being sucked into hell after he dies.         Please Mr. Hanks and Mr. Howard give this one a wide berth.  Do not taint your good names with this drek.  And as for you Mr. Brown, this book  should not be listed in the thriller section of the book store. It should be on the dusty shelf in the back squeezed inbetween the remaining copies of the Left Behind series and listed under Spiritual Fiction.  Maybe the movie version could even feature Kirk Cameron, I hear he's looking for work.
