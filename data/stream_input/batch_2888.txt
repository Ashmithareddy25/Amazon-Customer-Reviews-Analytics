B005S9ELVC|4.0|Fast past and futuristic. I think today's young will enjoy this movie more than my generation.  I do recomment it though.
B00B19H2KU|4.0|I can sum this film up very simply. This is to Jews what The Exorcist is to Catholics. That sums it up. Good flick.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This movie is worth seeing again and again.  It is a classic that everyone should see. It is almost as good as the book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|At the beginning, I did not think that I would like this book. However as it progressed it began to hold my attention, with its many twists and turns. It is a testament to the fact that there are many shades to evil and good. I liked the epilogue, which gave closure to the story. I liked this book enough to look for more books written by the author.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I read and reread her books. As a lover of history I find she is so evocative of the time and the status or lack thereof for women.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I guess I didn't understand that the &#34;friends&#34; part means that you play on line against other people.  Not for me.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|nothing worth the (short) time it took to download - its more like a user manual explaining that you have to combine three candies of the same color...
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Never watch any other Stargate tv shows or movies, this is a entertaining  smart show with great main and supporting cast. The storyline is not really original, just a different setting, the interaction between the characters is what the show enjoy to watch. Especially the first three seasons with Dr Elizabeth Weir commanding Atlantis
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Mistakenly purchased this thinking it was another movie. It was ooookayyyy. I wouldn't pay to watch it. Wait for Starz.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|excellent game needs to be longer before you have to pay. challenging and fun would recommend this game to  family and friends. keep up the good work. look toward to the next one
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Predictable story plot, but oh-so-cute to watch anyway!  Chemistry between the lead actors was so great!  Perfect summer flick to watch with a glass of wine and my girl-posse!
B007STBUIW|5.0|The Blu-ray is so much clearer than the original it is like watching a new movie. I also liked the extras where they interviewed the cast and director.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|This is the best of the three shows (SG-1, Atlantis, and Universe).  Too bad they dorked with the actors in the last 2 seasons.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Once again, James Rollins weaves fact and fiction, science and, technology combined<br />With so many familiar characters and a great story to provide the reader total escape.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|We enjoyed this film so much in the movie theater that we could not wait for it to come out on DVD.  The price was great as you can enjoy your snacks at home too.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|i like a game where you hit the play button and you play.  this one has lots of sparkle and you keep having to hit play and go to another screen and again and again.  the play is matching 3 but in only 1 min. time.  its ok but nothing special.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|GAVE IT FOUR STARS CAUSE I HAD A HARD TIME PUTTING IT DOWN. GOOD STORY  WITH  A FEW DIFFERENT STORY LINES. LIKED HOW EVERYTHING GOT WRAPPED UP IN THE END. WILL LOOK FOR MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR. GOOD READ.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The plot went on well past its &#34;due date,&#34; and the ending felt weak as the main characters limped off the last pages. I would not recommend this book to serious readers.
B004M8S6FC|5.0|Just like The Forever War I truly enjoyed this story.<br /><br />What to do when you age near the end and loved ones pass away? If you get a new start, then how and do you have control? Brilliant on the soft spots via-a-vis the main characters thoughts on old age, love for a life companion passed away, new friendships and a new life.<br /><br />And old school kickaxx on the description of bootcamp, alien races, technology, interstellar travel and politics - human politics and big corp. control also :-)<br /><br />I read this and immediately bought the sequel and the sequel to the sequel ('The Ghost Brigades' and 'The Last Colony' respectively) - it's that good.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Intense movie, it's a shame it didn't do better in theaters, as I'd love to see the rest in the series.<br /><br />Strong emotion, maybe not for young children. But it kept my wife's interest which is difficult as she usually falls asleep during movies.
B000UUF69A|4.0|Not an award winner, but still a move I could sit and watch with my 2 girls. Enoyed watching this movie
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great free app, gives you an accurate account of battery life taken up by various applications. Essential for when you forget your charger and you want to know how long you have left
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I can laud Buddy enough, he is one of my favorites and this offering did not disappoint. I've had it in the car since the day it arrived and have found nothing that can move it from position number 1.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I knew something of this incident before reading the book.  It's a good dose of fear, courage, comradeship, and chivalry.  The German Luftwaffe pilot, having previously killed many allied airmen, could not bring himself to finish off this badly shot up struggling and straggling U.S. bomber...instead he took steps...at great danger to himself...to save them.  A true and heartwarming story of an instantaneous decision that not only saved lives, but forever changed lives.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|I like John and the trio much better when they are doing their Blues thing, however, this was a good listen. In fact, I've listened more than once. I don't think this effort has the strength of the previous disk, it doesn't have an &#34;Olivia&#34; to anchor it, but I am enjoying the songs. I hope the boys get back to their Blues thing real soon.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I have just gotten into this show and have loved every bit of it.  This season has not let me Down either. looking forward to Season 9
B001UTW7QU|5.0|some (most of the science was pretty (bogus), but had superb writers and story telling. One of those I can't put down (off) stories. This will be a classic. When will season 6 start?
B00E38KGF4|4.0|It does seem to function.<br /><br />My version of Bitdefender Antivirus (free) paused the installation of VLC Plus Pro (free) noting that it was \\"aggressive adware.\\" That is something I just don't need and Bitdefender Antivirus (free) saved potential headaches.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book does not grab you from the beginning, but once it does it is very hard to put down. Lots of twists and unexpected turns and interesting characters. Had a great time reading it.
B000063TS9|5.0|Very nice recording, well worth the money I paid for it, Naxos might be a small recording company, nut they certainly have a stable of great recording artists.<br />Received the C/D about five days after ordering.<br />Thank you Amazon. Com.<br />RGB
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Lots of levels, good tiles that change. Can be challenging but fun. Great mahjong game. Very attractive backgrounds too. Most enjoyable
B0097C8XL0|3.0|It doesn`t seem hard--at first. Then it`s simplicity get`s you hooked.<br />I keep it running so that I can play it it between things.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I would recommend this book.  If you watched the Netflix series and are worried about spoilers, don't, its almost an entirely different story.
B001N8V7KA|4.0|One of Clint Eastwood's best movies.  Just a little slow at times for today's movie pace.  I would definitely recommend seeing it if you love military movies.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|An utterly fascinating description of the enormous political turmoil that waged over our gradual entry into the &#34;Good War.&#34;  Today we take for granted that the evil of the Nazi regime was obvious as was the need for us to do what we could to stamp it out. We have no idea how wide, deep, and intense the opposition was to our aiding Britain and eventually going to war ourselves.
B006UKPCSE|5.0|Perfect modern military intriguing story.  Love this movie.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I'm already a Superman fan. Couldn't wait and it was worth it. The best acting of any Superman yet and I've seen them all and loved them all.  Good plot, good drama. Good pacing. Great music. Now a few comments/question about this particular product Man of Steel DVD + Ultraviolet Combo w Digital download.  There is NO DIGITAL download for  MAN OF STEEL on this or ANY Man of Steel  DVD OFFERED.  Not screaming, just emphasizing. This digital download is just for Ultraviolet. Is this typical. I'm not a frequent purchaser but this seemed a little deceiving the way it's marketed. Maybe just because I dont purchase frequently. Can anyone offer clarification?
B007BLCGNU|5.0|Leonardo Dicaprio played J. Edgar perfectly, and the entire cast were well chosen.  The story was great.  It is one of those movies where everything worked very well.
B004XMMSZG|1.0|The music is fine at very low leverls.  However, if you turn the volume up the slightest, it becomes extremely distorted.  Not worth the money or anything near it.
006016848X|5.0|Simple, easy to understand reasons why it is impossible for men and women to ever think alike, and all the secrets how to communicate better with the opposite sex.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty to me was always the special and exotic of independent films which I love.  In addition to my devotion to old hollywood movies, I am a huge fan of film that stretches the imagination, challenges you to consider the off the beaten path ideas, even entertain with the sick and twisted which this movie brushes on.  Love the movie.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|Great actors, but lack luster acting.  Predicable story line and scenes.  Old, aging actors performing stunts that only 20-30 year olds can do makes the movie very unbelievable.
B00DU73T08|4.0|The Host was a solid story with simple effective cinematography and well nuanced performances. A bit longer than it needed to be, some pacing issues here and there, but the film is worth the slow spots. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't hate scifi.
B001N09BDS|5.0|Leonardo Dicaprio was perfect for this role.  All of the other cast members were well chosen, and the story line was excellent. A movie where everything fits perfectly.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Was three great stories that all came together in the end; loved it!  I would hightly recommend it - a great read!
B0033CTKHG|3.0|This movie isn't really for a true Bond enthusiast.  It has good direction and acting, but, it's just too silly to be considered a 007 movie.  The actresses are drop dead gorgeous for that time period.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids play this game all the time.  They love it and its free.  I play also, blah, blah, blah
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|One of the WORST movies ever made.  Terrible in every aspect. Skip it big time.  Stick with Sylvester Stallone's Original version.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I just got this controller in the mail today.  I opened the box and pulled the controller out of the package.  Immediately out of the box I could tell I was in for an iffy experience at best.  The buttons felt stiff, the left thumbstick would stick in whatever direction I pointed it and the start and select buttons felt like they were pieces of rubber in empty sockets.  There was no indication that pressing the button down was registering on anything.<br /><br />Here's what happened when it came time to play:<br /><br />Plugging the controller in it took about 10 minutes for it to charge up well enough to sync to the PS3.<br /><br />The lights flickered and it was a solid hour and a half before the controller reached full charge.<br /><br />The page for this product states it has a rumble feature but I never felt the rumble motors kick in.<br /><br />Every 10 minutes the controller would disconnect.<br /><br />The left thumbstick does not register when you point it anywhere in between full left and full up.  Half the time getting it to register in any direction took retries and had delays.  When I moved the left stick downward the stick would stay locked into that position until I moved it.<br /><br />Face buttons were unresponsive.<br /><br />All in all a huge disappointment.  This controller felt like something you'd buy at a swap meet with a logo that says Gamestation and has a bootleg Nintendo logo.
B001609SQA|5.0|One of the world's BEST ever science fiction alien movies.  James Cameron directed it, so the characters, screen play, and set are all excellent.
B005D4YOWI|1.0|Bad fit. My last pair was too large, so I came down 1/2 size. Length dropped from 11 2/16 to 10 11/16.  Now too short and uncomfortable.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|once again a &#34;sad&#34; but great movie. love denzel washington. this movie is very entertaining.denzel washington did it again. he is my<br /> favorite actor
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I have the free edition and I will agree that it's a beautiful app. My only problem is that I am bombarded every time I open anything on this app to upgrade. Yes, I know it's free but it's almost like being bullied.<br /><br />If I do decide to buy a clock app for my kindle fire HD, this would be the one.<br /><br />Just ease off the up sell with all your free apps Apalon.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It held my attention the whole way through, once again the author captures the life of people who we have never met.  Nor understand their was of life.
1449433251|5.0|Growing up me and my brother loved (and i still do)stuffed animals. This reminds me of him because he had a tiger he called \\"tigerster\\" (lol yea pretty lame but i'm the older sibling so i'm obligated to say that ^^)He would play pretend, toss it up everywhere, and even bring it everywhere (when he had the opportunity). One time he sneaked it into my rucksack for a trip because it couldn't fit anywhere else. Hehe good memories :D while that had nothing to do with the product, I still recommend Calvin and Hobbes because its a fantastic, lighthearted comic :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great tv program! Great actors, great multi-faceted storyline. Lots of twists in plots. Can hardly wait for Season three.  WATCH IT!!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I got this app and the original Lep's World. My 4 year old son is hooked! I cannot believe the graphics and cute songs! My son really enjoys the audio as well as visual in this game. Great for kids, or for adults that need to pass some time!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|View of his family from the voice of a very perceptive dog. Interesting story framework based on skill of race car driving.<br />Funny, informative and sad. Life philosophy thread throughout book is thought provoking. Love this book.
B006S01GH2|5.0|This was a very funny and quirky movie. The story was so original and the acting was very good. I love foreign films and this would be at the top of my list along with Bread and Tulips!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Family-friendly fun for all ages. I have seen this movie countless times since I was a child and do not enjoy it any less as an adult.
B000OLROWC|5.0|it's a good movie just fun to watch entertaining makes you want to watch it more I have watched it four times
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We watched Season 1, 2, and 3 over a 4 week time span. We were hooked from the very first show. We are &#34;biting at the bit&#34; until Season 4 starts in January. It was a real &#34;cliff hanger&#34; that ended Season 3. Would HIGHLY recommend the series to everyone.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The book was fantastic!!! It has a good climax to it and I love the characters, they actually sound like teenagers b in a apocalypse!
B005LAIIJY|1.0|One star is way too ambitious for this movie. I usually appreciate Quentin Tarantino's work, but this fell to the weigh side for me.  Jamie Fox was of course brilliant and as amazing as he always is. - powerful and intensely charming actor. In fact, with the exception of the young object of Jamie Fox's affection, each character was wonderful, well performed, emotionally stimulating and so on.  The young love of Jamie Fox appeared to be a beautiful slave princess:  not at all convincing - certainly not in the context of the era.  She was a little too unafraid; her mannerism too cocky...too bad.  And last, but not least, the music, other than Richie Haven's freedom was horribly used.  The selection of music abolished the possibility of any strong emotion toward the any of the events.  it could have been a powerful movie, but Mr. Tarantino went overboard with his artistic licensee..
1400032717|5.0|My daughter needed to read a few books over the summer and and chose this one. Much to her suprised, she enjoyed it!
B00004T9VY|5.0|Tea For the Tillerman was my all time favorites when it was first broadcasted on AM radio.  Cat Stevens is a powerful performer, singer, musician who wails out songs that allows the listener, even begs the listener to come with him on a journey.  He is unique as an artist and cannot be confused with anyone else - he always has been and i imagine that always will be.  This is not a man who was hijacked by commercialism or the need to sound like everyone else, and thank goodness.  Cat Stevens is like a dream that became a reality - praises to him for his musical ability to sooth the savage breast...
B00CATSONE|1.0|well expected something new on Nikola but either wrongly titled by author or intentionally for the sale purpose abot 40 % not relevent to Tessla not much new in<br />not even well presented may be meant for those who are not aware of this scientist poorly reflects on author .We wish if he improves and justify the purpose
B0089LOG02|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book but I never felt that I got to know the characters as people. The things that give you insight into the soul were missing
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like it so far... Its good quality and easy to follow.. I like the characters and the theme.. reminds me of the game clue.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Great book! Hadn't read anything from this author before, i was amazed.  Followed by reading the kite runner and loved it as well.
B000I8G5NA|5.0|All the questions you had in MIB are answered in MIB2 fun times are back again as Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is pulled from his retirement to save the world. Its a twist of roles as now Agent J is the senior agent with new tech and car. Grab the popcorn, start the movie and have a great time!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|A good selection of several decades of music, and always fast and up to date. I recommend it and use it alot.
0739384198|5.0|Simon Vance, the narrator of this series has a great voice and makes the story very easy to follow. This is a great book and is narrated very effectively. I highly recommend all there in the series!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I found this game to be fun,relaxing, and challenging. You can play at least 5 rounds for free everyday. If you are careful with your credits you can play quite a bit for free. Or if you want the challenge of awards for completing rooms you can choose to purchase items that fit your needs. Either way, it's a great game to take a time out with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game that takes practice to move ahead. Have been playing for 6 months! Only problem I have had is when I got a new kindle I had to start all over. The longer u play the higher rewards. But even with starting over I still am enjoying. Good for 4 to adult.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book will not disappoint. This is my second book by this author. She tells her stories with humor and class. The characters are very relatable. Great book! Now on to my 3rd book by this author.
B0091XT22O|5.0|I'm a Eighty's Baby so I grew up to this S***. Luv IT!!! But I only Purchased it because my girl
B00992CF6W|4.0|It was AWSOME!!! But I can't do a chest how are you supposed to do that I will rate it 5stars if somebody tells me that I have been trying to make one but I don't know!????!! Please help but other then that it was super that it blow at my face I thought I would hate it but it was ok
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Doesn't seem so challenging yet, but hopefully as the levels go on, it will become more challenging. I love mahjong, so it'll be fun either way.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this album!! I listen to it over and over again in my car.<br />Fast shipper too. Did I say I love it? I do!!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Was actually a good movie. Recently studied the Story in history class. Was able to see what the author was trying to depict while watching a good movie.
0062024329|4.0|Interesting book not sure it was what I expected but did read it beginning to end...<br />some wisdom shared throughout.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Definitely a really good movie. Will recommend to friends and family. Will also look forward to re-watching this but do not see the need to buy the movie
0545425115|5.0|Great book.  We are using it in an English class and it works great to facilitate conversations between the students and the teachers.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I was not that impressed but my husband seemed to enjoy it a lot. Probably will not buy the DVD but will watch it on the TV when it comes out
B003FFEX8C|3.0|The special effects may be a bit dated now but it was still fun to watch. Recommend watching as a family as long as kids are appropriate age.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Was a good movie but not happy about Duke being killed. Other than that it was good. Definitely a re-watch
B008MR1PDE|4.0|I like the GoneMAD music player very much. It does a great job downloading music to my kindle fire. I am well pleased.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!  My favorite of the series!  I love the relationship between Christian and Ana!  A good read for woman who want a great escape!
1439107955|5.0|Superb objective overview. I have no idea how a practicing physician found the time to write a 571 page book, but I'm thankful that he did. It really helps me as a victim of cancer myself. -- L. S. Coles, M.D., Ph.D., UCLA
B00746O3X8|1.0|After using the harness one time, the slide lock mechanism came off of my Canon 5D. I wasn't able to find it, so I emailed the seller explaining what had transpired, and asked how I could order another slide lock. It has been around two weeks, and I still haven't received any response. I was willing to purchase the part, even though I feel a company who focuses on customer service would have offered to replace it for free. Not even responding is unacceptable however.<br />I won't use this product again out of fear of damaging my equipment. I was just lucky the mechanism broke off when I was removing the camera from the holster, instead of while hiking.<br />If you are using this product, please be careful.
B000YJ6736|4.0|I like the way McEwan writes, but this book was not quite up to his standards.  It was interesting, and the character development was excellent, but the story itself stretched the imagination.  He knows how to write from a woman's perspective, which is saying a lot for a male author.  His female protagonist marries with no apparent inkling of the intimacy that makes a marriage work.  His male protagonist marries without prior affection or closeness, assuming all will be well on the wedding night.  I don't think real people think or act that way.  But...it made for a good story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just absolutely love Pinterest. This app works very well. My daughter even gets on and scrolls through things. It has larger enough thumbnails of the pictures so make it worthwhile.
B00C50NV2M|5.0|Product worked as expected. It doesn't cause headaches while watching. And finally no more use of batteries. It is also light and easy to store.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. My husband didn't know the story well so he kept asking me questions. I liked seeing the golden harp in one shot. I think the movie was very well made and expanded my imagination about the Jack and the Bean Stock story.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have studied for decades the Catholicism I was born into. Until this book, I was frustrated that I could not find information about the people and their lifestyles when Jesus was beginning his preachings. After all, it was a short three year period amidst a backdrop of centuries of Roman oppression of the Jews. From the moment the author pointed out that crucifixion was the Roman punishment for sedition, I knew the book would address my search for the some perspective of the times.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I'm not big on ratings but this game is worthy of praise. This game hands you and sucks you in. The entire story line is pretty funny and the ragdoll physics adds to the hilarity. Great game.
0064471837|5.0|I first discovered Garth Nix's writing when I read the \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" series. I fell in love with his writing style, as well as with the originality of the story, and wanted to read more of his work. When I first heard about \\"Sabriel,\\" I hesitated to read it at first because I had never enjoyed stories about necromancy before. When I usually think of necromancers, I imagine evil sorcerers in black cloaks summoning the dead with malicious intent. I decided to read the book anyway because of my love for the \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" series, and I do not regret my decision at all.<br /><br />\\"Sabriel\\" removes the concept of necromancy from the stereotypes it is usually associated with and puts a new spin on it. I have never read a book like it before, and I enjoyed reading about the fantastical world the book creates. I also found the main character, Sabriel, to be extremely relatable. She is well fleshed out, and her thought process is realistic. Her powers also contain weaknesses to balance out their strengths, meaning she is not all powerful and gilded in plot armor like many fantasy heroes are. I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of dark fantasy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interestingly, many of the books I've purchased since owning a Kindle either switch between characters chapter-to-chapter or between the Past and Present. I've very much come to enjoy this format. Talk about two needy souls - but to a sick Nth degree. I found the storyline fascinating in that I was driven to find out exactly what the hell happened. Slowly but surely you realize you are dealing with two VERY dysfunctional minds. Early on I was reminded of War of the Roses. As shocked as I was at that movie's ending, I was even more shocked at this story's conclusion - mortified would be a better word to use because it means there will be another one of 'them' being part of the world.
B003O86FMW|5.0|\\"I really can't think about kissing when I've got a rebellion to incite.\\" -Katniss<br /><br />Such a great series. Hurry movie hurry.
B002NZK5TG|4.0|Yes the story is entertaining bought this for my grandson.  Why Is it necessary to include language?  It isn't bad but a bit over the top for a musical about a plant!  Buy it be careful and edit while watching.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Being an artist myself I enjoyed this book a lot.There is nothing new under the sun is a very true statement.we are all inspired by things that already exist.We take these ideas, and interpret them in our own way.<br /><br />  Austin Klein is a talented, and amusing author.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I love this series. This is the slowest book for me so far and they are introducing many new characters and I am dying to find out what happens next.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far I love it! The hidden object are hard enough to be a challenge but not enough to be frustrating. The mini-games are fun as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is a challenging and fun game that can be addictive! The puzzles can be frustrating but the reward is worth it!
B008469DGY|5.0|The controls and spinning maneuver is awesome,  easy to pick up and play! One suggestion, more courses! If you play this game, you should rate it!
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|I love this move. Very funny and just what every kid wishes is that he or she could suddenly be grownup and not have to wait the usual time
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use Facebook all the time and this will help me to use it on my Kindle to keep on on what is going on with my friends and family.
B0006GAOJA|5.0|This is such a great movie. It is story telling at its finnest.<br />I actually do no care about sports of any kind at all.<br /><br />There are so many small things that<br />render it outstanding<br />the black and whitness...........<br />all the blood...................................<br />not for the faint hearted or easily rattled but a<br />remarkable  film
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like using Google on my computor and like now on my Kindle.  It is easy to use and will make it easier to use my Kindle to search.
0823015017|5.0|I recommend the book which I was already familiar with before I purchased it.  Lindly Haunani is great with color and for myself, I will gradually work through the book. The book is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection that engages in any form of art that incorporates colors. I appreciate that Lindly Haunani took the time to put this together for the benefit of others.
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|This was surprisingly good, not for kids --F word used repeatedly, but had humor action and a story, if you are looking for an action adventure , with humor mixed in , good way to spend an evening with some friends
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It had good action and some surprises.  I liked the storyline.  Good movie.  Watch this movie.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I bought these a week ago and they are excellent headphones. The other reviews are right in that the highs on these things are very sharp at times. nothing an equalizer doesn't fix! They in my opinion compete with the Beats Studios and are a 10th of the cost. They are built fairly well and again for the price i could not ask more! Very pleased with this product, fairly comfortable, fits my large head very well, and sounds great!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Enjoyed this book tremendously and am now buying this book in paper back form for a friend.  She can't wait for it to arrive.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|There is a little problem with the special feature disc in the 45th anniversary Blu ray in this set under publicity a box pops up and is blank in face all the boxes under publicity are blank no names of the features  I don't know if its just my set or of there are more sets or Blu rays with this problem
B00C33M2EE|5.0|these guys are great musicians and very creative.  I would recomend this to anyone of who loves music no matter what their favorite genre is.  Great instrumentals
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written.  This book caught me quickly and I read it in a couple of days.  Has some interesting twists.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Well, it is all over.  I Wish she would have ended a few things differently.  All in all, it way okay.
B00640UICA|5.0|Got this as a free game of the day.  Well-made, kind of warms the cockles of your heart with the cutesy graphics and sounds. Good for several hours of solving fun, but once I beat it, that was it. No replay value for me. I'd say it's a dollar worth of fun per person that'll play it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love this story which follows an Afgan family and their relatives over a period of 50+ years. Hard to put down, I will read it more than once....
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app I have found. I have downloaded many and none of them are as nice and easy and as AccuWeather! It's easy to check quickly in the morning and that way you don't spend time waiting to hear the forecast
B00404YUG2|1.0|Writer should stick to writing and leave narration to professional voice artists. Voice of the narrator is horribly grating. Also I cannot play my discs on my disc player as all the CDs are actually MP3s! Not value for money.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Author writes with a lively style on a difficult subject.  Very accessible and informative.  I learned a lot of history I didn't know and I generally dislike non-fiction...but this was another story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome movie and comical! Also, the quality of the movie was great. You Can't go wrong watching movies on Amazon.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot.  Good beach read and great to share with a techy young person in your life.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this story. Superbly written with such a complex character that I cared for more and more as the story progressed.<br />Highly recommended!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I thought Coraline was scary. Fifteen more words are required for this review. Here are more words. And three more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was pretty easy to do but fun at the same time. Was nice to be able to finish but got out in about an hour or less.
B007SSF3O0|5.0|Excellent adaptation of Jane Austin's book. If you've seen Clueless you know the plot, but it's still fun and enjoyable.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was amazing, I loved it! It was juicy, funny, and mysterious all at once. I recommend it to whoever girl wants a good girly thriller. Nice job, Sara Shepard.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hard to stop watching but I am afraid it will never become happily ever after and I will just run out of steam.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|U aint gonna find no better app thia is yoshi and im sayin that u must get this games no regrets!!!!!! He actually talkes to u on the phone
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I was completely engrossed by the movie's story line, acting, special effects and music.  I rented the movie one night and found I couldn't get it out of my head for many days afterward.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it was captivating with just the right amount of action.  Everything appeared so real and the drones were down right creepy, especially with the sound effects they made at appropriate times.  I really enjoyed the nostalgic elements that keep Jack longing for days gone by, and the music that accompanied that stirred some memorable chords within me as well.<br /><br />This movie was so good that I felt compelled to watch it again a few days later.  I purchased rather than rented the second time, because I'm sure I'll be watching it again at a later date.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|i think the group took a very unique and different approach to the sound of voices and music, on the album and got a very, nice blend on each song.
0345472322|5.0|But now I will say, &#34;Wow, she worked really hard on this book, and it will make a difference in my life!&#34;
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Story has holes in it but considering the quality coming out of Hollywood lately it was a least entertaining. Morgan Freeman's part was small although his character still had a strong impact on the story.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Such an amazing TV series. I swear every season gets funnier and funnier. I absolutely love Sheldon Cooper. Penny is funny as well
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is a great read.  I would say that it is so compelling because Mr. Sledge did not overly dramatize the action and his involvement with that action.  War is hell and he reminds us that there is not a lot of glory when you are going through it.<br />I am very happy that the book was referenced in another piece I was reading and I decided to get it and read it.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|exactly what i was looking for, i will recommend to everyone. it works great for all of my sound needs.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Brandt Legg's \\"Outview\\" is the story of a teenager who learns that the world is not what it appears to be - and far more importantly, neither is he.<br /><br />Nate Ryder is having a difficult time; his father died when he was just 12, his relationship with his mother is strained, and his older brother is in a mental institution.  And then there are the \\"outviews\\" - Nathan's name for the strange visions - or full-blown hallucinations - he's experiencing.  With the help of his friends, Nate tries to figure out what's really happening to him, and how it might be connected to his brother, and possibly his father's death.  In the process, he discovers that what he's experiencing is part of something far larger that he could ever have imagined.<br /><br />The book is told in the first person, from Nate's point of view, and the author does a fantastic job getting into the head of a teenaged boy coming of age in the face of events and experiences that are pushing him to the limits of sanity.  The supporting characters are very well-drawn, and the relationships (especially between Nate and his brother) are believable and compelling.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Outview\\" is very well-written, and the expanding mystery at the heart of the story will keep you turning the pages.  It'll definitely have you ready to buy the sequel the minute you've finished.  I would absolutely recommend this book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book! It kept me on my toes the whole time. Would love to see a sequel put out!
B001NA6096|5.0|Incredibly thought-provoking and a great representation of humankind. Shows us what magic can happen when you meet someone and completely open up to them, with zero self-consciousness because you think you'll never see them again. The movie draws you into the conversation and makes you grow incredibly attached to the characters. Now that the trilogy is complete, it's impossible to stop after just this first one.
B008MM9630|5.0|It's a  fun game for children and adults. It's a game u can play for hours  it's and not get bored after awhile of  playing it.  It's a game you do not have spend money to get far in the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love is game on xbox360 if u play this game u will love it and will not stop plying it
B000QRIGLC|5.0|There are really no words to describe this book. You must read it. 99.99% of the entire world could try their whole lives and never muster the courage and bravery this team of seals exhibited. God bless them.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Phillips Gregory weaves history and fiction into a spellbinding story of power, intrigue, and love.  I would have loved another 500 pages. It was over too soon!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I would recommend this book to those people out there who like reading fiction books. This book never loses interest and is very mood-changing. This boom is definitely a 5 star.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Wouldn't we all love to have that Neve's board?<br />Dave put together a great movie.<br />Loved the line &#34;That's Carl F*&%^n' Perkins man!&#34;
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really good game always something to do.<br />New rooms are amazing to search especially when searching the rooms using a torch.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|I'm so sick of everyone reviewing this masterpiece and forgetting SPACE MONKEY. I admit the verse is not all that great but the chorus is so powerful. I'd  listen to the album from meds just to hear \\"we're sown together, she's born Mesmer. Beside, astride her. I die inside her\\" Best album since black market music.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a well written, engrossing story that paints a vivid picture of slave plantation life with the twist of a poor i orphaned irish immigrant in the mix. It seemed very realistic in the portrayl of the workings of the plantation right down to the menus.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is addicting. Each level gets a little harder, can't stop !  A great stress reliever. Everyone should give it a try!! Awesome pictures, lots of fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|overall a good fun game for the whole family gems are way too expensive. needs a help screen.  how does one earn gems without paying a fortune
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We were looking for a movie that our child would like as much as the lorax & Rio was the perfect choice, lots of bright colors and good music!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Anytime the Director ran out of ideas to advance the plot, he inserted yet another act of graphic violence.<br />These occur about every eight minutes throughout the film.<br />Even with all the violence, this ends up being one of the most all time boring movies I have ever seen.  Fans of Karl Urban will be especially disappointed, and annoyed, at how Mr. Urban is misused in this film.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|Hunger Games is a well written book with an intriguing story and well rounded characters. One of the many dystopian stories to hit the shelves it describes a dark world with a shining lead character who undergoes great odds to finally achieve in the end. It is exciting, with interesting twists and turns which kept me glued to pages throughout.<br />I recommended it to others who enjoyed it as much as I did. One of the classic good reads.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|Set in 2153, we are expected to believe that Matt Damon is the only non Latino still living in the Greater Los Angeles Basin.<br />The villains in this dreadful mess of a movie are all NON Latinos who speak English or French.  This strong thread of \\"Linguistic Apartheid\\" was very disturbing to me.<br /><br />It appears to me that the message being made here is  that LA area has been turned on hell on earth because unrestricted Latinos were allowed to move there. This seems very racist to me.<br /><br />This is not a movie, it is a political statement. A very disturbing and not even remotely entertaining political statement
B000FBJG04|5.0|Very well written as everything is by Stephen. This book should be required reading in school History classes! This generation should know what the cost of their freedom was and what these boys had to go through. The &#34;tough&#34; kids of today don't know what tough really is. &#34;tough&#34; melts away the first time you're shot at by the enemy and you watch your buddy get blown away next to you.<br />A must read for anyone interested in WW II.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I enjoy this very much I've only played solo but can't wait to play multiplayer great overall, love the trickster class but anyway it's awesome totally recommended!!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is real life and what can happen and the circumstances behind it. I could not put this down! Teaches you what money can and can't buy. The Author touches on compassion, anger and depression of several lives involved in an accident.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|I bought this as a gift and will keep buying gifts because of the good condition that it was in thank you
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Lots of fun.  Even though there's not much said between the star crossed lovers in the beginning the movie does a great job in creating the connection and building a relationship between the 2 main characters.  Best zombie love story ever!
1451695195|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book but just about gave up on it in the first chapters.  There was way too much about the writer's education in the beginning and boring technical jargon close to the end.  I wanted him to TRY to describe what he saw instead of saying it couldn't be described.  I enjoyed the parts about his biological family...especially his sister...but wouldn't recommend the book to anyone.  Sorry
0307276902|3.0|I have no real qualms with this book other than the deception of calling it a memoir. Part of the appeal of reading a memoir is trusting that the author is being honest and forthcoming with his account. I knew when I began reading this book that it was exaggerated but while I was reading I found myself unable to believe most of it had even happened. It just smacked of fiction. It seemed unrealistic in parts, and I felt the misuse of the label &#34;memoir&#34; was highly ironic considering how much Frey cites honesty/accountability as being crucial parts of healing from addiction in the book. The eclectic and chaotic writing style was compelling, and I felt easy to read but if you're looking for an accurate, believable memoir of addiction I wouldn't read this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great read. I would highly recommend it to young adults or adults. It is a story that captures you early on and keeps you racing through. It has a story that really makes you think about others emotions and teaches quite a bit about accepting people you don't understand.
B004UPANAI|3.0|Kind of a disappointment.  Very cheesy at times, which is too bad since this could have neen much better.  That said, I'm a Marvel junky, and will probably watch it again anyway.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Lots of action but its just ok.  It went by very quickly so that was good. Not a lot of plot build up of the characters.
1781162646|4.0|The woman on the cover caught my eye. The story at an amusement park brought back memories of my childhood. Stephen King put his own spin on it--a murder at the park. I enjoyed the book very much. The murderer was not the one I expected at all. I recommend this book for its good story and the behind-the-scenes at an amusement park.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|It's a Bruce Willis Die Hard movie. A bit over the top but they seem to get that way with each one.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|If you haven't watched it yet, then you have no idea what you are missing. Everything about this show is incredible.
0064471837|5.0|I really love 'Sabriel', and all the Old Kingdom stories. They became an instant favourite if mine when I first read 'Sabriel' at 14, and have stayed among my favourites ever since (so much so that I wrote a whole dissertation for my literature degree on the Abhorsen trilogy and others). Therefore I can heartily recommend these books, and everyone I gave them to read to agreed. A great YA fantasy, especially also for girls, because nix expertly creates a world without gender bias where the young women of the stories are never restricted to the passive fairy-tale princess, waiting for her prince to come along, but go out and do all the fighting and adventuring themselves.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The subject says it all, this book reads very well and despite having seen the series several times through still really enjoy the novel.  Extra details and character internal dialogues add to the story.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I've followed this band since they appered on the sene in Seattle. I saw them on a local show called REV (predates Mtv) and have been a fan ever since. This album revisits the the things that made them great, however with a fresh spin on their craft that results in the best album they've made in years.
B005VPRG10|5.0|This toy is now $39, which is less than we paid--a good price.  My 10-year old son really likes it. He says, \\"It's really fun to build.  It comes with a death star trooper, a tie fighter, an imperial officer, and an R-2 unit. It has two missiles under the cockpit.  The only problem is the wings fall off sometimes when you're playing with it.\\"
B008JFUO36|4.0|Good movie visually fresh. I do like this type of character driven science fiction where the technology is treated as every day life.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this for my wife and she likes it a lot. it was fairly simple to set up using a tablet and a smart TV. The unit comes with a usb cable, as well as an AC power cord.
B004R63MWQ|3.0|Best thing about it is CGI with Jeff Bridges.  A bit boring same monotonous black and white throughout.  I would have rather watched &#34;The Lawnmower man&#34;.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Warning this game can be addicting for the whole family to play. It is beautifully created just like the movies. The only thing I don't like is it is overly sensitive to touch and keeps offering me to buy more acorns or download more games. I wish there was an undo button!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good game.  Lots of fun. Even for older people. Some glitches but they usually get them worked out in reasonable time. Dino world sucks though.
B005ZUR724|4.0|it is a fun game no doubt. for 7 bucks its def worth the buy.runs smooth without any pro lens on my kindle fire.I'm a world of warcraft player and there are a lot of similarities.the gfx are good as well.I can spend hours playing these kind of games but it being a game for ios or kindle you have to tire your hands out lol. I do re commend if u like mmorpgs.thumbs up.
B0031OCY2E|5.0|I saw this one years ago and had to buy it for our friends to see. I did not remember the exact story and was surprised to find my memory of the story was a little different..  Age takes the blame again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A bit disjointed but an intriguing read would have liked to have seen the main female character developed more a cop out finish
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great movie, Can't wait to see the next one in the theaters now. Cast is very well put together. Script is also outstanding.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|This book is a sea change, an absolute breakthrough that brings the reader to a whole new level of awareness.  It is a classic.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Amazing blue ray. I apprecite the cheap price Amazon, and i apprecite the quick delivery. I miss the original Actor for sparticus, but the show must go on.
0061537969|1.0|This was one of the most depressing and illogical books that I have ever read.  I have read many books that I have not liked, but this one takes the cake.  Not only was the story so depressing it was just cruel.  Beyond the depressing mood of the book, it was poorly written with little character development.  All references to racing seemed illogical and disconnected from the storyline.  Additionally, I feel that the use of a dog as a narrator only detracted from the story and made no sense, and I am the type of person to read a book just because there is a dog on the cover!<br /><br />Save your time, money, and the emotional strain that this book causes!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|It is amazing how much world Sanderson can fit into such a thin book. I hope someday he returns to this world, I would love to read a full length novel, or trilogy, set here. I think this just may have replaced Warbreaker as my favorite Sanderson book!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Extremely riveting and  totally character driven! Don't be fooled, without any action at all,  suspense builds and carries you away into the plot, reflective of the 1920s, where you find yourself rooting for one of few characters who undoubtedly steals the spotlight. A must see for hopeless romantics in every aspect of film!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I was really tired of the time it took for my standard USB style charger to fully charge my tablet.  This cable is the best!  It charges much quicker............
0679890475|5.0|When I saw this title I knew I must have been read this book as a child.  When I received it and read the book and saw the illustations it all came back to me.  In great condition.  Very pleased.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|The book is good, it makes you think on a different way on how the life has gone on a certain way to some people. Helps you to understand and accept what you are living, and try to identify the causes that could help you.<br /><br />Is written on an easy way that is easy to understand, and puts a lot of stories together in order to show the point.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love all Mahjong games but this one is obviously so appropriate for this time of year! For me it's rather a mood lifter...sea shells, pails and shovels, beach balls. It's just a real nice, seasonal game to play.
0316113514|5.0|As a dietitian and diabetes educator i find this book a wonderful tool to encourage exercise.<br />Helping people struggle with food as a type of addiction is so true and can be managed and helped with exercise. Love his work from way back with Driven to Distraction.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Great, entertaining movie and a good gift for my husband.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My preteen son likes this game as a way to distract himself while taking long cartrips. He says it has lots of features that the free version does not have and moves smoother than the free version. It has helped end the &#34;Are we there yet&#34; question when we take long car trips.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Amazing read!! What a fantastic learning experience and a lovely, unexpected love story. This book was glued to my hands! Must read!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|A complete waste of time, & a huge battery killer! And I wasn't able to get weather info for our area.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I thought it had too many characters and jumped around too much.  Had hard time keeping up who was who.  I did like how<br />it ended though.
B00122EX4Y|5.0|A great compilation of music for anytime of the day. Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris sing well together. The album is priced very reasonable.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very thorough and informative.  Although I was well aware of the consequences of ingesting gluten this made it perfectly clear to steer CLEAR of gluten/wheat!!!
B0044IABFS|5.0|It's hard to keep my interest the whole way through but I just had to watch every single episode because I was scared to miss any detail. Loved it the whole way through!
B00D7JGL36|3.0|i thought it would be more instruments and not so much singing. at least that was what our paper implied.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a amazing show! The characters are so well developed, crazy plot twists all over though! Can't wait for more!
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Not a film to watch when you need cheering up. More of a rainy day Sunday afternoon movie. Suggest  a good bowl of ice cream with it.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Katy Perry has a great voice and her music always keeps me singing along. Great for jamming out. This is a awesome album.
B008200LHW|3.0|I bought this GPS receiver trying to use my computer as my personal GPS using google maps, my mistake was that I didn't think that google maps depends on the internet connection so I can't use this feature on my car. I couldn't think on any other use for this unit so I returned it.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Cute combo of samurai and zombie... lots of fun and pretty well balanced.  The boss is tough though.  I enjoyed it a lot. Best towers version I've seen.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|lots like battlefeeld. game is the bizomb. Multilanguage multinational multimedia not into not freak deeky. this game is pimpin. a d i mean ds rootblissssss bomb. like thst good ass h downdown yabheard son
B003CHGV74|5.0|I am hooked!!!  This has been a great show and I often watch more than one episode a day. Looking forward to more exciting episodes.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|The only thing that I can say is...I can't wait to see the sequela!!! Amazing effects and a great story, plus it has a great quality in the cast crew
B0018QQQK8|4.0|She liked the book and loved the movie.  As a parent, it was enjoyable and suitable for a young teen.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Great visually but lacked substance, never really drew me in. Kept forgetting what the story was about but decaprio did a good job acting.
B00DB624GS|5.0|I just received the Japanese SHM-CD of Then Play on. I cannot attest to other reviewers complaints about the sound quality as I have not heard the Rhino remaster. I also have not heard previous CD releases of this title as I have never owned it on CD. I did have an original vinyl in 1970. The Japanese issue sounds good to me. I have listened to it on my home system and I think it sounds very good. I do not detect the hiss that was previously mentioned on Oh Well but my CDs know better than to hiss at me. One thing that is different is the Rhino remaster has the original UK running order. The Japanese version has the revised US running order from November of 1969. The US album was revised to accommodate Oh Well which was a popular radio play here in '69-'70. It does not contain the bonus tracks from the Rhino release either. I do not know if this is a remaster as my Japanese is not good but it sounds good even if it's not remastered. I also received the other 6 Japanese titles. beside Then Play On I have only listened to Kiln House. Again, I have never owned this on CD but I think the sound quality is very satisfactory. I am sure that these sound better than their US counterparts which I believe have not been touched since their digital debuts in the late 80's or early '90s. Then Listen On.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|Great picture. Clear. Really good.have seen it several times and it is still a good movie. Don't forget be see it again.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show. Excellent series...Must Watch. Amazon Prime Video Service is the best..Quality is excellent. 5 Stars. Best motorcycle Gang show ever made.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Some folks really dislike the breaking away from the original tale that is being done in the Hobbit. However, having read some of the other tales of Middle Earth not in the LOTR and Hobbit, I can see what they are trying to do and I believe they are honorably bending the tale to merge it with the original film triad.<br /><br />Liberties may be being taken but they are strengthening the tale for those who are not book readers and yet in a way that should they read the books will be able to love the books just as much, if not even more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of the arcade down the Shore that we went to when I was a kid. Easy for all age levels. Addictive and fun. Highly recommend.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|How I appreciate heros and father figures that are not turned into foolish doofises. Ralph is worth cheering for and the old school gamer in me loved the &#34;world&#34; he existed in.
1401234542|5.0|Intro: first of all johns is great almost in anything that he does (i hated brightest day as there was no gl story really) from superman, to gl fantastic run and even aquaman!<br />If you have never read gl don't start here. Start from the beginning. The mythology johns has created is top notch! Reading comics for more than 30 years and seeing the comics code of authority absence leaving so much stupidity in todays comics its really difficult to read something good.<br />Here the story evolves even more and even though the art is not as detailed as that of reis it is really good and flows like a movie! If you liked the previous stuff don't stop now.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|As an adult, I enjoyed it very much! The movie was for me not a child and it gave me lots of laughter with out feeling I needed a kid in the room to watch it. My intelligence was not abused nor were my eyes and ears assaulted with &#34;adult&#34; content.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Okay, first the birds, then the temple, now this?  I love the free version, played til I got 3 stars on all the games in the 4 Dragon levels.  Paid a buck for this one because I wanted MORE and you get plenty more games with this one. I like the tiles from this game, for some odd reason. And I like the sounds when you make a match.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it. It was so sad, but I couldn't put it down. I even got my friend to read it!
B00DXP0QX0|3.0|A good friend would always opine that the Guinness you get in America would remind you of real Guinness.<br />This is certainly not a 5 star release, nor is it it a two star release, so I'll run down the lane of mediocrity here and paraphrase my friend: This would remind you of the real Rod. And maybe that would be a good thing for RS to know and embrace as well. You can toss nearly everything he's done since Atlantic Crossing into one of 2 files: bad taste or smarmy. And it was never as though he were the second coming of Howlin Wolf. All the same, he was a lot of fun back in the day, and if you simply time froze the recordings from Truth to Never a Dull (which actually had a few dull), you'd be hard pressed to reconcile those with the poseur prancing through every bad idea from disco thru the sorta great american songbook (esplain me what's so great about that stuff).<br />This collection is fun to listen to, of no real consequence, but it does remind you that when you went to see him live with some mash up of Faces, the man could carry a show and tap something primal. A nod was as good as a wink back then. So, this is sort of a nostalgia trip back to when he was working out what it meant to be the genuine article. I listen to it and smile wistfully.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This movie is almost 20 years old and it still doesn't lose its charm! You could show this movie to a person who has never seen it before and they would never guess that it was made in 1994. It is that good! I don't think there could have been a better casting job on this movie, every actor/actress performed their characters roll extremely well. The top two performances IMO are Brandon Lee and Michael Wincott. Brandon did excellent as the Crow and Michael was the perfect villan boss as Top Dollar. With a dark, B&W comic book feel to it, The Crow is one of the best revenge movies ever made. It is definitly one of my favorite movies!<br /><br />In Detroit on Devils night, the night before Halloween, the city becomes a playground for arsons, thugs, and criminals as they run rampant throughout the city unleashing their evil and carnage upon anything and everything. Eric Draven and his fiancee Shelly Webster fall victim on this night in their apartment to a gang of thugs. Eric was shot and thrown from his window on the top floor of the building and Shelly was raped and beaten to a pulp, both of them died from their injuries. Two people who loved each other dearly and couldn't be happier had everything tragically taken away from them the day before they were to marry. They say sometimes when a tragedy is so severe, the crow carrying the soul of the departed returns the soul so that they may put the wrong things right.<br /><br />Eric comes back one year later crawling out of his grave guided by the crow. Discovering his newly inherited powers, Eric, with the help of the crow, sets out to find the thugs who robbed him of his life to return the favor. Starting with Tin-Tin, one of the guys who murdered him and his fiancee, he begins his quest for revenge, working his way from man to man until there is one left. However, Eric soon discovers that the city's top criminal kingpin has the last man in his custody as it turns out that the gang works for him and he was the one who gave the green light for the murder of him and Shelly. So Eric now has to deal with a criminal druglord and all of his minions. Even with the power of the Crow, will it be enough?...<br /><br />This is tied with another movie for my favorite movie of all time. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking it was the coolest movie ever! The only thing bad about this movie is that it was Brandon Lee's last movie as there was a tragic accident while making this movie that cost Lee his life. This movie was really close to being scrapped, but Eliza, Brandon's fiancee, gave her blessings to have them finish the movie knowing that Brandon would of want it that way. So at the beginning of the movie is a tribute for Brandon and Eliza. Some say it was the curse of the Lee family, First Bruce Lee and then his son Brandon, but I think that is ridiculous. They also done well to finish the movie with movie magic as it wasn't quite finish yet after the death of Brandon. So overall this movie has alot going for it and if you have never seen the Crow before, you're in for a real nice treat!ight for the murder of him and Shelly.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|There is a significant drop-off in suspense and action with this episode of the Reacher Chronicles. In light of past adventures, the story does not fair well. It comes across as something that could have been very exciting, but devolves into a very cliche' and average story. The story was so unbelievable as to be silly.<br /><br /> If this were a $2.99 kindle book, it would have added a star. As it stands, this is a full-cost &#34;best seller&#34; book and should be graded accordingly. For detailed reviews, I would suggest looking at some of the other 2 and 3-star reviews. Many of them hit the nail right on the head!<br /><br />Oddly, I enjoyed the &#34;bonus&#34; story better than the main story. It was fast and caught my attention.

B0009UC810|5.0|This movie is an all time classic. My family and I quote it all the time. This addition also came with some behind the scenes and interviews that we really enjoyed.
0142419400|5.0|I have read this book five times now, yes 5, and it has somehow gotten better each time I pick it up. There is something about this story that just makes me feel good and. Find myself going back to it again and again. It gives me this feeling of peace that is hard to describe. Between the friendships, the relationships and the back drop of Paris it transports me to a very happy place that I don't seem to want to leave or forget.<br /><br />The book is about Anna, a girl from Atlanta, that is forced to go to Paris for her last year of high school. Not knowing the language or anyone at her new school Anna is left alone and missing her best friend Bridgette and her crush that was possibly turning into something more, Toph. She is surrounded by unfamiliar everything and all she wants to do is go back to the safety of Atlanta. And then her next door neighbor Meredith takes her in and introduces her to her friends and the one boy that changes everything, St. Clair. Etienne St. Clair, the boy dreams are made of. All of a sudden France isn't so bad. Pretty soon Anna has a life in France and friends, Meredith, Josh, Rashmi and St. Clair. They break Anna out of her shell and comfort zone and show her Paris isn't so bad. And when things start to get complicated at home Anna wants nothing more then to retreat back to the place she had been desperate to escape, back to St. Clair. Too bad there are two problems with this. She is not only head over heels in love with him but he has a girlfriend.<br /><br />I honestly don't know how to even begin to describe Anna and Etienne's relationship. It is so perfectly crush worthy, adorable that I'm not sure I can give it justice. I mean reading about these two made me crave that feeling you get when you have an honest to God crush. The anticipation you feel when you see that crush was the feeling I got with every page I turned and Anna and St. Clair went from buddies to Anna and Etienne, maybe more then buddies, to Anna and St. Clair thatwon't cross any lines to Anna and Etienne the couple crazy about each other. Every emotion they felt, every conflict of uncertainty that was there I felt too and that made the characters and this couple in particular a work of greatness. And the way that Perkins showed cased Anna's feelings, towards this boy that had her all over the place,  by having Anna call him St. Clair and Etienne was just masterful and the perfect way to describe their ever changing relationship.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins wrote an amazingly superb book about figuring out what you want out of life, dealing with crushes and relationships and knowing what is worth it. Truthfully I will never accurately describe the amazingness of this book and the feelings it gives me. It is pretty impossible to put into words. Maybe the fact that I have read it 5 times in less then 3 years will help. Haha. A definite must read...at least once.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|I loved the Lord of the Ring series and was thrilled that they were finally doing the Hobbit. I love the music for the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit falls into the same category.
0061978078|5.0|Seldom is there a book that I am so excited for I run out to purchase it the day it's released. And rarely does that book live up to my expectation. It is like that movie that people tell you over and over to see that gets built up in your head and then after you see it, total disappointment. It has happened to me before and it will happen again so I was worried about Pandemonium. Did I put too much stock into it? Would it be a \\"sophomore\\" slump sp to speak? With the amazingness of Delirium it had pretty big shoes to fill. Well, Pandemonium filled those shoes and more! It was absolutely everything I wanted it to be an more! It hit all the points I was hoping for, had the growth in the character of Lena that I was looking for and yet left me aching for more, more, more. It did EXACTLY what the second part of this sure to be amazing trilogy was supposed to do; it left me wanting the final piece of the story.<br /><br />Pandemonium starts off with Lena and where she is now. It has been months since she climbed the fence, months since she watched Alex get shot to save her and she is now part of the resistance. She is undercover in New York doing what she can to help save people from the procedure and to open their eyes like hers were. She has obviously been through a lot since we last saw her, and through a series of Then and Now chapters we get to see what Lena's life is like now and what it was like when she was in the Wilds. As readers we are taken on a journey of Lena learning how to fend forever herself and how to trust people she doesn't know all while burying the emotions of the past and trying to forget Alex, Hana and Grace. We learn how she got to where she is and what leaving everything behind has done to her.<br /><br />Because the thing is, Lena Holoway is not the same girl we knew in Delirium. She is this new person that has to deal with that age old saying...\\"it is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all\\". Lena has loved. She loved with everything she could and then she lost it all and everything she knew in one split second. That love was taken from her and so was her right to choose and that changes a person. You see, there was no way for Lena to stay the same. Her eyes were opened by Alex and once that happened she couldn't go back. Lena had to accept how things are and learn to adapt. The thing is in order to do that she has to push down a tiny piece of herself.<br /><br />Really it was brilliantly done. The changes in Lena are so subtle, but noticeable. She is no longer the girl that isn't anything special. She isn't the girl that is hiding behind her pretty best friend. She is the girl that Alex brought to light, that he taught to fight for her right to choose. She is braver and stronger and aware. She stands taller and swears and thinks things through instead of being told what to do. Like it says in Pandemonium, she was reborn the day she went over the fence and there is no past.<br /><br />Honestly the whole book was just magical. Right down to the page turning, cliffhanger of an ending. I knew Oliver was going to do it, leave us hanging on for more. I just knew it and yet I was sad, happy, annoyed and anxious when I got to the final page. I wanted to throw the book and laugh all at the same time. Instead I just ended up smiling for a very very long time and I still can't get the book out of my head. It has only been a couple of days since I read it and I'm already dreaming of a re-read. And that right there is a true testament to the power of her words and a book that will end up being timeless.<br /><br />There is really a ton of things I can say about Pandemonium. I can go into a ton of details about what the Wilds were like for Lena, the people she encounters, the circumstances that are thrust upon her, and the connections she makes(whether romantic or not), but I just can't. It would give away too much and you would miss out on a remarkable story. Just do yourself a favor. I know you may or may not know me, but trust me on this...pick up both books, Delirium and Pandemonium if you haven't already. In my heart of hearts I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000F8O35U|2.0|Got the DVD for my granddaughters they have a Samsung Blu-ray player it will play a little bit then it stops working.  It plays on other DVD players and it works fine little expensive for product that doesn't work.
0062014536|5.0|I was lucky and got to read this early thanks to a friend. To say I devoured it would be a huge understatement.  I read the whole book in probably less than 8 hours and it has taken me 3 months to get my thoughts on paper, 3 months to realize it is over, 3 months to accept that Lena's story is done.  Why has it taken me so long? Truth: I'm devastated it's over. I loved this series with everything I have and when I turned that last page and read those last words I was slightly heartbroken because it was an ending. Lauren Oliver had crafted such a deep, emotionally story for these characters and I was sad to see them go. From the first page of Delirium to the last page of Requiem I was invested and to say goodbye was hard. But every good beginning must have an end and I'm thrilled to say I'm happy that Requiem was that end.<br /><br />Much like Delirium we get to see both Lena and Hana's lives, but this time from both girl's eyes and not just from Lena's perspective. Both girls have chosen different paths in their lives and that is evident almost immediately because neither one of them is the same girl they were at the beginning of the series. Lena is much harder than she was. She has seen things she never imagined she would back in the days she was with Alex. She has had her heart broken and has been thrown for a loop. She feels things more than she ever could have imagined when she left Portland. And then you have Hana. Hana has been living a loveless life in Portland with guilt slowly eating her alive. Once full of life and energy Hana is now a drone fighting her natural urge to feel things. She is torn and restless and yearns for the life that she could have had. Both girls are in two different places in their lives but suddenly on the same path which is about to coverage right while a war is about to begin and everything is about to change.<br /><br />Amazing really. Requiem is an amazing ending to an amazing series. Each book gave me a different feeling when I was reading it and I think the anxious feeling I got from Requiem was appropriate. It was more action packed and tense then the other two books, but had a deep level of emotion as well. I completely understood Lena's motives and Hana's feelings(or lack there off) and why it led each of them to take the actions they did. Lena was stronger than she ever was and Hana was the weak one which in reality was always the case no matter how it appeared. The dynamic between both girls was really spot on.<br /><br />What I really loved about this book was how you could see the complete growth and maturity of Lena. Oliver managed to show how she became a woman in a subtle yet blatantly apparent way and that was a highlight of this final book. Gone was the uncertain Lena with the school girl like crush on Alex and the envious feelings about her best friend's life. She did what few others had done, she ran and stood up for what she believed in and she was a better person for it.<br /><br />Bravo Lauren Oliver for opening my eyes to this world and thank you for letting me spend time with these amazing creations. Much like I felt reading that final word, I leave with a smile on my face and tear in my eye.as reading it and I think the anxious feeling I got from Requiem was appropriate.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy the excellent combination of character building with real-life &#34;meaty&#34; issues dealt with in the legal system as it is portrayed by the cast and producers of &#34;The Good Wife&#34;.
0061726834|5.0|To say I loved this book would be a huge understatement.  As many can attest I have suggested and pushed this book on any and everyone I encounter.  I've suggested it to friends, acquaintances and co-workers, some fans of YA literature and dystopian stories and some not.  I have legitimately pushed this book on everyone I know.  Why you may ask? Because it is that freaking good!  And you know what gets me the most now that I have read it twice? I almost didn't know it was so good because I almost didn't read it.<br /><br />Before this book I was one of those people that wouldn't read anything that was out of the realm of reality.  If it isn't something that sound plausible in real life then it was not going to end up on my to- read shelf.  I had successfully dodged the whole vampire phenomenon and managed not to ever pick up a book about magic.  Not my scene, not my thing. But after much pushing from a friend I caved and gave it a shot.  Did I think outlawing love was possible? Not so much, but I figured what the heck, I'll go for it.  And let me tell you, Lauren Oliver made a believer out of me.<br /><br />At first glance you read the description and think okay, straight up dystopian story.  Different world, different laws, different time. The United States is completely different. There are borders surrounding it with fences, there is less electricity, not as many cars on the road, less spending. It is a completely made up world at first glance and I guess partly you would be right to think that.  But there is so much more to it then just another dystopian once you get to the core of the story. There is heart and angst and a journey of self discovery hidden in this \\"make believe\\" world.  It isn't just a story or an alternate reality, it is really a story about a girl that is faced with a truth she never wanted to see and the choices she makes because of it even if it is the opposite of everything she has grown being taught.<br /><br />Delirium is a story about Lena, an orphaned girl, living with her aunt in Portland, ME.  She is 17 and counting down the days until her 18th birthday so she can get the procedure done that will cure her of the disease, deliria nervosa, we are all born with.  It will cure her of love. In her short 17 years all she has seen is the destruction love can bring and she wants to forget. She wants to be cured so she can get a free slate and not have to remember what life was like when she felt loved by her mother. She doesn't want to have to worry that the disease will get her too. But what both Lena and the government don't realize is love isn't something you need to be cured from, it is something that makes you strong, something that heals instead of heeds you.  Well at least Lena didn't realize it until she met Alex.<br /><br />Alex. What does one say about Alex?! A seemingly normal boy, no different really then a boy in any other book and yet there is something special about him. He is by far one of the best characters I have ever read about. He sees things that others don't see, been through things that he shouldn't have dealt with at his age and yet he believes in love and the power it has.  He believes in Lena and by doing so changes everything Lena thought she wanted, thought she believed in.  He shows her a new world with touching and feeling and laughing and happiness, but he does it in a way that allows her to slowly accept it. He doesn't push or force her to disbelieve everything she was taught and thought was fact. He shows her the world as he sees and, the world he lives in and by doing that he changes Lena as a person and together they become what the meaning of love is truly about.<br /><br />Honestly there really aren't enough words in the English language to aptly explain the beauty of this book.  It encompasses so much more then your typical love story.  Oliver truly has written an epic story of beauty and wonder and awe and love. It changed me in the best of ways and I will push forpeople to read this book for as long as I can because it is that amazing. Please don't be like I was in the beginning and almost miss out on a true work of art.

1250012570|5.0|You killed me Rainbow Rowell, completely killed me with this book. It was fun and light hearted and deeply sad and broke my heart and made me laugh. I felt a plethora of emotions and it is completely your fault. The story of Eleanor and Park was magical and real and deeply emotional. Did I cry? No, but I did feel all the feels because really, there is no way you can't.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is a story about 2 teenagers in 1986. Eleanor is the new girl, and everyone makes sure she remembers it when she arrives on the bus to school on her first day. Tormented by the kids on the bus she finds herself sharing a seat with Park, a kid that seems to keep to himself. Angered at first that he has to share his sit with this crazy new girl Park plans to ignore her and go on with his life as a misfit that still manages to fit in. But as the school year draws on, Eleanor and Park can help but lean on each other and become something neither one expected...love.<br /><br />Gah, it still breaks my heart thinking about these two poor kids. And that right there says something. That says that these are two fantastic characters if I'm still sad about their circumstances and how things played out.  And I think that is why Rowell is getting all the accolades she has been about this book. And honestly, she deserves them. Eleanor and Park are fantastic characters and they are the reason this book is such a success with just about everyone that reads it, if not everyone. Because the thing about these two teens are how real they are. How you feel what they feel. How it brings you back to that feeling of first love, of having a crush, of not knowing how to act or what to say or what to do.  Here you have these two people that are just so opposite of each other in almost every way from their appearances, to their clothing choices, to their home lives, and yet they find each other and something just fits no matter how much they tried to pretend it didn't. And watching them navigate though not only typical teen problems, but deep problems at home really got to me as a reader.<br /><br />Rowell managed to pull me in with page one and never let go. I took this journey with these characters and never looked back and I would do it again even knowing how much emotions it touches. For those of you that have heard of this book and are scared to read it because of all the chatter about it, you my friend are missing out.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I sincerely hope the execs that canned this after a single season were fired for stupidity. This is one of the best Sci-Fi series I've ever seen. Stargate SG-1 is our favorite, followed by Chuck, and now Firefly. The plots and characters are original, engaging and well developed. It draws you in, and by the end of most episodes I'm thinking, &#34;Wait that's it? Pop in the next DVD&#34;. It's a bit like Wild West meets Star Trek, but a lot more believable and a lot less cheesy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story lines and characters...with the exception of two major characters dying this season...wont say who in the event you havent seen it!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Great songs, listened to them on youtube first before the album was taken down so I know I'm getting a quality album. Only thing that's bugging me right now is that it's not transferring into my cloud player,so I don't suggest you buy it here online if you're expecting instant streaming like I thought.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|They ruined the Mandarin character for fear of a backlash in the important Chinese movie market.<br /><br />The plot is pretty generic and bland.<br /><br />Any character that isn't Tony Stark is a cardboard cutout.<br /><br />CGI is good but could be better.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is still an amazing actor and a perfect Tony Stark.<br /><br />Worth renting or watching on TV.
B0038AUY96|2.0|Jo Nesbo seems compelled to add complication after complication to his plots - finally one gets the feeling that he's just filling out the novel. I stopped reading this 3/4 of the way through. There's also a compulsion to veer frequently in the direction of soft porn which eventually becomes wearisome. Henning Mankell is much more gripping, and, it strikes me, much more an 'honest' writer.
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|While not perfect this is a very fun movie with good characters, neat story and very beautiful and creative environment and creature designs.<br /><br />The CGI is pretty good and the story pace is enjoyable.<br /><br />We laughed a lot while watching it. The Croods is a great family movie.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I like the concept, but I think this book could have been half the size and just as effective.  I did learn from it, but there were too many story examples for my taste.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|While the scholarship behind this book is impeccable, it is never dry or boring to read. I was at least vaguely familiar with most of the names and incidents involved; the book brought all of those things into perspective. The author cuts through layers of myth and wishful thinking to reveal a very human, engaging, and compelling figure who refused to pander to morally-bankrupt power and instead fought to bring justice to the oppressed. Many will take offense at this characterization, preferring to consider Jesus as a superhuman who was able to do things that we could never do (thus relieving us of the obligation to try.) Others will take it as a challenge to look beyond their own selfish interests in order to work to make the world a better place for their having been here.
0064471837|4.0|I have often found re-reading favorite teenage books to be a disappointing event. Many of the books I enjoyed when I was younger seem shallow and poorly written to my (hopefully!) more mature self, and most end up in my give-away pile leaving me disillusioned with my long-held fond memories of it. \\"Sabriel\\" is one of the few books that has held up. My first reading of \\"Sabriel\\" was about fourteen years ago when I was a young teenager. The book resonated with me; it was darker than most of the other books sitting on the young adult shelves, Sabriel was a heroine I admired, and I was especially amused by Mogget. Today I remain charmed, and amused, by \\"Sabriel.\\"<br /><br />One of the reasons \\"Sabriel\\" held up while other books disappointed is that the book is well-written. Nix's world is interesting-  mixing modern society with more traditional, \\"old fashioned,\\" fantasy elements-  his magic system is unique, and his writing is descriptive without falling into purple prose.  The characters in \\"Sabriel\\" have fully rounded personalities with their own strengths and their weaknesses, and their relationships have different degrees of complexity, especially the relationship between Sabriel and Mogget. Nix's plot is tight- it does not linger too long on things that are not important to the overall story, and objects that are important at the climax of the story do not suddenly appear out of thin air, instead they are introduced earlier, thankfully avoiding the always popular (and always unsatisfying) deus-ex-machina.<br /><br />In \\"Sabriel\\" Nix avoids the main pitfalls of today's young adult fantasy, especially the YA books aimed at girls. In those the fantasy is a side element to the real focus of the story- the romance between the protagonist and a guy who is, without fail, really hot and really rich. This is not to say there is not an element of romance to \\"Sabriel,\\" there is, and the guy is, in fact, pretty good looking and pretty rich (he's a king after all), however, that is really a side element to the over-all plot, and Nix does not go on and on about it. Touchstone's looks and position are an element of his character, not his whole character. The same can be said about Sabriel. While Touchstone thinks she is beautiful, being good-looking is not Sabriel's whole personality, nor is she given Mary-Sueish powers, instead she has to use her mind as well as her magic, and even then she suffers loss as well as triumph.<br />With strong writing and engaging characters \\"Sabriel\\" is a book that is appealing to young-adults, but it also has the strength to be both interesting and meaningful for those who have passed out of their teenage years.at is really a side element to the over-all plot, and Nix does not go on and on about it.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another brilliant, sexy book by Sylvia! The characters grew so much and we got to learn more and more about  their secret pasts. Gideon finally opening up and Eva finally acting like the woman I'd hoped she'd be instead of the bratty rich girl she was turning into. The book was so vividly written and each detail was laid out perfectly. I fell head over heels for the characters all over again and I can't wait to see what steamy plots she has up her sleeve. Bravo Sylvia Day!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Truthfully, I don't remember reading this book because I went through the series so quickly. City of Ashes is wonderful and keeps the suspense and laughs flowing throughout the series. Where a lot of 2nd books fall short or fall victim to the &#34;sophomore slump&#34; in a series, this blends itself well into a greater project.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Very fun to play i enjoyed it alot. Easy and entertaining. A good way to spend some free time alpne
B001NLL93W|5.0|With a new twist on the series, Cassandra Clare keeps the pages turning in The Mortal Instruments Series. The characters continue to grow and develop and at the end, you'll be satisfied, but still want more!
B000HZM4FW|4.0|Excellent film.  Only down side is that the ending is a little gross.  But overall, an excellent movie.  I'm sure I will watch it again.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|As a &#34;grown up,&#34; I often catch myself gravitating toward YA books. The Mortal Instruments series is wonderful and City of Bones, the first book, is fantastic! It's gripping enough to keep the pages turning (and quickly I might add), but also explains enough so you're not lost in this new world of Shadowhunters and Downworlders.<br /><br />Great characters, exciting events, and multiple perspectives make this book unique and fun.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book is an amazing tale of resilience and redemption.  If I am ever incarcerated, I will fear the system, not the inmates.  This woman achieved more personal growth from a year in prison than most people achieve with a lifetime of good luck.  She seemed to lose her capacity for hate rather than increase it.  But the cold emptiness of our prison system horrified me.  Is it any wonder that people are so much worse off when they finally get out?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love using Kindle on my Android because I can take it anywhere. It is invaluable why waiting in a doctors  office
B004GYY714|4.0|I had to hunt around a bit to find the live program I was looking for - it's not obvious. But other than that, it gave me what I expected.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kids love it and really do enjoy palaying it all of their free time They have learned to share paying it
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Wow and I thought Fifty Shdes of Gray was awesome. I couldn't get enough of this series! I've read the series twice already! Sylvia Day is amazing. I would most definitely recommend this series! I can't wait to read more!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Toca Hair Salon 2 is a very fun app. You can make any hair style you want with it. Only one downside: There are only 6 customers  to choose from.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I really like this cover for the Kindle I bought my mother.  She likes it too.  When the case for my Fire wears out I will get one like this.
B00A72989U|5.0|Best album ever. I listen to it all of the time. Alicia Keys is amazing.can't wait for her next album.
B005O7PSRO|5.0|castle season 4 episode 1 was awesome can't wait to watch the next one.  The video streamed through great no interruptions or commercials!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|My mother-in-law recommended this book to me after reading it herself. She has a way of finding and reading excellent books. This was no different, I loved all the adjectives he used in describing his NDE, it really came to life for me!
0385345054|3.0|The book is well made- high production values, beautiful pictures,etc, the flowers lovely and interesting, and for that the book would rate 5 stars. But i feel deceived because i have a ton of scrapbooking paper, wrapping paper(one flower with this kind) and was naively hoping that these flowers would use papers other than crepe paper. Ha! YOU MUST HAVE CREPE PAPER. I have ZERO crepe paper. Sooooo i am annoyed and wish that i had been told about the kind of paper the book uses in the title. The authors also use tissue paper as accent, vintage pips(what, no pips?!?)and actually to buy everything you that they recommend would cost alot. So while i understand the glowing reviews because the book is attractive and instructions okay, i can not make a single flower until i order crepe paper from somewhere. Do these authors think that every one, every crafter has CREPE paper??? As you can read, i am irritated, feeling a bit mislead. New book title: 'Crepe Paper to Petal'!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was expecting something more.  Ok, he's been abused as a child so he has some weird sexual fetish, sounds like half the men out there. What's all the buzz about?
B00005TQKQ|5.0|I was happy to find this on Amazon.  It has been discontinued, and I needed it for an old video camcorder.  I tried one from Radio Shack, and it got stuck in the camera.  I guess Sony means it when they say &#34;ONLY&#34; use Sony head cleaner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is the bomb!! I love this gamee.  the most genius thing ever.  I love minion rush!! I'm crazy about it. never not on this game.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I liked this book very much!  Made me, as an adult, THINK!  This is the second time reading it with my nieces and nephews as an assigned summer reading.  I do think the imagery is too difficult for them to understand, in parts. Very mature comprehension levels.
140006922X|3.0|Zealot is well written and easy to read.  The author did a ton of research and provides the references used.  So if you are looking for a scholarly text, this is a great choice.  On the other hand, if you are struggling with your faith, upon most religions are based, this will not help you.
B008MM9630|4.0|Keeps me busy, always something to do. I like how the quest are continuously updating.<br /><br />And unlike most games where all you get is money for rewards and have to buy game coins this one rewards you with their currency quite a bit makes it nice to be able to buy special items without actually having to pay for it.
B009HEMF1M|3.0|....... competently made, gelling the characters with their diverse personalities . It's especially well done for a comic book movie. The most outstanding thing here is the casting.
1931559317|5.0|Great cost benefice, very practical guide, perfect for beginners and i think it is also useful for more advanced users
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Sort of like another movie or two, single action guys meets explosions, chases, fights -- quick and dirty, a love interest (very limited), and Tom as Jack. WOW!<br />It has some great action in the movie, good plot -- easy to follow. The movie is a perfect &#34;Mens night out&#34; flick!
B0088W3TM8|3.0|Is it just me or does the Major remind you of the commander of Wormhole Xtreme?  He's a major.  Get a military haircut.  Otherwise the storytelling is good and overall it was interesting.  I'm just glad I have prime so I didn't have to pay extra.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Hate the plot and the Daffy Duck spaceship with the steamboat Willie engine room that looks more like a water treatment plant than it does an engine room. As the villan of this ridiculous plot acted more like a robo-cop gone bad than Khan. The whole cast should have die along with this idiotic ship at the end. Apparently,they missed the historical fact of what happened to the Columbia shuttle craft when it hit the atmosphere. Brilliant!!!! Can't wait to see what a fiasco mastrepiece JJ Abrams is going to do with Star Wars.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Love it! A nail bitter to then end!! can't wait for the next one,<br /><br />The review window require twelve more words to complete......
B001JNNDGA|5.0|First! I cannot believe after the prophet Isaiah said that The Messiah would have to suffer and be afflicted. The Jews still did not believe. The temple veil was torn from top to bottom and the ark of the covenant was visible with the naked eye, they still did not believe. I cried all through out the film. I love the Lord and The accomplished work. Great film. Thank you!
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|Even a stellar cast couldn't pump life into this movie. We are all very aware that each actor in this movie is capable of holding together a film on their own, but their talents did not shine through in this one. Even the soundtrack was not right for this movie. I kept watching it thinking that it has to get exciting at some point, but it never did. I did not even feel that any of the actors had good on screen chemistry between them. I can't quite place my finger on it but everything about the film just seemed off; even the special effects were not that impressive. I hate to be harsh because I am aware of how difficult it is to make movies, but this was just not a good film.
159413586X|5.0|This is a great story and I just started this 3rd book of the series.  I am excited for the next movie to see how it  is on screen.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The ease and access of Amazon video streaming was easy and problem-free.  I enjoyed watching the final episode of Star Trek Voyager as I have recently began watching the show for the first time.  I would like to view more seasons and episodes soon since Netflix only offers Season I.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Connie
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife has been a fan of the show since it first came on. I never cared for the stars and the name was kinda goofy.  I spent a sick weekend on the couch with my iPad and gave it a try.  What a GREAT show!  I'm hooked.  On episode 22 in less than a week.  I can't stop watching.<br /><br />Give it a try folks.
0307352153|5.0|This is a great psychological book. It is really helpful not only to understand our own behaviors, but also to understand others and to plan accordingly at office and other social environments.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Love Tom Cruz and Morgan Freeman. Great ending totally didn't guess what was even going on at the beginning so had my attention the whole time. Def would watch again
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read about 7 books a month and its very rare<br /> to find one with a plot this well put together. It is truly difficult to decide what you would do if you were Cecelia and the perspective of each character makes the moral dilemma even more intense. A modern Greek tragedy and a study on the lifetime effects of a terrible decision made in anger, this is a must-read!
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|love this game, but it can be very frustrating when you are stuck for weeks at a time on a level
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a fun game and there is some cutomizing that you can do with your cars. That being said there are not many traks at all and they get old after playing them for about an hour or so.
1609611543|5.0|Who would have guessed that wheat can be so bad for you.  It is true.  I proved it to myself by going wheatless and my energy soared and my appetite decreased.  Read this book then buy the cookbook. You won't be sorry.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|This is a fun game I wish there was more you could cutumize and diffrent tracks but all in all not to bad.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!! :-D  It's such a tear-jerker!  And thought provoking!  The acting is great as well! :-)
B004VFN7BE|5.0|This is one interesting movie, I would say within the top five of all the movies I've ever seen in my life.  It's just exciting, keeps you on the EDGE of your seat.  It somehow still does, regardless of how many times you've seen it.  You will NEVER go wrong with this one.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This was a sleeper for me. I enjoyed it because it was about a subject not really<br />seen on the screen.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Truly amazing how many great bands went through that studio and used that board!  I'll be watching this again soon!!!
B00A83075M|5.0|I loved it good for adults to see too. My grandkids loved it. Who doesn&#34;t love Ralph, he's in all of us.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Good book<br />Classic Demille. Corey has become one of my favorite characters. Matter of fact I have to watch myself and not pick up his manner of speech while talking with my wife whil reading one of these books
B003TQKVGU|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK! I would recommend this to anyone who is open to learning about the subconscious mind and the power we actually have within us to change our lives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was by far the best I've seen in years! Very entertaining and I would recoment it to everyone! A must see for the whole family!
B0096BIENY|5.0|Love the music from il divo and jersey boys . The others are okay but the quality is just great and the service is so efficient.
B00AWJYJVA|2.0|Started with Le Carré's trademark asynchronous chapters, but the connectors weren't there.  The ending was very disappointing - a real anti-climax - as though he meant to come back and redo it, but didn't get around to it.  Overall it missed the polish of his other reads - very fragmentary.  I love Le Carré, but regrettably I can't recommend this novel.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I purchased these as a Christmas gift in 2012. Was given to a friend who casually plays games. I asked him how he liked it and said that the sound was great and the different dials on the belt controller worked fine. He liked being able to change bass, as well as the levels of sound coming through the headset. (Voice Chat vs Game Audio). He said that the Voice Level Recognition doesn't really work. He had to really put the mic up to his mouth so he could hear himself in the headset. I tried it out and it's true. If you have it at a regular distance, you can't hear your voice.<br /><br />The problem was the build of the headset. The swivel on the headset isn't as comfortable as you think it would be. It does a weird pinching with the headphones. They don't just simply lie on your chest. They try to continue to curl up a bit, and with the mic sticking up, it feels awkward to try and keep them that way since you have the mic poking you in the face.. So the swivel headphones were a bad choice. What is the worse thing though is that the integrity of the headset is compromised by screws located near the swivel. There are 2 screws that are meant to secure the headphone to the head unit, but that causes the plastic area to become smaller and easier to break. With the belt unit connected to his pants, my friend turned his head and had the clip pull the headset down around his neck, when he removed the headset to check it out, the screws caused the plastic to break. At least we know that the belt clip is of good quality, no? Here is the outcome of the headset being pulled down by the clip.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Notice that the break happens where the screws are supposed to be keeping the headphones connected to the head set. Once again, the sound quality of the headset is great. Clear, crisp and loud, but that isn't really worth much if the headset itself isn't comfortable or capable of staying on your head.ead.
143911000X|1.0|I did expect a more serios book with some cool advice, not only ridiculous, and or &#34;trying to be funny&#34; situations .
B003K16PFU|5.0|Orwell's prose is extremely readable and lends a British humorous detachedness to his account of the events; fair-minded comprehensive (apart from all the damn acronyms), this was perfect as my first close account of the Spanish Civil War. &#34;The experience of being hit with a bullet is a remarkable one, and one that is worth describing in detail...&#34;
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This game is fun and challenging. I guarantee a lot of time can be sucked up playing it! So set aside a block of time because once you've completed one challenge, you just have to see what the next one brings.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I often find it necessary to display webpages for an elder parent who is not a computer user.  This tool simplifies the process by allowing me to broadcast the Chrome browser (or Youtube) page on a large television screen.  It is much easier to browse the web from a laptop than from the built-in browser functions on my A/V system.  Great tool for online research with groups of people.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It was a decent action movie. It was not as good as the first one but good enough. Bruce Willis was did not have enough scenes
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Got talked into reading this and couldn't put it down.  Best book ever.  Can't wait to start book two.  Yeah
B003YOASY2|5.0|Really one of the funniest albums I have heard in a long time. It has so many great songs that I listen too multiple times
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is so much fun building up your dragon island the way you want it .  You can breed up to 168 different kinds of dragons.  To get many of them you would have to be very lucky.  You get coins and gold to buy habitats, dragons, food, and to clear the land.  You visit neighbors and others to see their islands.  The more dragons and habitats, the more coins you get.  The only complaint I have it that it takes too long to breed and hatch many of the dragons.<br />If you want a game to play every day I would recommend Dragon Story
B0013DC5B0|5.0|Has all of the songs and some skits from the movie on this CD and I think it sounds fantastic, every time I need a pick me up, this is one of the CDS I turn to.
B00AEBBA36|4.0|I've seen this movie several times as I own it.  The nearest comparison among Viet Nam flicks out there would come from \\"Go tell the Spartans\\" with Burt Lancaster.  It's not about heroics, though the actions of many troops depicted quite naturally seem heroic.  This movie is about the so-called \\"brotherhood in arms\\".  Mel Gibson is a fine actor.  Whatever demons in his own life he is dealing with seem to come out in films he's in.  See \\"The Patriot\\", for example.  Kinda similar but for the vast gulf of years between the two conflicts depicted.  Sam Elliot is a natural for the role of the gruff and consistently loyal Sergeant Major Plumly.  I'm mystified by the favorable opinions of that dreadful \\"Pearl Harbor\\" atrocity.  Please read your history, movie fans.  That movie has no place in comparison with better, more accurate films such as this one.  The horrid insertion of fighter pilots manning one of the Doolittle Raid bombers is so irresponsible that no serious historian, whether academic or hobbyist, should mention it under any circumstance.  Its insulting to those brave souls who actually did fly that hazardous mission.  I highly recommend \\"We were Soldiers\\" as an honest, no frills portrayal of this historic event.  I'm sure many of Col. Moore's \\"troopers\\" feel the same.  God bless you veterans.
B005PK57NU|5.0|We don't have cable.  Stumbled upon this show on amazon prime and really enjoy it.  Court, politics, realistic romance without the soap opera...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't know what to think when I saw that this could be considered as a young adult book but it turns s out that at 25 years old I couldn't put this book down. I finished it in 3 days maybe 6  hours total. I wish it wasn't over which is an indicator of a well written novel!
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|My husband and I have watched every season.  This wasn't the best one but it's so much fun anyhow.  Forced to go over the top.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|As to be expectedfrom this  author once again an excellent read that gives insight to the trauma faced by the people of Afganistan. Written with sensitivity and expressed in beautiful prose.
B00340I4KG|5.0|Have this movie n VSH but love it so much since VSH is out of style I wanted it n DVD.
B001AP11L6|5.0|Love all things jack white. This is one of my favorite albums by the white stripes or anyone for that matter.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|We have enjoyed watching this movie for many years. We bought this DVD to add to current collection. It will be watched over and over.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have really been enjoying the experiments.  I have long believed in the power of the mind to create your own world.  I haven't always believed that I was able to do it myself.  At least not the positive stuff.  After doing these experiments, I believe in myself more.  Thanks Pam!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series and look forward to season 4.  Season 3 left some interesting subjects to be covered for net year.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|I continue to enjoy introducing new generations to this decades old classic. It handles complicated themes of justice, religion, economics and political structure with sensitivity and informed brilliance.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|New Girl's second season was just as strong as season one. Zooey Deschanel was born to play the quirky but loveable Jessica Day. In the start of season 2, Jess loses her job as a teacher and she also kind of loses who she is halfway through the season. She begins a sexual relationship with a guy who thinks she's someone else at first, then she starts to have real feelings for him in the Halloween episode. But that storyline arc isn't what makes season 2 so special. In episode 15, \\"Cooler\\" Nick (her insecure, unmotivated roommate) and Jess share a very passionate and intense kiss. I haven't seen chemistry this strong since Ross and Rachel on \\"Friends\\" in the mid-90s. After that episode, Nick and Jess dance around their feelings for each other. They are good friends, but Jess is afraid that Nick is not the right guy for her because he lacks direction and he's got commitment issues. Eventually by the time the episode, \\"Virgins\\" airs - Nick and Jess realize they can't deny their attraction anymore and take the plunge. What I like about this show is the Nick and Jess storyline could've been put on hold until later seasons, but the writers decided it would add more drama and authenticity to put them together as a potential couple instead of dragging it out. I really love this show. It's fresh, very funny, and full of surprising, heartfelt moments especially in the episode, \\"Chicago,\\" when the gang is there for Nick after his father dies. My favorite episodes include: \\"Menzies\\", \\"Parents\\", \\"Pepperwood\\", \\"Quick Hardening Caulk\\", and \\"First Date\\". I can't wait for season 3 and see how the whole Nick and Jess relationship plays out. Of course something tells me they won't be a couple for long, because Nick has a tendency to sabotage himself. Enjoy season 2 and I also recommend checking out season 1.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|I didn't find half star, Otherwise I would  use it. I don't know why is in the Amazon video the first place. Totally tasteless
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really love this calculator. This is the only calculator I have seen where you can add and subtract negatives and positive intergers. Will recommend to everyone. Very good tool.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has never failed me. It is easy and simple to use! I use it daily whether I am helping with homework or simply balancing the checkbook. Best part is it is free!
0061950726|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was an easy read with a surprise ending. I had always heard about the &#34;orphan trains&#34; but did not really realize how many orphans there were in the early 1900's, this book really brought it all to life.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I bought a set of used Nikon lenses, not knowing that none of them came with lens caps or rear lens caps. So I kept them bagged until amazon sent 6 of these rear lens caps. Every one fit perfectly, and they have a high quality plastic feel. Very happy.
1439153663|5.0|This was a well written book describing how a slave and a poor white girl became dependent upon each other for comfort and survival. Having just read Homer Figg with my grandaughter, this book about slavery satisfied my adult interest in American slavery in the 1860's.
B007P06DOK|5.0|I bought this CD as a replacement for my original copy that had become damaged after years of use.  A recent PBS special on the making of Graceland emphasized the musical genius of Paul Simon and the political turmoil of the times.  This program made me dig out my damaged copy of the CD.  Alas, it couldn't be salvaged.  I was delighted to find the 25th Anniversary Edition of this CD and have enjoyed it several times.  My husband had never heard the CD until last week.  After hearing that he said, &#34;that is a really great album,&#34;
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and so easy to order online with Amazon and add to watch list.  Love how easy this works.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|for fans of the Comic this movie stays true to form Karl Urban makes a great judge dredd exciting and action packed
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Its a good thriller but becomes predictable at times. Always the good wins and bad loses which sort of spoils the thrill that it is building up. Characters do justice to the roles.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Remember the first time this one came out, A really big hint with young and old. Now our granddaughter is enjoying it and we are again with her.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was more exciting than the first book.  I can't wait to read the last book.  Please let Peeta and Katniss get together.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Very funny & different. I love zombie movies but sometimes they start to feel like they're telling the same story over & over. This was a fun departure from the normal zombie movie, no real gore or scares but a good story & likable characters. Think more date movie love story than make-out horror movie!
140006922X|5.0|This book was the first time I have read anything regarding Jewish history around the time that Jesus lived. The context of Roman occupation, Jewish revolts, and other events serve as a framework for a fascinating and eye-opening analysis of Jesus' life, times, and accomplishments. Read it if you are even remotely curious about the historical Jesus and the factual events before and after his death. You probably won't look at your faith in quite the same way afterwards.
B00821OX98|5.0|we watched them all in a row and didn't want to stop. Can't wait for next year to see more.

B00EDF43MY|5.0|We own every one of the paid Dr Panda apps and for good reason, they're fantasic! My 3 yr old loves them, my 9 yr old loves them, Ive busted my husband playing them, and I play with them!
1423140605|5.0|If you liked the Original Percy Jackson and the Olympians or the Heroes of Olympus this book is great and I enjoyed it greatly.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love musicals, so of course I was drawn to this show. This one is more drama based, unlike Glee, a couple laughs here and there, but mostly just drama. I did like the story line, especially just feeling like I was really getting a peak of everything that goes on behind the scenes to create a broadway musical.
1423140591|5.0|If you like Percy Jackson then you will love this book as a continuation, it is really, really good and a funny read as well.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The last third of ths book gets bogged down with unnecessary characters and the author fails to tie them together to justify their existance. The end produces none of the emotional response the reader expects. Otherwise the book is beautifully written until it seems to lose its way.
1433502410|4.0|Like more of the comments mention, the print is small, but the information and explanation is wonderful! If you are a new christian take your time, read the bible first then look back to the explanation of the page. But I love all the maps, and follow ups with each verse.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|Need subtitles in English! I may have impaired hearing, or maybe I just can't understand snobish british, cockney and irish...
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Compact, easy to use and works as reported in the ads. I use my Headphones with my iPad to listen to my collection of CD's transferred to my iPad and thought I couldn't get the volume I wanted, so purchased this item at the time I bought the Headphones. They do boost the volume, but actually more than I need as the iPad-headphone combination at near full volume does the job just fine.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I play witch sage on the computer and I like it.It won't play on my Kindle fire so I'm very sad about that.pleas fix.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|This album is everything that today's music is missing. It's well-written, beautifully crafted and timeless. John Legend has completely restored my faith in R&B. It was worth every single cent.
B001MTENOC|3.0|This is a very thought provoking book.  Sometimes it seemed so far out that I had to stop reading for awhile.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|On Kindle or iPad, sometimes it's hard to get one's fingers small enough to make certain selections. This does it well. The devices don't react as readily to it as to a finger-tip, but it's easy to get used to.
B008469DGY|5.0|Started the game playing before work....then I realized I was late for work. Easy to play and a lot of fun!
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's been fun to play a little every day and see how you can build up your points and levels ..
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Although I've only seen the first four episodes so far, I'm enjoying this series tremendously. Great cast, great acting. It's a bit slow-moving at times, but the point seems to be not so much to create tension and drama leading up to the solution of the mystery, but to show the impact of a tragic event on the life of a small, remote, peaceful community. Not sure what the premise will be going forward if a second season is produced. Will there be one murder per series as in this one? It's a bit unconventional as most of us are used to one or more per episode in whodonit series. But so far, it's working. The longer time frame allows for the deeper, underlying themes to be developed more, and hopefully, a good, credible, surprise ending.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I'm not sure why this game has such a high rating. It's a horrible, ugly, boring game. I got it because it was the FAOTD. This game isn't even worth $1, definitely not worth the normal $3 price.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was a fascinating story of a young girl surviving World War II in Germany. It told of the humanity of her family & many other ordinary Germans during the war. It told of the hardships suffered.<br />A minor complaint was the fact that the author said that 6 million people died in concentration camps when it was a far larger number.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|If you've read the books, you know it's pulp.  The movie is actually deeper than the books it's based on.  That's not to say it's very deep.  I enjoyed the old stories so we say the movie in the theatre.  Liked it enough to want to own it.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|What can I say, it's a classic. I rented this because I could not find my DVDs and my grandson was was spending the day with us. The quality is amazing.
B00ANGICRE|3.0|it is is deep though provoking movie, with excellent performancees by the 4 main characters, John Hawkes, Helen Hunt, William H. Macy, Moon Bloodgood, Annika Marks
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I was so thrilled to find that all these seasons were on Amazon prime!  It made my prime membership even more worth it!!!
B001P9KR94|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and it was well the the cost. Dev patel was very good and now I watch him on the newsroom and appreciate him even more
B005PK57IK|5.0|I was so thrilled to find that all these seasons were on Amazon prime!  It made my prime membership even more worth it!!!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|what can I say a star studded cast , great plot, twists, and turns.  All around a great movie. :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|the book is great!  But know that the movie is nothing like the book!! If you read the book first you might not want to see the movie, which was a huge disappointment!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is great, easy to use, and won't drain your battery.  I love the fact that it works as advertised.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a quick read and I enjoyed it very much. The end of the book really uncovered a lot of &#34;what if's&#34; which is really what the book is all about.  I wasn't overly emotionally invested in the characters but that was ok, I didn't need to be in order to enjoy the book.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|Probably would give it 3-1/2 stars if that was an option.  Jennifer Aniston does a nice job, looks great.  And we got see plenty of her throughout the movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Read this book in record time. Love the characters, was emotionally connected to them. I couldn't wait to read more books by Jojo Moyes.  This book pulled at my heart strings big time!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Enjoyed it from start to finish. Uplifting and moving story of the relationship between two lost souls who found each other and enriched each other's lives.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This Lego set is different than most typical sets, but my 8 year old enjoyed it.  There are many different combinations and things that can be made with the set and has kept his interest for several different play times.  There is not much else to pick from if looking for something minecraft related, so our options were limited.  However, would def purchase again since my little boy LOVES minecraft and Legos.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|If you liked John Carpenter's flic &#34;The Thing&#34; then you will like this Norwegian based movie that is a prequel to the Carpenter drama.<br />It details the &#34;beginnings&#34; of the advent of The Thing and ends with the dog that began Carpenter's epic.  Very nicely done.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game has very good graphics and an interesting back story. The hidden objects are sometimes obscure, but the puzzles are difficult enough to be challenging without being so hard they become frustrating.
B0009S4IKQ|5.0|This is not only a fun flic : a tense drama - highlighting the activities of a wide selection of the famous and not so famous - but is also a poignant romantic story as well.  If you like Garbo and old-time drama movies then this is for you
B00000K413|5.0|This is a great album for those of us who don't like Bieber. Tff has a unique and emotional vibe that some modern artists sadly lack.
B0014VPFTA|2.0|Circa 2010, the local Austin video/radio stations were playing selections from Mayer's 2009 \\"Battle Studies\\" -- \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" and \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye.\\" I loved those two songs, but never followed up in learning more about his music until just a week or so ago, when I ordered used copies of both \\"Battle\\" and \\"Continuum,\\" the latter after reading multiple Amazon reviews saying how great it was, his \\"classic,\\" how \\"Battle\\" cannot compare.<br /><br />Still haven't received \\"Battle,\\" but after listening to \\"Continuum\\"... After the second song, I was not only dismayed but actually starting to get depressed at how bad/bland it was. I tried to pump myself up: \\"It's OK, it's only the second song, keep with it...\\" By the fourth song, \\"Gravity\\" -- with its lyric \\"Gravity, stay the hell away from me\\" -- I realized that the dismay wasn't going to lift. By the end of the CD, here's what I learned about Mayer and about life:<br /><br />Mayer has \\"emotions.\\"<br />Mayer \\"makes the most\\" of all his \\"sadness.\\"<br />Mayer is \\"so scared of getting older.\\"<br />Mayer has \\"too many corners\\" in his mind.<br />Mayer \\"could be wrong\\" or he \\"could be right.\\"<br /><br />I.e., nothing real about life, and nothing real about Mayer. (So much for him breaking out in \\"full blues mode,\\" as one Amazon reviewer said.)<br /><br />Listening to \\"Continuum\\" was, to me, the musical/lyrical equivalent of listening to a yuppie parent bragging to friends (over white wine or craft beer -- but only ONE glass) about a latest organic food purchase or what clever thing they just named their kid or pet. Nothing truly heartfelt; all \\"received\\" emotion, how Mayer thinks he's \\"supposed to\\" feel. Completely bereft of any REAL soul or blues or beauty or honesty.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is entertaining. The music needs improving.  Overall, pretty neat. I need seven more words, have a nice day
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wanted to read it again as soon as I finished.  I only had that desire after one other book, and while I resisted the urge this time, it won't be long before I read it again.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I picked two stars because the story was drawn out with nothing going on. It was a lot of waiting. Waiting for Eric and his decision, waiting to find out what is going on with Sam, waiting to find out what Mr. C knows about the murder. It wasn't suspenseful, it was annoying. I didn't like the ending either, it was more of the waiting to see how the relationship goes.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Great music from great artists...love it!  This is one of the best albums of stage music I have heard.  Great selections!
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|I'm new to the whole `Before...' trilogy.  I understand that I'm probably the one in a million who hadn't seen any of the parts, but it is a truth I can't hide from.  Back in 2004, when the internet was abuzz of talk over `Before Sunset' and critics were raving Julie Delpy's performance and the Oscars were nominating its screenplay I was under a rock.  Well, to be completely honest, I wasn't under a rock as much as I was too lazy to want to watch `Before Sunrise' and there was no way I was going to watch a sequel without watching the first film.  So this year I finally buckled.  With all the critical praise for `Before Midnight' I knew that I was going to eventually HAVE to see this movie, and so I Netflix'd `Before Sunrise' and `Before Sunset' and had myself a `Before...' marathon.  Yes, I got up early this morning and watched the first two films and then got in my car and sat in a theater and indulged in the conclusion to this romantic trifecta (or is it?).<br /><br />In all honesty, I'm still semi-processing the whole thing, but I really don't think one can talk about one film, especially `Before Midnight', without at least addressing the others.  The films are so interconnected despite being about so many varying themes and subjects.  Quite honestly, other than the two main characters these films don't really speak the same language and yet they feel so interconnected.<br /><br />What I think is so great about this series is that, experienced as I did today (back to back to back), the films play out like a complete relationship.  You have the initial meeting in 1994 on a train through Europe.  These two people, Jesse and Celine, meet rather spontaneously, share a meaningful `chat' and then decide to spend an entire day and night roaming Vienna and getting to know one another.  Then you have their chance `re-encounter' ten years later in 2004.  Much like the infamous `Love Story' (better known by its 1957 remake,  `An Affair to Remember') one of these lovers missed their six month rendezvous, which caused them to be separated for ten years before they are reunited when Jesse is on a book tour through Europe and happens to stop over in France, where Celine is from.  In the latest film you have this pair, now nine years into a serious relationship complete with twin girls and Jesse's son from his previous relationship.  The glowing romance is stripped away and the reality of love and life has set in.  In the beautiful way in which Linklater and company have shot these films, we get to see these snapshots of a relationship in such a full and complete way, and while separately some work stronger than others, together they create a beautiful whole.<br /><br />They take you from fairytale love affair to realistic adventure to tragic reality, all parts of which contrast and complement in ways unexpected.<br /><br />I don't know if this speaks to the cynic in me, but I feel as though `Before Midnight' truly stands out as the most impressive of the trilogy.  It felt the most honest and earthy, and while `Before Sunset' certainly felt more organic and natural, there is something emotionally stirring about `Before Midnight' that I just can't shake.  It is the only film in the trilogy that reduced me to tears (several times) and since I'm one who reacts more favorably to having my emotions played with, it is only natural that this conclusion be the film I appreciate the most.<br /><br />More so than any of the others, `Before Midnight' feels very mature.  With `Before Sunrise' it felt like an indie variation of the classic romantic comedy.  It used big words and long sentences and political, sexual and controversial subtext to set it apart and make it `relevant' and yet recycled clich&eacute;d themes and situations in order to remain part of that world.  It felt very fairytale like, which is something I enjoyed and yet also felt somewhat disconnected to.  `Before Sunset' moved us forward somewhat with a more honest interpretation of this kindled love, and taking these characters from the initial meeting to only their second time together (yet with so much extra worldly baggage on their shoulders) it made their connection feel more secure, more rooted and honest.  Their verbal exchanges, while equally as long, diverse and weighted, felt easier to digest and felt more comfortable on their tongues.  They were older, wiser and more trustworthy.  But, with this third outing, Linklater takes us out of the fairytale and into the real world.  He draws from a darker place and gives us a real look at a fractured relationship and plays to the idea that NO relationship is free from complication.  Whereas the first two films romanticized the whole experience (even the disagreements were charming), `Before Midnight' confronts us with a more savage underlining of subtext.<br /><br />I was not expecting this at all, but it was a welcome surprise.<br /><br />Some may baulk at this assessment, but for me this was Linkater at his most Bergmanesque.  It was reminiscent of what Woody Allen attempted to do with films like `Husbands and Wives' or `Interiors' and yet this actually feels more connected to Bergman's world than either or those films.  I kept calling to mind `Scenes from a Marriage', which is one of my favorite films of all time.  The conversational quality of the whole exercise is so enthralling; one can't help but be completely swept up in it all.  What makes this film so efficient and so affecting is that is couples the same ease of language and chemistry that was honed and perfected over the course of the series and adds that needed edge of tension that makes this film feel more enlightened, more important.<br /><br />Both Jesse and Celine are flawed individuals.  Unlike Allen's `Husbands and Wives', this never felt like a one-sided conversation.  Even moments where it could be perceived as such (especially when Celine becomes overly agitated and defensive) are diffused by the nature of the film.  This is a mere conversation; a heated one, but a conversation and so the natural recoil of affection and plunge in defensiveness is expected.  The way these two circle the subject of their relationship is so effortless.<br /><br />Yes, if one were to try and point a finger than the dinner table scene which featured a scenario straight out of `Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married' felt a tad forced and obvious and could have been stripped from the film itself, and yet it all felt so natural given the moment in the film.  It felt like part of a whole, but still I was glad to see it end.<br /><br />This trilogy works best when its sole focus in on the two leads.  They play off of one another so beautifully that one can't stop looking at them.  While I was initially put off by Hawke in the first film, he completely won me over in `Before Sunset', and while he is extremely effective in `Before Midnight', it is Julie Delpy who completely owns this particular film.  Her progression of character and ease of performance are a rarity in cinema and something to marvel over.<br /><br />So, as a whole I must say that I really like this trilogy.  I don't love it, although these are films that I really MUST watch again and I have a feeling that over time I'll become more and more effected by them as separate entities (since right now I'm having a hard time viewing them on their own and not as part of a larger whole), and then again they are films that I could easily begin to pick apart and criticize.  I think that the singular nature of the film itself lends itself to that kind of reaction.  By confining your focus to singular conversations, you are leaving yourself open to varying opinions on those conversations and viewpoints and thus you are going to stir passion, either for or against your film.  I could listen to these films all day long, and in fact I'm almost tempted to keep `Before Sunrise' and `Before Sunset' on loop while I'm at work this week just to soak in every word.<br /><br />As a whole, I'd rate this trilogy an A-, mostly on the strength of the final chapter.  Individually (and this fluctuates by the minute), I'd give `Before Sunrise' a B-, `Before Sunset' a B+ and `Before Midnight' an A, verging on an A+, but I'm hesitant to call this a masterpiece just yet.ere conversation; a heated one, but a conversation and so the natural recoil of affection and plunge in defensiveness is expected.

1451696191|4.0|Son needed this for PreAP Engligh 1 assignment.  Not crazy about the adult content but he enjoyed the book.  He could easily relate to the main character as this is a coming of age book.  Easy read.
B00DOQK2OG|1.0|Terrible sound. You would be better off buying any other Rainbow live or studio CD. Very disappointed. Don't make the same mistake I did!
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|One of the best movies ever made! The set locations are so beautifully depicted and the guys are so easy onthe eyes...  : )
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I didn't care too much for the reviews, however, the part on anxiety touch me very deeply.  In reading this book, I am confronted by my own thoughts and decisions.
B007TKBD4G|5.0|I love this album, more than their other records, and I first heard it from a digital download. Because it was such a favorite, I decided to pick the LP for my collection, and I was surprised at how different the mix sounds. I am an audio professional and not new to vinyl; the mix here sounds much more intimate, and a lot of the reverb that was on the other master seems to be missing here. I don't have a strong opinion which is the better master, but I would say that the LP is very revealing of the recording process. There IS a digital download card included inside of the jacket, which was not marked on the label. I was already familiar with this record when purchased, but I'm glad to have the LP and play it frequently.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|Keeps your interest and has a good storyline. It is the first movie I have enjoyed for my film class.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Very helpful now I catch my cats plotting and planning. I think they know that I know what they are doing now. Funny stuff!
1878424319|4.0|In the second half it got a little repetitive but the concept is amazing. No one has ever described the process of life &#34;agreements&#34; as well as Don Miguel Ruiz. Something I've been trying to figure out for a long time and just now and I'm saying &#34;Ok, I get it&#34;. Worth every penny.
B0090SI582|5.0|I would actually give this 4 stars instead of 5 but to balance it all the negative stuff i gave it 5. People will have their own \\"bias\\" opinions and there is no changing that. So, i'll give you mine. Take it or leave it. I grew a huge comic fan and I still am, there a few changes in this movie but if you're truly a comic fan you would know that Marvel comics gives their writers freedom to make changes from time to time esp with movies. 1st you have to keep in mind that somethings MUST be changed from page to screen because not everything will transfer well. Anyway, the action was good, the story was good and it even has a nice surprise during the closing credits. I am going to miss Hugh Jackman when he decides to stop playing Wolvie or gets too old. Bottom line to give this one star i think is too picky but hey, an opinion is an opinion. I would recommend you rent it first and decide for yourself but just don't get carried away. It's just a movie and if you're big on the comics and hate this movie, you'll still have the comics bub!<br /><br />Take care,
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I've been playing Mahjong on KDE for Linux distros for ages. Nothing has changed much on that side & I just love this game a lot. The drawback I see with this particular version is adding a story line to this game, which is really not needed & the actual play area is very small. Given the fact that I have the first generation Kindle Fire, it looks like the UI on this game has a lot of un-needed things on it. Just have a dark background & a big area for the board. That's all that Mahjong needs.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie but was disappointed since it seemed to be so skewed to the 'over 80' crowd.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Unlike the &#34;Zombie Tower&#34; game for iOS, this doesn't have those high end graphics but is basically the same concept. Makes it easier to play as a break from work for a short time without having to do much. Just love it!

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Wasn't impressed. I cut my teeth on Piers Anthony and Heinlein and this novella (it's pretty short) seemed very adolescent in comparison.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Still, after all these years, even with the 1970s schmaltz, a masterwork.  Most things in life can be explained by reference to some combination of: (a) these episodes; and (b) Hanna-Barberra cartoons.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Extremely addictive loads of fun.  Highly recommend one of the best Kindle games yet, if you like the Minions from Despicable Me.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|This reminds me of the singer/songwriters from the 60s and 70s.  Such lovely lyrics and melodies - and cute singers to boot.  &#34;Most People&#34; has an amazing story to tell . . . listen and you won't be sorry!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse has got a really great feel and the weights they supply allow an excellent range of choices for the feel of the device. I'm a pretty avid player in a lot of different games and this mouse has great variability and the placement of the programmable buttons is excellent. I've mis-clicked a few times in really high tension situations, but it has always been my fault so far. I've used this thing rather intensively for a few weeks and it's held up really well. I like it. And it's certainly much better feeling than my prior mouse, which was from a much more expensive brand.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Ariana is a breath of fresh air among all of the artists who use auto tune and are considered talented. Her vocals are flawless, hence all the comparisons to Mariah Carey. Putting that fact aside, she has a style all her own<br />and being that this is her first full length album she has a lot of room to grow. I will wrap this up by saying, if you are a fan of true music buy this album it will not disappoint. I am already looking forward to her sophomore effort. Some standout tracks... ( \\"Honeymoon Avenue\\",\\"Lovin It\\", \\"Piano\\",\\"Almost Is Never Enough\\",\\"Right There\\" ).
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game! It is like I am at a real zoo. I love how you can get animals and try give yo so much coins!!!! My favorite animals on it are the cats. Oh and I love that if you free your well animals a few times in each section you will earn a protector for that section. I REALY WANT A SNOW LEOPARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />  Get the coolest most fun game ever!!!!!!  It is not a big wast of time or money too.

B007HB5TN8|4.0|People in 200+ years ago thought and reasoned and had the same emotions we have today.  The main difference was the times were more conservative and had more rigid moral and behavior expectations than we have today.  Our rules of behavior are so loose today in comparison.  Our reading material is not more interesting, just more risque.

1582701709|1.0|This author is teaching something that the devils that surround him are teaching and its teachings are straight from the pit of hell and to be avoided at all costs! One needs to read the following books.<br /><br />Invasion of other gods-David Jeremiah<br />Satan's Evangelistic Strategy for this New Age-Erwin Lutzer<br /><br />Basically the lies presented in this book go back to the Garden of Eden when the devil told Eve that we shall be like God. Sadly those that read this book are in the darkness and cannot see the light of the gospel. But those that are in the light and have been told to read this book for a college class or given it as a gift, I warn you this book is damaging.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I love all the step up movies and this is the best! They are pretty mind blowing, what talent! YEAH
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I used to like Kindle. The app was fast and reliable, and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color (with N2A).<br />Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books, and Kindle (the app) would not download them unless I updated the app. The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time. Then it loads, and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations. A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it. Meanwhile, the app still doesn't allow you to group the books by topic.<br /><br />This spells the end of Kindle for me. I'll move my books over to Calibre, which doesn't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I usually love Sophie Kinsella's books.  I have enjoyed every one.  This one was just not conceivable.  Without going through all the details, the way the older sister tried to do what she did was pretty unbelievable.  And why the younger sister was so impulsive.... well, I didn't get it.  I was getting more annoyed as it went on.  I mean, how long can someone thwart a plan?  And the airline delays?  It just was too much.  It was like look at your accessories and then take one thing off.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|clarification and update: while finishing up this show i also am finishing up BREAKING BAD. i had to decide whether to compare this show to that one.  BB is perhaps the best tv show bar none.  if i were to write tv reviews comparing every one to BB, nothing would probably get over 4 stars again. so this review in no way is saying i like this show as much as BB.  however, DEXTER has held up for me personally over the past seasons.  I've always looked forward to it and enjoyed it. i am even a huger fan of the novels but it is a doomed prospect comparing novels with visual media.  they are apples and oranges. my original review follows.<br /><br />there are some viewers of dexter who have been hugely disappointed with some seasons of this show,  i have not. i also read the novels, which are very different from the show.  they are much more comic. i also have no problem with the novels.  so if you are someone who has been very up and down with dexter, i may not be the reviewer for you.<br /><br />in my opinion, this is overall a satisfying conclusion to the Dexter series.  Front and center throughout this last season are Dexter, Deb, the ghost of Harry, their father, AND the shrink who oversaw Harry's development of the code, played by Charlotte Rampling.  She treats both Dexter and Deb!<br /><br />As we open, Deb is an absolute mess from having killed LaGuarda at the conclusion of last season. she has quit the force, is drinking and taking drugs, is working free lance for an investigative firm, etc.,  Dexter is desperate to fix her but of course he is the source of her problem and she can now barely stand the sight of him.  with this set up we are off and running while also tying up the supporting characters on the series, like Vince, Angel and others.<br /><br />the success of this show largely depends on the acting jobs of michael c. hall and jennifer carpenter as dexter and deb.  if they were in any way weak, the entire series would flounder.  it is good Hall recovered from his bout with cancer as i can't see anyone else taking over the Dexter role from him.<br /><br />some are upset at how this show concludes.  it would not fit the novels at all as the novels are comedic whereas the tv show has always been solely dramatic.  the show is also more morally oriented than the novels. this often happens in tv and film adaptations of novels, unfortunately. so this is a highly moral conclusion to the Dexter story. perhaps someday the Dexter series will be remade to fit with its novels. if so, the actor would have to be highly comedic, which i doubt describes michael c. hall as dexter.  with the dexter which was reinvented for the tv screen, he did the best job he possibly could.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had never read a Stephen King novel (started one once, but didn't like it), so I was skeptical. Also, I'm not a big fan of alternate history novels. However, I was won over. It's a great story and a great book. He is a much better writer and storyteller than I gave him credit for.<br /><br />People who read lots of King tell me there are references to his previous books peppered throughout the story. I missed them all, I'm sure, but it didn't matter a bit. King fans also tell me this book is different from his normal books.<br /><br />I read it first in the library, then bought this copy for my mother. She was also skeptical, but loved the book after reading it!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I like the singer and the album is okay, but I think his other album, COLD FACT, is much better.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Very enjoyable movie!<br /><br />This movie was Dustin Hoffmann's directing debut. It deals with how artists are often cast aside as they age, something he has personally experienced. There is humor and pathos. The movie features a terrific cast, many of which are retired musicians and opera singers. That lends a great amount of authenticity to the film.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching.
B004ADH1RI|1.0|Couldn't watch it with my kids, they said it's too mean. The language is not appropriate for a 13 year old. We turned it off after the first 5 minutes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another great series from MPT. Some of the snobbery is hard to believe and makes me chuckle. Surely,  what is great about a Great House is that they &#34;think &#34;they are GREAT!  Loved that they family realizes they employ many people and are responsible for providing jobs, that's something anyway. I tried to imagine what role I would play if I lived during that time...probably one of the milk maids with revolutionary views. Generally, it is an excellent series even if it is hard to relate to the lifestyle on this side of the pond.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really tub for all ages its tough at times but you can always pull through to win
B00821PCJS|3.0|Some redundant and boring moments, but it is moving forward slowly. It is an interesting premise for those who love Sci Fi<br />as do I.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Simple yet addictive.  I like the colorful graphics.  Can't wait till the grandkids try it!  Way to go devs .
1603429999|5.0|This is an outstanding book on the topic. Everything you want to know and lots you didn't know you need to learn is<br />covered in the workshop. The patterns are simplistic, but give experience with the techniques for the beginner. However,<br />it is not just for a beginning knitter. Get the book before it goes out of print.
B002CGSYNU|1.0|this did not fit the olympus lens i needed it for, and it said it would. very bummed. Now i have to go search for another one. Not worth sending back because of shipping costs.
0307719774|5.0|Small enough to travel easily with.  Loads of good questions, perfect for those who wish to keep a diary of sorts but don't know what to say.  You don't feel too self absorbed because you're just answering one question a day.  Each question only gets four lines for an answer so it's not a huge commitment to keep up every day.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Gave it to my dad, he hasn;t said anything about it since he got it. He probably lost it somewhere,
0547564651|5.0|As a retired dean of instruction for a community college, I found this book to be invaluable for the insights it provided on what motivates students to succeed. I really would have enjoyed having read this book about ten years ago when I was in the midst of my career and leading a group of educators in their quest to educate challenging students. However, I did forward my copy to my niece and her husband who are both primary school educators. I am happy to report that they have both devoured the book and are looking at ways to incorporate some of their new-found knowledge in working with their students. Excellent book for educators or for those interested in educational practices.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What can I say other than this is one of the best games to have bar none.  Get it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.
B00E193TM2|5.0|I have lost nights of sleep listening to the CD. The best Five Finger Death Punch album out there today.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Awesome grip. Really adjustable for many camera set-ups.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints on this purchase. I adds a nice feeling to camera movement. Increases your range of motion and will allow you to pivot, swing, swoop, and flow into different angles and positions with your camera. Its very natural feeling to use it and is a huge help at live events and longer continues recording situations.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I originally read a review in Down East Magazine.  The author i is from Maine, so it was somewhat disappointing that the story wasn't set in Maine, but all the same the story was so interesting and unusual that any complaints were minor.  It is very well written..very different story great read!
B0073COMUW|5.0|Very bright white light, one bulb is enough for a whole room!!!! The quality of light is very different than typical incandescent bulbs.
B004LWZW24|5.0|This movie is perfect! I love and enjoy horror and so this movie I absolutely love it it's so good and I recommend other to watch it too
B00005JNS0|5.0|I needed to replace my copy after &#34;loaning&#34; my original, and this one worked very well. Perfect transaction and the product was just as described. Thanks!
B005PK553C|4.0|Great TV Series. I just wish it was longer so they could develop the characters more. Can't wait for next season to arrive on Prime.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|I love this film, and was very satisfied with the service. The sale was fast, easy and just what one would want. Thanks!
B006U1LYP8|5.0|Yes a tome but Rutherfurd  always pleases the inquisitive and historian as well. You can't go wrong with this author. Dive in!!
B00007EDY5|5.0|Works perfect! Fast delivery. For me its was a quick and economical option than wireless, at home use in smaller area.
1250029465|5.0|Bob is all the rage in London and now here in the states!! The writer is a success story in himself!! A must read !
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Getting the obvious out of the way, this was post-modernism and apocalyptic mash ups at it's BEST. With nods to the Matrix, to every mech anime ever, to Harry Harryhausen, and more, a lot more. Beyond that though, this was actually story about about the things that matter, family, friends, duty, honor, loyalty, humanity, unity, courage, pride and purpose. One of the best lines in first 20 minutes comes Idris Elba's Stacker Pentecost where he asks,\\"Is this where you want to die, or do you want to die in a Jaeger?1\\" to Charlie Hunnan's Raleigh. Which is a throw back line to knights and samurai of old, who would rather do go die fighting then be stuck idling away in obscurity. The soundtrack alone makes the movie worth watching in a loop. But that's besides the point. This is about the soul of humanity, what we live for, what die for, what hope for, what we have faith in. Which given Guillmore Del Toro knack for putting these elements into these types of movies. If anything this should be a rallying cry for humanity, in an anything but subtle way..
0712654194|5.0|Don't be intimidated by the size of the volume!! Rutherfurd mixes history and fiction in such a way as no other. I was in London earlier this summer with my granddaughter and know some of the places he writes of. He's right on the mark!! Go for it you won't be disappointed.
B0091WAWTM|5.0|The Wicker Man is one of those movies that makes me wonder, 'how on Earth did they get away with making this movie?'<br /><br />I'm sure glad they did.<br /><br />This movie, which follows an English police sergeant (Ed Woodward) to isolated Summerisle island to investigate a missing teen, is full of unexpected plot twists, creepy characters, and even a scene of adolescent boys singing around a maypole about sex, that will keep haunting the viewer, long after the end credits roll.<br /><br />Did I mention that Swedish actress Britt Ekland plays the island's siren, and performs a quasi-Celtic pagan dance (nude) to entice the investigator?<br /><br />Yes, it's all here.<br /><br />Looking for a Christopher Lee movie where he dresses like Hugh Hefner in 1973, but with wispy long hair?  Yes that's in \\"The Wicker Man\\", too (Lee considers his role of Lord Summerisle in this movie to be his finest role ever).<br /><br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" stands on its own as one of the freakishly campy yet unsettling horror / near-musical movies ever made.  Amid all of the oddities and laugh-out-loud strangeness, it does creep up on the viewer.  See it, and if you're able to get \\"Willow's Song\\" or the \\"maypole\\" song out of your mind the next day, consider yourself lucky.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Great characters and nice plot development. Sometimes a little onerous but overall a nice easy read. Well written and fun.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|I have not been a fan of KIngs more recent books, his classic books are amazing compared to the books you would find today. The only thing that gets me is how advanced Danny is. When is 3 he has these very vivid dreams and when the story goes to his point of view it is as if he is a man not a child barely out of diapers. I have 5yr old twins and find it very hard to believe Danny is this advanced. I wonder at times if King has children, he would know that if the character was 8 or 9 it would be a lot more believeable.
B0090SI44M|4.0|Grand kids liked it - just ok for me but I enjoyed watching it with them so 4 stars is about right
B00CWY76CC|4.0|All 10 levels were fun. My first intro to Escape puzzles so I was slow to learn but caught on and enjoyed all 10. Funny thing is my 6 year old grandson is every bit as good as I am, intuitively.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Not purchased for me  so I did not want to drag the ratings down when I have not even played this game
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I like the story of this game,it definitely keeps me into the game.Its an aspect most modern games seem to go very light on,but this one keeps my attention and the action,stunts you can do are cool.
B005LAII4E|5.0|I loved this money, it was full of action with humor and kept us on the edge of our seats the whole time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is impossible to lay this book down!  What an amazing story about an amazing politician!  Would that we could have such a brilliant president in our time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a great game. It gets very very addicting though. I really think you should get this game. :)
B00555X8OA|5.0|the length alone is challenge--but worth the effort to finish.  One will surely be far more critical when participating in &#34;water cooler conversation.&#34;  My kindle ed is filled with underlined sections of individual insights worth noting.
B00A44HRG2|2.0|I thought this would be fun to watch but it is,for me, boring. Maybe I didn't watch it the right time of day.I removed the app from my list.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think it's great.  Best doppler tracking of anything I have tried yet on my Kindle.  You can even get down to street level if you want to.  Forcasts are accurate and information is up to date.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Wonderful movie.  It is beautifully made and filled with symbolism.  It deals with end of life issues and saying goodbye.
0385337388|4.0|Though the book was written during the 1970s, the crisis' that the characters go through are still relatable by modern day healthcare workers. The characters deal with several emotions at the same time: anger, bliss, depression, sexual feelings, and many more.<br /><br />It is an enjoyable read. May start slowly, but is worth the time.
B008469DGY|3.0|It was fun. But all you do is try to get a hole in one. Different... I would like it better to play the ball to get it in the whole.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|I love every note that Keith and company play.  There is a lot of free playing, but also some very easy to follow improvising on standard tunes.<br />I like the unique arrangements of Stars Fell on Alabama, Somewhere, and the uptempo Tonight.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addictive and fun. Can't stop playing, even at work lol. Download it today and become addicted too!!  Just kidding
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I saw one episode of Game of Thrones on HBO and I was hooked.  I immediately started reading the series.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app!! It is awesome if you can't always communicate with friends and family. My cousin lives far far away from me and barely get to talk. Now me and Lizzy can talk all day long if we could. If you are looking for a texting app, this is the one!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|A little too cheesy at points with all these characters and some of the lines used in this movie other then that pretty good
B008469DGY|5.0|This app is super fun  and addictive. It can be a casual everyday game or even a long term session. Great buy
057809665X|2.0|Seems disingenuous to me. Building rapport under false pretenses or as a game isn't what I was looking for but I can see how it would be good for car salesmen etc.
3836538725|5.0|Just achingly beautiful. Salgado's work is stunning and his latest book just proves that he's one of the greats, love it.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Good story for those who want to be entertained without extreme bloody violence and a deluge of four-letter words.  Hugh Jackman is a familiar hero with a human touch and he does not disappoint.  The robots are as believable as computer graphics can make them.  The movie is good clean family fun.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This Blu-ray is a very solid investment.  The story is just great; acting is fabulous.  We will watch it over and over, many times.  Great enjoyment.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Van Morrison is at his best in this new recording.  It is a must have or Van Morrison fans.  Great
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|I was lucky enough to go see this show when she stopped in Boston.  Better yet I watched in awe from the Golden Triangle!  The show I thought was flawless...  The Epix broadcast...  Not so much.  I'm hoping the Blu-Ray and DVD will be a different edit.  I know not to hold my breath Lol.  The quick cuts are almost distracting and kills the live feel of the show.  The filtering doesn't bother me much.  I understand she's human and is now 55 and like us she has her own insecurities...  However unlike her most of us aren't one of the most famous people on the planet having every move, outfit, and wrinkle scrutinized.  I get it.  Anyway...  I can't wait for my copy to watch in HD and in surround sound!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Great re-mastering of an old favorite.  Paul McCartney and wings are at their best.  If you liked the Beatles, you will love this old favorite.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|HAVING SPENT EVEN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THIS PROGRAM, I CAN SEE THAT IT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO CREATE FUN, ORIGINAL DESIGNS, WHICH CAN THEN BE PRINTED UP OR SHARED WITH OTHERS.  IT'S COLORFUL, EASY, AND GIVES PLENTY OF CHOICES OR &#34;TOOLS&#34; TO DO YOUR ART.<br /><br />ALSO, WHEN I HAD A QUESTION, DARREN MURTHA HIMSELF RESPONDED TO ME...AND QUICKLY!  THAT I DID NOT EXPECT...<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LITTLE WONDER OF AN APP.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie broke my heart. So sad and touching and wonderful. Benedict Cumberbatch is in top form, as always, and I absolutely LOVED this.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think they added random stuff like the nether reactor core which was very unnecessary. But it is a total copy minecraft desktop addition, the original because it has different creators. I know it's still Mojang, but I mean it's still different creators.
1451629192|5.0|Bravo to the author. I couldn't imagine going thru what she did and I commend her for writing this book. Thank you.
B008CLI4N4|2.0|Got this series because of the great reviews . But for some reason , I could not get interested in watching it . Maybe , do not like some of the actors , maybe slow in telling the story . Or maybe , I can appreciate this fine work at a later time . Doubt it ,but it can happen
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! Once you start playing, you won't want to stop. I give this game 5 stars!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Great band, great music, great album!! Never get bored with their songs, especially &#34;Feels Like We Only Go Backwards&#34;. Can't wait for the next albums!!
B00A285OOW|5.0|If you are a fan of Philippa Gregory and this era of history, this is a must read! Was helpful to have read the White Queen before.
B00A5IYXY6|4.0|great cinematography; good plot; OK acting.  rented it immediately after catching the 2nd half on Turner.  amazon needs to fix their no ipad hdmi, though. . .
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Problem is the camera on a Kindle is on the front. You wouldn't believe the contortions I've done to take pics with it. But it works wel other than that.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|perfect for stereo recording using two mics and audacity.  zero detectable noise, good pre's, fairly priced.<br /><br />amazon, thanks for carrying it, but then what don't you sell?
B008469DGY|5.0|Really like this game, but was disappointed there was no putting. But as far as driving, it's challenging and fun and the graphics are beautiful.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This season is great!  I will watch this show until they stop filming.  The mix of comedy one liners and deep drama keep me drawn in.  Love it!
B00CSYR432|5.0|From Up on Poppy Hill is one of my favorites of Studio Ghibli and its music, despite it not being composed by Joe Hisaishi, instead Satoshi Takebe. Be sure to check out Satoshi Takebe's and Aoi Teshima's music as well.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful, and reflects the 1960's well. I am always impressed by the seiyuu (Japanese voice actors/actresses).<br /><br />The story is extravagant in its own way, just like Spirited Away. It leads you to assume the ending when it's not actually true. I enjoyed that part the most.<br /><br />I remember I shed a tear when I first saw the trailer; the music and Aoi Teshima's soft melodic crooning voice along with the main characters' indirect interaction was so excellent.<br /><br />I am so glad From Up on Poppy Hill is finally released in the US. It's appropriate for children to watch; they will have another edition of Studio Ghibli to add to their childhood, as did I.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I am officially hooked on this show.  This season is true to form in following through with what I expected!  Love it and love Sam and Dean!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this version of Mahjong. Have it on my laptop too. Easy to play and pause when interrupted.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever on andriod.its kinda like you can make your own magazine.or look at them for free
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|So...this is book two in the series, but I bet a reader can pick this one up and not feel like they've missed a beat. Sheryl clearly has a talent for blending her stories together. Nicely done.<br /><br />In this second installment, we get into several characters' heads and find out wht makes them smile, and annoys them to no end. I like that. We also get more of what made Bridalveil Falls so good...the mystical experience of two worlds, the enemy between them, and the amazing, strong girl at the center of it all...Oria. The story is engaging, the characters believable and fun (well, most of them, ha), the shape-shifting and Native American wisdom is powerful and magical. I'm actually going to recommend this book to my husband, and he really doesn't like most books. I think he will like this one.<br /><br />Recommend for all readers, YA up. Especially for those who enjoy Native American wisdom and spirituality.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I don't know if the short bio was plagiarized or not, but it was why I downloaded the book and I got the background info on the subject that I wanted. The rest of the book was a semi-academic musing on the nature of genius interspersed with random quotes about genius and imagination and the author's advertising of his other book. Glad it was free. For people who want an in-depth biography of Tesla, I would recommend searching for another book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love all of the walking dead...can't wait til next month for season 4!!! Carl is awesome Rick is amazing and Darrell is crazy lol but a bad ass
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was very well scripted. I loved the story. It was the most unique Zombie/Apocalypse movie I have ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Warm Bodies warmed my heart.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Just the game I been looking for thanks for the great game. I've love card games and this one is the best yes finally...
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|It seems to be a lot of convecture on the author's part. All opinion with no real facts.  Not recommended.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I have always liked this movie, but watching it recently after not having seen it for several years, I think it's far funnier than Shaun of the Dead, and a brilliant bit of movie making.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fell in live from chapter one I haven't been able to put it down ever since then though I feel rather distraught with the end
0688002307|3.0|After having this book recommended to me for years by one person I really like and respect, it was recommended to me by a second person I really like and respect, so I finally picked it up.  I don't know why it took me so long to read it, and I don't know why it's taken me equally as long to put these thoughts together.  I am concocting this from notes I left over 7 years ago, and this is the third time I've tried to put this together today.<br />I should really probably start by stating that I realized, about halfway through, that I am pretty solidly a member of the \\"Church of Reason,\\" and the Pirsig would probably hate me.  I am far more of a \\"destination\\" guy than I am a \\"journey\\" guy, and I think this jaded my reading of this somewhat.  I am either the exact wrong or the exact right audience for what Pirsig was intending to say...<br /><br />For me, this book was largely two books in one.  While we had the obvious narrative structure of the trip to San Francisco and the conversations that happened along the way, the underlying philosophies could have probably been presented on their own.  As much as I admire his ability to weave relatively complex ideas into a relatively mundane road trip story, I often wished that the two were separate.  I felt like the narrative as it was presented came across as flat and dry, and I often had trouble sinking into the story.  This is perhaps somewhat unfair as I was reading [[ASIN:0375725784 A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]] at the same time, which was absolutely engrossing for me, but the fact remains... I had a tough time with this one.<br /><br />I think that, due to the father/son-esque relationship between the main characters combined with the shared activity of road-tripping, I found myself comparing Zen even more to HWoSG.  The whimsical nature of Eggers's work was really more my style, so I found the narrator in Zen to be, not only dry, but also a bit pretentious.  As I made my way through the novel I found myself drawing more comparisons to [[ASIN:0553375407 Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit]] than HWoSG.  Here too we had a main character who seemed to believe himself to be on a different plane of understanding than the reader.  With Ishmael, however, I felt that pretention was acceptable due to the fantastical nature of the story.  If I am to suspend my belief enough to allow for a philosophizing talking gorilla, I am also prepared to allow that gorilla to preach at me all it wants.  With Zen, I just found myself put off by the tone and wanted to read about someone I found more likeable.<br /><br />Despite my issues with tone and my incompatibility with the author's approach to life, I still found numerous takeaways, and the book definitely had set my brain to work.  I don't think I'd ever really considered the idea of Quality as something that could exist in an object without being observed by another.  I still have a really hard time grasping that idea, but I did like the way in which Pirsig went about trying to bring people around to his way of thinking.  I think it was Quinn again (although, this time, I think it was [[ASIN:0553379011 The Story of B]]) from whom I first got the idea... It's not about changing WHAT people think but instead about changing HOW people think.  I liked the way Pirsig described it as needing to change the \\"roots\\" of an idea instead of its \\"branches.\\"  Even if my \\"root\\" didn't change, I very much like his philosophy on *how* to change it, and it is in that way that I think I am, perhaps, the perfect audience for this.<br /><br />One of the best illustrations in the story came with the description of an artist/mechanic/scientist working on something.  Some object.  Some goal.  The narrator insists that, to achieve Quality in the endeavor, the actor must lose the dualistic nature between himself and the object upon which he is acting.  The idea was, if I recall, expressed as \\"nonselfawareness.\\"  I think this is the thing with which I most readily identified.  Mostly all I want to do is lose myself.  I have a hard time believing that I have any ability to discover (or free) the existing Quality of an object, but the idea that I could lose who I am in service of a greater good is extremely tempting.  It is also a lot about focus... a quality I often lack.  It is so difficult to slow down and focus, especially in the &uuml;ber-fast pace of today's society.  How do we not focus on what is next?  Or maybe that's just my personal problem because I'm so insecure about the present and so scared of the future.  Precisely due to my fear, I really loved the Native American view of the flow of time presented here.  I would love to turn around, face the past, and let the future come at me, unseen, from behind.  My attempts to control, understand, and predict my own future have certainly saved me from pain, but they have also locked me out of chances to be happy.<br /><br />One thing I believe I'm omitting is the discussion of \\"Classic\\" vs. \\"Romantic\\" approaches to life.  In my heart, I think I want to believe that Romantic is not only possible but better.  Objectively and subjectively better.  I just can't get there.  Late in the novel Pirsig looked at this in a way which had him blaming the Greeks for allowing the world to lose an entire approach to life.  While it is rarely good to find ourselves in an homogenous environment of any type, I have a very difficult time giving so much credence to this romanticism.  It would stand to reason that the dominant way of thinking of any era is the way that it is because it worked.  I can't completely discount the idea of social Darwinism, so I find myself applying it to ways of thinking in this context.  To demonize the idea that the more dominant society would assimilate the less dominant ones (again, back to Ishmael) seems wholly unfair.  Of course just because something worked 2000 years ago doesn't meant that it would (or should) work for us now.  Therein lies the flaw in my argument... We spend a lot of time looking forward, thinking forward, and moving forward and perhaps not enough time looking back.  We certainly don't spend enough to recalculating how our approach came to be.  So is the real point of this still that we all just need to step back for a minute and approach the problem of life from a different angle?  An angle away from our egoist nature?  Turn our backs toward the future?<br /><br />So how do we get there?  Isn't this all about the journey?  Or is it about how you take the journey?  Of course there are bumps along the way, and most of us create our own obstacles.  Whether through our egoism and a lack of understand of what is actually best for us, by allowing our \\"value rigidity\\" to soften, bend, or break over time, or by allowing ourselves to be caught in \\"gumption traps,\\" it seems like all of these problems as presented are solvable simply by changing our outlook and approach to life.  At least according to this... not that it's easy... Can it all really boil down to that?  It very well may...<br /><br />I'm not really sure how to wind up my thoughts about the book.  I think that's a testament to how interesting the ideas presented really are.  There was no final, \\"ahhhhh...\\" feeling when it was over.  No real closure or happy ending.  It was totally sad to read the afterward, although I don't understand why he doesn't mention his other son.  Even after that jab in the afterward made me realize just how real the story really was, I still had a hard time caring about the actual narrative... the trip.  I just really wasn't interested in the relationship b/t narrator and son.  I wasn't interested in whether or not they made it to the ocean, and I didn't care if he sent Chris back on a bus or not. Although the language was very poetic and VERY descriptive, I still never got involved in the story that was being told.  I found it distracting and I would have much rather just read a third-person narrativeof Phaedrus's story.  I imagine that this style and the process of writing had to have been rather therapeutic for Pirsig, but it didn't really make for engaging reading for me.  The story under the story, no matter how pretentious I may have felt the author was, was still an incredible exercise in looking inward and understanding my approach to looking outward.  All-in-all, I'm glad to have read it even though I didn't particularly like the act of reading it.  That is, sadly, the case with most things for me though.  I like the way it made me think about things... as well as the simple fact that it did actually make me think about things.  And that was good enough.  So did I like the book?  The answer would be \\"mu.\\"<br /><br />Oh.  And the one thing I'm sure that I learned?  I NEVER want to take a cross-country trip on the BACK of a motorcycle.  Never.e flaw in my argument...

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Plays like any arcade or PS game. Fun though it takes an eternity to download. Not much involved with the movie from what I could see in the levels I played, but that might be a good thing.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Just great stuff.  Good ole fashion rock and roll with some great lead and rhythm in it.  A great trio for sure.

B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I have enjoyed his music since 2001, but Paradise Valley is his best effort to date.  It is honest and thoughtful without an ounce of pretense.  It does dip it's toes into the country genre,  but it is a pop/blues lovers version of country.  Quite palletable, as country goes
B008469DGY|5.0|GREAT FUN. It's golf without really being golf. Highly recommend. Easy to get the hang of it and really control the flight of the ball.
B002HXR542|1.0|The available digital format sucks . . . I would prefer a 1.99 rental. 9.99 is too much for streaming unless I really want the film. This costs too much.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I very much enjoyed being able to watch this series. Amazon Prime made it very easy to access and to watch
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to setup, pretty interface. Full featured with fade in. Wake up to ..your favorite songs. At $.99 this is a no brainer.  Try it you'll like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My mom even likes it.  I really like this game.  Cool game I play it all day.  It is super cool.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|We don't have the most blazing fast internet connection, but Netflix works on it just fine. Sometimes it has to downgrade us to non-HD quality, and that is fine. But Chromecast just stutters and is unusable. It also gets out of sync with the phone I'm casting from and often becomes non-responsive. It's nearly useless.
B00932DCS8|5.0|I was drawn into the movie from the beginning.  There was not a moment when I wasn't glued to the screen.  The plot is very fast moving and full of twists.  The main character, Roger, starts off being a not very likeable guy, but midway through you can't help but root for him.  I highly recommend this to someone who wants to escape into another world.
B005CVWWJY|1.0|A bad clich&eacute;. A Tron with some Harry Potter in it. Its not because the mix is weird. My low review is because the story spent more time detailing old video games than amazing me with the story itself or other possibilities for that happy.<br /><br />The story not even once surprise me. Even Aech doesn't do no good. Really Mr.Author good starting point, somehow a good title but the main story very very poor.<br /><br />A story with a happy ending without any good ideas.
B00BTHWFHE|5.0|It reminds me of the Time back when BS published &#34;Sabbath bloody sabbath&#34; and Sabotage only with a much better sound. &#34;Black&#34; is back!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|The movie had some stunning visuals, and the storyline kept my interest throughout the film. This film warrants a nice large HDTV in order to really appreciate.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|It's a great game...keeps you thinking but it's not frustrating..I like the size of the denim getting bigger, it's more challenging!!!  Overall a great game..no negative things to say about it!
B00008WT5M|5.0|The album is pure rock and roll, satisfying my expectations 100%. The songs are fantastic and the voice hoarse, feature vocalist, along with the amazing guitar solo of &#34;old student&#34; once again made ​​the perfect combination.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great series revival.  Even better than the original.  Steven Moffet is a genius and has created a worthy successor to the original.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This an AMAZINGLY AWESOME GAME!!! It's so much fun to play. When I look up, time seems to pass you by. I love this. Get this game. You won't regret it.

0385349947|5.0|LEAN THINKING?<br />I ordered \\"Lean In\\" because I wanted to know if Sandberg incorporates Lean Thinking from Lean Manufacturing, which is about eliminating waste and increasing flow. I didn't assume it did, and it doesn't.<br /><br />A DIFFERENT KIND OF POWER?<br />I also wondered how Sandberg uses the term \\"lean in.\\" I didn't see a definition of what she means by it, and as an author myself, I wondered if the title was selected after the book was written. I think of leaning in as a different kind of power that doesn't confront directly unless absolutely necessary in order to create allies and avoid triggering enemies. This is the kind of power Psyche used in \\"The Myth of Psyche\\" when she took the fleece of the golden rams that had caught on the branches while the rams slept, rather than confronting them directly in their wakefulness. I see this kind of power as one women have an advantage using, and I wanted to see if Sandberg frames her use of the term lean in as using this kind of power. Well, some of that thinking did get \\"caught in the branches\\" but it wasn't defined directly (or I didn't find it if it was.)<br /><br />A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE<br />Like many others, it was clear to me at many points that Sandberg lives a very different life than I do. It was clear when her hubby moved the central operations of an entire company so he could work closer to their shared home. Yeah. We do that every day. But rather than being a reason not to like the book, it was part of what made it fascinating. I'm different from Sandberg - and yet so many things are still the same in our different worlds.<br /><br />TRUE AT ALL LEVELS<br />I don't think much about how women are held to different standards and how women can undermine our own success with habits that men tend not to share, and I don't want to live inside that frame. But it's good to be reminded of how true that is, even at top levels. In my SpeakStrong work ([[ASIN:1600378641 Speak Strong: Say what you MEAN. MEANwhat you say. Don't be MEAN when you say it.]]), I find women often over-explain and, as Sandberg notes, use self-doubt as self-defense. Sandberg details how that shows up at top levels. Since most people at top levels seem intent on cultivating a public persona of certainty and perfection, her admissions and observations give rare insight. I am grateful to her for breaking that silence.<br /><br />SOME GREAT ADVICE<br />Sandberg offers some great communication advice, explaining that her recommendations come from the fact that women are held to a different/higher standard than men are. Her example of how she negotiated with Zuckerberg had some aspects of taking the fleece from the branches rather than direct confrontation. Sandberg prefaced her request with \\"of course you realize that you're hiring me to run your deal teams, so you want me to be a good negotiator. This is the only time you and I will ever be on opposite sides of the table.\\" She created and ally as she looked out for herself.<br /><br />This worked, because it's true. Too often people - and more often women than men to my experience - speak this way when it isn't true. Then it's not communication skill, it's BS. Leaning In as I understand and use the term requires more skill than directness alone.<br /><br />NOT A WORLD I WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN<br />I respect Sandberg for what she has done and for sharing with us how she does it. I am grateful to her for addressing gender issues despite it being a great way to put a target on her back. (The \\"whine and cheese\\" review title struck me as very uncalled for. Sandberg identifies a discrepancy without playing victim.) However, I also appreciate her defining how she makes it work, in part, because if I were to be jealous at all of her \\"privilege,\\" seeing how consuming it is for her erases any of that.<br /><br />LEANING IN TO PATRIMALARKEY<br />I agree with Sandberg that more women leaders would be a positive step forward. I also believe that change doesn'tjust come from the top. Now that there are more women in the workforce than men, I do believe and see that a more feminine style of being is infiltrating the workplace. So while learning and adopting from men an women who model masculine ways of doing things, it's becoming safer to be true to more feminine aspects of our natures. I'm talking about creativity and adaptability and inclusiveness to name a few aspects. I invite you to notice if the term \\"feminine\\" equates with weak in your mind. It doesn't in mine. It equates with balance for the over-dominance of masculine principles in our culture. I like to call that Patrimalarkey. (I don't advocate Matirmalarkey either.)<br /><br />CREATING A NEW GAME<br />I like the reviews that note that many women (and balanced men) create their own games rather than play the games men have created that suit unbalanced masculine natures to the exclusion of the more feminine values and approaches. I remember advice someone once gave me - it's not my job to beat my head against or tear down the structures around me. It's to create new structures that respect the people in them - including myself.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is the need for balance and the ability to be and communicate who we are. A world where we don't have to pretend we don't care when we do, where we don't have to pretend we don't know what we know, and where we don't have to pretend we want what we want. A world where women don't feel the need to be sword-wielding alpha males, and men don't feel a need to tiptoe around women who use doubt as self-defense. A world where the systems respect the people in them. My personal world is quite balanced, and this book will help me make some tweaks.<br /><br />There's a time to confront and wield the sword. There is a time to lean in. The skilled among us can do either, as the situation requires. The wise among us find or create worlds where we can live with and be ourselves with how much of either we are called to practice.<br /><br />Sandberg's world is too driven for my nature, but it works well for her, and I applaud that. Sandberg offers some great tips on how to navigate the work world as it is. She shares her humanity in ways few at her level do. It's a worthwhile read.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I managed to see the end of the movie...twice. So I decided to read the book. Loved it. While I have no interest in running away from it all, it was very relatable and a good reminder to step back and smell the roses.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Really good stories in this book.  I love short stories and John Grisham has delivered.  I read every one and will read them again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much that have a really hard time sharing it with my kids. Wonderful fun for the whole family.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love watching this show.  It is packed with so many things going on.  This helps make it fresh and interesting for each episode.  Cannot wait for Season 4:)
B007P7UF0G|3.0|This is one of my favorite musicals, and for that should have had 5 stars.  However the company who had put together this DVD made a huge boo-boo.  They did not match up the soundtracks.  The background musical soundtrack (not the main speaking or lead vocals) was all you could hear while the actors moved their mouths and seemed to be cut off.  It turned out the rest of the soundtrack was on a different Dolby channel.  I don't know how you can tell that will be a problem until you play something.  I'm only glad I didn't give it as a gift.

159562015X|3.0|Was disappointed that I didn't have a code i needed to take a test that supported the book. I received no shipping slip and didn't know certain rules applied to certain products. I was told I had to contact the publisher for it. Still waiting the out come.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|To long. Story isn't that good. Tom Cruise not a good actor. It has its moments, if you can't find anything else to watch and have 2 hours go for it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting is superb, the storyline is engaging and I couldn't wait to watch each episode. The costumes and decor are true to the times.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The first 90% of the book was well-written and engaging. I really liked perspective of the two main characters off-set in time. I found both sides very easy to relate to and believable. The last few chapters of the book did have the same depth and interest as the first 90% of the book.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have only ever read one other book of his and I might be hooked now after this one. Good book
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie had the potential to be saccharine sweet, but instead was a carefully crafted story of the relationships between long time friends and the revelations that come on a trip requested by one of their number who was terminally ill.  Predictable, perhaps a little, but also funny , engaging and thoughtful....with breathtaking scenery!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is a great stylus and works perfectly on my Kindle Touch and on my Kindle Fire...Amazon requiring 3 more words here!
B008JFUR10|5.0|First Off, This Was A Great movie...And one that hasn't been out in a while. Don't mind the bad critics....THEY ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO SAY ABOUT EVERYTHING JUST LIKE PEOPLE ON TRIPADVISOR. Trust me when i say it was great. It wasn't a mega plot made u think hard about the story kind of movie......it was action, with no dull moments, a little romance, and little to no profanity...likes of which i haven't seen in a long time..Only Movie i know of, with that kind of nature is Pirates of the Caribbean....People go to the movies and expect way to much...if it has action and a good story... enough to keep me watching, on my toes and eager for more, then by God that is a good movie.....what I'm tryna say is that in a few months it'll be on Red box or something, rent it, and come back and tell us if the movie was a blast or a dud. Personally i thought it was great and so do billions of other people...with a small fraction who happen to think it was crappy and a waste of time and money. Oh and if you happen to buy/rent...watch the end of the credits....Its funny...not crazy hilarious but funny...And this is Honest truth.<br />Hope you Enjoy the movie when it comes out.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a quick read. Written in a very conversational tone and easy to get through. it's a good story, but SUPER sad. i knew the premise of the book when i started it, but it was still sad. You know ultimately what's going to happen though so it's not a huge surprise. This is a good book — just very sad because it's about kids with cancer.
6305692572|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  A womans struggle with dependency, and her husbands struggle to cope.  And, how she turned her life around in so many different directions.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Great start and interesting show.  Develops the characters well, with a lot of interesting variables and situations. My wife and I like different characters from the show, some which are opposites, which means the writing is good in different, all subtle ways.  I'm a David Tennant fan as well, and he plays the character with a great deal of depth.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|didn't think I would like it -- but it is very entertaining, I could sit there for hours and watch the entire season
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Very fun. Instructions could be a bit clearer. But fast paced and entertaining. Different rule designs mix it up and having a story to follow us nice.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I can't seem to get assistance on this game when I cannot figure out on my own what direction to go in or how the puzzle works.  I started it over a year ago but have yet to complete it and haven't attempted to for several months now.  Too frustrating for me.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found the book hard to read I had to work at it to read and I only read the first four chapters. It was like going to school and doing homework
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My husband, sons and I like to see who can solve the puzzle first!  Very entertaining and can be extremely challenging but if you like puzzle-like games, this will keep you busy for hours!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is an amazing read. Loved it cover to cover. I love the idea of a child hero. Very unique.
1926778103|4.0|Darksiders 2 is way better than 1.  Not so with the art books.  Here's why:<br />This thing is longer by over 70 pages.  Most of the art isn't tiny and the Environments (places) section isn't as scant.  I really like this book.  Also, a lot more full color Joe Mad pieces are in this one.  It had characters, enemies, weapons, objects and areas.  Also, it has quite a bit more commentary (the second book has next to none).  Although that commentary is hyper cheesy fantasy descriptions of the various subjects in this book.<br />Although War is the focus, this one has art of all 4 horseman.  The boss pictures are bigger and better and all but one are drawn.  Plus, it has Samael who is missing from the second book.  The Griever has no concept art but he is in the back.  Which is another great part of this book.<br />  In the end there are the full color CGI models from the game.  What a nice touch.  The second book has that but they are tiny and not colored.<br />If you are into Joe Mad's art (the other artists mimic his style phenomenally well), comic style fantasy art with Gothic undertones or the Darksiders games: get this.<br />I have the second printing and the binding isn't woefully flimsy like in the first, but it's still pretty bad.  You have to be careful when flipping through it.  A real drag some of these older Udon softcovers are afflicted by this because they are excellent books otherwise.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is very help word so yea the game is fun guy f th Nick oh I buggy had chin bling high
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's YA, great for middle schoolers, but grown ups will get something out of it too. Highly recommend to any age group !!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great production values, characters that draw you in, story line keeps you guessing.  This is no sifi original with broken cgi.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought this book was fun to read.  Kept my attention.  The suspense in the beginning was terrific, I liked how each chapter ended like a cliff hanger.  In the end, I thought maybe there was too many stories lines, that all came neatly together at the end and that was just okay for me.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I simply love this movie, great effects and good plot also not to bad of acting. I recommend this movie.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a very fun games yes there are ads but where isn't there I don't think I have any game that doesn't in some form advertise. I've just started playing I'm sure like any game there will be kinks and crashes.it's just a game
B00C2PO09I|5.0|Just love watching any movie on 3D, this one was fantastic to watch. I recommend this to all my friends.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I remember this book being one of my favorites as a child but couldn't remember the story, much less why. And I didn't know it was part of a quartet! I'm finishing the others on audiobook. Great story!
B005HS4CUY|5.0|This movie is a classic, my son and I watched Toy Story about 100 or so times. As the other two came out we watched them also, even as he got older we still watched them. As I saw the 3D box set I knew I had to get it. Stand alone the three cartoons are a classic good movie, now adding 3D is simply a bonus! I recommend this 3D box set to everyone of all ages.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Not a great movie but still worth watching.  Acting was so so - story line a bit weak but for some reason I liked it.
1400079144|4.0|Superb book could not put down. Story holds you throughout the book. I recommend to everyone would enjoyed other Dan Brown books. However story is a great read even if you have never read Dan Brown.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this was a very good book. one of my favorites. it was a little confusing and i had to reread a couple of paragaphs but over all it is my favorite book
1452126577|4.0|I like the book which is a Christmas gift to a Grumpy Cat fan. It is quite humorous and well put together.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|My 2 yr old and 5 yr old both like these puzzles and the balloons they get to pop when they get them right. The 2 year old has learned placement fast through this. The 5 year old just does it because it's easy for him but he needs to feel accomplishments so I'm good with that.
1452126607|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the calendar as it is part of a Christmas gift to a Grumpy Cat fan.  I thought the pics and comments would have been better. I do however appreciate the large squares for the days as I write in them.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I bought this dvd thinking I could pop it in and watch it, but was unaware that it was only viewable in certain \\" regions\\" the movie I received could only be viewed on dvd players in Japan, or other South Pacific Countries. I had no use foe it so it went in the trash. I will never buy feom this company again.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The plot goes very well in the begining, but in the finals chapters I think that the author could do better.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|What a true value of family and doing all you can for your children.  She was the true heroine to choose to go with her husband even though she knew it would probably be death.  He was the hero to keep his son safe no matter what.  I loved it.
0399165274|2.0|I was not very impressed with \\"The Kill List.\\" This is my first Frederick Forsyth book, but to me, it was slow, rather poorly assembled, and lacked a very satisfying ending.<br /><br />The story follows a Marine, code named \\"The Tracker,\\" as he's tasked with bringing a Muslim terrorist to justice. This terrorist, named \\"The Preacher,\\" posts videos online encouraging his followers to take out small fish--people who are important in their communities. This apparently is easier than trying to put a big plan, ala 9/11, together. A subplot to the story has a Norwegian merchant ship getting captured by Somali pirates. The two plots eventually merge together to make it somewhat interesting. Of course, you must also throw in a geek boy who never leaves his Virginia home--but, with all sorts of government computing power provided by The Tracker--can break into any system, any where, any time. C'mon.<br /><br />Two other things bug me about the book: For several of the main characters, we get their entire bios up front. I don't think all that info was very important, number one, and two, if it was, it should have been spread out some, rather than front-loading the novel with all this character stuff. Second, while we learn early on The Tracker's name, Forsyth continues to call him The Tracker. Or sometimes he calls him just Tracker. Yes, it's an anal retentive complaint, but there it is.<br /><br />The final act is really the best part of the book, but there's certainly no surprises and it's really rather pedestrian, especially if you've read Flynn (RIP), DeMille, or especially Matthew Reilly.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Entertaining and creative! Thoughtful story writing brings added interest to Mahjong and comic venue provides a mission and motivation to continue completing tile matching to reach higher levels. Nice use colorful backgrounds and bright tiles that are readily available to match, while remaining tiles underneath are muted until they are freed. Fun to play!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Conns: doesn't come with instructions &amp; Only has 10 levels (Rooms) After finishing, you want MORE!!<br /> Its a bit hard to figure out at first but it is addicting. Me &amp; my Mom played it all day! Went beyond my expectations. Also this app never asks for money later on or bribes you to rate it. I only had one add pop up all day so your never inconvenienced!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have always loved this tv show. Saw it first on tv and knew i had to get it once the crazy price went down. love having this in my cd collection! Great ww2 show with a great cast
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It was quite different from the original, but it was okay. I wouldn't watch it again, but it was worth watching once.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love most shows that Masterpiece Theatre produce and this is no exception.  The series has so many highs and lows and you connect with so many characters.  I loved and hated season 3 due to some characters that were lost, and the season ending shocked me!  I wont spoil it for any who have not seen it, but be prepared!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Deane Johnson superstardom he is a talented actor, with a very good supporting cast. I have high hopes for another G.I.Joe movie.
0345803485|1.0|First off I do not understand for a second why this book has become so huge! I was insulted as a woman when I read this book and cringed multiple times, the only reason I kept going was in the naïve hope something good would come out of it and it would magically have something to offer. This book encourages woman to be treated like brainless, submissive morons and the fact that women found it so romantic absolutely kills me! Not only was it promoting sticking through abusive toxic relationships but the writing was lacking any skill. Please spend your money and time elsewhere, trust me!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This is a nice little unit.  Well built and works great.  I have Home Theater receiver that will not play digital music in the \\"Zone 2.\\" This converter allowed me to take the digital signal from Apple TV (via toslink) and plug it into the analog CD input on the Home Theater receiver.  Now I can listen to my digital music collection by the pool (Zone 2).  I am very impressed and pleased that I purchased with this unit.  The sound quality is excellent without any detectable signal artifacts.  Highly recommended.  I've only had it hooked up for a day, so I'll be sure to update if anything goes wrong.
125000098X|3.0|Ho hum, formulaic...not as good as the first 2. Will get the next one from the library...hope it's much better!!
B0091UA5E6|4.0|I would give this movie 5 stars just based on Henry Cavill's hotness ( and his characters personality), but it was extremely violent and some scenes were hard for me to watch. But I am a girl...  My husband loves this movie.  Very 300 like.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book is all interviews that a reporter did after the zombie war. Not a book about any single person or story
0812550706|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and I thought it showed so much intelligence for a kids' book. I think all ages could enjoy it as well
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Effortless to learn, but quite deep and strategic.doesn't yet appear to have particularly bad balance issues. Nice art, too. DLC is par for Gameloft, I.e., absurdly expensive, but still fun.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I guess I've had my fill of the Ahnold. The movie was ok, but enjoyable. Certainly worth seeing, but nothing to rave about.
B004UPANAI|5.0|One of my action favorite movies. Hugh Jackman always puts on a good show! If you liked the X-men series you would enjoy this.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|a great look at our potential future and inside the reality of our lives, the synchronicity of souls, and the possibilities that lie ahead of us. worth seeing, if anything, for an escape from normalcy.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The love that Gideon and Eva feel for each other is wonderful and exciting. They have their ups and downs but they always find the way to each other.<br /><br />I'd love for a man to feel the way Gideon feels about Eva toward me. He can't stand to be away from her and makes sure she knows it. I love how he tells her that he NEEDS her instead of wants her.<br /><br />Throughout the series, I've fallen more and more in love with the characters. I feel the pain they are in, the sorrow during sad moments, and of course the sexual tension...enough said.<br /><br />I hope there will be more to come. I'm looking forward to it.
B001XUY818|4.0|Great movie it has been a long time since I saw it and the first time my wife saw it
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is a good read.  There were quite a few unexpected twists and turns in the story. Which kept my interest.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Amazing story for any dog lover!<br />Wonderful perspective from the dog's point of view.<br />You'll look at your dog differently afterwards!
B003G4W49C|5.0|English assignment but still great book<br />I I I I buy th u....I s. Book for English it. A great book
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I couldn't believe how many decals came with the package, and my 3 year-old daughter loves the jewels on the wall. She shows them to everyone who comes in her room. Wonderful purchase.
B00DHHWYAW|1.0|This is quite possible the worst movie in 2013.  The music was horrendous.  Rap music in the 20s?  Give me a break.  Was this a bungled attempt to turn this into a sort of part of somewhat maybe a musical?  The music was bad.  The acting was bad.  What a waste of time and money.  We saw this on a DVD and even that was a waste.  I feel sorry for anyone who paid full fare at a movie theater.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Good stuff from Alfred.. I just like to watch this every now and then as a memory refresher. Prime video on Amazon makes it quick and easy to access when the urge hits me.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  One of my favorites.  The only album I listen to daily.  Look forward to more of her work.
B004ZNA7WY|3.0|There is enough Floyd like weirdness, just not that depressing edge that the Roger brings to the whole Pink Floyd experience.  I like David Gilmore's solo work better.
1444730568|3.0|The &#34;flipback&#34; idea is awesome. The execution is poor. This tiny book is made of cheap materials: The spine wrinkles, the cover doesn't lie flat, and the page quality is flimsy.<br /><br />But... it's Pride and Prejudice, so the story is top-notch.
B004ZNA5JO|3.0|I love David Gilmore's work, but that hard edge is missing.  This just doesn't have the same head-slap as the old Pink Floyd has.  Sorry fans, good, but not great!
B004VYYA2K|2.0|If you want to use this purely as decoration, yay! You've found a good purpose for it.<br /><br />If you want to use it as a storage box, you should keep looking. Flimsy box won't stay in one piece and the box lid won't stay secured.
B00001NFCY|3.0|I guess I just don't see, or hear, the overwhelming musicality that so many others have found in this album.  It was rather blah to me.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was lucky enough to snag this book in e-format before Amazon pulled it (to publish in paper). The story was so fresh and well-conceived that I have loaned my Kindle out to friends who missed out on buying this book when it was available. I can't wait for the movie--I think it's inevitable.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I never remember this movie being released in theatres. I like Matthew McConaughey so $3.99 was worth it to see what it was all about. It's different, it's interesting, totally worth $3.99.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very disappointed after all of the hype.  Tried to connect this device using two different wifi access points (Verizon FIOS and ASUS AP), and after several hours of troubleshooting and trying different wifi configurations, the chromecast never did connect.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|The short & sweet review:<br />If you are already raising bilingual children, or considering it, buy this book. It is THE foundation for your bilingual library.<br /><br />The more in-depth review:<br />Annika Bourgogne starts off by establishing her credentials. It's quickly clear that she is qualified to talk about this subject, not only by virtue of her studies, but because she is raising her children in a bilingual household. Though she grew up monolingual, she was surrounded by two languages and cultures. She is well aware of the many theories surrounding bilingualism, including those suggesting it is somehow detrimental. Right away, the reader sees that she is not speaking from an academic ivory tower. Though she includes useful information from various studies, she is living the experience, just like the rest of us who are looking for real advice.<br /><br />I found the book's layout extremely helpful. Ms Bourgogne starts with generalities, then brings in the research, and finally, adds in real-life advice from the parents who have \\"been there, done that.\\" This makes it easy for the reader to sort through the information and find what will be useful for his/her family.<br /><br />She seems to be a strong proponent of \\"whatever works for your family is the right way,\\" which is  refreshing when so many books on bilingualism are staunch supporters of their way (MLAH vs OPOL), and their way only, eschewing the \\"other\\" viewpoint as fundamentally flawed and destined to fail.<br />She encourages parents to be sure their child is getting enough of the minority language, time-wise, in the interest of keeping the child's skill level up to par in that language, but does not push any specific methodological agenda.<br /><br />Ms Bourgogne's book is full of actual, useful suggestions. She lists various websites that may be helpful, and gives plenty of real-life advice on how to enhance exposition to the minority language. She also deals with the common questions parents face, like, \\"What do I do when my child won't speak my language?\\" She makes an interesting point about how to conciliate various language activities with different personality types, which is something I haven't seen addressed elsewhere.<br /><br />I am currently raising two bilingual sons who are both in primary school, and I've lived in my adopted country for about fifteen years now. I started studying my second language at age 12, and have studied linguistics, phonetics, language acquisition and speech language pathology, along with other books about raising bilingual kids. So I don't think of myself as a novice as far as bilingualism or raising bilingual children is concerned. For that reason, I didn't learn a lot from this book that I haven't read before elsewhere - however, this book sums everything up very neatly. Its presentation of the available information and its practical suggestions make it a perfect read for the parent who is beginning his or her foray into the world of raising a bilingual child, or for the parent who is already deep in the trenches but is looking for a clear, concise review of the subject. This book should be the cornerstone of any library dealing with raising bilingual children.<br /><br />FTC Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Entertaining, visually exciting and well-written, very entertaining movie. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic, bringing wit and charm to the role.
0374531269|4.0|This was a summer reading project assignment for my daughter. She did not like the book at all it just not here type of book to read.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Easy to read and entertaining. Reminded this working, new mom that she's not the only over-thinking worry wart who just wants the best for her kids out there. Great story teller with the perfect blend of normal life and celebrity.
0385523394|3.0|The show is a lot better.  The book was slow at times. Just didn't pull me in like I expected it to.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I removed this app.  Do not like the maps.  Downloaded my original version (2.3.22), but I was not allowed to install it.  What gives?  Are we forced to use the version YOU choose?
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This was a fun game AT FIRST.. but then I kind of got caught up in it and was purchasing gems that I didn't need, and then they didn't show in my account until I complained to TeamLava SEVERAL times.  The customer service I received from them was pretty horrible...  so I will never make any \\"in game\\" purchases again while playing this game.  It also takes a REALLY long time to cook most everything in the restaurant, which makes for a very long day...  16 hrs to make a tuna melt, really?!?!  12 hrs to grill salmon?  mmm, ok.  It's all a scam to get you to purchase coins and gems, I have no doubt about that.  But take my advice, don't do it!!!!  I still play the game, as it is kinda fun.. but I will NEVER purchase anything from TeamLava ever again.
B003L77G06|2.0|2 of the DVDs are scratched so we are unable to watch 2 of the episodes.  It was rated &#34;like new&#34;.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game.  So fun and creative.  It can make me mad, but in a good way. :)  Highly recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This novel is very interesting.  I love the vintage photographs of children and how the story is woven around them.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A great overview of the business of IT, and how it impacts everything.  Even for a marketing guy like me, this was understandable and interesting.  Reads like a Lencioni story. After nearly 9 months at UrbanCode (now part of IBM) - it is cool to be a part of this movement.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so easy I was in the last room in not even an hour its the best game forvkidsvand adults.
0553381407|5.0|It's a great book, speaks a lot of my confusion of my feelings which very much related to my childhood how my parents treated me and some still going on. Learning from the book how to be assertive when dealing with my parents nowadays.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game. I used to play Shanghai a lot and this is better, in my opinion. The ads only appear at the beginning and don't bother me at all.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|No matter how many times I watch Casablanca, I feel like its the first. A part of Hollywood gone past<br />with real actors playing characters that you care about, you root for, and sometimes you wish you<br />where. So here is looking at you Kid.
1936719010|3.0|Pressfield's &#34;Do the Work&#34; is an easy read that lays out a process and mindset for getting a task done.  It is highly appropriate to someone who is faced with an individual, intellectual task like writing a book.  It may be less helpful to someone facing a people-oriented task (like accomplishing a team-based objective).  The book contains a few useful anecdotes, but is overall just...Okay.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|Japan is a wonderful country today, but it committed horrendous crimes against China and prisoners of war.  This is a reminder of the horrors of WWII.<br /><br />This movie is a classic and must be seen.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you're looking for an easy but entertaining read about mythological creatures with a little bit of romance, this book is for you. I couldn't put it down!
B006VRDZ44|5.0|I am just now watching this as I was preoccupied when it originally came out.  Wow.  Very impressive in all ways.  I'm glad I finally got around to it.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|A master piece. Almost too real to watch, however In reality the story was probably close to what was real. My grand son would not watch it because it was in black and white. He says with all the technology that is available, why was it filmed in B&W. He doesn't have much eye for art.<br />great achievement. Lots of research.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book sucked me in quickly and was worth the read.  A great book about the use and abuse of power over others and the power that each individual has to protect themselves.
6310292196|5.0|I bought this movie from England because it had not been released in the US yet. Region B will not play an a regular Blu-ray player, so a while back, I purchased an all region Blu-ray player beaches there were several movies I wanted that were region B produced.<br />This is a well written story. Beautifully produced and directed.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|not up to austens individual story lines. the characters had very little character and not too much going on, too bad
B005N1OUSE|3.0|Although it gave me some good ideas i think i can develop further, i did not feel i reached the aha moment in any of the chapters.<br />Personally, i would have liked to have more ideas on how generic drawings could apply to different concepts or ideas i want to show.<br />I recommend this book for people that are not very familiar with charts and ppts. In my case, i work in an engineering environment and i see tons of drawings and power points presentations with tons of concepts, charts and diagrams that although are not always clear, are our main means of sharing our ideas. Thus, what was shown in this book was nothing new for me and will not be for a person used to read between lines seeking for the real substance of the messages in an structured and logical way.
1936594234|5.0|I have a copy of this book that is 30 years old.  Wanted to reread it (as it works) however my old copy was falling apart. Was happy to have located it on Amazon.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent classic sci fi storytelling!! I read the book very quickly. Looking forward to seeing how the movie goes,since the book is always better... Anyway I can't wait to read more from this author.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|My first experience of Judge Dredd was a  comic book in which the anti-aircraft defenses of Megacity One detected, acquired and shot down Santa Claus.  Then came the fairly crappy Stallone movie.  Dredd, however is a great example of a decently plotted, acted and filmed SciFi movie that rarely comes out anymore, similar in scope to \\"Pitch Black\\" or \\"Distrcit 9\\", IE, what you can do for $25-45 million bucks.  I loved it.<br />  The sense of barely contained chaos, overflowing humanity, apathy and violence is transmitted with basically every frame.  Best part: Karl Urban never takes his helmet off.  The 3D didn't really add or subtract anything, but I recommend this to any Dredd or SciFi fan.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Love the book, love the series as a whole and love the HBO version of his books. I can't wait to read the next book.  Wonderful, wonderful author and story.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Can anyone tell me why we don't get upgrades? On survival craft you get more for less!!! Anyone who is interested in buying this game trust me. I would choose survival craft than this game anyday.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this game because it's a different twist on hidden object games. It actually evolves as more levels will be added and as long as you are patient, the game is actually free to use!
B00EEXST2K|2.0|I thought She did a good job, the story is kind of boring...predictable...and untrue. The real Lovelace did more than just one film (some other really nastyones) and she endured other stuff not covered in the film. So not interesting to me.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|I bought this movie because I had seen that Matt Bomer was in the cast. I did not like the movie and it was a little hard for me to follow. First it was more like science fiction and I'm not really into that stuff. I did see the character that Matt Bomer played and beyond that point I simply lost interest. The possibility of life in the future being like that was a little hard for me to wrap my head around. For some who are into that type of thinking the movie would be good, but not for me
B00AFEX83C|1.0|totally loved the movie but the cd was very scratched up and didn't work well at all. very great movie though, awesome for the whole family to watch:)
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|The movie was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat. You keep hoping that she doesn't get found out during some of the scenes. The ending was very unexpected. I considered it one of those that you never saw coming. I have recommended this movie to my friends and family as one of the best films I'd seen in a while.. I had been looking forward to seeing it and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app all the time to check the life of the battery and if it requires recharging<br />Simple and effective to use<br />Love it
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|I did not watch this movie until I had nothing left to watch and I'm glad it worked out this way. The movie was very boring to say the least. Justin Timberlake did a good job of acting as did Mila Cunis. The story itself held no reality with it. It should have been called How to Have almost Constant Sex with Someone You're Not in Love With. Even at the end when they finally discovered that their relationship was more that just friends. I don't think the movie should have played out the way it did. I think it should have been relationship, friendship and then sex. It leaves the audience a little confused by the order in which things should go.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book. It was the first book I read on my Kindle and I loved it. Shocking ending.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Can't seem to do very well but 5 year old granddaughter does great I guess I need more instruction to conquer
B008469DGY|5.0|Would recommend this game as a quick time killer for those boring meetings . Simple rules and acute skill needed to unlock new levels
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Excellent cast. Good writing. This series will keep you entertained. Definitely worth following & I don't watch network TV because 95% of it sucks. I am not a fan of Tony Scott's work but I am a fan of Ridley's work. Whoever is responsible did a really good job.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Wish I would have thought of this. They did not have them with my kids so after seeing my nephew with one, I thought they were great baby shower gifts. The moms have loved it.
B008469DGY|4.0|Great time killer.  Lots of fun and great graphics/scenery.  Love that you can control where the ball goes.  Different kind of golf game and super fun.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another job well done! These games were never really my thing, but people told me I had to try. So glad I did! I'm totally addicted. Everyone should definitely give it a try! They have so many to choose.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are so cute and it is perfect for minion fans. could there be one eyed minions in the game? that would be cool.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|started off slow got good then ended with the usual cliffhanger with one i didnt see coming good show until next season
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie that everyone could enjoy. Its wholesome, cute and I bet everyone who watches the movie will love it!
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|I purchased a new good book for $.00 and was surprised to find it was the whole book. Thank you
1250029465|5.0|I saw a youtube video on James Bowen and his cat named Bob and fell in love with the cat, the story and the bond between owner and pet, which Bob is actually much more than that.  It is an inspirational story how one can turn their life around by having to care for something else besides oneself. I recently lost my father and this instantly cheered me up.  My dad would've loved Bob the streetcat.  Thank you for a wonderful, heart-warming story.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is not only fun, but it is irrisistable with its mind blowing graphics I just got it and I'm already hooked!!!
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I have the big fish casino app on my ipod and ipad. At first it was fun, the graphics were good, the different slot options were interesting and kept my interest. They let you win a little here and there, but the minute you buy a chip package (which are pretty pricey), they will take your money so fast and if you dream of ever getting a jackpot, well good luck with that- it is pretty much impossible even if you spend a lot of real money to try to win one. And their 3x chips sale is the biggest joke, if you buy during that time, they will take it away from you 3x faster.  I wrote to their company and told them about their ridiculously tight slots (like betting max 20 times in a row and not getting anything) and just how unhappy I was with the whole gaming experience.There response was this: that in order to keep it fair, they keep the odds the same for everyone even people who don't pay for their (expensive) chip packages. Wow, really??To me, that doesn't seem fair to the people who shell out the money for their in app purchases, they do nothing for customer loyalty and offer no incentive for people who pay to play their games. For them, it's too bad, better luck next time. Oh and another favorite response they love giving is: sometimes the slots are tight and sometimes they are loose, if you find yourself losing too much, lower your bets.I guess you have to be a real life millionaire to be a millionaire in their casino too. I don't understand why they are so stingy with their chips, they are fake chips, if people buy their chips then they should be more generous during slot play, they don't have to make it super hard Vegas style, we are not winning real money here.<br />So warning to all, do not download this app if you can help it and especially don't buy their chips, they will make it even harder for you to win because they want you to keep buying!The itunes store rates this app almost 5 stars, but it is lie, amazon reviewers know what's up.  This game is the devil!
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|This fantasy movie is a well told story with suspense, drama and lots of humor!  It is dark and scary in some parts, so not appropriate for small children.  Muppet creator Jim Henson creates some of the characters in this movie with such detail that while watching the movie, one can easily forget it isn't real!
B004HYDL1K|5.0|But I do.  This movie is ridiculously violent, hilarious and fun.  I will not only watch it again, I'm looking forward to buying it.
B0011FL7FA|4.0|The actor chemistries play off of each other to tell this tale of the conflict, heartaches and the challenges of growing up during the Vietnam era.  The lead characters are given names from Beatles songs such as Lucy, Jude, dear Prudence, JoJo, Mr. Kite and Sadie.  A new twist is given to classic Beatles tunes and incorporated into the story enhancing the lyrics into a completely different interpretation.  As a long time Beatles fan, it took me a while to get into this movie but the more I watched, the more I liked it!  It is highly recommended!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you play Dragon slayer then you know me my review was best game in the world but I am not talking about Dragon slayer I am not talking about Dragon slayer I am talking about minecraft this app is a game were you have to survive.there is two modes creative and survival.creative is you don't have<br />any lives and you can fly.And we all know what survival is.
B00271HAK8|5.0|It's a classic! After 27 years it's just as funny to my teenagers as it was to me. Bow, bow, chica, chica, oh yeah, beautiful...
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Lot's of fun. I know this is for kids, But even at this age I could not resist myself playing with it. A very well characterized app. Tons of accessories for giving final touches to your characters. Kids love it including the biggest & oldest Kid in the house!<br /><br />Five stars from me.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Awesome! Great read. No wonder Kurt Vonnegut is a writing legend. I can't wait to read more of his books!
B005LJK3AC|2.0|Could have been humorous but was just lame, sophomoric humor, and filled with trash talk. Don't waste your time or money on this one
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Too bad Stalone didn't reprise his character but it was pulled off brilliantly. Definitely a shoot -em up Bad Guys vs Tougher Good Guys romp. Storyline was OK and worked to keep the action confined in the building.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun. KEEPS YOUR MIND GOING AND TRY THINKING. WISH THERE WAS MORE LEVELS. I like how every room has something a little different.
B001NA2NM4|5.0|Disabilities studies has been my passion for years. This film is a great historical piece showing the freak shows as they were. I loved that the film was not about how freaky the people with disabilities were, but about their revenge against able bodied persons. This film delighted me!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the first word to the last, I was entranced. Much like the winding staircase that connects the occupants of the Silo, Howey's writing style flows and draws you deeper into the lives of his characters. This is science fiction at some of its best.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think that this book was amazing ,and  I think this is best book in the world. That's only my opinion. I believe everyone should read, and you should be looking into getting this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A page turner that keeps you guessing! Definitely recommend this to anyone that loves mystery and surprise endings! A must read!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This new voice is full of promise with great lyrics and compelling music. All songs were good and<br />the whole CD was a good value and arrived on time as expected.
B006MGB31Q|5.0|I like Alien, and for this price is a winner. I never watch the extras so I don't miss the extra discs. The transfer quality of Alien is the best in whole anthology. I found the latest movies bluish in few scenes.  As long as you know the plot of The first Alien, second time, watching is rather boring experience. Many complain about &#34;Alien resurrection&#34;, but I found this one more interesting than &#34;Aliens&#34;
B00CXQL828|4.0|I've immensely enjoyed each of these musicians over the years.  As a huge guitar fan, Kotzen's solo stuff is a mandatory staple in my collection.  This albums sounds like his newest album with a technically perfect and flamboyant rhythm section.  Some outstanding timekeeping with progressive tempo changes, and great baselines and occasional leads; but it's basically Ritchie's voice and axe work that really steal the show.  Again, severely biased as an axe fan.  Give it a few listens, and you hear Ritchie, Ritchie, and more Ritchie.  You'll hear fantastic writing, playing, and production, but nothing raw or new for any of the players.  Let's see how the project evolves......excellent start!!
B00CEF014E|5.0|I am usually not a bloody and gory kind of girl mainly because it all usually seems so unreal. Aside from that, I am pretty jumpy when it comes to violence. However, this was so very suspense filled that I could hear sound effects as if I were sitting in the center of a cinema watching the story unfold. I love reading a book that is well written with a plat thick enough to trap you in your seat. This was absolutely a great thrill ride and just may have... turned me in the direction reading more thrillers. Bravo!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Story line was a bit confusing, but had some exciting scenes and nice special effects. Overall, we enjoyed the film.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I love this app. It makes pictures more fun. The sketch feature is my favorite. I recommend this to any one that likes to plat with pictures.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Provides such awesome stuff. But it is not as good as minecraft pc.but, it gets all of the new updates
B002RV01QI|5.0|After serving time with some family members in the Celtic pop band Clannad, Enya decided they were becoming too pop and set out for a solo career. It may have taken her two albums to perfect the sound she's become famous for, but when \\"Orinoco Flow\\" became an international hot single and propelled her 1988 album \\"Watermark\\" to multiplatinum status, Enya became an international pop star. Which is something of a misnomer, as what Enya records is anything but traditional pop. She utilizes old folk and Celtic sounds, lush overdubbing and multi-layered harmonies to create music that no-one else has ever come close to duplicating.<br /><br />That is why \\"The Very Best of Enya\\" is essential listening. The songs on this CD bent the arc of popular music and she became the best known musician of what was then called \\"New Age\\" music. More to the point, she transcended the faddish nature of the movement and continues to make music that resonates with the public to this day. While her music is gentle, she still has a dynamic sound. \\"Storms in Africa\\" ebbs and flows, building to its climax. \\"Only Time\\" (made popular after 9/11 as something radio used to calm listeners) gently lulled it's way into the top ten Billboard charts. her music is graceful and never disruptive, but she does so without resorting to the kind of Adult Contemporary radio bombast or condescending wimpiness. Enya creates music that comforts and brings the listener an experience in elegance.<br /><br />If there are any qualms here, it's that I probobaly would have been just fine without the Christmas Carol \\"Oiche Chiuin,\\" as it disrupts the originality of the rest of Enya's work. Also because the elegiac goodbye of \\"May It Be\\" would have brought the collection to a far more satisfying conclusion. \\"The Very Best of Enya\\" is music that transcended all the tropes of modern pop music and still stands as fresh and gorgeous as it has on the albums it's been culled from.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I recently fell in love with Catfish: the TV Show. So I decided why not watch the movie where it all started? Sure I already knew the ending (thanks to the intro to the TV show), but why not?<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, the documentary keeps the suspense building and there are quite a few twists and turns along the way. You may think you know the ending but it's much more involved than you think. I was taken aback on several occasions.<br /><br />All in all I think it is definitely a much watch. It's fascinating no matter your POV.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I liked it...it was a good movie I say watch it if you like si fi love stories...good effects...rated it 4
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series.  They leave me wanting more of Gideon and Eva - not wanting the story to end!  Love love love!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Excellent graphics and story.  Becomes a little difficult to follow but you eventually figure it out. Some items vital to continuing the game are placed in hard to find locations causing constant returning to previously played pages.
B00AYB16EO|3.0|Of course this is mind numbing and doesn't really require acting but sometimes you just need a real stupid crass show to watch in shame while everyone is gone. That's what the man cave is for..isn't it?
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Clint's westerns are always awesome. And, this movie is no exception. Good story, acting, actors, and execution.  To bad we rarely see comparable westerns anymore.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun little pass time and entertaining as well. Great game to keep kids busy when yo need a few minutes for mom.
1452126607|5.0|Too cute.  A must for any cat enthusiast!  It will make a great birthday present who really loves anything 'catty'.
0802473156|5.0|What a wonderful book for all readers. Gary Chapman's wisdom applies to all kinds of relationships. I have purchased more<br />copies for gifts. America would be in a better place if everyone read and applied the truths!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I know this is a classic, and I can see from the beautiful writing why, but those characters are just awful people! I felt anxiety reading this book everytime another life was ruined.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|We liked that there were of a lot of unexpected twists in the plot. We also liked that you think you know something but the outcome is completely different.<br />We really disliked (SPOILER ALERT) that The laughing man had to die to save Sal.<br /><br />If this were to become a movie, we would have Miranda be played by Genevieve Hannelius, the laughing man played by Johnny Depp, China Anne McClain would play Julia,  Annemarie played by Bailee Madison are our first choices!
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I bought this CD for my husband and he liked it, but not as much as his previous 2 albums.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun because it works your mind and tests your skills. It's the kind of game you can't<br /> stop playing.
B0000683DH|5.0|The only Trek is the one with Shatner.  I do not like the &#34;new&#34; Trek. These were great to add to my collection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Love the free extras on Facebook. The choice of bingo and slots is great that way you can mix it up.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Of course I have ALL of his music. This one I particularly liked.  It did come at a time in my life when I needed it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Game is addictive. 2 things I don't like is you can't earn medals to buy stuff, and over half my allies I can't go into there map to collect hearts. Keeps saying error and brings me back to war screen. But as for the medals. I understand you got to make money but you still be able to earn medals every time you complete a task.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|great.  Left them with my ex when we broke up cause it was one of his favorite shows.  Jerk. got lots of my movies too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great app and it not a waste of time...I high recommend you get this it's a lot of fun and you will like it
B000OVLBEY|5.0|This is the only movie I really like Cage in, and I think probably the only one I own of his.
B0001907DA|2.0|You get the entire 7-film set of Police Academy movies on 7 discs. The price has been as high as $130 so fans may prefer buying the 4-Film Favorites (x2) sold separately for $20 total. The bonus material is extremely light in either collection (each film gets 5-8 minutes of making-of featurettes). I rate the films 4 stars but this set gets 2 stars. [[ASIN:B002GSXKPG 4 Film Favorites: Police Academy (Police Academy, Police Academy 2, Police Academy 3, Police Academy 4)]]. [[ASIN:B002GSXKOC 4 Film Favorites: Cop Comedies (National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon, Police Academy 5, Police Academy 6, Police Academy 7)]].<br /><br />The Region 2/B Blu-ray collection offers all the films in widescreen (1.85:1).<br /><br />Special Features on DVD:<br />All 7 films including the 20th anniversary edition of the first film<br />All but parts 4 & 5 in widescreen<br />All parts have new making-of featurettes<br />Commentary on part 1
B00003CXA2|5.0|can't believe I waited so long to review this one.  I loved adding this to my collection!!  Tom Hanks is wonderful!!
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Top Gun was loved by many in the 1980's. None of us had a clue about what kind of message it sent other than being funny, action-oriented, well-cast, and with a great soundtrack. Even today \\"Maverick\\" and \\"Ice Man\\" are part of the lexicon. This two-disc combo comes with a Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D and a digital copy. The 3D is good but does have some flaws (the 2D transfer is better for some scenes). Overall, the picture quality is slightly above average but the audio really shines in this release. There is over 3 hours of total bonus content which is quite impressive.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />- Commentary by Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Director Tony Scott, Co-Screenwriter Jack Epps, Jr., and Naval Experts<br />- Danger Zone: The Making of Top Gun (6-Part Documentary)<br />- Multi-Angle Storyboards with Optional Commentary by Director Tony Scott, - Best Of The Best: Inside The Real Top Gun, - 4 Music Videos, - TV Spots<br />- Behind-The-Scenes Featurette, - Survival Training Featurette, - Tom Cruise Interviews<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B001F12J0C|5.0|great when me and my ex used to watch them.  Never go the chance to see them all cause I left them with him.
B00COWOXGE|4.0|This is a great thriller starring Harrison Ford as a man unjustly accused of killing his wife. There is almost 2 hours of bonus content included. The video looks great and the audio is even better. It is a noticeable improvement from the 2006 Blu-ray. My only complaint is the TV pilot from The Fugitive 2000 TV Series is included (not the original 1963 television pilot).<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Introduction by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford<br />Commentary by Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones<br />On the Run with the Fugitive<br />Derailed: Anatomy of a Train Wreck<br />Theatrical Trailer<br />\\"The Fugitive\\" (2000 WB Pilot)<br />The Fugitive: Thrill of the Chase<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B000025JMP|5.0|This album has a special place in my heart, as my parents would invite folks over and they would put this one on to dance to.  All the songs are fantastic and Elvis sounds his best on this one.
B001JAFYFG|3.0|Logan's Run is a fantastic adventure in the future. Logan is a Sandman (police officer) who must catch Runners (criminals) who flee the society-imposed restriction to go on Carousel (suicide) on your 30th birthday. Back in 1997, previous rights-holder MGM/UA Home Video issued 'Logan's Run' on Laserdisc in a Widescreen Collector's Edition that had some additional supplements. Among these were deleted scenes, two more vintage featurettes, an essay about the film, a reprinted article from 'American Cinematographer' magazine, script excerpts, and still galleries related to costume design and production photos. Unfortunately, none of those ever made the transition to the smaller disc formats. This film gets 5 stars but the Blu-ray only 3 stars.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Commentary by Michael York, director Michael Anderson, and costume designer Bill Thomas<br />Vintage featurette: A Look into the 23rd Century<br />Theatrical trailer
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|... since it was released.  I wanted to see it in the theatre but never got the chance.  It is a good one.  Glad I can add it to my collection.
B000QFW7UA|3.0|The 25th Anniversary of Goonies is a hard release to judge. It comes with a board game, movie storyboards, a magazine and an article with cast photos. That is an impressive amount of stuff. The picture and audio quality are fairly good. Oddly, the bonus content on the disc is less than 30 minutes (which was ported over from the 2001 DVD). It also contains an audio commentary. On the one hand it is loaded with goodies but the lack of video supplements is disappointing. The longest featurette is only 13 minutes and that's a music video. \\"The Making of the Goonies\\" documentary is only 7 minutes long. Ultimately, this is a set for diehard fans only since Goonies is now available separately on Blu-ray without the board game. Overall I rate the film 4 stars and this set gets 3 stars. The 25th Anniversary Edition has been able to hold its value.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Cast commentary with director and all seven actors<br />The Making of the Goonies documentary<br />Cyndi Lauper music video \\"The Goonies 'R Good Enough\\"<br />Outtakes<br />Includes new board game, original movie storyboard reproductions, 1985 souvenir magazine reprint, and reprint of 2009 Empire Magazine article with cast photos and updates

B0044XV3QY|5.0|James Cameron really outdid himself with the special effects in Avatar. This 3-disc Blu-ray release comes loaded with 8 hours of bonus content. The picture quality is superb and the audio is very good. While there is a 3D release this version remains the best for bonus supplements. However, fans with a 3D TV may consider buying the Blu-ray 3D release of the film.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround, English Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, English Descriptive Audio Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, English Family Audio Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, Spanish Subtitles, Portuguese Subtitles, Chinese Subtitles<br /><br />Special Features: 3 Versions of the Movie, Capturing Avatar, Deleted Scenes, Production Materials, Pandora's Box, Interactive Scene Deconstruction, Production Shorts (17 production related featurettes), Avatar Archives (including original scriptment, 300 page screenplay and the extensive Pandorapedia)<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray!

B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Jon sounds fantastic on this album.  Not  one of my favorite albums, but I could listen to his voice no matter what he sang!!
1616550414|3.0|Hyrule Historia is 280 pages and received a 2011 release in Japan (it was translated into English in 2013). It is a beautifully illustrated book about the excellent Legend of Zelda franchise. Overall, the book is dominated by pictures and has comparatively little text. The book is divided into 4 sections: 1) The Legend Begins: Skyward Sword, 2) The History of Hyrule: Chronology, 3) Creative Footprints: Artwork, and 4) Special Comic: Skyward Sword. On the plus side it has many sketches and concept art used in the series. However, this is not a comprehensive guide to the universe of Zelda because there is no overarching narrative pulling it all together. It's not really \\"Hyrule Historia\\" it's more \\"Hyrule Artoria\\". It could have contained an exhaustive backstory about Hyrule but it's more of a coffee table book dominated by visuals.<br /><br />While the authors try to link Hyrule's History together it is different from the stories provided in the instruction manuals originally provided with the games. For example, in the introduction it states Ganon was relentlessly pursuing the Triforce but did not become connected with it until Ocarina of Time. I have to take some exception to that otherwise he would not have split the Triforce of Wisdom into pieces in the original game. Hints on gameplay are also largely absent. Coverage of the games should have been presented in a chronological fashion to see how the Zelda universe developed over time. Ultimately, some of the games don't receive a lot of treatment so the result is somewhat lopsided. Skyward Sword (2011) gets most of the focus so it seems more like a promo piece to market the game when it was released in 2011. There is very little coverage on Majora's Mask, Link to the Past, or Link's Awakening. Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure (three action-adventure games produced by Philips for the CD-i in the 1990's) aren't mentioned at all. While I am a huge Zelda fan it is surprising this book managed to get a 5-star rating from Amazon reviewers. While it's very nice looking it makes me think Nintendo Power culled together some of their Zelda coverage and printed them in this book.his book managed to get a 5-star rating from Amazon reviewers.

B002UPA4ZY|5.0|My family will be hearing Andrea Bocelli at Christmas in Atlanta.  He is a favorite of mine and the concert will put us in a Christmas frame of mind.

B009LQKHIO|5.0|A heartwarming story. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book by Sanders. This and [[ASIN:B00EZGED94 Everlasting Light: A Civil War Novella (Civil War Romance)]] are my two favorite books this summer.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app. It's really good for waking up early to your fave music. I suggest you get it...
B004EPYZUS|5.0|went to see this one at the theatre and eagerly waited for it to come out so I could add it to my Cruise collection.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I totally enjoyed this movie. I'm not a movie snob, so I won't critique the acting, or compare it to anything else. I just have to say that I liked the movie, I hope they do a part 2. I loved how evil the witches looked. Plan on renting it again.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show - yes it is yet another lawyer show, but the banter that takes place is great.  The movie quote references are really fun to listen for.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I purchased this book, because it sounded so different. Plus it had almost 5 stars. I read a lot and maybe what I want out of a book is different. I like books that keep me from putting it down, books that make me laugh and cry, but come away with a good feeling. This book was well written until the last few chapters, then it felt like the author was just trying to get finished. The book was depressing all the way through! I expected a book about love and family between a white girl and the slaves. Yes there was a little of that,but mainly all about abuse. From child sexual abuse to constant abuse against the women of the book. No thanks, will stick to my feel good books.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The writing is witty and the chemistry in the actors are great. It is a different take then your typical lawyer drama.
B008MX7Z32|5.0|I'm a notary and I go into people's homes to sign documents.  I'm constantly surprised by the low light over people's dining tables and I can hardly see what I'm doing.  Bought this desk lamp to help and what a difference it makes!  Compact, light-weight, and SUPER BRIGHT.  I love it.<br /><br />Immediately ditched the little book lite I had been using (not nearly so bright, and it ate batteries like a box of See's Candy anyway).<br /><br />LOVE this light.  Makes a  h u g e  difference.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|When we reviewed this film, we had a feeling it would not be good. Worst-<br />it was horrific.  This film story line goes so fast, an entire audience<br />could easily lose track on what is going on.  Unneeded scenes of partial<br />nudity had no reason as just to give quick lust of individuals. People<br />rating this film with 5 stars have to be fabricated - or these individuals<br />are just an indication where film quality is going. Its hard to imagine<br />Spock in with an on going affair with lieutenant Uhura much less Spock<br />going crazy and violent. Something unbecoming of a Vulcan.  Non-the-less.  This<br />film is truly Garbage.  (Walters Judson Group film score:  57 (40-106).<br /><br />Brandon Eli Roman.

B00D8HNR5W|4.0|When I first heard the rumors of a future NIN release coming up sometime within the 2012/2013 time-frame, I was of course ecstatic to see what Mr. Reznor had cooked up for me this time. Yes, I had been following \\"how to destroy angels\\" and his contributions to movie soundtracks but I was craving a new NIN album to add to my collection. Of course like others I was a bit weary to see that Trent had taken the dive back into the corporate sludge that is a record company but it was a new NIN album for crying out loud! Fast forward to June 6 of this year and the single \\"Came Back Haunted\\" was released with a slightly tepid fanfare. A good chunk of NIN fans, myself included, were disappointed that the newest offering was basically where we were had left off after The Slip. Don't get me wrong, the song itself was definitely up to par to what I love about NIN, but it left me wanting for something more. The one thing I loved about Trent's music is its constant evolution in sound and structure since Pretty Hate Machine debuted in 1989.<br /><br />Thankfully, with the release of \\"Copy of a\\" my fears of stagnation were quickly put aside. This time around the tracks are not going to automatically stand out in the first listening session. This is an album that needs to grow on you after the next 2-3 listens before it gives you an impression. Trent seems to have mixed bits in pieces from every other NIN album and combine them with a more atmospheric or minimalistic sound. Guitar's are still featured here but are not at the forfront of the album. This is not \\"The Downward Spiral\\" with its aggressive guitar-work, schizophrenic drum beats, and bitter/cynic lyrics that were spat through your speakers as a young adult in the '90s. That was when Trent was a younger man who showed a resentment to the world around him. Now, he's happily married with two children, older, wiser, and has freedom to release whatever he feels like. And with that freedom it seems this time around he wanted to experiment and broaden NIN's catalog of songs. Heck, I was as shocked as anyone when \\"Everything\\" was released a little over a week ago and left scratching my head on what influenced this tracks creation. It sounds more along the lines of a Joy Division or The Cure then a NIN track but its certainly nice to see that Trent isn't scared branch out from the norm.<br /><br />There will be a divide on this album of people who love it and people who hate it with a good amount left over who are on the fence whether it is a great album or not. That's OK. We wouldn't be NIN fans if we all mindlessly bought each new release from Trent without some gripes about how it could be better. After being gifted with gems like \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\" we've come to expect each new NIN release to be compared to those two records. This album is a hit or miss for people because of it but at least give it a shot before trashing it. Anyway, I guess I can go with my track by track review now with that off my chest.<br /><br />1. The Eater of Dreams: Pretty good set up for the album where it slowly builds up until it kicks into the first official song. 6.5/10<br />2. Copy of a: Definitely one of the catchiest track on the album with a memorable hook. Some great guitar work from as well. 9.5/10<br />3. Came Back Haunted: As the first single I can understand its release but its basically what we all have come to expect as a NIN single. 8.5/10<br />4. Find My Way: This is a slow burner that gradually builds until the end and leaves me satisfied. The lyrics may be a bit simple from most NIN songs but they work. I can see where a few reviews have stated it could fit on The Fragile. 9/10<br />5. All Time Low: This opening brings me back to my days tolling hours on my PS with FFVII. This track is surprisingly catchy in its structure with some nice lyrics throughout. It may take time for some to get use to Trent's singing but it takes me back to the style used in \\"Down In It\\"  10/10<br />6. Disappointed: I found this track to be quite enjoyable since it features some of my favorite NIN elements. It slowly builds in intensity until the end where it resolves into some catchy beats. 9/10<br />7. Everything: Did this not come out of left field or what. It definitely features pop-rock elements from the 80s but its still pretty good. The whole track is catchy but is still awkward when its placed between \\"Disappointed\\" and \\"Satellite\\". 7.5/10<br />8. Satellite: At first I wasn't a big fan of this track but it slowly grew on me. The stop/start method with witch Trent sings kind of threw me for a loop. Funnily enough it reminded me of a certain singer that will remain anonymous as of now. 8/10<br />9. Various Methods of Escape: Here is where the album really starts to pick up. As others have stated this is one of the more accessible track on this album which reminds me of \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\" with it intensity in witch Trent sings the song. 10/10<br />10. Running: That beat. If this doesn't feature some of the catchiest pieces on this album I don't know what your hearing. Yes that awkward bit near the middle and the end takes some getting used to but boy is this track strangely good. 8.5/10<br />11. I Would For You: Best chorus on the whole album. It kind of reminds of \\"We're in this Together\\" but with its own differences. Lyrically this is the strongest track on the album that builds up until that cascading guitar gives way to a disjointed piano finish. 10/10<br />12. In Two: The heaviest track on the album that features some nice vocals. It kind of slows down around 2:55 but slowly builds back up again. 9.5/10<br />13. While I'm Still Here: What else but a quiet end to a NIN album? At first I wasn't all that impressed with this track but like the rest of the tracks it has grown on me. Love the sax near the end. 9/10<br />14. Black Noise: If you have a slow and quiet track you have to end it with a bang, right? Don't see why this wasn't added to \\"While I'm Still Here\\" like the end of \\"Hurt\\". Otherwise its a pretty intense end for the album. 7/10<br /><br />The album's overall rating: 122/144 = 87 = B+>6.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I couldn't wait to finish it to see how it would end.  Though there was a lot of violence in the story, it kept me interested.  Can't wait to read the rest of the Jack Reacher books.
B00AW28HF6|2.0|THE TSUNAMI CONNECTION by Michael Gallagher centers on an orphaned, kibbutz-raised Israeli woman named Kefira who is a Mossad field agent. Her quest at the outset appears to be revenge for an attack on her team, but the story broadens out to encompass much broader objectives.<br /><br />There are many concurrent stories in THE TSUNAMI CONNECTION, one being that the Russian mafia is in possession of a nuclear submarine that carries a weapon supposedly capable of causing a powerful tsunami. There is no mention of how criminals could get their hands on a nuclear submarine, operate it and modify it, or of any international efforts to recover it. I found that unbelievable.<br /><br />The author's main focus was apparently to let the crooks deploy the tsunami weapon in the ocean near Banda Aceh, one of the localities devastated by the tsunami following the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of 2004.<br /><br />Another continuing storyline is protagonist Kefira being controlled by her supposed adoptive parents Sam and Yochana, who have vaguely-defined but high positions in Israeli military black ops. These parent-daughter interactions emerge throughout the book, and frequently conflict with accepted military discipline in the field.<br /><br />The good guys are apparently unable to prevent the activation of the tsunami weapon, and it creates a 15-metre tsunami, witnessed by a Banda Aceh farmer and his daughter as it engulfs their village and kills them. Oddly, the book makes no mention of the widespread devastation and other consequences, such as the likely deaths of 300,000 people living in coastal Indonesia. A tsunami is not a local event.<br /><br />Aside from the one brief scene, I never found out what happened as a result of the tsunami. Those are high stakes indeed, but the sense of so many lives being important is missing from this book. The following chapter is an unrelated foray into Kefira's childhood, which concludes with her participation in a political assassination at an early age.<br /><br />Fiction generally is about high stakes in a situation where time is running out and there is only one person in position to save the day. Writing is about creating a series of images in the reader's mind, but the images created by writer Gallagher come in a flood of disjointed ideas that do nothing to build plot, storyline, or character.<br /><br />The author's choice of a female battlefield commander is a good one, as women are better at multi-tasking than men. They size up situations more quickly, and it's easier for females generally to set aside their egos and focus on the mission. This trait, however, is one that protagonist Kefira does not possess, as shown by her many tactical blunders throughout the story, beginning with the loss of 17 troops and a helicopter in the opening pages. She is never called to account for this mistake.<br /><br />I read black ops fiction in part to experience that world. I did not feel the presence of solid research behind Gallagher's book. One example is around rank structure and female leadership. In spite of Kefira being called Colonel, the Mossad is a civilian service and there are no military ranks. Many Mossad agents are former IDF, which does have rank structure, but it is never mentioned that Kefira was IDF. If that had been the case, the Israeli troops would have called her 'Aluf mishne', so she would not bear the rank of Colonel for any reason.<br /><br />I felt I was being told the action of a story while being kept away from the story itself. As I left each chapter behind, I had no sense of rising action or increasing suspense, I was simply dropped into an unrelated event stream in another country or another time. I was not aware of a plot, and the whole idea of suspense is missing from this book. There is little foreshadowing of events. Readers are expected to be satisfied that the inexplicable scene-hopping is necessary, but I did not find the puzzle filling in and giving me the chance to guess ahead as to the outcome.<br /><br />Scene-setting in Gallagher's writing is often done after the fact. Action starts, then we find out where it is and to what destination it is headed. Historical facts are inserted to explain the action as needed, but they come off as casual and unimportant. The initial attack sequence is placed where the historical Exodus led by Moses is said to take place. However the writing here can be misread as Moses somehow following the helicopters in the present.<br /><br />This is but one of many passages in the book that suggest it is in need of a re-write and careful editorial attention. Throughout the text are frequent punctuation errors and missing open or close quotes that slow the reading and cloud meaning. There are many unusual or incorrect word choices and stilted phraseology that require re-scanning, and prevent immersion in the story itself.<br /><br />In the end, Kefira is disgraced and demoted, and winds up with her old desk job and in the care of Sam and Yochana, her adoptive parents. Unbelievably, in spite of her many errors of judgment throughout the book, she is to be a teacher at a Kibbutz. It's an anticlimactic ending to a book that is hard to figure out from the start. A hero's journey it is not.<br /><br />I read this novel twice through to be certain I wasn't missing anything. I re-read many sections, and made searches of many terms to fully understand the sequence. Regretfully, I am not able to recommend this novel, or give it a rating higher than 2 stars.ess ahead as to the outcome.<br /><br />Scene-setting in Gallagher's writing is often done after the fact.

If I would've known it was this good I would've gladly paid for it.

193413712X|3.0|If you enjoy poetic descriptions of nature, the inner workings of wind up clocks, and trying to figure out who the narrator is now, this is the book for you.<br /><br />We meet George, an 80 year old man, lying in his death bed. He is surrounded by family and ticking clocks. Though bed ridden, George's rambling mind transports him back in time in the 96 hours prior to his death.<br /><br />Be patient with the confusion over which narrator has taken over the task of telling the tale. We meet George as a young lad, learn why he almost lost some fingers. We meet Howard, George's dad, and learn why he lost his family, we meet Howard's father, whom we only know as Father, who is a preacher, yet his flock abandon him, around the same time his comprehension and ability to communicate abandons him. Planes of history intermingle, George's mind flitters back and forth between the visions in the 96 hours before his death. We learn more about George through these memories.<br /><br />As George's body winds down, like the clocks he used to mend, I understood why he is surrounded by a loving family, squirreled money away in 8 different bank accounts, and why he dwells in the past before he dies in the present. What I don't understand is why this book won a Pulitzer ... A patient reader is needed for this one.  Beautiful language? Yes. Easy read with a take home heart felt lesson? Maybe, depending on the reader. Great plot and storyline? Not in my opinion. But hey, I am not writing Pulitzer Prize winners myself.

It's so neat to know it's true, although as always in films, there is some fictionalization to add to the drama.  (Of course, it would be far better if no one had to be a quadriplegic in the first place, but so neat both men found such friendship).

038533348X|2.0|The book is well used for starters, but I noticed right away there was a library sticker adhered to the binding. I groaned as I opened my birthday present, as the book was obviously lifted from a local library. The top of the book even has an ink stamp.<br />Not cool, man.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|The movie was good. Great cast! I actually wish it had been a little longer. They could have expanded on some of the characters.
B003KJF2WE|4.0|I liked this movie - I pretty much like any decent movie about superheroes. I like it less than ironman, thor, and the avengers. I think it's a couple of bucks well spent if you're into this type of movie.
B00008GKEG|5.0|What a great in depth view of the roots, travels, trials and triumphs of one of the finest &#34;bands&#34; of our time.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I liked this movie pretty well. I pretty much like any movie that has something to do with threatening the end of humanity, especially when weird sci-fi stuff is involved.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very informative and well researched book concerning the life and times of Jesus and the early years of Christianity. This book separates fact from myth.
B002LANLDK|4.0|Although this edition in the franchise is not the best, but still a good movie that sets the stage for fast five
B003B02O14|5.0|I cannot believe the ending after all that he wound up with nothing but a broken heart woman are all the same
1608871819|5.0|I loved the movie so I knew I would love this and it didn't disappoint me at all. You should get if you are a superman fan.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a fun game.  If you just click around u will get a penalty which is cool b/c it makes you think before clicking.  I think the items are hidden pretty well so you really have to hunt.  The only thing i don't like are the characters in the game.  They have dialogue & I have to keep clicking to by pass them.  This is a great time to relax....
1401359418|1.0|The book is about defining way of life not luck. Most of the common man cannot differentiate between the two. What is luck? Luck is define as the events one does not control goes against them. Now, do not tell me you control all event as you did not create the earth. Did you? So irrespective of ones way of life 'luck' exist and there are people who are unlucky: that the events he/she does not control mostly goes against them. Yes,such people are low in number. Therefore, they will be outlier in any statistical method. Never use statistic to understand known stuff. Like do you use statistics to know when sunrise tomorrow at your place? Anyway, do appreciate and understand that there exist people with bad luck and do not hurt them by saying such things does not exist. As you do not hurt a person who lost his or her parents by saying that they would come back. It is stupidity and rude.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Was totally awesome and deserves 10 stars! Read read read read this book! HALO IS SO FREAKING AWESOME! Can't live without reading this book!
B008JFUPPI|2.0|Well, if you liked Men in Black (even the last one) you will like this movie too, since it is a kind of spin off.<br />Of course you do not have the screaming Will Smith, but Jeff Bridges is so adorable like always so it is a big plus for the movie.<br />Other than that it is a fun movie to watch if you do not have anything else to watch. It is not bad, just not a first choice.<br />But it has it moments, some of them having to do with the hyper beautiful Marisa Miller!!!!
B002QEXT4W|5.0|OK, Robin Trower has been gone.  Ok, Mathew Fisher has also gone missing.  But, you know what?  Grand Hotel and Exotic Birds are two good albums of solid music that can play through to the end.  I liked the older Harum with its harder edge from Robin Trower, but their songwriting was just not as consistently strong on earlier albums.  I do like the earlier stuff a lot, but phase two of Procol Harum was more consistent and still rocked.  I am definately happy that I gave those later albums a chance.  PS This is summer rock / not to be played in winter.  Its all good.  JohnnyP.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin is one of my Favorites!! Somehow he manages to absolutely pull me along with the events of the story. The prose is so neat and tight that my attention never wanders. I find myself reading longer than I usually do! I love it!
B00005A46U|1.0|OK, I love In the Land of Grey and Pink.  And I mean that.  I bought this cd from the mostly positive reviews that it garnered.  However, upon many listenings I must say that this album in now way is as good as Grey and Pink.  It sounds much less focused.  It sounds ....... like Grey and Pink running out of air.  It sounds like a sketch.....maybe the cds after grey and pink were better, but not this one.  I don't hate it like the one star says......., but don't buy it either.  You'll sit for hours wondering if you like it....if you like an album, you don't have to think about it, right?  Johnny P
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Love the ending! This is a great read for many reasons. Family tension, teenage craziness & genetics. You have to read!
1401937268|5.0|I love that all the cards have a more positive appearance and discription on each one.  U don't have to be that talented.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Decent dungeon crawler game. Only drawback is the reliance on crystals to buy the really good gear and any potions.
B00D8HNQZI|4.0|The other day I heard an interview with Trent on NPR, in which he said that he wants to make music that gets better with each listen, and layered so on the 50th time you're hearing it, you still find something new.<br /><br />I'm no where close to 50 times through this...yet.  After listening to it all the way through 2 times in a row, I am hooked.  Once again, Trent has produced an album (hey, I bought it on vinyl, so I am STILL calling it an album!) that breaks the mold of anything he's done in the past.  I love the fact that each release has it's own distinctive sound, and Hesitation Marks continues that NIN tradition.  The songs flow very well from one to the next, yet once you look back on the entire album, you realize how diverse the songs truly are.<br /><br />Buy this and listen to it all the way through...at least once...twice...heck, go for 50!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you read this book with an open mind and from a historical point of view, you will enjoy it. The author informs us about the turbulent history of the Holy Land during the time of Jesus, and places Jesus of Nazareth within the context of that time period. I found the book to be well written and engaging.
0385486804|5.0|Read it and then later listened to audio version; despite it being my 2nd time, I got so lost in it that I walked past my block, continuing for five additional minutes until I saw how far I'd wandered.
B004UJ81IA|4.0|More than a century later, quite a few entrepreneurs in the Cevennes area offer donkeys for rent to hike through and around the area: they capitalize on Stevenson's story. This is the legacy that tells us that the readers of every generation since have really enjoyed the story.
1416583432|5.0|I love this book because Alexandra Horowitz conveys curiosity and love and tempers it all with all the scientific detachment she can muster (difficult with beloved mutts).
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read it in two days.I simply couldn't put it down,<br />I founds the characters and story arc engaging. This was obviously written to be a series, it is not a complete book alone. While Card does a good job of wrapping up this book, it is clear that he has left many opening for the next book.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I was surprised how taken I was with this movie from the first clip. The amazing detailed movements and expressions of the characters, the amazing actors behind the characters, etc. But was impressive was the service that Amazon provided when we encountered a glitch in downloading the movie. We called the customer service line that appeared on our TV and got immediate service. Turns out it was a simple issue on our end and within a few minutes we were watching the movie! I look forward to a sequel!
B008469DGY|5.0|Hours of my life that I will never get back :-)<br /><br />The graphics are phenomenal and with such clarity. The controls are very user friendly and responsive.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Not worth the $5 fee! First hour was horrible, second hour was better but overall could have cared less about the characters. Odd story line, pretty bad acting (James Franco was horrible!) and not great effects - don't bother!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book will send your emotions swirling. The character of Victoria is so believable it is heart wrenching to think that someone could go though so much and not have to be committed. You will love her and hate her from page to page and will keep turning them until you reach the end. I couldn't put this book down and as with any good book I was disappointed there wasn't more read.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Bought this for hubby as a gift.  He likes it.  There's not much else To say but am required to use 20 or more words to complete review.......
1452110581|5.0|I saw this on Amazon and could not resist purchasing it as a gift for my cousin. She loves this book!
B00005U11Z|5.0|I am really enjoying the DVD . I owned this on VHS . Bought this for a very low cost . I really enjoyed this concert . Neil Schon and the rest of Journey are kicking butt. Enjoy
1452126577|5.0|When I sent this book to my cousin, she immediately called me laughing. She loves this book and has it by her &#34;reading&#34; chair and reads parts o it daily. Big hit!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I'M a huge Dr Who fan, and this was one of my favorite season's of Dr Who!!  I truly miss David Tennet as Dr Who!!<br />In my humble opinion, the series lost a lot of it's glamour when David left the show...Nevertheless, Dr Who, is AND will forever be, one of the greatest sci-fi series available for our viewing pleasures!! You certainly can't tell THAT I think this is a &#34;superb&#34; sci-fi series?!!!!?????  LOL lol LOL<br />  All kidding aside though, if you've never seen or read this sci-fi series, you are IN for the Best fantasy ride of your life!!<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking this program out, I guarantee you'll not BE unsatisfied with this particular sci-fi program!!! Be sure to check out the books as well, they actually go further into more details story wise, than the TV programs do....  Enough said.........  :)
B009CGHAK6|5.0|I remember how I used to watch this movie every single day in my VHS and now that I owned it in a better quality I feel and enjoy it a lot better.
B004856SQ8|5.0|A-Team provides an updated look to the classic TV Show. While classics can never be recreated, for someone like me who was born into the era of the original A-Team it was fun to see a new look brought to it. There is a level of comedy in it that definitely keeps it fun, but enough action to keep it interesting. Of course with a movie like this, the story was pretty mediocre, but come on, a movie like this is all about the action, not an A+ story.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I love the music from the older country artists. This CD that Vince Gill has put together is just great of songs from the past.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|If you follow the plan you will loose weight and feel GOOD it comes off slow but that way it will stay off. I lost 10lbs and have kept if off still want to loose 10 more but I'm sure if I stay the course that will happen
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and have it on a tape to play in my VCR,,which we still have one hooked up to watch some of the movies we love.  Now I have it for the DVD player.
B003B02O7I|4.0|I enjoy court room drama mixed with adventure. It wa the perfect mix and kept me entertained. Very easy read with good ending. This was my first Grisham book and i will be reading another of his books next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome job and good stuff that is the most important thing in my opinion . The only way you can see that is the best way for you.<br />Love this game and want to see more like it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's helps keep in touch with friends from the past. Only problem is the constant request for your detailed personal information from the many sites that would probably be of interest. No info, no site.
B008602KQI|5.0|Entertaining, easy to watch, easy to stream thru Amazon.<br />Wanted something to get my mind off life and this movie did the trick!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is especially good in the 3-d format!  This is a beautiful addition to anyone's holiday library of children's films!
0345803485|1.0|I must say I expected something different.  First of all I have read \\"sexier\\" books than this and enjoyed them more. I totally did not like Christian.  What woman would put up with his crap??  And Ana is such a wimp until she finally realizes what he is and leaves him.  I don't intend to read the following books of the Fifty shades because I'm hoping she never goes back to him. Also after Ana discovers sex you'd think her descriptive phrases would be more \\"racy\\"  \\"Holy Crap\\"!
B005KGPC4S|4.0|Wow who would have thought that Kevin Smith made this movie? it is nothing like his previous works but it's really good it is super intense and it keeps you at the edge of your seat.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is a well acted, funny film. Sandra Bullock does a great job and Ryan Reynolds demonstrates that he can hold his own as a leading man with a well established star like Bullock.  This is a situational comedy with embarrassing and ridiculous situations coming together to either pull this couple apart or push them together. I found the dialogue to be very clever at times. I think you will be entertained.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Great sound! Very Catchy. I'm glad I bought the cd. I have a lot of tracks on repeat whenever I start listening.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|It presented topics that benefit high society to understand why lower class people are at a disadvantage. The book was okay but not great. I could have gone without reading this long drawn out argument.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Just a great Sci-fi show. No filler episodes which I hate. Acting and special effects are top notch. Also stars Moon Bloodgood super hottie and Sarah Carter another super hottie.
B0041CGOZS|3.0|Around the world Bon Jovi have been in at the top of the charts from 1986-2010 which is impressive by any standard.  In 1994 they released 'Cross Road - The Best of Bon Jovi' a collection of single the were hits (with the except of In And Out Of Love).<br /><br />16 years later, the band had released six albums of new material and an awful lot more hits (although the USA seems to have left them after 1995's 'This Ain't A Love Song'.<br /><br />It seems crazy to me that most of the singles on this collection are already on \\"Cross Road\\".  Why not include all the other hits from 1995-2010 on the second disc.<br /><br />It's a shame that this album caters exclusively to people who've not heard much Bon Jovi when they could be expose to much of their back catalogue.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Honestly this was for a summer assignment for my literature class but I read it in two afternoons. I actually cried after reading this. It's a great book a quick read and definitely paying the price for.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutely love hidden object games.  This is very much fun to play.  Unlike all the hidden object games I've played, this one allows you to connect and play with your friends.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Just  enjoy playing this game!!!! So much fun .  Would play it all the time if I could but always run out of lives too fast.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|An excellent app.  The action is awesome and the warped humor strikes a chord with my personality.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone 13 and over.
B005LAIIGW|4.0|an amaze video by the art sensation that's very a good movie for me and this movie become my inspiration
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Not what I thought, don't like having to wait for energy, once energy is full only lasts 5 minutes, could be better
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I am not a game player but playing this game has got me playing game I thought I'd never play but I really love this game it is the game to play  must play.

B00DHHWYAW|5.0|I was taken completely by surprise by The Great Gatsby.  I bought it, but I did not really even have a big desire to watch it.  Maybe it is because it received some lukewarm reviews.  I should know better.  But I admit, those kind of reviews always influence me, until I see the movie.  9 times out of 10  I never agree with the reviews.  This movie was directed by the great Baz Luhrman.  Leonardo DiCaprio was a revelation as Gatsby.  I found it so moving and his performance elicited many tears for me personally. The music, which is highly controversial--and I was prepared to hate--was marvelous.  I  do not know if people are uptight about monkeying with a classic or what it is, but how can anybody not like that music?  I watched it in 3D and it was breathtaking.  In fact, that did add to it my viewing pleasure enormously.  I cannot recommend The Great Gatsby highly enough.  I really really loved this movie.  And Baz Luhrman is a genius.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Through a love story between 2 people, so many themes relevant to people of color were also introduced.  Also learning about life in Nigeria and the struggles of people migrating to America.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This movie was not a &#34;traditional&#34; take on Fitzgerald's novel.  It combined some very modern elements (music, cinematographic style) that, in my opinion, helped to capture the feel of the era in a way that would make an emotional connection to today's viewers.  I know that the critics seemed to hate it, but if you are not a &#34;purist&#34; about the work, then I think this is a very enjoyable film.  The casting was on the nose and  the acting was very good (i.e. solid).  The scenes were rich and visually interesting.
B001RNO7B2|1.0|This was the first time I bought shoes on line. As an adult I have always worn size 10. To say these shoes run small is an understatement! I tried to wear them around the house to break them in and just got feet sore. Do not buy unless you order one full size bigger or more! Great quality but absolutely not sized correctly.<br /><br />I
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was touched by each character in this book loving some and disliking others. I hate that in our past events like this occurred and though this is a book of fiction, I see a lot of truth in it. I am glad that my Book Club brought this book to mr.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Suits the TV show is classy and funny and exciting. Love the characters in the show. The sarcasm is priceless!
B0073V7YTY|3.0|Interesting app, especially for lovers of science. However some of the readings seem 'suspicious'. The calibration process could be more intuitive.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|after reading A Dog's Purpose and A Dog's Journey how could I pass up another story?  I love these books.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As a native Dallas-ite, I was leery of yet one more in a long line of painful JFK assassination stories. It always seemed to me that simply being from Dallas somehow made us guilty of THE CRIME.  It is such a dark chapter in the story of my hometown.  However, this wasn't another Dallas-bashing story.  Sure, there were a few good ol’ boys tossed in for good measure, but overall, we Texans were portrayed in a kind light. The book had me from the very beginning especially since there was time travel involved.  It was interesting hearing about places I'd visited over the years. Then when we learn how Stephen King spins what might have happened had Oswald been stopped in time ...well, read it and see.  Your time will be well spent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.it is awesome.I love this game.I think it is awesome you should git it!lol lol it is fun fun I love that it is free.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a heart warming story. It is very sad at points though. The part at the camp was the saddest. Good book though
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I didn't know this was a fantasy work until it was too late and I was hooked in by the engaging characters and thrilling plot.  While it would still appeal to the younger set, this is a good read for just about  any age group.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Ready to spend an evening in front of the telly watching mindless TV?  Then this is it!  Doctor Who newly discovered by Rose and her tendency toward curiosity lead us on a fun romp through time and space.  Join the adventure.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I have watched all of the Stargate series and have loved all of them. I really love Stargate Atlantis season 1. The characters and stories.
0765325950|4.0|After decades of waiting and maturing (myself and the story) this conclusion wasn't everything I had hoped, but how could it be?  It was a very good book, avoiding the pacing problems of the slower books in the series while still giving fans those &#34;Everyone in the same room&#34; scenes, enough time with Mat, Perrin, & Rand while still giving most main characters a POV, and tying up most of the loose ends (which for a while in the series seemed to be only multiplying).  More than serviceable, but not the book my imagination had hoped for.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|After watching Cranford, I was disappointed as I thought that where the series ended.  I was so glad to have found Cranford: Return to Canford.  Great series!  A keeper to watch several times over the years.  Love those BBC series - they do such a great job!
B000Q79HS8|4.0|I have waited a very long time to watch these movies and it is pretty good. Kept hearing others talk about it and it is a cool story line and very entertaining

B003QTUQGU|4.0|Another tim burton movie that was very colorful. Interesting take on the book but overall entertaining and fun to watch
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Stunning photography!<br />Superb story, with a great message.<br />Artistic & creative directing.<br />Rarely does a film of this quality get made.<br />Immediately jumped into my top 3 best of the best films I've ever seen.
B001I9B9I4|4.0|I really liked this movie. Theres another one similar to this one that has mandy moore in it. These are not bad.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|Worth the buy! The album is just amazing like any other CD she has out. If your a lovatic and love Demi Lovato's music I recommended you to get this!
B00114RKT8|4.0|pretty good show with some awesome actors in them. I thought it was an excellent movie and recreation of this mans life.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Mazing!!! Doctor who is the best show on earth! And the 9th doctor is a great character... fantastic in fact.

B008469DGY|5.0|Really enjoy the feel of the game. A fun way to pass the time while the drill is spinning away.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|lets me watch all the videos I want. easy download and easy to use. Make sure you check it out
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|In the Epilogue the author said this should have been, or started out to be, a short story.  He was right.  It is not a novel in any sense of the word in my opinion.  I kept waiting for &#34;something&#34; to happen and it just rambled on with a lot of nonsense and no  real high points or action.  It was a fairy tale about a seven-year-old's fantasy and although  it started out with a  very brief introduction to the  time and place by the adult version of the narrator, it quickly devolved into the ramblings of a child's imagination.  I am not a fan of fantasy but this author is no J.K. Rowling who knows how to make the reader want to read more and get involved with the characters. In fact the child's parents and only sibling were  cruel, clueless, and had no redeeming qualities that I could  detect. The character development was so slight and the plot so  bare, I don't know how this book made any kind of best seller list.  I usually have something positive to balance out the negativity in any review I write but in this case the best I can say is that I finished it because hope  springs eternal and I hoped it would have some kind of satisfying denouement but my hopes were dashed in a slow petering out of the story.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Period costume with modern music. They should have picked either modern costume and period or classic music to match the costumes
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|I know it's usually Trent's goal to sound depressed or angry, but on this album he just sounds more tired than anything else. I'll tolerate this album over some of his others but I'm certainly not very impressed.<br /><br />I guess his days of \\"Sanctified\\", \\"Closer\\", \\"Mr. Self-Destruct\\", \\"Somewhat Damaged\\", and \\"Only\\", are long gone. This album reflects a lack of effort and that of a pity-probing cry to hopefully retain his past appreciative fan base.  Which means, if you've truly enjoyed Nine Inch Nails over the years, you'll probably have a lot more patience and tolerance for this latest effort, than any new listener would.<br /><br />However, this might surprise you as I say this.  This IS a rather more easily listenable album than some of his past albums.  It flows rather comfortably.  In fact, so much better than the harshness that we had to endure with \\"The Downward Spiral\\" back in 1994. But, the problem that I have with this latest release is that there is nothing that really stands out at all. No one song here is anything more fabulous than the rest of the whole album. It's just a bland complacency of expected sound factors from the typical Nine Inch Nails familiarity sound machine. Just a bunch of nowhere filler material with no outstanding highlights to the album at all.<br /><br />I borrowed this CD from a friend.  I thanked her for sparing me from having bought it myself. She doesn't seem to be too impressed with it either, but she bought it anyway and I was only glad to give it back to her.<br /><br />Nice try Trent, but no thanks.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is my favorite movie of the year! It is funny, has drama & a dysfunctional love story. If you are not into dialogue movies, then move on. But the dialogue is sarcastically funny & so inappropriate at times, it just works! Bradley & Jennifer played these parts perfectly. There was never a dragging moment, that made me look at the clock, which usually happens for me during 2 hour movies.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I'm sure by now it's pretty much all been said, good story, writing, acting, music, etc.  Seeing this after the Snowden revelations, I think it shows that the weakest link in the oppression factory of the \\"know everything\\" security reflex might just be the humanity of people involved.  We can hope so and that it will remain a significant one in any case.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love Mitch Albom books. They are quick reads but they always have a smart message behind them. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they have to go go go all the time and never slow down.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This is a tale of a young child, mistreated by her own parents who call her a brat and a pest. Little do they know, their child is a genius, reading novels at age 5, multiplying large fractions in her mind in less then 5 seconds, and just acting and speaking like a mature young woman. This girl is Matilda. But this is only the beginning
B000OW77UU|5.0|I didn't really appreciate the film the first few times I watched it, but I am on my third or fourth time of watching it, and I love it.  Will and Jaden are really good in the film, and it is an unfortunately realistic look at how life can be.  However, it does give hope for those in that situation.
B0000067L3|5.0|It's against my better judgment that I post this review, because I know people will massacre me and I'm not really in the mood to be massacred. But, eventually I just felt I had to be true to myself and take the knocks as they come. The dilemma is this: This is one of the pinnacles of creativity in rock music, not to even mention superlative musicianship. It's been longer than I care to mention, and it still blows me away - in fact, more so now, when the competition is basically zero, than back in the day, when plenty of other talented bands could be heard around the clock. Now, that's the first disc.<br />And we come to the \\"live\\" disc. I have never understood people's fascination with it. Frankly, I'd give it one star, and only because there is no no-star rating. It bores me to tears! The endless, brainless noodling, Eric going on way too long and audibly looking for inspiration in the middle of \\"Spoonful\\", instead of giving some air time to Bruce. What does Bruce get? An exhausting marathon on the harmonica. A completely uninteresting song, but let's give Bruce credit for technical proficiency and for energy, except... wait a minute - isn't he one of the finest bassists in history? Who the heck thought it was a good idea to feature him on a harmonica!? Why not a solo on bass that would compensate for overlong Eric? Do we have Ginger playing a xylophone for ten minutes? Nooooo... I hate this \\"live\\" disc. Truth is, except for Hendrix I've never heard a 3-piece band that could really fill the room with coherent sound (that's sound, not noise) - consider how much is going on in the studio, on the same songs that sound like nothing live, just showpieces for virtuosic but meaningless noodling. It's pretty hilarious to think that here we have one of the most famous guitarists in history, and a bass player that follows close behind, but the only thing that gives me any pleasure is Mr. Baker's inimitable drumming.<br />Okay, so now, fans, do your worst. I'll try not to read any comments, I can take only so much cruelty.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Everyone should read this book especially young academics. The author is right IMAGINATION can drive people to achieve great things. Only thing i didn't like was there wasn't enough detail given in the events of Tesla life.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Pulled me in. Since women characters vary in age the story maintained my interest along with my 34 yr old daughter's intrigue with the characters and their Australian setting.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|A few things about me:<br /><br />1.  I never review stuff on amazon.com.<br />2.  I am old enough to have seen Jimi Hendrix live before he died.<br />3.  I have heard a LOT of music.<br /><br />That out of the way, this is one of the best records I have heard in a long, long time.  With few exceptions, most of the stuff being released these days  is dreck.  The Rides are the real thing on the other hand.  I just wish it was longer.  Buy without fear and enjoy.
B0013JZDSG|5.0|Nothing else I have listened to is close or as good except for CeloGreen.I lost the CD and missed it so much it made sense to buy it<br />again and put it on the cloud.
1401937268|5.0|The artwork on these cards are magnificent; clear and the meanings are always precise!!  I love working with these Tarot Angel Cards by Doreen Virtue and Radleigh Valentine.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|I casually purchased this book assuming it to be another comprehensive running manual and not a dramatic, out-of-the world documented adventure, baring deep into the lives of great people that hath so changeth my life. With amazing literary skills, Chris manages to immortalize an extraordinary real-life account, filling in comprehensive knowledge that a amateur runner like me would be forever grateful for.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I really like this book.  Getting the balance between nutrition and exercise is very intimidating, but Mike has made it easy by providing exact calculations for nutrition, and excellent explanations for all aspects of his program.  If you want to take your training to the next level, I recommend this book to be your guide.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|The story tells about Vida Winters, a well-known writer whose background is mysterious because she never tells the same thing about it whenever she's interviewed. On her deathbed, she hires a biographer.<br /><br />She chooses shy Margaret. Margaret is hesitant but hopeful of learning the truth about Vida, whose books she discovered and devoured in her father's antiquarian bookstore. She also wants to discover why Vida's first book, titled Thirteen Tales, contained only twelve stories.<br /><br />Vida's story, told in fits and starts, and ending just as she dies, is every bit as engrossing as Margaret imagines. An obsessive brother, a twin sister, a moldering mansion... All the ingredients of a good gothic tale. Margaret's only problem is sifting what's true from what isn't.<br /><br />The writing is magnificent. Heavily atmospheric, each chapter uncovers a bit more of Vida's past until in the end, the truth comes out. And we finally learn about the thirteenth tale.<br /><br />Excellent read.
B005PK56TA|4.0|This is like Nip/ Tuck (TV show) after everyone has died and now are haunting you.  I like it.  Thanks
B007R6UWN0|5.0|I am a fan of the books and TV movies of this genre. Wallander, Agatha Christie, etc. Jason Isaacs nails it. I watched it over and over. Don't just settle for the tv show. Read the books too!
B00640UICA|4.0|fun and brain power.  good for all levels, my kids and I enjoy it very much.  cute graphics and music.
B00A6WSTIW|5.0|Great use of CGI and great action!  What I really enjoyed was the unexpected victims.  You will not guess who gets eaten next!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love taylor swift. Great lyrics. The duets are just awesome. Some up beat and some songs are more serious.  I play it all the time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very fun to play. The graphics are extremely good. Everything looks realistic. You need to get it and try it out for yourself.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Did not realize this will be made into a movie this fall when I started reading it. I am looking forward to the release. I hope it does the book justice. It was an amazing read. I highly recommend it. It was a longer book than I usually go for and a little different than my usual reads. I enjoyed every page of this! Death as the narrator was very interesting. Hope you choose this book as your next read. You won't be disappointed.
B002BCNK1Q|2.0|There's no other way to say this: Clint Eastwood overacts in this film and makes all the other characters seem amplified and exaggerated as well.  He has good chemistry with the Asian actress.  Why didn't the story focus on her and leave her dull brother and relatives in the background?  A man Clint's age simply does NOT have the energy to effectively produce, direct, AND act in 95% of the scenes.
B00EZJX2K2|5.0|After five episodes I am \\"sooo\\" hooked.  Actually from the first episode I've been drawn into the plot.  Normally, I would have figured out the villain by now, but I fear that it is not the case this time around.  If you are wondering who the most outstanding actor is then David Tennant wins hands down.  So, climb on the ride you'll be glad you did.
B005CWRB44|4.0|Thought I was getting a brighter light than the original because of the advertised lumen rating.  However, in comparing this new one to the original, my light meter registers a greater lumen output from the original.  Comparing them visually, the original appears to have a tighter, brighter beam.  Maybe the new one I received is defective.  It's still a bright light for its size, but certainly not brighter than the original model I have.
B00E5Q1HJS|1.0|This is a violent remake of the wrath of kahn!  Most star trek movies you can watch as a family, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.  Since when is crushing a mans skull on screen StarTrek.  Please do not make more.  Great Computer Graphics work!
0736092269|5.0|GREAT ILLUSTRATED BOOK OF WHICH MUSCLES ARE INVOLVED IN ALL STRENGTH TRAINING EXERCISES.  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY WEIGHT LIFTER.  GREAT SOURCE FOR STRENGTH TRAINING.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show!!! If you like White Collar, you will like this Suits. Suits has a bit more humor to it.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a fun, action-filled movie. Retired and somewhat dysfunctional former spies and assassins have to deal with government agents out to get them. Red2, the sequel, is even better, but I recommend seeing them in order to get the full effect of the characters.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. After I bought it we watched it for the third time and still love it. There is humor, drama, and a few touching moments. The cast is tremendous. It is a must see. It's a shame it didn't get more press in the US.
1451695195|5.0|This is a powerful book, it has changed my outlook of life. This is a wonderful account and it just validates many other accounts before him but in a very technical and professional way.  the secular way of his narration is very important for people who is not into religion.<br />I recommend this book, it is a must read, I have already told many of my friends about the book.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game and pretty much any of the king.com games but I think it's unfair it is only available on kindle fire hd. I think it should be available on the regular kindle fire as well. I would also like to see candy crush and pet rescue.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I admit that I only started reading this series because friends on the internet were talking about it in awed voices, and that it was going to become the &#34;next Harry Potter.&#34; Naturally if people are going to make such bold claims, I have to find out if they're just boasting or not.<br />I have now read the first four books of the Mortal Instruments series, and am considering buying the other accompanying series, The Infernal Devices series.<br />This is a wonderful series. I don't think it's fair to say that it's the next HP, but it is pretty awesome.<br />Clary is a likeable heroine, and Simon and Jace are just perfect. There are lots of secrets, and intrigue galore. I read this book in one sitting, which isn't as impressive as it sounds because I do that a lot for books I like.<br />I decided to buy it in e-book form as well as book form, just in case I don't have the actual book with me and want to re-read it.<br />I think it's a great series for teens, but also for adults too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the daily scripture, the way we can switch versions while reading to compare and the fact that I can actually have it read to me.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I adore this movie, and the book series too. I watched the movie first, because I actually didn't know it was a series, so I might be biased but I think it did a good job of following the story line (which I know that some fans would disagree with), and I just enjoy the mythology being shown to a younger age. I'm really glad that I bought this, and am planning on buying the second one when it comes out on DVD too (and not just because of Nathan Fillion, who's in it!). It's a wonderful movie for a mythos fan, or a fan of the books, or a fan of Rick Riordan (who wrote the book series), or of the boy who plays Percy (had to check, I couldn't remember his name, Logan Lerman). They did a truly awesome job on this movie.
B000VZJLVS|5.0|It's refreshing to hear organic-sounding dance music, played by actual musicians.  The melodies are catchy, and the lyrics are humorous and fun.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|This is a wonderful re-make of the original movie, although it gives it it's own twist so it's kind of it's own movie too. (I hope that makes sense.)<br />Brendan Fraser is awesome, as always, and the movie itself is wonderful. I loved the price of it, and I'm really happy I bought it when I did.<br />If you like Brendan Fraser, adventure movies, Jules Verne, or Josh Hutcherson, this is a wonderful movie. It's great for the whole family.<br />Buy it! Watch it! Then buy the second one too, because it's also awesome, and then maybe we'll get a third with both Brendan Fraser and &#34;The Rock&#34; in it, and they'll all go to the moon with Michael Caine!
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|My children (5 and 11) and I adore this film. It is very faithful to J.M. Barrie's book and the actors are all perfect in their roles.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|This review is for my wife. Not me. 90210 is hog wash. But she wants the other seasons so I have it 5 stars. Cuz what baby wants...baby gets.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Good balance of the slow melodic songs and the fast paced songs that make you want to go for a run a fight 5 guys. Plus Requiem blew me away. What other band does that?
0071592466|5.0|I ordered the book, because it is focused on the Speaking and Writing sections of TOEFL only. It has a well-structured and useful Phrases sections. Personally I like the Writing examples, specifically for the Integrated part of the test. Was surprised that half of the book is dedicated to grammar rules and assignments. I would recommend this book to all TOEFL-takers and heroes!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got this app for the free app of the day, so I didn't have to pay for it. Anyway, onto the review, I thought this app wad super easy to use and navigate. I have played around with Photoshop a little, but am not proficient in Photoshop. I thought this app was super compared to other photo editing apps I have used.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Not only is the plot amazing but the acting of every character is great. Their acting according the black comedy theme of this movie definitely invites the audience into the movie. The graphics of the attempts of suicide and the adventure in this movie helps keeps the audience at the edge of their seat. In the end it really makes you reflect  your own life and gives a you a optimistic view of life. This movie is to DIE FOR!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I like how the movie was overdone! The music didn't seem to fit the time period, maybe to appeal to a younger audience! Stayed true to the book!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a great book. Not a \\"Christian\\" view point but an honest one. I enjoyed the scientific aspect as well. His story is truely remarkable and uplifting!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game has great graphics, intricate play, and requires you to think! I have loved all of their apps, and hope to buy more in the future!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I had really looked forward to watching this movie, and honestly I was a little disappointed.  I think the story line was good, but it just seemed to drag on.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Well I  have just finished this movie.  Yes, it is much more than I expected, the language is true to the scenes and all of the Characters are really good.  However, JJ violated a beginning Original Star Trek fact Kirks first Captain, Captain Pike does not die in a city somewhere, he goes to a plant where his love is waiting for him.  Pike is in a wheel chair and he is just waiting to die.  The Khan sequences are not true to the original series.  So not to keen on this movie as holding to the original Character base.  It is even much more far fetched than the original series, some of the feats were even far beyond what the originator intended.
B000059H99|1.0|Extremely POOR sound quality destroyed the viewing of the movie.  It sounds like it was pirated from an extremely poor master.
B005DJREJS|5.0|It's just a funny story line to follow and really draws you in. I'm hoping the fall season continues to be catching
140006922X|5.0|Excellent book.  Well written and easy to follow.  Reza Aslan provides a historical review of Biblical times without any religious overtones.  This book does not promote or deny Christianity, Islam, Atheism, or any other philosophical/religious viewpoint despite what some of the cover reviews may indicate.  Should be read by anyone who seeks understanding of religion as well as all Christians who want to know what they believe in.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|What else can be said.  The movie is a really neat kids movie and will entertain even the kids which don't sit to watch movies.
B008J05EL8|1.0|What a rip off. I wanted to use for conferences and journaling.  I paid but no downloading happened. There is nothing to open. How do I get my money back?
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very good mobile app of a full version PC Game.  It has good simple controls that work very well.
B008469DGY|5.0|Flick Golf is a well Polished shooting game that let's you shoot ball at Golf greens to get varying points.<br />The Controls are wonderful.  You can Shoot and then adjust shot in mid-air by flicking Curves, Change of direction and even Backspin to land ball closer to center of target (the Hole marked by Flag).  Landing within measrured Distance Rings around the hole will give you points according to how close you land to the hole in the center of rings.  Points and extra time are also given for hitting the Flagpole, Curving it, Spinning the ball properly, etc.  The HD Graphics are awesome with spectacular scenes.  Controls work great with Fluid movements and Realistic Physics accuracy.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful Fun filled game that is Engaging and Enjoyable to play.  A real treat after you learn how to vary your shots properly.  Smooth Flicking controls with Fluid ball travel and Scoring works nicely too.  Addictive fun and good Replay Value.  Music and Sound effects are great and their volume levels can be adjusted.<br />NO Annoyances, Ads, Intrusive Addons, etc.  And it can be played with WiFi OFF (hoorah).<br />It's is a well designed and Pleasant app that I recommend to all ( especially Physics Game enthusists! ).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is truly one of the best I have read in a long time! IT IS SOOOOOO GREAT! SOOOOO INTERESTING! I couldn't stop reading it no matter what. In fact I'm writing this review after reading it for the second time. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good read. WARNING: there is a cliff hanger at the end that makes you want the next book, makes you NEED the next book. Definitely read this book THE HUNGER GAMES will be the best book you have read. Trust me read the book.
0375842209|5.0|This was the August selection for my book club and I don't know who suggested it. It is a gem. It did take me about 50 pages to get accustomed to the author's narrative style but after the first 50 pages I was completely invested in the characters and their plight. I didn't want to set it aside. Life in Germany before and during WWII was something I knew nothing about. The characters are skillfully presented and their relationships compelling. My heart broke for them. Zusak writes beautifully descriptive scenes. I won't get into details of the story or I might give something away.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|This book was a real surprise. I downloaded it because it was inexpensive and I needed something to get me through a long day. From page one it just grabs you. The main character is best described as an unreliable and imperfect character. She has a lot of flaws, and it is hard to know if the paranoia she feels is real or just a side effect of drug use. Makes for an unusual story, which includes courtroom stuff (which I thought was fantastic) and some great thriller elements. There is also a ton of character development, which makes the story very realistic. I could really see this in the theater someday as a summer blockbuster, it has all the elements, and plenty of details that would play well into a cinematic screenplay. Enjoy!
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Remember when we were young and children's movies had a positive message of some kind in them ?<br />This is a throw-back to those times . Clever dialogue w/ characters & situations any child can relate to.<br />Buy this Movie !
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I love Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage together.  I thought the way that he sacrifices his divinity for her humanity resonates with my faith so deeply.  I loved this movie.
B004INNRFK|5.0|This arrived as promised within a couple of days. The service is always very efficient. I had been looking for this DVD and knew I could trust on Amazon to have it.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The characters are easy to get mixed up in the beginning even though they aren't written in the same voices - there's just so many of them - but it's actually very interesting to see the different characters from all the different perspectives, and it's subtly done. However, the book left me feeling uneasy about a lot of the implied messages: it's not murder if you didn't totally mean to kill someone? you're not beautiful if you're fat? it's okay to keep it a secret that your child might not be your husband's? etc.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Loved it! Had humor and drama. Characters are very easy to love. I can not wait to finish season 3
0812550706|5.0|I'm happy I read this book before I found out what a nutjob OSC is, because the book, on its own, rocks. And having read a bunch about the author, I've decided that he's just in deep, deep denial about his true feelings and beliefs, and I'm going to stick with that.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|I just recently watched this movie (after all these years).  And fell in love with Tom Cruise.  Had no idea he could sing, but he did a great job and sexy too.  Have watched it many, many times!<br /><br />Also, watched Knight and Day.  Thought it was great also.  I wish he would make more movies along that line.  Sexy, but humorous also.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Nothing too deep here (aside from a telegraphed-from-a-mile-away molestation scene) and no big surprises, but it was a good quick vacation read.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was way More than I expected it to be. Awesome trilogy. This is a true love story. I couldn't' put it down.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Halfway between a short story and a novel, halfway between kid lit and adult, it's good (of course, it's Gaiman!) but not satisfying
1781162646|1.0|Really disappointed ,this really is not one of Stephen kings best books ,endless rambling on about nothing,A big waste of money.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|There's not much else to say. This is the epitome of ambient music, and it is done near perfectly. A beautiful listen suitable to nearly any occasion; any music lover should give this thing a listen, I think you will definitely feel it was time well spent.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|Interesting concept for this story. Iwas amazed by the variety of weapons and the twist & turns the story line took. Well done.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This show is great - but you need to start at the first show(s) of the season. We started somewhere in the middle, and it made no sense until we re-started at the beginning.
174179403X|3.0|Lonely is quite shilly-shally lately on quality and is lately not using the traveller's tips. The Abkhaz and Ossetian situation is not unveiled enaugh and this particular issue is missing a lot of practical/backgroun material. Eg the 2004-2005 Central Asian lonely is pretty good and beating all others (did travel in 2006). Travelled Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and it was soo perfect. Looking into this, Ill have to write a lot of emails to locals. No worries, its just that Lonely seems to be becoming a tourist book more than a traveller's book.
