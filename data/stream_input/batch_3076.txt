B00BD99JMW|2.0|I Never write negative reviews, but this one warrants it. I enjoyed the other books in the series so I ordered it even with the poor reviews. It was an absolute waste of money and time the author should be ashamed of cheating her reader's with this novel. Will never pay for another of her novels again. A real shame
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|After growing up with nightmares about &#34;The Shining&#34;, Stephen King once again brings everything back to life in Doctor Sleep.  He continues the story from when the son grows up with the demons of the shining within.  This book is a real page turner.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am on my second read of the trilogy. I didn't t review the books initially.  The story is overwhelming I think to the  every day woman and certainly titillating.  Beyond everything I have ever read.  But when you get past all the sex of every kind there is a love story that unfolds.  There is some difficulty for me in reconciling the \\"English\\" vs. the \\"American\\" sometimes but overall I enjoyed the read.  I experienced a myriad of emotions.  I am sure I will again read the story of Ana and Christian but I don't know how well it will translate to the big screen.  This story is not for the faint of heart.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little device is a technological marvel. easy to set up and works great from my phone, tablet and PC. I highly recommend it. It was purchased from Amazon at a great price with fast, free shipping.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awesome, fun, and can be challenging in a fun kinda way. It's a great game to play and super exciting when you get a new shark to play with ^_^ I love it and you will too
B00992CF6W|5.0|Most people think that this app doesn't update as quick as apple ipads and iPod touches. Well think how mojong feels about having to rush and make mistakes on minecraft updates. HAVEN'T YOU GUYS EVER HEARD OF PATIENCE? You guys need to wait, seriously. Your going to ruin the updates for other people that love Minecraft.
0385349831|2.0|The premise of this book is compelling, but the actual reading, not so much.  I gave up after 50 pages of platitudes and banalities passing for some kind of wisdom.  I enjoyed the Alchemist, despite its base in magical thinking, but was disappointed with this effort.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST ITEM EVER! IT WORKS GREAT! MY GRANDSONS ALL 3 LOVE THIS GAME AND IS TRYING TO TEACH THIS OLD WOMAN.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game....relax at night and enjoy but I will warn it becomes very addictive especially when you start to collect items
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I liked the first book as well as this second one in this series. Blake Crouch is having the next book out in 2014 and will get that one too, to see how the people of &#34;Pines&#34; handle the enlightenment of their existence.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|This is a great album! He has a great array of artists on the album. Everyone should purchase this album...
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Good graphics and easy to play. The  A.I. is dumb at the easy setting, which was good to play and win, but is challenging if you make it so with increased difficulty settings.  I like winning and like the ability to learn the correct moves and yet can increase my strategy for competing as I get comfortable with the game.  Recommend this developer for other games they make....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I started reading this book and wasn't sure whether I was going to like it or not, but like most books if you give it that one or two chapters, you're hooked. It's much more of a different story line than most popular novels. You need to read it!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Read this on a train ride - it was ok.  It took the author a while to even really get to Tesla and his life, and even then the info was nothing much more than common historical knowledge.  Very little actual detail on his life.  The last part of the book that talked about the post Eddison/Tesla show down was about the only good part.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I've had friends telling me to check this out for years.<br />I'm glad I did, this is a great series!<br />It keeps me glued to the tv.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game is really gets your mind working. It also helps you develope mind skills. Everyone should try it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time, when the kids would leave for school I'd grab my coffee n get comfy and start reading getting nothing done for a couple days!!! It was so real, the characters, the feelings and the twists!!!! When she found that letter I was just going crazy until she opened it and then my mouth just hung open for like 5 minutes! A MUST READ!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Wish you got more life's but over all fun for all ages. Super fun candy to play with, who said you couldn't play with your food.
0143039431|5.0|Classic work of literature that gets better with age. Amazing how some of the problems with our culture just don't seem to ever resolve. Very timely novel.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Came up perfectly no glitches was just like i  was watching on the tv love this show! fds sadf asfd
1401937519|5.0|Dying to Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing by Anita Moorjani is a moving self portrait of sheer human resilience and the transformative power of deep self love.  Moorjani narrates her experience of a descent into the depths of human fear and lack of self acceptance, meeting these toxic fears in the face of death itself, peering over into eternity and returning to wholeness in her choice to live.<br /><br />Moorjani narrates her story from the humble vantage point of one having no agenda, no self serving mission that has too often been the cruxt of popular self help books, to tell a story of quiet strength, remarkable insight, and honest character.  Her embrace of self in the critical act of love places the power to transform and heal within the palms of each individual's own hands as she reminds her reader that we do indeed create our own realities--in life and in death. With a moving forward written by reowned inspirational teacher Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dying to be Me is an excellent example of spiritual autobiography as sacred text.<br /><br />In the process of reflective autobiography, Moorjani addresses race, class, gender,  and socio-religious concepts of culture, and how her socialization (Hinduism, Catholicism, Ancestor Worship, British Hong Kong, India, Cantonese, Sindhi, English, female, \\"othered\\" person of color) impacted her self concept and sense of self determination.  Moorjani's journey reminds us all that it is in the knowledge of our own magnificance in learning to stand in our own truth that we become free and then truly begin to live.<br /><br />The book is composed of three parts that start from the moment Moorjani \\"dies\\" and then circling back to her childhood memories of family, cultural, gender, race, and socio-religious constructs that shaped her early identity.  Juxtaposing memory with cultural critique, Moorjani paints a picture of all the facets of her life that gave her both joy and incredible stress and inner turmoil, leading to her greatest fear--of becoming stricken with cancer--a living reality.<br /><br />The second section focuses on her approach to death and her crossing over.  It is here that the synthesis of the book's theme comes to full fruition. Moorjani learns through this harrowing ordeal of deep illness and near death experience of the only reality that is: the divinity in everything.  More importantly, she comes to accept the truth that she is the divine center of her whole creation, and as such, she matters and is interconnected to everything else: \\"In other words, because I'm at the center of my cosmic web, the whole is affected by me.\\"<br /><br />Moorjani's approach to her NDE is revolutionary because she puts the catalyst of change and the jewel of value and meaning of life within her own self and in being keenly aware of her position within the centrality of her own life and with life itself.<br /><br />The third and final section is a reflection back upon why Moorjani feels she got sick with cancer, and inspirational messages on the infinite self, universal energy, and self allowance. Her narration of her halting process of taking her place on a world stage as a new voice calling for the transformation of humanity into  more universal awareness is empathetic to plight of the reluctant heroine or hero called to speak, shine, act.<br /><br />While Moorjani's memories are so detailed as to be considered tedious to those sensitivities that are accustomed to the sweeping dramatics of most NDE narratives, the patient reader who inserts herself into Moorjani's experience will find numerous resonances and points of communion.  Moorjani's words should feature among the most effective preventative medicines in the epidemic of cancer upon the planet today.
0761174192|5.0|I always get this calendar and enjoy the wonderful cat pictures and the information on each one. I look forward each morning to a new cat picture.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Thoroughly found this story sad.  Characters were not sympathetic.  Ending left me angry.  Will not read another book by this author.
B00ELE8D4Q|1.0|Cher found some music with a thumping beat which was fine for one or two tracks.  But basically the whole CD was the same music over and over just with different lyrics.  It is awful and I wish there was a way to get my money back.  I expected so much more of Cher.  Shame on her.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I always enjoy a good techno thriller. Dan Brown got me started with these. I thought about the concepts presented and found that privacy issues are on everyone's mind. Dave Eggars gave us much to ponder. Are the coolest new toys and ideas always for the best? I found myself excited about the usefulness and fun but then frightened with the larger implications of the advancements.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I played a lot of this cd as we had our work costume party for the public.  Definitely a hit!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved ths book I just couldn't put it down I always had to know what was going to happen next!
0753827662|5.0|couldn't put the book down.  many theory changes and surprises right up to the end. I recommend this book if you like thrillers
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Crazier than the first season so well acted!!!! visually incredible with great affects!!!  Interesting story line which keeps moving forward and unfolding!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Great warranty, wonderful product, handy on/off switch. Big enough that I never lose. Smart enough to know when it's on my ear or not.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is back on target.  Great story.  Sit back and let John Grisham  take you on journey of masterful deceit and double crossing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This was another game where you get so far into it and then they want you pay for more, I don't do that, once I do I will be doing it all the time and I can't afford that. But for games no one beats Amazon, I don't shop any where else on the web except for Amazon.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Cant wait until nov 22nd its gonna to b excitin but I watched this movie probably but 20 times I still love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|you really have to use your mind and eyes, for this game!! I very much love it. It's a time consuming game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like it, but I wish it would be more accurate!  Then it saying.... @2pm, mostly sunny, when it is like 8pm.  I would get it just for the weather alert's.  :)
1250038820|5.0|Devoured it as soon as it was delivered. I love the blog and the Facebook page. Great coffee table book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was amazing. I would recommend this game to everyone who love the little minions. If I could spend money for bananas it would be for the minions
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't know what Veronica was thinking but I guess she's the author and it's her choice right? Better finish the trilogy just in case
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is purely amazing. As much as I want to give out every spoiler possible, I won't. This book makes me want to scream at the end, because I don't want Tris's Divergent Trilogy to have an ending. I am happy I read this series, Tris is a very unusual kind of girl, the one you grow to love very quickly, and refuse to let go of. I relate to Tris a lot. Tris is the kind of person I wish I was. The ending is mostly what any reader would want it to be. Except what happens with Tris. I was disappointed with Peter's actions, and a little with Tobias's, because I wish he showed a little more.. how do I say it without spoilers. Emotion toward Tris's action. I didn't feel... all that needed to be there. All in all, however. I loved every word in this book, definitely worth the wait. Anyone who has Divergent and Insurgent, reading the conclusion is a 100% must.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|She loves Katy Perry and ROAR has become an anthem for her and her neices.  Happy all around.  Side not, amazon cloud player is great!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great compelling story. I'm still confused about the ending though, so I might have to look it up. Time to see the movie I guess. Thanks Charlie. And Sam? Not really sure. K bye.
B00170GXQ2|5.0|The original release was visually amazing.  The extended cut (added/extended scenes) add so much more.  The second disc has some great featurettes.  One of Gary Oldman's best films.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator does what I need it to do. It is way better than the one that came on my smartphone!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's simple and works well. No issues and easy to use. I am happy with it<br />Try it out, great price too
B0063IH60K|5.0|very true and very gritty it tells a very familar new york story i think its one of best mob stories since goodfellas!!
B00942Y94I|5.0|Love this movie. .. the love triangle thickens and becomes something more in depth than a &#34;teen-age&#34; crush.  All of the Twilight movies are great,  just wish it was the original Victoria - character changes in the middle of a saga wasn't the best idea.
0920236162|3.0|I love the message this sends to my 5-year-old daughter in theory, but the pictures are a bit dark so she doesn't enjoy it. Unfortunately, it doesn't get read too much as a result.
B002XHN776|5.0|Such an awesome CD...can't stop listening to it. I love it! The talent from this band is undeniable from the lyrics to the percussion to the guitar rifts....great buy!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I THINK THIS GAME IS FUN !!! Cannot hardly put it down. IT's very enjoyable & easy to play. You also get really nice rewards. Would recommend this game to other Bingo fanatics :)
B00EDK1LP6|5.0|You can really feel the power behind the music.  Ramin Djawad really captures the movements of these colossal monsters and machines in his music.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Catchy, gets better each time I listen.  The title track and Afterlife are teh standouts IMO.  Not Neon Bible but on par with The Suburbs.
B004LUS390|4.0|Still figuring out everything you can do with it and how to do it but so far it's a lot of fun.  My granddaughter and I have made some pretty impressive art with it.  It has a feature that duplicates what you do on one side on the other side so if you draw half a heart, the other half appears on the other side.  We like that one.  It has various tools to make different lines,, too.  Like I said, we are just getting started with it but so far it is really a fun outlet for our artistic side.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|We like the depth of the characters--although they are set in another time and place, they reflect values and customs that affect our culture today.  And the plots give us a chance to evaluate the &#34;old &#34; ways that have perhaps been lost, against the mores of today.
B004YXE438|5.0|Here's the caveat...you get this one and then you get hooked on the puzzles so you HAVE TO get the additions.  They aren't expensive so I ended up with all of them.  I wish they made more.  You can choose how many pieces and the difficulty level.  It has a timer but it just keeps a record of you solving time so you can compete against yourself if you want.  The pictures are, for the most part, very nice and fun to solve.
1476747016|5.0|Pusheen is so cute-- the essence of cat cuteness. The illustrations are purrfect. The captions are funny, endearing and cute. The size of the book is a huggable size -- you can take it with you anywhere. Oen any page and you will be delighted.<br /><br />Pusheen I LUUUV you!!!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Just love this movie ... quirky, offbeat, irreverent, lots of &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments. Can't believe more folks don't know about this movie!  We show it to all our friends.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Always reliable, easy to use and understand.  Has been my old reliable for so many years! Why change something that works!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|For starters when I buy an app even at a small price I don't want it to keep trying to sell me stuff. I also expect it to work this clock kept crashing. I got it so I could use it to wake up in the morning but because it always crashes it doesn't go off. I a l so don't like if kindle is not plugged in it totally kills battery app is already un installed<br /><br />!
B002UTKSBK|5.0|I LOVE this album! I can't push it enough. In my own opinion, this is one of the best soundtracks of all time. I used two songs (\\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\\", \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship (featuring \\"In Dreams\\")\\") from this album in our school drama club production of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and they worked perfectly!<br /><br />The album starts off slow and quiet and comfortable, with \\"The Prophecy\\" and \\"Concerning Hobbits\\". \\"Shadow of the Past\\" and \\"The Treason of Isengard\\" bring in a little darkness, while \\"The Black Rider\\" starts off bouncy and energetic, then gets gloomily suspenseful. \\"At The Sign of the Prancing Pony\\" again is smooth and comfortable, yet with a twinge of sly wariness. \\"A Knife in the Dark\\" is darkly energetic and excited, where as \\"Many Meetings\\" is more easy and relaxed (more luxurious, if you will). \\"The Council of Elrond (Featuring \\"Aniron (Theme for Aragorn and Arwen)\\" is very peaceful, with a beautiful solo by Enya. \\"The Ring Goes South\\" starts off slow and quiet, then builds up until it loudly anounces the Theme for the Fellowship for the trilogy. \\"A Journey in the Dark\\" is again a quite, yet wary piece, from when the Fellowship is in Moria. \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\\" immediately starts off loud iith the Theme for the Fellowship and gets deeper and darker, as it goes on, ultimately ending with the the sad yet beautiful solo as the membersof the Fellowship weep for Gandalf outside Moria. \\"Lothlorien (featuring \\"Lament for Gandalf\\")\\" is a quiet piece that is slightly calming. \\"The Great River\\" sets the mood again for the Fellowship's continuing journey into the next two movies. \\"Amon Hen\\" starts slow, then with recognition to danger, becomes more valiant and boisterous, then ends slowly and sadly with Boromir's Death. \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship (featuring 'In Dreams')\\" is a song that descirbes the whole movie, being valiant, yet quiet and solemn at the same time, nnd often reprises the Theme for the Fellowship, then ends beautifully with the two verses from 'In Dreams' sung by a boys choir. \\"May It Be\\" is the only full song sung by Enya on this album, and when you listen to the words, not only is it relaxing, but it defines The Fellowship, themselves: Bound by honor, and friendship; ever loyal; and they'd go through Hell with each other (which Frodo and Sam ultimately do), and will stick with each other to The End of All Things (pun intended).<br /><br />My Personal favorite tracks from this album are \\"The Black Rider\\", \\"At The Sign of the Prancing Pony\\", \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\\", \\"The Great River\\", \\"Amon Hen\\" (which I think could easily be renamed 'Charge of the Fellowship'), and \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship (Featuring 'In Dreams')\\". This (album, and movie trilogy) is an amazing example of cinematic greatness. I applaude Howard Shore. I got this album when it was on sale for $5.99, so $10.49 is a little steep for just eMusic, even for a soundtrack this good. But I still encourage all y'all, to get it if you're thinking about it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Good game to kill a few minutes here and there. The theme works well with the current holiday season (Halloween).
B00992CF6W|2.0|it wouldn't download and keeps saying download failed I hare when this happens I have it one the computer and xbox but it wouldn't download please help
B00DV9QHB8|5.0|Lang Lang is a perfect fit to play both Bartok 2 and Prokofiev. Although I am not a 100% fan of him ( especially for his other works), I have to say he plays these two piece passionately and also in a precise way.
B002OSY2T6|3.0|Our baby never really got into this toy.<br /><br />But, of course, her personal preference is no reason to downgrade this review. The real reason I give it only three stars is that there isn't much interactivity offered by this toy. Theoretically, they are supposed to push it along and chase after it, but that didn't seem to generate much interest at all. So it basically just sits and plays music and flashes.<br /><br />Not very exciting.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I loved this game so bought the 5 in one special. Included more puzzles and ad free playing, but now the pieces DO NOT FIT SNUG!  It is hard  to even guess which piece fits where. I was about to give it a 5 star rafting, but now it's a one.  Please tell me how to fix this and I'll change my rating.
0321934318|5.0|Love it! Scott Kelby is a great author and easy to understand! I wont be getting rid of my copy anytime soon.
1438074085|4.0|It is a good book, with many excercises for practice, it include all skills, the best was the Vocabolary's book.
B005JVNRA0|4.0|Very good movie that kept you interested in the plot, plenty of action and it is hilarious fun, do enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wow!  this game is so fun, really addictive. I love the Color's. Not something you can breeze through, concentration is a must to play.
B001QWBM62|5.0|For the price, this is a great digital audio recorder.  It picks up sound fairly well and also has two inputs on the bottom.  I would highly recommend this to anything looking to record dialogue or music.  Great item.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Sooooooo good. Like this is one if ny favourite movies ever. No joke dude I love marvel. I loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great<br />Book wider full story enjoyable fun interesting at the gen Khmer hi li mi ninop re to the ho
B00BCX2F66|4.0|I love the durability and the built in stand.  I only wish the cover was designed to suction to the face of the phone.
6305428042|5.0|FAST delivery!! I love this movie. This movie takes me back to my childhood. I love witches, magic and best of all - HALLOWEEN! This is a definite must-see!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Just months ago while I was sick I caught an episode of Castle, from then I was hooked on a show that made me smile, laugh and just flat out enjoy the characters.  Thank you amazon for video at my fingertips.  Give this show a try...you won't be disappointed.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie is very inspirational and teaches a lot about family values and brothers' love. Must see to my opinion
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an excellent history of one of the true creative geniuses of history. It is as much a lesson in imagination as it is a cautionary tale about pissing off the wrong people.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive . I only wish you could get lives back fast but not bad waiting two hours for five lives
B007VUCAVO|5.0|There's not much to say other than this app is easy to install, open and run. Once up it performs flawlessly.  Life should be so simple. Get it, it works.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|The package arrived on-time and in tact. It was a great price too. Though not even amazon can fix the fact that the very first star trek movie is sooo bloody bad I could barely watch it =) I can't belileve we ever liked this movie!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It works! Really enjoyed the book, the concept and the writing. Presents a viable concept in an easily accessible way.
B001FB55YE|1.0|Didnt play on my ps3 :-( will have to buy it again I think, really bummed no clue why it won't play
B009LOJK1Q|1.0|The crappiest book i have ever read. Corny plot. Not recommended to anyone. SK biggest failure ever ever and ever.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book was extremely delightful. You have supence, humor and romance all in one. Rose Gardner is ready to spread her wings and enjoy life, that is until a murder happens. I was entertain all the way through this book. I look forward to the next book.
B001E7EONC|5.0|Great story line with a blend of action and realism.  It is based upon a real scenario.  Statham is great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I could not leave the couch. I watched the whole season in 2 days! I only wish there were more episodes.
B00280LYHS|5.0|i was crying when luke killed himself to defeat kronos. i liked when Anabeth and Percy kissed under water. i would recomend this book for me and connor!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and kept checking hoping kindle would get rights to use. this game is very addictive and fun.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great sound, depth, and volume. Excellent bass for such a small headset. So light you'll forget it's on you head.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is one of the games you play to help pass time quickly. my wife has it on all the time.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This game was so fun and addicting.  The levels are a little challenging when it comes to finding the extras.  There are no ads in this game (that I came across anyway).  Can't wait for an update with more levels!
1449305172|5.0|if you are intending to learn about startups, you should read this book. I always recommend to a lot of people, Ash is a monster lean guy!!
B00F2NOPFG|4.0|I like all Star Trak movie. This one is a must have for me. But I think the Villian ship should be much more better than this. It look like a very very cheap toy, not worth a dime. Very disappointed.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This game is horrible.  It's long and boring and repetitive.  It's impossible to earn enough diamonds to open new rooms without paying real money.  The objects are tiny even on my 8.9 inch Kindle Fire HD.  After I quit out of the game, I can still hear the stupid music on my Kindle, and have to reboot EVERY TIME to get rid of it.  I deleted it from my Kindle.  Don't waste your time!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I loved this app from day one, so much so that finally, literally a day ago I went and upgraded from the free version to the paid version. What was once my go to alarm clock app disappeared and I was left with something ugly in its place. Overnight the clock killed half of my kindle battery. EVERYTHING began running horribly slow on my fire. My keyboard would sometimes not work. The screen flip was slow and chuggy. WTF apalon! I figured it had something to do with the included weather options on the paid one... turned those off, it still ate battery life like a demon. Turned almost every extra option off and it still sucks. Tired to download the free version again and now it was updated to a lite version of the paid app.... that still causes all sorts of problems for my fire.<br /><br />So as of October 31st this app gets nothing but a 2 star from me. Time to look into another app I guess... which is sad because I used to love this clocks musical wake up.<br /><br />Edited Again 10-31:<br /><br />Downgrading to 1. Gave it one last try, redownloaded it and tried setting an alarm for an hour later. Just holding out hope that maybe it wasnt the app killing my battery--- at 11:15 tonight the alarm went off. Checked it to see how much battery life I had left. Went from 100% to 83% and I also noticed the clock at the top of main Kindle Fire screen (to the right of My Kindle) had frozen at 10:20. The app's time was correct, but my actual Kindle was an hour behind. At that point I uninstalled the app and had to restart my kindle for the time to register correctly on my device.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This has been a great game to play.I have only been playing for a day but it's pretty good.I  don't plan on paying out a lot to play, I simply don't do that.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a good game not real easy but not too hard I really wish it was a lot longer
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  It took me a few scenes before I understood the gathering of items.  Once I did understand I was hooked.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Soooooo funny!  I laughed so hard I was crying.  And not just once but many times!  Highly recommend to all
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I'm a big Supernatural fan. I've watched every episode at least twice. Season 3 was pretty good, but, doesn't hold a candle to the previous two. The DVDs themselves are in excellent condition and my package arrived quickly and in one piece.
B00G2SIW7M|3.0|Many excellent songs, but several boring ones also. Including only the best on a single CD would have made it 4 or 5 star.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I have a deep love for Supernatural. After the atrocity that was Season Seven I didn't have much hope for the series. Boy, was I wrong. Season Eight surpassed many of it's previous seasons. The acting gets better, the writing sure as Hell gets better, and, the VFX team really goes all out a few times this season. Definitely worth the price tag if you're a Supernatural fan.
B007W8S2MG|4.0|Some people have already said that the Playstation 2 is without a doubt one of the best consoles of all time. I can agree with that statement as there were some great games released for that console such as Kingdom Hearts, Ratchet and Clank and even the Persona series. But that was back then and now the Playstation 2 has been forgotten about but the games still remain. Persona was a series that has spanned from the original Playstation all the way up to the PS3 and even arcade games. It usually dealt with teenagers who were able to call upon their psyche (called personas) to battle strange enemies. Persona 4 was one of the pinnacles of these games and now Persona 4 Golden is now available for the PS Vita. But will this game have you longing from the nostalgic playstation 2 games or is this a game you should skip altogether?<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden is not just a rehash of the Playstation 2 game there are new features that available on this game and nowhere else. The biggest difference is that you can unlock two new social links named Adachi and Marie who is exclusive to this version of Persona 4. And both of these social links can unlock various dungeons as well as new content for the stories and different endings both good and bad. There are also new levels of difficulty in this game ranging from Safety (or very easy) to Risky (or very hard). Also there are new areas to explore including a beach and a ski resort even Okina City which was only seen in cutscenes is now available to explore.<br /><br />One of the neatest features about this version of Persona 4 is that it incorporates wi fi to the experience. If your party is critical and needs help you can broadcast a call for help over wi fi for people to come to your aid. It is a very innovative feature of gameplay and can get your characters out of a tight spot when they need it.<br /><br />And that just scratches the surface of all the new features that are jam packed into this version of Persona 4! There are new ways to get around via motorbikes, the ability to skip cutscenes if you have played the game in the past and new events such as a skiing trip and Halloween! If you have either wanted to play a persona game or have played them in the past and own a vita this is definitely the game to get!new ways to get around via motorbikes, the ability to skip cutscenes if you have played the game in the past and new events such as a skiing trip and Halloween! If you have either wanted to play a persona game or have played them in the past and own a vita this is definitely the game to get!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game and the changes they make to the background to keep it interesting. The only thing that bothers me is it glitches on both my kindle fire and my note two. Other than that super cute game that even 5 year old loves to play.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|I still like The Great Gatsby better with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford, had to watch this new one twice to appreciate it more. I enjoyed the party scenes. In the end this is a very emotionally moving movie. Romantic
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A classic Reacher novel, terse dialogue and good character development.  The plot twists will keep the reader interested and looking forward to the final word.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|The figure looks real. I'm keeping it in the box. The blue crystal and duffle bag with money are both  made of solid plastic. I'm glad I was able to buy one to add to my collection.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|So thankful I didn't pay to watch this boring movie. Would have been demanding a refund. Slow moving , worst Paranormal movie I have seen yet
B00005JKDR|5.0|This has quickly become my daughter's favorite movie. If you have never seen this cinematic classic, then you are missing out. A great story about a company who's job it is to bottle the scares of children to power the world, with a very sweet story line about the main &#34;scarer&#34; being soft for a certain child. Sully plays the main monster, and my daughter loved it so much it's what I ended up being for Halloween!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone must have!!!!<br />Should be promoted around the world!!<br />Deep respect for creators & the film crew! I'll promote it to my friends!!!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I like this game very much. Just not enough levels. It is addictive, very challenging and frustrating at times, but that is what makes it fun. More please!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This app works really well with my Kindle fire 4G. My family uses it on trips all the time to  look up places of interest and the best local places to eat. Without it you miss all the best local activites
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my friend had this game and I lovveeeeeeeeeeeeee it thanks minions. y'all made me love this game and the movie both of them
B004UJAOLM|5.0|There is nothing to dislike, besides the characterizations chosen by Emily Brontë.<br /><br />This is a good read to anyone of High school years and above.<br /><br />The five-star rating comes from the immaculate writing of miss Brontë. Though she was ill in mind, she was an incredible writing, by syntax, diction in word usage and dialect, and by plot. A read I'll read for Christmas' to come!
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|Love these little guys!  Haven't used banana plugs since they used to come in pairs together.  These individual ones are easy to assemble and fit my speaker connections nice and tightly.  Good to know that wires aren't going to come loose anymore and the gold plating makes them impervious to corrosion.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|First I should say I'm a huge fan of The Shinning. And luckily this is a great follow up without trying g to outdo the original. Sure characters appear in both books as do places but the tone and feel are very different. Doctor Sleep is a very fast fun read dir any King fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy that the game is finally on Kindle. I play it on my phone also so addictive. Download it and enjoy it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Two days in a row now, the new Yahoo mail has connected two of my incoming emails together. I cannot reply to the separately, and there is nothing they have in common. I nearly lost a friend who thought I ignored his invitation to dinner.<br />These conversations are a pain. I just went into my settings and deleted that aspect. Too much stuff. I can see a thread in an ordinary email by scrolling down, so Yahoo does not need to remind me.<br />The simple things are sometimes better.<br />Please do not give us stuff we did not ask for, cannot use, and definitely do not want.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Perfect. The disc works exactly at it should. As for the movie itself, what can I say... It is the Terminator! One of my top ten all time favorite movies (a series counts as one.)
B000ID3KU6|4.0|Is a little long and drags at times but if you watch it in one hour segments you will find it well worth watching. Fonda is brilliant as a cold blooded killer who early in the movie shoots a small boy because he saw him  kill his family. The mystery surrounding the harmonica playing gunslinger that is his nemesis throughout the movie is answered shockingly at the end. And good prevails over evil. This is on of the best westerns I have ever seen. And the memory of the ending will be etched forever in your memory.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|What can I say... It is the Terminator. One of my top 10 all-time favorite movies/series.<br /><br />I have not opened it yet so I cannot rate he quality of this particular blu-ray.
B00FPH6PRK|4.0|The Conjuring is one of the best of its genres that I have seen Ina long time. the true story is told in an almost docu style ..in a very grown up way. There are no cheap thrills or frights in this film....the facts just keep building and they are scary and chilling. As for the performances...each actor is playing it straight.  The &#34;special&#34; effects are minimal and the lighting is dark but this dark tale simply works.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|Decided to buy this unit because of good reviews and manufacturer claims that it can charge two devices at the same time, even tablets.  Used it yesterday to charge my Samsung Galaxy S4 while using GPS App for navigation.  Charging indicator  indicates its charging but closer look its really losing power.  Power level is slowly going down instead of going up.  Phone run out of juice before I reached my destination.  I also bought the Anker dual port wall charger which is primarily stored on my emergency bag on my car.  Will write another review as soon as I have the chance to use it.
1932100660|4.0|Could not find at the local libraries and bookstores. Good to easily find online. Have not finished reading. One of main books to read changing the perspective to any heart patient.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game came up, but it did not work.  I  could not get any object to move.  I took it off my Kindle then reinstalled.  No movement.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|I almost didn't get it after reading some of the reviews.<br />It does fit your hand very well. Shoot the D800E without the grip is kinda tough. The body is small and needs a grip for &#34;Portrait&#34; shots. It does make the camera a little taller than the D3s. I would recommend it to everyone with a D800.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always you think one thing and a surprise turn will change everything. Very hard to stay away from book. Read it in two days. Great job!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to finally be able to download candy crush for my kindle fire!!!  I've had no problems since I downloaded.
B00127RAJY|5.0|definitely get a work out, needed a change of pace in my work out and this worked great...... need more words yeeaahh
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It had been a long time since I felt &#34;on the edge of my seat&#34;.  This is what I feel with this series.  To me, the basis is not the zombies themselves but what humans can achieve (or not achieve) when survival is at stake.  I truly recommend this series.
B000007UTN|5.0|What can I say? This is a classic, must-have record if you are into Radiohead and well worth having on vinyl.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Hey I have a problem. I cant put the icon to my tablets homescreen. But I can still play it.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|When I first used it it was good.  Now I only get goats to shoot at and when I hit them it tells me my hunt has failed, over and over.  Can't get back to deer hunting.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|I'm a huge Jack Johnson fan..mostly because of how clean his recordings are  but this album seems like a Country Western theme.<br /><br />I would rather listen to his old style than try to cross over...maybe I'm wrong here...like his other albums better!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|we love this game, my kids love playing it and play it all the time. definitely one to download if you can
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|...which is to provide basic protection AND fit in an iPhone holder on my bicycle.  Other than that, not much to it.
0756407915|5.0|There's so much wisdom in this book. It's almost more an exploration of disparate philosophies than an adventure novel,but only almost. The characters are compelling and the pace is generally good. Some chunks feel like exposition, but those are short and worthwhile.
B007WPM4P0|4.0|The acting is wonderful, the relationship between the principals has great chemistry and a good look at the horrors of WWI.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|Boring, self-involved, trivial. Very hard for me to imagine how or why this has been such a hit. The most superficial kind of fluff.
B0081336FO|5.0|We're anxiously awaiting season 3 because we enjoyed the first two seasons when we discovered them looking through our Amazon Prime video selections.
B00E8TWPI4|5.0|My 6 and 9 year old daughters love this movie. We downloaded it onto their Kindle. It took awhile but was totally worth it. Great kid movie, catchy songs, and appropriate subjects.
B00B9B4IYI|3.0|It was not as easy to sink as I would anticipate. I have already had to sink my devices multiple times to get them to work properly. When its working its awesome. Needs work!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have been enjoying this game very much. It is very addicting and fun to play. I have yet to come across any problems. It runs very smoothly.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'm so glad we finally were able to see this series. Now I know why everyone else was so addicted. Amazing show.  Great acting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING AND FRUSTRATING.  Hard TO PUT DOWN.  This could cost me some cash if I am not careful.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I have become disenchanted with hip hop recently, but this is not why. New style, great beats, great flow, great lyrics.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|I purchased this for Christmas for the grandchildren. How can you not love this movie.  Great family entertainment for the grandchildren.
0307245306|4.0|Very enjoyable book. It's nice to be able to listen when you can't read it yourself. It's also fun to hear it put to voice. It made me laugh more.
B00EPFEY44|2.0|Bocelli is great, and the Portofino concert, as seen on PBS, was fantastic.  Which makes this offering so disappointing...the DVD does not include all the songs as seen in the original showing. Why?
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Its the big bang theory. what is there really to say? if you are far enough in that you are thinking about getting season 6 then you know what the show is about and how funny it is. I would actually argue it is funnier than season 5.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|So many people have offered excellent reviews and observations on this movie that I feel a bit superfluous adding my thoughts, so I'll keep this short and sweet.<br /><br />Much Ado is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays because it ends in earned love and nobody dies. Whedon captures the sheer joy of the play, but he also eclipses it with enough darkness that the happy ending is not assured. The look on poor, innocent Hero's face as she is falsely denounced by an inherently decent man who has been duped by a cruel trick is enough to break the heart of a cynic. In \\"Othello,\\" a similar deception ends in murder and tragedy.<br /><br />Whedon has chosen to use Shakespeare's own words, without paraphrasing, throughout the film, a pretty bold decision when you also decide to set it in contemporary times. Because the actors are so good, even if you have never read the play, you will follow the story without difficulty. The choice to open the movie with Benedick and Beatrice having once consummated their attraction alters the entire dynamic and thrust of the story. It was an inspired decision, but a risky one.<br /><br />Black and white suits this film. Partly, it is the astonishing architecture of the house itself (designed and built by Whedon's wife...how lucky is this dude?), which is a meditation on light, glass, mirrors, and what we see and don't see.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion's performance as Dogberry is the best I've seen. It is funny and pivotal to the happy conclusion, but not a parody. He invests the character with an ineffable quality of desire for nobility. It is an interpretation of the character that I have not seen before and made me happy for the education in how a gifted actor can bring a new perspective on any character, no matter how well known.<br /><br />The characters spend almost all the movie with a drink in their hand, which was occasionally distracting, but that is such a small complaint when measured against Amy Ackers' brilliance (her fierce demand for Claudio's death, among many other excellent moments, including her gift for physical comedy), Gregg was not the first choice for Leonato, I understand, but his essential good humor and decency invests him with the requisite qualities to settle all matters at the end. Franz Kranz is amazing as Claudio. Even as he is destroying Hero, you still like him, Alexis Denisof was able to morph from a witty hedonist to someone who not only appreciates Beatrice, but deserves her.<br /><br />I liked this movie. Wish I'd seen it in a theater. It is worth renting if you, like me, like romantic comedies that have a hint of potential tragedy in them.
142312166X|4.0|It was in perfect shape and I received it in the amount of time alotted by Amazon...  I love this series...  This one really did connect the other books together...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So so sorry this is out for kindle.  Going to lose my job, my kids and my pets because of this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was well-paced and lived up to the hard task of keeping my attention, especially through the second half. I would absolutely recommend it!
B007UXTG8M|4.0|A visceral look at a sex addict and the turmoils of his family life as well as professional life...I always love the cinematography of Steve's movies...
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I like the way Mr Martin has created a fantasy world which we can readily relate to actual history (Wars of the Roses). He has weaved a rich tapestry from different story threads, and infused the whole with elements of fantasy and imagination.
B009XPFS5A|5.0|Found myself watching all 6 episodes in marathon fashion!  Couldn't get enough!  Just when you think they're on their way, another bomb gets dropped!  Love it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I literally just finished this book and needed to share how awesome a read it is. me Before You touched me down to the core. sp tender and expressive I felt I knew the characters personally. I could not put this down so anxious to see how this story would wind up. a fabulous read memorable and stand out as one of the best books I have read.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I love digital animation and I'm continually amazed at how it evolves over time. The Croods are a &#34;caveman&#34; family who's lifestyle is forced to change as their world begins to self-destruct. It's great family entertainment filled with humor and  emotion, lots of gorgeous scenery, wonderful characters, and a very happy and touching ending. This one goes on my Favorites list.
B001NN413K|1.0|The DVD did not work on my DVD players or computers because it was a &#34;Region 2&#34; dvd meaning it was for the Europe area. I am from the states and apparently in &#34;Region 1&#34;. I did not know of there being varied regions for DVD play. All the same the seller knew where they were sending the DVD and did not bother to double check that I still, indeed, wanted the DVD as it was obvious I was not in Europe. To return the DVD would cost me more than simply buying a new one. I am deeply disappointed in Rarewaves,com's customer service. Will note purchase another item from this company.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I hate that you can only play a few times then you it tells you that you have to wait like 25 min to be able to play again. If the company truly wants people to love it they need to get rid of that!  I wont be playing this game much. We shouldne able to play as long as we want.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|It was great in the visual and special effects, but it was a bit of a disappointment in the storytelling.  It was a modern update of the Wrath of Khan from the orignal.  But Cumberbatch does an excellent version of Khan.  But it still was a good movie, give it a try.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lot's of fun. Figuring outcwhat the puzzle pieces are so you can solve the puzzle....about three hours to do all the levels
B009NH6JRE|5.0|This is the best series on T.V. right now.  We have bought all the seasons.  If you have not seen The Walking Dead you are missing out.
B00881VLCE|3.0|First of all, I absolutely love the puzzles. They're great. They give you a huge variety to choose from. I also like how you can choose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be(35, 70, 140, 280). So if you can solve a hard one, just make it easier. That said..... here's my one and only complaint, and it's a big one. The app only opens half the time. Well not even half, more like a fourth:( I have to do a lot to get it to work. Here's an example. (I have a Kindle)  I go to Applications, Clear the Cache, do a hard shut down, restart the device, then it will usually play. Now honestly, who in the world would wanna go through all that everytime you wanna do a puzzle?? It's insane, just fix the damn thing. PLEASE! When it doesn't play. The adds still show up on the bottom of the screen, but the rest is just black. It needs an update or something.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a well written bio that helps us understand a bit about leadership and its foibles.  Jobs had great success in a too short life, and he did it with drive and grit and sometimes stepping on people.  He was quite strange and yet quite human.  Isaacson does an excellent job of telling a story and his narration of his own words is clear and helps capture the story.  If you have the wear-withall to get both the text and the audio, I found it helpful and interesting.  Amazon makes it not too expensive to do so.  I went back and forth between the two and Audible/Amazon keeps track of where you are.  I would not do that for all books, but this is a longish story and sometimes you just want to read a while instead of listen.  On a long drive listening is good.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|It was a great step by step look at a master presenter. A must read for every manger. Simple and captivating.
6305014140|5.0|it's a great movie and the item arrived in good condition on time. I had no problems whatsoever with the purchase if i had the chance to buy again i would.
0375869026|5.0|This is a well-written, easy to read book which deals with many factors young people deal with:  peer pressure, bullying, etc.  The best part about it is that it demonstrates how effective different strategies are in dealing with these things.
B00C9QQBA6|4.0|In this story love transcends all. A love story for the beginning (of the series) and for all times.<br /><br />Aurora Conspiracy the Series: Crash Landing is a short, but sweet, beginning to the Aurora Conspiracy series. It's light and fun and gets you geared up and ready to read the next books. Emily is high-spirited, stubborn with a mind of her own, but with loving parents, she's able to think and act for herself. Enter Aurelius, mysterious, strong, and out of this world (literally) handsome, and it's love at first sight. You find yourself smiling through the entire story. And I like that it's different from the formulistic romance stories -- girl meets boy, they fall in love, something horrific makes them break up, then they realize (after much angst) that they can't live without one another and presto, happy ending! This was realistic and endearing from start to finish.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. I did find the language by the characters and narrator contained anachronisms at times which would throw me out of the story and was disturbed by the sinful act that the character then publically thanked God for, but that won't stop me from reading all of the other Aurora Conspiracy books.<br /><br />I recommend starting with this book and reading straight through to the end of the series.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I didn't really care for the game.  It wasn't what I thought it would be, I had hoped it would have been like a game I had played before.
B009LDD54K|5.0|i understand that this was based on true facts how sad for the children to be treated in such a way. I thoroughly enjoyed it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am now addicted to this game. The great thing about it is if you run out of lives and have no money to buy more, your friends on Facebook can just give you more lives and you can give them lives as well. It is a really fun game with different types of levels. I love all the games made by King. Unfortunately, both Diamond Digger Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga are not on Kindle. I had to use a third party app to get them but can't purchase lives, etc on them since I didn't get them from the Kindle app store. Please add both Apps to Kindle so my purchases will be allowed. I'm stuck on a level that I know I need extra lives or a booster to complete. I can play over and over but I need more turns in the game to win. It is very frustrating.
B009CG3M1C|4.0|It is a great action movie, with a great sound track!!!!WOOOOOOOOOOOOO  I tell all my friends they need to watch the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game to pass the time away.  Age appropriate for children to adults.  This will quickly become your favorite game.
1451666179|5.0|If you've read any of her blog, you already know the quality of what you'll get in the book.  Yes, some of it is recycled from the blog, but really, I'm fine with that, because a) every bit of it is worth reading again and b) I'm glad to have a way to support the author for all the amusement (and, in the case of the sections about depression, words to explain the experience to other people) I've gotten over the years.  The new material is as great as the old as well.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fast pace and super fun to play. The only thing I don't like is the energy ratio for every little action like cutting trees but other than that it is really cool.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Purchased. the game yesterday and man I'm addicted. You cant help but get hooked on this game. I absolutely love it. I look forward to my hour commute to work each day on the train. I have it on my Samsong S4 and my kindle fire. What a way to hone your battle skills. Never thought I could have so much fun with a free game. Now you can earn your way to better and faster planes; but how can you resist not buying Mach 2.4 capability for only .99. I dare you to not like this game. Great job Third  Wire. This is my second gamer with these guys. Definitely a satisfied customer.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|Coming from England this is a classsic film that I had not watched for many years, but it is still as good. The cliffhanger ending always needed a sequel.<br />A great film with some good Brit humor, it will 'blow yer b....y doors off!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I still download podcasts occasionally from the BBC but this is really a handy and quick way to keep up with what interests me in the news.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game. My friends kept trying to get me to play it and I finally did.  Now I am hooked.  Thanks guys.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was written back and forth from Tris' and Tobias' points of view.  I couldn't put the book down and really enjoyed it.  The ending wasn't as I would have wanted in my own perfect world but a day after finishing it I have come to accept it and I'm okay with it.  :)  I urge you to read it yourself if you loved the first two and understand you may not agree with the ending but that is the beauty of books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes an excellent mystery. The plot twisted and turned and kept me guessing. It is different from so many other stories. Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love the ease of this game, not long and drawn out, but a quick bit of fun. It's fun to see how many fruit you can slash at once!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn was such a great writer. He kept his readers on the edge of their seats supporting Mitch Rapp and the USA. &#34;The Last Man&#34; has many plot twists and turns. I recommend this book to everyone interested in spies and dealing with terrorists and threats against the USA. Vince Flynn will be greatly missed. His books are so realistic that the reader can't help wondering if he was ever in the CIA.
0307593525|5.0|My friend has been wanting these books as she is a fan of Julia Child, so I bought it for her for a birthday present and she was ecstatic.
B005544V6A|5.0|Awesome !! This show just sucks you in I was up all night binge watching. Enjoy the show... Cheers Ray
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent writing ! Each character is unique and keeps the suspense all thru book. I could not put this novel down
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the clasic games out there ..... that has been given a really nice twist. It is very addicting and a lot of FUN.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Cross between Comics and Super hero action film with Carrey humor throughout.  Start a little slow but build nicely as the movie rolls along.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Amazing story about a man and his teddy bear and how his life must continue through all the struggles of relationship
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Nice to see the big stars putting together a show for the kids, Well done for the Kids and adults will find some humor along the way.
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|I really liked this show.  It is my understanding it is 'historical fiction&#34; based on legends rather than historical, but that doesn't matter to me. It is, IMO, well done.  It shows their realistic living.  It only gets 4 stars rather than 5 because the blu ray was VERY expensive for only 9 episodes.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A book that is reminiscent of the Stephen King of old.  As \\"The Shining\\"  is one of my favorites, I loved finding out what happened to Dan. A hero that is human, with many shortcomings but puts his past behind him and finds a way to give to others through his special gift. Abra is strong, wise beyond her years and absolutely endearing.
0066620996|5.0|Great book with Great insights for excelling in business and How to grow your business in a sustainable and rapid manner
B000NY12CI|4.0|This book opened my eyes what it is to be a woman in Muslim society. It was a book that I had to read slowly in bits and pieces to understand what happened to this woman.<br /><br />A must read for every woman
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game is fun, wonderful and enjoying to play it's also fun and safe for kids of all ages to enjoy
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A story of a girl at the time that was dangerous in Germany. A story of survival and the people that protected her. This book is so good I wanted to read more when I was done with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga I love it can't get enough of it it's fun and safe for kids of all ages it's also very addictive
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a good read. A story of two women and how their lives came together in the end. A book of love and forgiveness.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great setup book for the final book. Can't wait to start it right now. I hope the movie can live up
0321934318|5.0|Thanks Scott for being clear and precies.<br />I donot like long and winded comments.<br />Look forward to The next Lightroom programe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive,  extreme fun!  Great graphics, good for eye-hand coordination, strategic thinking, logical brain training, all around great game! Good job!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Great action packed movie a must buy for the collection by far my favorite of all the movies hope they make another one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome in the pm. When nothing good is on tv., also keeps mind busy when trying to quit smoking!!! Definitely a bonus.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book stinks like Dudley in the hood man like me like the homes of in the sea like me
B0052UZIFA|5.0|it was fun to play just like Plants vs Zombies is always been fun to playthank you for charging me my money for it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Truly addictive.  I love this game.  If u like games candy crush is a must buy.  I wonder if a vegetable crush is coming?
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I find the two button interface on the GoPro infuriating.  This Touch BacPac takes away the pain and suffering.  I use it all the time.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|This seems to be a great product but the cloud choices do not include Amazon Cloud.. why not?  It's being sold on Amazon to work with Kindle Fires, it would stand to reason that Amazon Cloud would be included in the cloud choices..
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Anything that keeps the angry birds flying is fine by me. I like the new and different things in the game.
B00D7NWTSI|2.0|Truly forgettable.  Don't waste your time. This might be okay for 12 year olds or people who are not interested in any story or character development.
B007SG9L5E|5.0|Actually, my husband is the one who really likes this.  I like it, but not as much as he does.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Really nothing special about this series. Was almost like watching Downton Abbey, but not quite as engaging. Maybe will improve after a few more episodes.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I like all of the Resident Evil movies, and this is one that I did not own.  When I saw that I could get it and for a good price, I bought it.  I really liked the movie.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Bought in advance of seeing him live in NYC on Sept 26th as a wedding anniversary surprise for my wife.  We had great seats at orchestra floor, and he played probably  4-5 songs from this album (if memory is correct).
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|I wonder why Carlos Santana is never invited to this event! He is a great admirer of Mr. Clapton and I'm assuming the feeling is reciprocated! They have toured together and recorded together! Invite Mr. Santana next time!  Ed Carson
B00CXQL828|5.0|Bought in advance of them playing at the Starland Ballroom, in New Jersey.  Great tunes, catchy, and not only is Portnoy great on Drums, Billy Sheehan is just as great as he was, if not better, than when I was introduced to him over 25 years ago.
159562015X|5.0|If you're looking to find your strengths, look no further.  This is the book for you.  Easy to follow test, realistic expectations.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|This album's not bad, but it's not great either. It has it's good and bad points, and in the end it's okay.<br /><br />  I'll start with what's good:<br /><br />  1) It's cohesive.  There's a definite sound and feeling that permeates the album. The mood is consistent and nothing on the album feels out of place.<br /><br />  2) It's different than their other albums. One thing I've come to enjoy about Arcade Fire is that no two albums sound the same. And I'm glad this doesn't sound like an attempt to recreate The Suburbs or anything else.  They chose a new direction and stuck with it. That's commendable.<br /><br />  3) There are some really good songs on the album. In fact most of the first disc is very good (with a couple exceptions). It's catchy and works its way into your brain like every other album they've released.<br /><br />  4) The first disc moves along well. Despite the consistent atmosphere and sound, the songs on the first disc are different enough, and switch tempos often enough to make it an interesting and engaging listen. I was very pleased with the first disc.  But I was also  hoping that the second disc would be a complete change from the first....<br /><br />  Onto the bad...<br /><br />  1) The second disc is boring. It's cutting room floor material. It continues the mood of the first disc, but it's not nearly as good as the first disc. The progression feels sloppy and there's only one, maybe two good songs on it. There's nothing particularly catchy or exciting, and at this point the sound has become stale.<br /><br />  2) The song writing itself is not nearly as interesting this time around. I think The Suburbs has great lyrics, and Funeral has great, really weird lyrics that stick in your head. The lyrics in Reflektor feel very superficial (despite what seems like an attempt to feel otherwise) and they're not particularly interesting. Take a song like \\"Laika\\" or \\"Suburban War:\\" They're haunting--and you find yourself thinking about them as youlisten to the songs and trying to imagine exactly what the singer's singing about. \\"Laika\\" is still a bit of a mystery to me.  This type of writing does not exist on Reflektor. The lyrics are simple, and become more and more redundant as the album progresses.  There are catchy melodies here and there, and as always, the lead singer has a great voice, but they lyrics themselves are lacking.<br /><br />  3) I wish the female singer appeared more often.<br /><br /> 4) It's shallow.  I listened to the Suburbs for an entire year almost every day. Same with Funeral.  Those albums grew and grew and grew on me, and it took a long time before I felt I had really digested them. I didn't even like Funeral at first.  Reflektor on the other hand was likable immediately, but after several listens, I get the feeling that this doesn't have what it takes to go the length. I could be wrong, but it feels like it lacks a heart.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Constant nickel & diming to advance the game really ticks me off. But what else is there to expect from King.com
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I downloaded Reflecktor and listened to it all the way through. It usually takes me time to warm up to songs. Though this record was different and unlike their previous albums there was no &#34;warm-up&#34; period. I think this has a lot to do with some of the new sounds and the beats that make it easy to dance to (Here Comes The Night Time and Joan of Arch) that drew me in. Overall it's a great album and was worth the wait!
B009MYARIK|5.0|this book was wonderful! it was silly and light...just what any reader would expect from a sophie book. many parts literally had me laughing out loud and who doesn't want a nice break from the everyday serious stuff? i definitely recommend this book!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good game like the power ups just like subway surfer but better like the minions good game very good game
B005LJITS0|3.0|Lots of action, but very unbelievable. All these Green Lantern elders that have been around for eons and cannot figure out how to do away with the villain. In comes the new guy from earth and their problem is solved.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Easy to learn, great casual game, would recommend to anyone interested in having fun.  Theme is child friendly.<br /><br />Great for new gamers or hardcore ones.<br /><br />If you don't have this, try it out!
B004P02OJ6|5.0|Almost any movie with Russell Crowe in it is usually worth seeing. This one is not exception.<br />A very exciting believable movie. Keeps you guessing right to the end.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun to play, but once you get to rounds in the 20s, it loses some of the fun. Maybe I am just bad at it, but it is not fun to die 5 or 10 times trying to get through a round. It's a game!
B001UG56ES|5.0|It was a great action packed movie. I love movies about Australia. The actors were great. This is the second time I have seen it and I will probably watch it again in a year or two.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Even my two year old likes to play. Fun for the whole family. Don't get stuck in the chocolate!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Exquisitely written and devilishly decadent. Can't wait to download the next book! Keep me reading everyday. A wonderful story, worth it!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Touching, reflective, and honest! I 've  really enjoyed it, couldn't put it down. It speaks truth and touches us all in our various experiences from our youth to adulthood.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one if the best books I've read in a long time I mean literally WOW I can't wait to start book two and then three and then the movie definitely worthy of re reading over and over grey is a mess 😳😳
B00BEJOMIW|4.0|Have been hearing all these reveiws the the new Gatsby was so much better than the 70's version, but I don't agree.  Since they pretty much followed it word for word, I think the depth of characters were much better.  I mean Mia Farrow does drive me crazy, but I think she was suppose to.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|What I about this dictionary is you could look up words that you don't know. What I dislike is that you can't type letter that you need .
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Interesting perspectives of the 2 narrators: an Irish indentured servant and a slave on a Virginia plantation around 1800. It kept me up late. Loved the period details.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|This app is the best I scared so many people with app even some the cured the calmly thought there were really ghost
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Interesting premise with undertones not all that far from reality. Truly carries the potential to alter your perspective. Good read.
B0001I561E|4.0|It was great to see the kids liked the movie, got it for my grandkids and glad they can watch it when they want to.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Not as good as suburbs, two inconsistent with some great songs mixed with mediocre.  They appear to be trying too hard here to be 'different' when they already had the recipe down.  When U2 followed Joshua Tree with Achtung it was amazing and they pulled it off...not so much here
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The story was pretty good and the comedy within the super heroes added to the film over all. The action scenes were very entertaining. A fantastic film everyone should watch.
B000YGIIPO|5.0|Pratchett's books are never offensive and always entertaining, even when intended for kids. Why do I have to write 7more words?
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Egger's take on our willingness to trade privacy for convenience is all too believable because it's not that exaggerated from what already exists, especially as Google places mystery barges off our coasts.  The novel does tend to get a bit preachy and repetitious, but it serves well as both satire and cautionary tale.
B001NOD0Q8|1.0|michael moorcock's dancers at the end of time  trilogy  may interest those with a more vivid imagination. space aliens, time travelers , a love story ,  and the  best writer in modern fantasy fiction for a tour de force. \\"the supreme achievement in modern imaginative fiction\\" from the guardian upon its' release says it all.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is the best set of Rocky movies ever!  It is all of them and in Blu-Ray for less than the DVD!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Excellent, the handle stays cool to the touch and the coals always burn correctly. This is really for small grills though, I should have gotten the regular sized one because you can just put less charcoal in it and it's only like a few bucks more at the time I bought it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great,fantastic;it's about time you brought Candy Crush Saga to Kindle. I've been waiting for this. GET IT NOW. Don't wait
0345803493|5.0|Loved the books - but you need to realize this is adult subject matter. I would suggest reading it with your significant other.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great book by The King! If you ever wondered what happened to Danny, from The Shinning, bu it! If you didn't, buy it anyway! The book explores a whole new level of possibilities and consequences of the shine.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Love Gillian Flynn! I think she is my new favorite author. Can't wait to read more from her! 2nd favorite book. Sharp objects is my number 1!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game!  works way better then temple run and all of those others.  has the best characters.  its never shutdown on me.  get this app!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I appreciate the scholarly and objective approach to this story of the life of Jesus. I do wish the author had employed the King James version for his Biblical references, as this poetic and beautiful translation justifies the value placed on this heterogeneous collection of writings. Although Jesus was only one of many messianic claimants, his beautifully phrased parables and inspiring expressions of love seem to have set Him apart, along with a charismatic personality.
0060555661|3.0|Printing is too small.  I ordered it for my husband and he has a problem with reading fine print.  It will take him some time to read it now as he can only read for a short time.
B002APU580|5.0|Awesome movie!  Great actors,  if you love Jane Austin you will love this!  You just can't find great movies like this anymore.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|not being able to sleep I got this game. mistake #1. playing in the dark...mistake #2. never knew a game could be scary. wow.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Words fail me when I try to say how bad this film version of one of my favorite books was. I cannot imagine what the director was thinking of.  he obviously didn't get the book at all and what it was trying to say.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This apps provides quick and easy utility to take, edit and use digital memory. I like it and use it regularly.
B00F9040HU|3.0|I love the game but I am disappointed it isn't available for my kindle fire hdx.  I have to play on an older kindle.  You all should keep up with the new technology or you will lose customers
B00DFBY1CE|3.0|Expected a little more .... But, I'm a hard room.  It is still worth a listen. Not sorry I bought it.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I have been using a different alarm for a year, but wanted a new one. I purchased this and it has drained my battery twice in 1-1/2 weeks. My phone heated up and my battery was unusually low. I went into battery in settings and MY Alarm was using 36% of my battery use, more than the Android operating system the first time. The second time it was again the top user of battery power; I didn't even bother to look at the percentage. I immediately deleted the App.<br />Only .99, but a waste for me.<br />(And no, I didn't contact the maker of the app. I am not interested in using it.)<br />A have a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've played a lot of puzzle games lately and this is one of my favorites. It's elegant. Great feel to the graphics. Not too difficult, but challenging. Great game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really enjoy the accuracy of this app. I have three but this one is the best for forecast, and also wonderful for emergency information.  This one is a keeper, really like the format.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I am inexperienced when it comes to creating documents. After I downloaded this app I easily created two documents for my church (which surprised my husband who is the pastor). I am so happy that I have this app. Now I have no excuse when it comes to creating documents and letters. kudos to the developers.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|An interesting read at the start but then it kind of drags on. Felt like I wanted to get to the conclusion but all of the in-between didn't keep my interest all that much.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I do a lot of repairs for friends and family and for work related issues and this tool set has everything you need to the job. From laptops to any type of cell phones, ipads ect....
0596009208|4.0|I found this at our local library but liked it enough to buy one for myself.  Some OOP snobs don't think java is a real object language but this book explains it in a nutshell.  I also recommend Ivor Horton's Beginning Java 2, which is equally good as primer.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Wonderful movie. And also delivered on time and was in perfect condition. Great sound and video quality. John Mayer is such a great artist.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Wish Tris didn't have to die. Other than that I liked it. Didn't feel like she left me hanging at the end.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|i bought this adapter for my first gen Bose ipod dock station for my Iphone 4 to work on, it worked perfectly and charged the phone as well, i then bought another one for my Scion XB that allows me to use my phone in the car to play the ipod or music in general and also charges the phone in a quick amount of time.  i would recommend this to anyone who has an old pin config on their phone and to anyone who isnt getting charges out of their docking station
1401235417|5.0|I have been salivating to get started on this series and now that the new 'Death in the Family' saga is about to be coming out in trade (It's out at time of this review publication and I'm reading it!) I thought I'd better put other things aside and dive in.  Wow!  This was worth waiting for; it was even better than I had hoped for.  I'm a big Batman fan; I've read DC comics off and on all my life but never read them in order or became fangirl-ish about them so while I know all the heroes and villains I'm not up on the backstory of everybody.  The new 52 is awesome in my book as it lets me get a new fresh look as if I'm a newcomer.  Snyder's Batman is the dark, broody one I love so much!  The first little scene at the Asylum was fun with all the villains and I loved! how the Riddler had a shaved head with a green question mark of hair shaped onto his head.  We meet all three Robins which was great for me as I'm really only familiar with Dick Grayson in that role and never read Nightwing.  He is the only one who features in the rest of the book, in his Nightwing role, and I liked the character enough that I want to read that series of the 52.  Batman finds a new villainous group, The Court of Owls, has been operating underground in Gotham since the 1800s and has a connection with his family.  They have sent an assassin, The Talon, out to get Batman.  A dark, involved story with equal amounts of action and plot.  Capullo's art is marvellous; the colours suit the mood and the &#34;owl&#34; members are certainly eerie.  I found myself page-turning through the novel, but not too fast as I had to savour the art, and the ending left me with a rush.  Great new start to the Batman!
B00821OX98|4.0|Another fun apocalyptic sci-fi adventure! Monsters, family relationships, tender moments, scary moments; not the very best, but certainly enjoyable to watch!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|The movie had a great premise and brings full the Monsters idea to a great continuum.  Has some great college related gags which those of us who went to College identify with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's definitely worth the download.  I am sure you will enjoy it too. Have fun!!!!
B004LWZW8S|4.0|As far as the seller, well that part was great.  The movie however, was not that great a movie, I am not the spoiler type so I suggest renting it before you buy it! Unless of course you find a good used deal on one that's comparable to a renting price.
0770435726|4.0|As I neared the end of Chris Pavone's debut novel, \\"The Expats,\\" I was immediately reminded of two things. The first was a line from \\"The Lion in Winter\\" (1968) in which Prince Geoffrey remarks to his mum, \\"I know. You know I know. I know you know I know. We know Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it. We're a knowledgeable family.\\" The second was just about any episode of a Hercule Poirot mystery on the BBC in which the plucky little Belgian assembles all of the suspects for the last 20 minutes of the program and exposes not only their true relationships to one another but also every element of back-story previously omitted just to befuddle the viewers.<br /><br />In my heart of hearts, I'd really like to give this novel a full five stars. Unfortunately, it all too frequently falls into the trap of characters doing too much \\"telling\\" and not enough \\"showing.\\" The device of an ex-CIA agent believing she can reinvent her life by starting over with her family in a different country is a good one. Pavone is also adept at exploring the stresses and strains that occur within a marriage when longstanding roles are flipped, be it a husband who - by loss of a job - suddenly becomes the stay-at-home dad, or the wife who discovers that neighborhood coffee klatches and dropping the kids off for play-dates isn't nearly as fulfilling as being a gun-toting undercover operative.<br /><br />There are clearly some pulse-pounding moments when the female protagonist begins to realize that no one in her immediate circle - including her own hubby - is being entirely honest with her but there just as many more when it feels as if she is channeling her inner Kate Jackson from \\"Scarecrow and Mrs. King,\\" a lapse that diminishes her credibility as a formerly lethal government agent. In that context, the protagonist's deepest, darkest and most guilty secret regarding her last assignment is actually the least plausible. Readers unfamiliar with the strict protocols of covert operations, however, are unlikely to give this particular scenario a second thought and will simply accept the premise as a way for the heroine to come to closure.<br /><br />Flashbacks - as well as flashbacks within flashbacks - are a tricky proposition in any genre but especially one such as this with a multiplicity of moving parts. (I admire that the writer was able to keep track of who was where and doing what to whom over the course of 326 pages.) It's also helpful that specific chapters indicate in the upper right corner \\"Today\\" and the time of day. Just past the midway point of the book, I realized the \\"real time\\" unfolding was between 10:52 in the morning and 8:08 p.m. that same day and that everything else had already transpired as an extended series of flashbacks. On the one hand, this is clever. On the other hand, once you figure out the rhythm, these intercuts between past and present tend to downplay the suspense. It would be similar, for example, to showing an aged Indiana Jones sitting in a rocking chair at the beginning of a movie and saying, \\"Let me tell you about the time this ginormous boulder came bearing down on me...\\"<br /><br />Chapter 33 reveals that the action is unfolding \\"Today, 8:08 p.m.\\" Chapter 34, however, states that it is \\"Today, 5:50 p.m.\\"  It's the only place in the book that doubles back on itself; that it occurs so close to the end only adds to the frenetic unraveling. (I actually had to go back and do some rereading to make sure I wasn't missing something.) Two pages into Chapter 34, we're suddenly back into the continuation of the conversation started in Chapter 33. Better editing could easily have remedied this.<br /><br />Coupled with the intercuts was the publisher's decision to mix fonts rather than use a single font and its italicized counterpart. This, of course, would probably only annoy someone with graphic design experience but it surprises me that a traditional publisher would opt for a format I usually only see with works that are self-published.<br /><br />As a storyteller, Pavone has tremendous potential and if \\"The Expats\\" is made into a movie, it will definitely make my list of must-see flicks. The backdrop alone - Luxembourg - is well worth the price of admission, and the author skillfully incorporates his observations and recollections of having lived in that city while he was composing the book. For armchair travelers and wannabe spies who enjoy vicarious espionage adventures, \\"The Expats\\" is entertaining escapist fare.
B008602KQI|4.0|first time at prime movies. it was easy to used, now would like to see some newer movies, andT.V.. shows
1419707663|5.0|Child turned 9yrs and I bought this for him. He loved the first series [1-3 books],  I look forward to purchasing the second series.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Although the title was promissing, and the Kindle sample looked interesting, reading the book wasn´t as fulfilling as I had expected.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|A fine cast with excellent production has made a great effort to make an movie set in an isolated portion of rural Arkansas as authentic as possible.  The story line takes quite a bit from Mark Twain; the child actors are terrific.  Overall a very nice little movie that is most enjoyable.  Extensive extra features on this Blu-ray disc are a valuable addition.  Highly recommended.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This story will definitely catch your heart same as it caught mine.  The story about an unbreakable bond with a horse and an English farm boy will make you cry a lot.
0525478817|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself in for, but my son gave me the audio version of this book,and this was a way to pass time in the car.  What I got was a Y/A novel that was very much an adult novel.  Maybe teens with cancer are wiser and older than their peers because they have to be.  I found the story very compelling and the descriptions very real.  The audio version was done so well.  There are so many audio books that the narrators kill the story, not so with this one.  The story matter is sad, but there is magic and happiness too.  This is much more than just a cancer story, it lets the reader know that no matter how insignificant we are we all have a reason to live. I am so glad I got to spend time with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace.  Thank you John Green for writing this story.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book is a quick read and keeps you interested.  I like how the author gives different perspectives at the end.

B00F2HW20M|5.0|While members  of  Genesis more  or  less  ignore  or  smirk  at  their  creative  prog  roots,  Steve  Hackett  has  kept  the  bands  best  works  alive  via  his  Genesis  revisited  series,  and  most  recently- Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith. Songs  are powerful, played  with  emotion  and passion  by  a superb  band.  Sound  quality  is  quite  good. Lot's  of  special  guests  such  as: John  Wetton of  Asia/King Crimson).  For  any  classic  Genesis  fan (sorry-  not  the  Misunderstanding  crap),  this  is  must  buy. Steve  is a humble,  fan-friendly  man  who is keeping  the  band's  classic-years  legacy  alive. Please  support  him... the  rewards  will  be  a  wonderful  live  recording with  classics:  Supper's  Ready, The Musical  Box, Dancing  with  the Moonlit Knight,  etc. Over 180 min. of live  excellence!

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Some books you step into for awhile to enjoy the break from life. Some books, like this one, become a small part of the fabric of your life. You are changed by experiencing it. I entered this book upon the recommendation from a friend, not knowing what it was about. My favorite way to explore book or movie! Even though the content was at times painful, and certainly causes one to become introspective, I loved it! I don't regret that I am done reading it as the essence of the book will be in my moments of memory, of longing, of facing the past while embracing the future. I hope you take the time to experience it as well!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|When I first saw this game I was like &quot;This is one of those useless games&quot;. But it's actually a good challenging game. The object is to cut all the strings on the spiderweb to save the trapped bugs. The first levels are pretty easy but it gets more difficult as you go along. I'm so happy that I got this game during the Halloween sale, but I think it is worth the money. It helps you think logically. Get this game!

1439170916|1.0|he includes details that make you wonder why anyone would care, want to read about, or need to know to convey his message. this style of writing reminds me of someone who is obsessed with hearing themselves talk, exagerating to a degree where they are attempting to convince the reader of excitement among mundane issues, or are simply getting a larger paycheck with greater quantity of words written (very Dickens-esque). the scatter-brained addressing of a narrative is hard to follow and becomes old and boring with separation of short narratives every couple of paragraphs. even the reviews of this book are meretricious and flamboyant. the o, oprah magazine, raves that the book is \\"compulsively readable\\" which I'm not sure makes any sense as a form of expression, and leads one to question whether, like the rest of (declining) western civilization, has any capacity to recognize literary art. I'm discouraged as i see people honored with prizes for incomprehensible drudgery as the days of this postmodern existence permeate any existence of the once diverse planet. it is rather egotistic to claim that one illness, which happens to be the focus of your profession is the emperor, or most important issue, relative to the sea of other conditions. other forms of genetic disease are very similar to the programming errors incurred in the complex bionetwork of instructions for life, but because people like to hear some guy with an accent talk about himself, give him a pulitzer! and because you cant follow any of the presumed adhd-inspired \\"style\\" of unorganized writing this author possesses, actually, I'm convinced to make him president...maybe we can restructure healthcare after the extermely, exuberantly, riveting, mind-blowing, grotesque, fearful, emotionally thrilling issues discussed in this obvious masterpiece.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Like all of sandersons books, this one was amazing. Can't wait to read what he comes up with next woots!
B008P9M614|5.0|I'm so glad I went ahead and bought the whole series!  I missed a couple of episodes in the first couple of seasons and it was great seeing it all from the beginning.  It got me through the month I had to wait to get cable installed in my new apt.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A great historical novel about slavery that included white indentured servants.  The white indentured servant is something we tend to forget about.  I found myself very caught up in the story and did not want the book to end.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|even if you are not a child on the outside you can still love this movie because it brings out the child inside of everyone.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Well written. Lots of Al Qaeda history along with the middle east. The bad guy got his due! Watch out for the UAV's!!!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|once again it didn't follow the original star trek plot that closely or close at all but as a movie picture it is stunning and they do a great job with the action scenes
B00005N5RM|4.0|Thirty years after the original \\"The Blob\\" with Paul Newman we got the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (Larry Hagman also did a sequel in 1972 called \\"Beware! the Blob\\"). The plot is like the original: A mysterious Jello-like substance from outer space lands on earth and attacks the nearest town, devouring people and growing.<br /><br />The movie has the vibe of a Stephen King film -- small town, cartoony characters and a monster of some sort that threatens the town -- sort of like \\"Christine\\", \\"Silver Bullet\\", \\"The Tommyknockers\\", \\"Needful Things\\" and a gazillion others. It's also reminiscent of the 80's Friday the 13th flicks. So, if you like Stephen King and the Friday the 13th films, you'll probably like this one.<br /><br />As the delinquent teen, Kevin Dillon (in a quasi-mullet, lol) is a surprisingly effective protagonist and Shawnee Smith is too; she plays the popular cheerleader who hesitantly seeks the delinquent's assistance. If you're not familiar with Shawnee, she went on to play the ditzy brunette Linda on \\"Becker\\". Anyway, it's cool seeing her as a teenager here.<br /><br />In some ways this remake is better than the original. It's in color, it has better F/X (naturally) and a few scenes are much more explicit and horrifying than the original. Two examples jump to mind: When the girl's boyfriend, Paul, buys the farm early on it's one of the greatest horror scenes in cinematic history, no kidding. There's another semi-shocking scene where someone we don't expect to die is hideously consumed by the creature (in the sewers). Speaking of which, one of the movie's strengths is that people you wouldn't expect to die do.<br /><br />But it's less effective in that it sometimes cops a semi-parody vibe, like when the cook at the diner is yanked upside down into a sink by the creature or when Erika Eleniak (in a too-brief role) buys the farm playing some kid's hot date. I couldn't help busting out laughing at these scenes and a couple of others. Were the filmmaker's intentionally shooting for camp here? I think so.<br /><br />So it's a weird mix, switching from utter horror to amusing non-horror. The addition of a subplot that reveals the creature's origins as decidedly earth-centric takes away from the Blob's otherworldly and scary ambiance in the original. As such, it's not as effective as the original, at least as a serious horror film where less is more, but it IS just as entertaining and maybe more so.<br /><br />Interestingly, the story takes place in a California ski town (notice the snow-making vehicle), but the film was shot in Abbeville, Louisiana, which is hardly known for skiing. The long shots of the town with mountains in the background are obviously not Abbeville and are presumably of a California town.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is an entertaining 80's remake of \\"The Blob\\" that strangely bombed at the box office. It shouldn't have as it's on par with the better Stephen King and Friday the 13th flicks of that era.<br /><br />The film runs 95 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: BWere the filmmaker's intentionally shooting for camp here?

B00A81NFAS|5.0|whenever you can mix a football movie with a love story it doesn't usually pan out too well but they did an amazing job composing this movie
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thought it was very slow. Usually I'm a very fast reader when a novel holds my attention. I found myself putting this novel down and returning to it when I was not busy.  I also did not like the ending. It didn't seem to get justice.  I thought Nick was a very weak character too.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|just imagine if there were really drugs like this on the market! the world would be crazy. great movie and once again Bradley Copper was a stud.
B003XU02QG|1.0|I was looking for a historical account of a Roman centurion. This was in my opinion a horror flick with lots of blood and gore. I have seen horror movies with less bloody scenes then this. Very disappointing
0142419400|1.0|Bad condition of the edition of the product that I didn't even ask for. Thanks. I'm shipping this back as soon as I can.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|A fairly good movie to kill an evening.  It did fall short if my expectations. I didn't feel Jaden Smith had the acting 'chops' to carry this movie.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a very engrossing tv show.  I was looking for something I could really get into and enjoy the characters and this fit the bill. I am sorry I never watched the show before now but I do have four more seasons to catch up on.
B001BANK32|3.0|I was very bored. Kept waiting for something interesting to happen but it never did. I really like Stephen King but would not recommend this book.
B00G2SIW7M|2.0|When the stones went disco in the 70s the results were not so good. Reminds me a bit of that.
B001XUPD94|3.0|Not that good. Kind of sucked. Good look into non-space life in the 23rd Century, though. Interesting attempt to dive deeper into Star Trek lore.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This version does not connect right wjth my FB game and repeatedly<br />cheats me out of moves!!!<br />I won't install it again...to many glitches!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am having a problem adjusting to the size, but I feel in time, it will be good that I downloaded it to the kindle.  Thank you
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you thought &#34;The Shinning&#34; was one of King's best tales, you'll love this continuation! I am now rereading The Shinning!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book, but was disappointed in the ending.  It started dragging and I lost my excitement of finishing the book.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I ordered four of these to replace the six year old fans in my full size Thermaltake case while doing a computer upgrade.  Along with this upgrade, I decided to also get the Noctua NH-U12 CPU heatsink and an additional Noctua NF-F12 fan for the heatsink.  So six Noctua fans in total.  There are now only two that haven't been replaced.  One is a 220mm fan and the other is a hard drive cooling fan that does not even really have to be there and doesn't make any noise so I didn't replace it.  All of the Noctua are 4 pin fans to provide more flexiblity over my 3 pin fans since I can now adjust the RPM with that extra pin using PWM on my motherboard.<br /><br />The packaging is very professional and easy to open.  The accessories are well thought out and they make sure you have everything you need to hook up the fan with very little fuss.  The fan quality also appears to be top notch.  I like the rubber (or silicone) mounting hardware that replaces the screws.  I was only able to use this in one location and, although was a bit of a pain to install, seems to work extremely well.  And along with the rubber (or silicone) corner pieces on the fans, it creates a very quite setup.<br /><br />I ran the fan tuning on my motherboard and received a cooling rating of 0.4°C/Watt.  I don't know if this is great but I know it's good and I'm happy with it.  In silent mode in idle CPU conditions, all the Noctua fans will turn off except for the CPU fans which stay on at low RPMs.  When the fans are running at lower RPM's, I cannot hear them even after unplugging the big 220MM case fan.  But in turbo mode, I hear them all spin up and start pumping that air through the case keeping it nice and cool.<br /><br />The only downside is the color.  I don't like it.  But for anyone looking in my case that is knowledgeable of fans (this would be no-one), they would spot the Notua's immediately and know I went with quality.
B00B6DTWM2|5.0|I watched this on a whim and I had to leave a hallway light on when I went to bed.  Verrry spooky and chilling.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game but in the next update must have  redstone  and more blocks and mobs so make all this and I will like your game so much
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time.  The cast is amazing and the twist on The Taming of the Shrew is SO GOOD.
B000000OU0|5.0|Some of the best overlooked songs of that time. Brought back great memories. Well worth the change and highly recommended. Strong buy.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I love the Dexter series, and this season was no exception.  I can't wait to see what the last season brings.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Wonderful. I loved the movie but I mostly loved the music in the movie. Now I can just listen to the music anytime I want to.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I bought this to have in my classroom for reward days or class parties.  I think me and my classroom aides enjoyed it more than the kids.  Great for all ages:)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Swept away by a great story.....so nice to escape. Thought provoking as well. The butterfly effect, and time travel? How can you go wrong? Besides, any time to get reminded of IT, is a spooky and wonderful day!
B002GHHHKG|5.0|Let me start by saying that Nick Cage is NOT one of my favorite actors.  That being said, this is one of my all time favorite love stories.  Such a good story and awesome twist at the end.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! Great that it is now on kindle too. I play it and most of my friends play it. Lots of fun
B000FZETIO|5.0|One of the best romance stories.  These classic 80's movies are so good, this one is a must have to your collection.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|In am so happy it's here. It doesn't seem to have any glitches so far. It's clear and fun to play.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|I still remember seeing this movie when it came out in theatres.  Such a great story, amazing animation; its a timeless Disney classic:)
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I've read some people try to characterize this as a &#34;dance&#34; record, but that seems quite short-sighted. In reality, it's got all the hallmarks of Arcade Fire's signature sound (i.e. they swing for the fences in nearly every track) but this time the focus is on the rhythm section more than ever before. There's nods to disco, synth-pop, dub, and calypso in the rhythms used throughout the album which serve as a masterful backdrop to the driving expansive guitars and vocal harmonies fans have come to expect.<br /><br />The most conspicuous difference (to me at least) vs. their prior work is the absence of Regine as a lead vocalist on any of the tracks. It seems her role is more to amplify Win's emotive lyrics, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since I think his voice shines more than ever before despite it's limited range. Perhaps the credit goes to James Murphy for layering the effects, beats, and all the other bells and whistles with the vocals to achieve a mish-mash of genres that is more than the sum of its parts. In essence, this is an AF record made in the image of Talking Head's &#34;Fear of Music&#34;, but with the ambition turned up to 11.<br /><br />Standout tracks include: &#34;Reflektor&#34;; &#34;We Exist&#34;; &#34;Normal Person&#34;; and &#34;Afterlife&#34;

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting and so happy now. Love the graphics. Enjoying playing on the go. Wondered if it would be available on kindle.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|everything was great about it...from shipping to the movie itself...u wont be wasting your money!Tom cruise and morgan freeman are really great actors
0385350864|5.0|I almost didn't get this after looking at all of the dismal reviews and am so glad that I thought better of it.  I absolutely loved the first two books and to me, this one didn't disappoint at all.  Seems to me a lot of people that didn't like it didn't enjoy how Bridget's character hadn't evolved enough, matured enough, and was still floundering a bit.<br />To me, that was the whole point - she was thrust back into this dating world that she had trouble getting through the first time around, and is now having to do it older, with children, and a whole new set of rules.  If she had done effortlessly with poise and grace, it wouldn't have been Bridget Jones.<br />I won't go through the whole plot as that's clearly been done - all I will say is that I laughed out loud and truly enjoyed the entire book and would highly recommend to any fan of Bridget Jones.
B008V2THJE|3.0|Slow moving but interesting story on how all the characters eventually converge.  Nice scenes of Paris.  Good acting in various roles.
B00B4804KS|5.0|It's already a great movie, but seeing it in 3D is an amazing experience. Some things really do pop, like the foliage and some key action scenes, but the real power of 3D is the depth.<br /><br />The video fills the screen, no black bars top and bottom, and the depth immerses you into the movie.<br /><br />Some excellent examples are when their climbing down the tree while the vehicle crashes towards them and the climbing over the fence scene which looks like you're actually there looking up at a tall fence and into the seemingly endless sky. Words probably can't do it justice and I'm also doubly impressed because the visual hold up very well for a 20 year old film.<br /><br />Sterio D does pretty much all the 3D work in Hollywood with varied results but the really went all out on post converting this movie. So much so that there is even an extra feature on the 3D disc that shows their process. They basically rotoscope everything frame by frame and give it a depth map.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging. You just want to keep playing.  Great game  for all ages makes you think. You have to try it.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Great re-imagining of a classic. It was great to see a unique spin that wasn't just an updated ripoff with cgi. Great practical effects enhanced with some digital. A surprising twist to the original story. The cringe-worthy over the top violence was beautiful.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|can't wait to finish, a mature high school musical type of show, with a good cast, and an awesome &#34;villainous&#34; character
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I haven't watched this movie since it came out in theaters, I waited quite a while to get it waiting for the price to go down. I have to say it is a really entertaining movie. The only major detractor is Shia Lebouf. Seeing this in 3D was very awesome. The regular dialogue scenes have okay depth because they are post converted but the CGI is where the 3D really pops. I especially the battle with Shockwave and his giant snake creature taking down the building. Really impressed me seeing again it after a couple years.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I got tired of reading about all their sex.  I got it after the second book.  So I couldn't even finish this book becuz of it.
B004EPYZTE|3.0|I like the Conan based more on the books than the Arnold version but unfortunately Jason Mamoa doesn't have the charisma the Arnold infused into role, perhaps it was too much dialogue for Conan who should mostly grunt and kill people. Although there is quite a bit of bloody violence, most of it is digital blood sprays but the effect is still pretty cool.<br /><br />They took visual and story references from the books and comics however the actual movie's story is pretty straight-forward and hackneyed.<br /><br />The 3D adds some depth but most things are like cardboard cutouts, nothing really pops out except the begining title and the fire ember particles floating during the credits.<br /><br />So overall it is an entertaining movie if you like bloody action, boobs and not much story. You can probably pass on the 3D version.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Something that every adolescent should read either with parents or teachers.  It's a beautiful book that will touch anyone who picks it up!
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|In my opinion you can add several things to make the game more attractive such as give a big perspective of the altitude concerning te face of the earth among other things.<br />Regards<br />Diego
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Ordered for a Halloween costume. Son dressed like Dr. Who. It was perfect.  Put my son in character.  Provided light as well
B00ESB6GBY|3.0|Not as funny as the other seasons. Still funny and follows the theme but perhaps it's one too many seasons. I understand that it's difficult to write the shows. They did an excellent job overall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. play all the time. didn't think it would be fun but I  was wrong It's Ton of fun!!
0425263924|4.0|It wasn't as intense as I would've like it.  I wanted more info about who done it & who protected him.  It was good but they could've done more I thought

B004LROUW2|4.0|Very nice, but very long. It really is hard to get into but still Murakami is an amazing writer.<br /><br />Like. Kafka on the shore in more sophisticated
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Ever since this updated it does NOT work at all!!! I have installed multiple times, it will not work.  I decided to uninstall and find a new weather app.  I loved the old version , too bad this version doesn't work!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am so addicted to this game. such a simple game but very addicting. I have been waiting to get it o n kindle.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app isn't all that great.  There seem to be a few minor bugs, pictures don't load (on my NEW BB Bold).  I do not favour a 5-star rating system. I'd give this app a 5/10.
0670024856|5.0|The complexity of character development wouldn't let me put the book down! The botanical information woven throughout the book is masterfully written. When Alma turned to mosses, it brought back memories of being on my belly exploring the fascinating world of mosses through my camera lens.
B00G118LYY|3.0|I can't drive how I want to. It's really making me mad. All I want to do is drive and have fun but I can't control it. There are no instructions on how to drive. Please help me!
006202406X|4.0|i have to agree with most of the readers here that i was hoping the ending would be different but i cannot deny this is still a great book just because the ending is not what most people expected or hoped for.  the author did a great job on this book and the entire series, told a great story all the way to the very end. this book deserves at least a 4 star if not more, the only thing i can pick on is maybe the POV from Tobias can be better, he sounded a little too much like Tris. other than that, there is nothing i don't like about the book.  i am glad she introduced Tobias' POV into this last book, I totally enjoyed this book and of course the entire series!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I would recommend this type of music to anyone who loves softness has such a mellowing sensation to it and a relaxing feeling you can close your eyes and drift away

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and addictive!  but once you get to level 30 it gets almost impossible .. I've been stumped for a while
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|the story line was ok but the author rambles on and on and on.............get to the point!  land the plane!!!  not the best book I've ever read, but not the worse.  like the 3 stars say, 'it's okay'!
0143119680|4.0|This is a great book.  I only give it 4 stars and not 5 because, in my opinion, it does start off slowly.  But once in the depths of the book, you will get lost.  I had trouble putting it down.  That said, I did not buy it as I took it out of the library but for anyone wishing to give a gift to a book lover, this is great!! I gave the 2nd installment 5 stars!!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This a great game. I love puzzle games and I have had hours of enjoyment playing it. I would recommend it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good show! It's hard to find shows with good characters and interesting story lines these days. The Good Wife is one of those shows.
B00AYE8C70|5.0|This is the best app ever. I was able to talk to my boyfriend while he was overseas with no problems. I would recommend this product.

B00EJXX17S|5.0|I'd never heard of Lindsey Stirling nor any of her songs until one randomly came up through Pandora.  The uniqueness of her music intrigued me, and so I went on to listen to a few more on YouTube, and was equally impressed by the choreography of her music videos.  It was odd, hearing and seeing the violin played with such energy and passion when most play (admit it) boring classical pieces sitting on their bottoms.  Toss in the very modern background electronic support, and you have an acoustical experience the likes of which you've never heard.  I'm very much looking forward to a second album, just to see what she can conjure up next.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|There are certain classics which are adorable at any time.<br />Years may roll on but the ears will be ready to listen.<br />Victor Hugo is really a victorious man, author of all times.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary comes in handy from time to time while writing technical information. Like it very much. I highly recommend this popular product.
0545626382|5.0|Love these books, I've already read them once before and am a huge fan of the series. I wanted to get a copy that I could have to share with my friends who haven't read the books yet. The books came in excellent condition! Fresh clean pages and nice binding. Couldn't be more pleased.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I just like playing Mahjong Games so I just keep buying them.  There is a lot of games to play so I didn't get bored with it.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|An all around great movie featuring a well developed character in Bane. Bruce Wayne comes out of retirement to take him down.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Very cute animation. A fun game that is surprisingly addicting.  It was increasingly more difficult, yet never frustrating as you can use coins won in game to buy solutions
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I absolutely loved this purchase! I pre-ordered it, so I got a really great deal! I've watched it several times and have loved it! I definitely recommend it! Also it shipped so quickly. I am absolutely pleased with this purchase!
1582701709|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book! A lot of the things they write about, I'm looking at it and saying &#34;Yeah, I do that!&#34; I can see where when my life was doing really REALLY well, that I was doing a lot of what they were talking about. And I'm trying to get back into that mind-set.
B00BH0VSM6|1.0|I'm PO'd at myself for reading the whole thing. An utter waste of time. The author never explains how his America hero is qualified, by reason of education and/or experience, to be a &#34;consultant&#34; hired by New Scotland Yard. He ineptly stumbles into ludicrous situations. He doesn't find the culprits so much as they find him. In one notable scene, the villain stabs him and he nearly bleeds to death, but 2 hours later he slips out of the hospital to confront the killer singlehandedly. If you like this genre then I suggest Lee Child, Michael Connelly, John Sandford or any of a dozen other authors. This story is soooo bogus.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Love this movie! I will watch it by myself with no children around even! Instant classic when it was originally released in theaters, and now I can watch it whenever I want! Sometimes, I'll let the grandkids join me....
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another great Grisham story.  This was one of my favorites with some unexpected twists and turns.  It is pretty well developed and ends in an unexpected way.

B003B02O14|5.0|I have enjoyed John Grisham over the years and have read a few of his older books recently and they are as enjoyable as his first works.  This one was a pretty great story with a great ending.  Enjoyable, easy read.

B003B02O7I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  the twists and turns were really interesting and the ending was great.  Not as predictable as some of his works.
B001993Y3G|5.0|Always loved this movie. Hated the fact that on the DVD version, you had to flip over the DVD to watch part 2. C'mon, the movie wasn't THAT long! Never understood why they had to do that, but whatever. I'm so glad that I can watch it straight through now!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Atwood's dystopian view of the future gets closer day by day. This is the only type of &#34;horror&#34; book I care to read.<br /><br />I was a little (pleasantly) surprise by some well placed comments about gun rights.

B005EGXNLS|5.0|Cornwell is the best historical fiction writer out there today.  I have read several of his books and this one is right up there with others.  I still think his Arthurian legend stuff is the best I've read in the genre.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Reading a Man Booker prize winner is not like reading just any old novel.<br /><br />  An unfamiliar weightiness defines a book where a sentence can run for half a page, insisting the reader takes a leisurely pause to consider, reflect, chat with the author, and occasionally sigh. We are out of the habit of this kind of prose. This is how the great writers of past centuries wrote. Surely authors are not supposed to do this now? Thus an element of awe offsets the balance to nit-pick--why did the editor allow such rambles and so many random colons and semicolons to pass?<br />  The Luminaries is set in 1865-66 in Hokitika, a gold-rush town on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island. The inhabitants are mainly men, following occupations suited to the place and time: among others, an hotelier, chemist, shipping merchant, clerk, gaoler, politician, newspaperman, ex-convict and the miners hoping to strike gold. Two Chinese and a mysterious Maori are also central characters. Women are scarce, and overblown; Anna is an opium-addicted prostitute, and Lydia a conniving user of naïve members of her own sex. Even the meek gaoler's wife is capable of crime.<br />  Human behaviour leaves a lot to be desired. There are no heroes here. Theft, embezzlement, murder, revenge, greed, ruthless self-interest, addiction, blackmail and pride barely prise open the lid of bad behaviour. This bird's eye view of the community unravels objectively so that the traumas and defeats we read about seem interesting rather than tragic. This detached view is reinforced by the inclusion of astrological charting, a dozen properly-erected horoscopes reflecting the aspects of the planets at given points in the story. This `as above, so below' correspondence suggests humans are puny creatures, moved  by fate as the planets orbit.<br />  As the story quickens towards its end, chapters grow ever-shorter. All sense of a marathon read has disappeared. The reader sprints regretfully across the finish line, having enjoyed a re-creation of a real place and time in history. I give The Luminaries four stars for its achievements. The fifth star is just for Eleanor Catton; firstly for daring to write in such an unfashionable style; secondly for securing a perceptive publisher for her audacity; and thirdly, for scooping a major literary prize and securing her place as a remarkable story-teller and chronicler of human complexity.having enjoyed a re-creation of a real place and time in history.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The book is perhaps overly simplistic in the Ayn Rand style, but it makes its point effectively. Eggers also manages to build enormous suspense; this is one of those books I was tempted to read into the wee hours of the night until I finished it. It left me with a pang that felt like heartbreak. I'm sure I'll be thinking about it often in the weeks to come.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It took so long to get it for kindle, but it is so worth the wait!!  Thank you!<br />One of the best games ever!
B000RLH2VM|5.0|Simply outstanding movie.<br /><br />The directing, pacing, storyline, acting and cinematography are superb. Scenes have room to breath and develop because Frankenheimer lets his actors infuse character. Unlike a Michael Bay film or countless other Directors, Frankenheimer understands the nuance of body language between an actor and the camera and he doesn't rely on wise cracks, cuts, whip pans and gimmicks to create tension, excitement or levity. There is palpable tension from the opening frame through the end, all cleverly woven together with a brilliant score.<br /><br />This is cinematic gem and a study in great cinema.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wonderful book. One of his best. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys Stephen King!  It ranks with his best books!
B0043D2LAC|5.0|This is a great bag for items you need access to but don't want it in your face every time you get in you bag.  In other words it keeps items handy but out of site.  I only wish they made on bigger.  Like a few inches on each side.  I currently have my Light meter, SpeedLight and some cables.<br /><br />Recommend for any photographer that has to be on the move.
B007Z9QTVI|4.0|I ordered this movie because I had heard so much about it and I thought it was finally time to try it. Well it didn't disappoint. The plot acting by Brown and connery is amazing. However, I'm a little dissapointed by how their relation was shown. It seems very static and then jumps around a lot. We don't really see the evolution of it as much as we would like to. Another, and probably the only other negative thing about this movie is the soundtrack. I didn't find it appropriate and it didn't really set the tone.<br />If you can get over these two minor points, you will absolutely love this movie. I particularly like how the movie's plot mirrors a quintessential novel. In summary, if you want to see a great movie, Finding Forrester is a delightful feature to watch with friends and family.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game.....great app, can't ever get enough of manning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Great game for kids, mine keep trying to beat each others high scores

0446310786|3.0|Looking through all these 5-star reviews makes me almost afraid to write a not so great review.  I will though because I can't say that it was the best book I ever read. It must have received a Pulitzer Prize because it was written during the civil rights era and discussed a timely topic that needed discussing. I found it hard to stay interested many times throughout the book and sped-read through quite a bit of the chit chat about the kids.  I felt like it took a l-o-n-g time to develop the characters (almost half-way through the book)and had episodes about characters that didn't really matter nor make any difference to the story.  The rest of the book was about the kids and their escapades and their near-perfect, but boring father.  The trial and ending were interesting but all the stuff leading up to it and after it almost became boring. Lastly, I wish that it had been available on the Kindle because I am now finding it hard to turn the pages of a book...(LOL).  Read it if you feel you missed out in high school and must back-track and read all the classics you didn't get a chance to read.  Otherwise....
B0019IB0II|5.0|Very helpful to people or their families who are going through the same type of situation. Good ways to help stroke victims.

B002JVWR0Y|5.0|I Love to Order DVD's from Amazon, they always come in perfect condition, and are just what I ordered.  Dexter 4th Season continues the saga of the friendly blood spatter analyst for the Miami PD, who has a hobby that borders on the balance between justified killing, and murder.  That's what makes the premise of this show interesting.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|arrived on time and well packaged. i had already owned this item previously and was pleased to have it back in my music library.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Too much intrigue and all the action packed in the last pages but still a nice story and fun to read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game was pretty much made for tablets. I've played this on my smart phone but the phone overheats every time I play.  Once I got a Kindle and ported the game to it; like a match made in heaven. No lags or overheating; graphics are crisp and clear and the game responds well. I love it more than ever. Only downside (if you consider it as such) is that it is WAY TOO addicting! Keep it up.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have no idea whether to even begin with this review. I want to write a lot but I will never have enough time to write what all I think went wrong with this book. I'm finding it hard to think of any other series ending I have been so disappointed in.<br /><br />This final book felt rushed. It actually seemed like someone who didn't know the characters wrote this book. The duel POVs did not work. I think by giving us Tobias's perspective, she actually took away his voice. This Tobias didn't seem anything like the one in the previous books.<br /><br />The whole underlying meaning of the series of being Divergent (I mean, come on, it's the title of your first book Roth), just vanishes. It's kinda like oh, being divergent is genetic so you aren't anything special and what you have done isn't special.<br /><br />I usually never agree with killing off a main character but I don't mind when it adds something and provides meaning. This death was just wrong in so many ways. First off, it was too rushed and almost like an after thought. I feel like it was added for shock value but honestly wasn't shocking at all. It was just annoying. This book made me dislike Tris at times before her death but I really disliked her after. She took away Caleb's redemption. It made sense for him to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Having her take that away from him just proved that Tris had not grown as a character. She did choose to sacrifice herself regardless if what she told Caleb to tell Tobias. If Tobias was really \\"her family now\\" and \\"she wanted to choose to live,\\" then she would have let Caleb do it. Oh, but Tris is always right. Sorry for the rant but I just am really annoyed by her now.<br /><br />Overall, I think the author had a great idea and wrote 2 great books. Allegiant just felt like it didn't have enough thought into the writing or the plot decisions. This is the first time that I wish I hadn't read a series at all. I think she should have waited to release this book until after the first movie came out because now I'm not sure if I even want to watch the movies.until after the first movie came out because now I'm not sure if I even want to watch the movies.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is amazing; I've never read the books, but the film made a fan out of me! It's interesting, gut-wrenching, and beautifully epic. Great performances, great visuals, and great directing!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game you can breed dragons feed them to make them lager and if you already have it for kindle than go on Amazon and look up Dragonstory New Dawn and it will show an update for Dragonstory. Also ad me Minecraftisawso
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who read the Shining or a Stephen King fan. I have to say this book was on of the best sequels to a book ever. Just as great as the first!
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|When I was first introduced to Arcade Fire, in the winter of '05 (say \\"aught five\\"), I got the impression that they intentionally embodied the old timey charm SNZ once had, albeit with a far less stringent sense of anachronisms in the orchestra (some very 1980's drumming/key work, the latent dub influence that finally found its way to the forefront on Reflektor) and maybe less reefer madness, but with all the same whimsy and cacophony. So, a few albums into a well~documented and oft~celebrated career, Reflektor breaks off from the apparent \\"accepted\\" Arcade Fire sound, no longer resembling any band on the Merge label, past or present, settling rather awkwardly/confidently into their own musical language. I can't speak to every song featured here (some of them bore me to tears, even after repeated listenings), but the fun factor of the first disc is an  immeasurably silly and uplifting success. Approach the second disc with more care, perhaps a set of headphones to better immerse yourself.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This was a good read.  It has gotten me into reading the entire series.  Kept my interest and that isnt always easy.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had Netflix previously and it would not stream right, the audio didn't keep up with the video. The only problem I had with this was every once in a while the video would stop and then start again but that I can deal with.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great as always.  Just cant wait for the next book to come out.  I love the books even more than the series.  That is usually the case though as the books hold so much more detail.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Animation (technical aspects) outstanding, excellent cast, great voiceovers. Wasn't as funny as I would have expected, feels like the movie was made to sell merchandise more than to tell a story.
6304712499|3.0|It was alright. It didn't suck by any means, but it could have been better. I know its his origin story and everything, but it felt like it kinda dragged in some places.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A surprise a minute. And (mostly) believable. Good combination of a thriller that makes you think, clever plot twists, fantastic casting, fun effects. Hope this group (cast & director & crew) can get together for another &#34;adventure&#34;.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|the story malala tells  should become required reading in all schools.  it not only teaches the history of her country and area but shows the reality of life for those living in areas of political and ideological conflicts.  she and her family are an inspiration to us all, to do what in our hearts and minds we know to be correct, even when the odds are against us.....their courage to stand by their ideals are a great lesson for all people.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I lost two dogs this week to heartworms, and didn't think I could cry anymore.  Then I stumbled across Hachi as I was surfing my satellite tv menu.  I started to pass it up as I knew it was about a dog and I wasn't in the mood to watch a dog story, but I went back because I had heard the story of Hachi.  Needless to say, I cried the entire movie - but I couldn't stop watching it.  I know from experience how devoted dogs are to their human friends - and to see such a poignant and moving story after having lost two of my own dogs, well, I guess it was therapy - though I was emotionally drained.  I have ordered the movie and will watch it again (and sob again) but it is a wonderfully done movie and I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone who has experienced and appreciates the unique bond between dogs and their human companions.  I'm tearing up now thinking about it.....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hard to put it down! Keeps you trying over and over to the point where you get frustrated and almost giving up. Then all of a sudden you complete a level and your hooked all over again...
6305428042|4.0|Great Halloween movie for kids and kids at heart (a.k.a., grandparents).  Recommended by my young adult niece, who watches it every Halloween, so I bought a copy for me.  Great fun, and Bette Midler (one of my favorite stars) steals the show.  It's my new annual Halloween treat.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded this, so that I did not have to take my laptop along on the travels and work travels. I find it very practical. It works well, in fact I prefer the Kindle for Android and thus reading on my mobile phone to reading on my laptop even when the laptop is availalble.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Deborah Harkness's novel, \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" takes advantage of a popular theme--witchcraft and magic--and completely destroys the mystique behind it by creating dull characters and insipid plot lines.<br /><br />Harkness's heroine, Diana, although a young hottie, dresses like an overweight matron who can no longer fit into structured slacks with a zippered closure and must rely upon black stretch pants or black leggings because they are more \\"comfortable.\\" In addition to this, Harkness thinks nothing of wasting her readers' time as the slouchy Diana displays characteristics of acute yogaholism, substance abuse in the form of green tea, wrinkled prune syndrome from all her baths and couch potato-itis. Big red flag!  Is Harkness trying too hard to create a \\"cool,\\" exercising, spa-loving twenty-first century woman who is comfortable in \\"her own skin\\" and is not the usual club-hopping/bed swapping queen of tawdry drama--think the over-sexed character Freya in [[ASIN:1401310915 Witches of East End (The Beauchamp Family Book)]]? &lt;Super UGH!><br /><br />Enter Matthew, a centuries old vampire...  Of course!  Does this sound more than a little familiar?  Now Bella of [[ASIN:0316038385 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] was too clumsy to even attempt the downward-facing dog asana but she did get straight A's, have a penchant for good literature and at the end of her saga she did display some mighty awesome talents as a protective vampire.  Matthew is a bit older than Edward having a French pedigree which sniffs of over bred poodle, a centuries-old chateau and an overbearing snoot of a mother that makes the Cullen clan look like the Cleavers from a niceness front.  Harkness injects Edward's protectiveness in steroid mega-dosage into Matthew's persona--he is so indulgent and downright bossy, he would make an invalid out of any woman in about two seconds.  How is it that the independent scholarly Diana takes to this so well?  Simple.  She's in love. &lt;Groan> &lt;Double Groan><br /><br />The premise is simple: Diana is a powerful witch--(maybe even a Supreme like Jessica Lange in [[ASIN:B00FQY4C86 American Horror Story: Season 3 - Coven]])&lt;Giggle> but she doesn't really know it.  Through a series of discoveries that are initiated by her finding an old manuscript in a library in Oxford, Diana must embrace her heritage or allow a Civil War between supernatural species to occur.  Life-threatening situations abound, but Diana always finds time to have another cup of tea, take a long bath, wax eternally romantic about Matthew or change into another pair of baggy-knee-ed stretch pants. &lt;Gag><br /><br />Bottom line?

B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This version of Peter Pan approaches perfection due to the excellence of the casting, the beauty of the setting, and the genius of the acting. As in the stage play, Jason Isaacs plays both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook, giving a nuanced performance that hints of the manic in Captain Hook as Mr. Darling, and of the humanity in Mr. Darling as Captain Hook. Jeremy Sumpter is brilliant as Peter, capturing the ferocity of a clung-to childhood and the yearning of an unreachable adulthood. Rachel Hurd-Wood is luminous as Wendy, embodying her approaching adolescence with a sweet maturity beyond her years. The rest of the supporting cast is equally terrific, from the Lost Boys to Tinkerbell to the pirates to Olivia Williams as the mother who never loses hope.<br /><br />This isn't your Disney Peter Pan. There are a lot of darker, scarier elements (the mermaids come to mind) and I wouldn't show it to a toddler. But older children and adults alike will be captivated by this very engaging fantasy. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book. Vey different. Never read a book that was narrated by Death before. What a completely unique voice. I don't usually read books that make me cry but this was fantastic.

0345803450|1.0|If this book was not written by a well-known author, it would not have survived.  Readers probably believed, because the author was Ian McEwan, this would eventually be a rewarding read.  I was bored with the story and did not care what happened to the characters.  Yes, it has a satisfying culmination, but I don't want to wait until the last few pages of the book for the interesting part to begin.  The entire story must be interesting, not just the shocker at the end.  I would not have finished reading this if it weren't a book club book.  There was no character that I cared about or wanted to see succeed.  It was set in the 1970's, but there was very little evidence of that in the story.  The main character was unbelievably gullible.  A very disappointing story.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|I think this author could put together a decent story if they had a good editor, maybe.  But this book is honestly a train wreck of the worst kind.  The plot is about as shallow and cliched as you can find; in fact, at times I felt I was reading The Big Book of Fantasy Cliches, complete with a magic sword, Merlin figure, and Chosen One, rather than a serious novel.<br /><br />The main character is the worst kind of \\"Mary Sue.\\"  Everything is handed to him on a platter and for no real reason--he's a fairly normal individual with very mundane redeeming qualities.  He's not especially noble or wonderful.  He's just not a jerk (which is a quality he shares with every character not set up to be a villain).  He sneaks into the castle to force his way into the Legion and instead of being punished, he's rewarded by two princes (who instantly befriend him) and the Best Knight in the Land (tm).  When others rightfully point out he should be punished, they're threatened with punishment instead.  By the end of his first day, the king loves him, two princes think he's the best thing since pockets, the head knight of the land supports him, his only rival for the position he was seeking is out of the picture due to injury, and the princess (soon to be queen) is smitten with him despite having shared a total of about ten words with him.<br /><br />People are constantly defending him and helping him for absolutely no reason and he really doesn't have to do anything on his own.  All his actions are justified while anyone who dislikes him is painted as a jerk or villain who is just out to get the good guy (and they all get their just desserts for daring not like Thor).  When he should be punished, he's not and when he does nothing wrong, he's blamed and punished based on the most idiotic logic.  It's ridiculous and unrealistic and, frankly, boring.<br /><br />There's no suspense because you know he's going to overcome every obstacle with minimum effort and probably end up married to the princess, ruling over the land with justice, kindness, courage, blah blah blah. And since none of the other characters receive any development at all, there's no reason to care about any of them or care about the story in general.  The story starts out mediocre but quickly devolves into the most nonsensical plot devices possible--all meant to show what an epic hero Thor is to the point the plot suffers horribly from the constant attempts to show off Thor's awesomeness (though he really isn't that great).<br /><br />That said, the narrative itself wasn't horrible.  It was overwritten in places, going a bit purple here and there, but it lacked some of the major issues I frequently find in e-books.  The pacing was decent enough, and the dialogue mostly natural (there were a few awkward bits here and there), and the book flowed well without that horrible feeling that you're reading a list of events rather than being told a story.  The world had some development with unique creatures and such, rather than being entirely lifeless and bland.  But that is the extent of the redeeming qualities.<br /><br />I think the author has potential as a writer.  But this book has no potential as a good story--too cliched and two dimensional.  I really do not recommend it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|love to playthhis game<br />still learning different steps<br />keeps me on my toes<br />excellent  brain game<br />not as easy as it looks
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is really great since the electric goes off where I live as lot. Easy to read and see in the dark. Love this app
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Just an amusing version of the &#34;birds&#34;' well worth the tiny investment  by any stretch of the imagination! Try it and see.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Ms. McKenna is an artful storyteller!  Jamie's time in the orphanage was absolutely heartbreaking.  To read that his experiences were excerpts from true stories made me angry as well as sad.  Lydia' s life was devoid of joy too but at least she was loved as well as her parents knew to love. I'm so glad they found each other. The ending was a surprise but it was fitting considering all that they had been through.
0920236162|5.0|This one of my all-time favourite children's books.  The story starts out as any fairy tale with a girl, a prince and a dragon.  However, there are some cute twists and a good feminist bent.  Boys will still enjoy this story :) Overall, I am a big fan of Robert Munsch's stories.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the first time I have read this author. I thought it was awesome! It is a must read. So many twists, ups and downs.
B00992CF6W|1.0|the reason people are rating five if because they are thinking of Pc minecraft. this app sucks is never updated and is way overpriced. 7 dollars for basically beta minecraft. if u ask me that's bull.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Works like a charm, no problems given at all, except i had to change the voltage, but other than that it is great.
B001ANYDAO|1.0|The Outliers is a wonderful demonstration of the complex events that occur for a person to get ahead in this world. Whether it is a birthdate, family legacy, the decade that a person is born in, or the coincidences of war, the unexpected need for 10,000 hours of effort to excel, our lives almost seem to be predetermined to become a star in their field of endeavor. A great read, and I highly recommend everyone select this book to analyze what opportunities lay before them and their children. The discussion on our educational system is a must. Read it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it is challenging. it is my favourite game .. ... ... i love this game so much.  my family also love this game
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Cleaver graphics, fun humor, interesting twists, good logic puzzles.<br />I enjoyed the play even when repeat efforts were needed. Get the game and get the girl.
B00F875N98|5.0|I saw KOL for the for first time when they opened some shows for U2. They were deer's in head lights but brought the house down.  Fast forward to Napa Bottle Rock and they have matured to a premier rock act.  This new release mixes new threads with classic KOL sound.  A must add to any KOL collection.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|An enjoyable and enlightening account of sniper and Seal workings but a little too much personal info for me l
B000002LAC|5.0|Good listening, wonderful songs, beautiful voices.  If you are a fan of any of these singers buy this cd, you'll love it.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Really great movie. Enjoyed every bit of it. Really shows the heart of a woman and how powerful women can be. Very passionate movie. Would recommend...
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I  have to say this is the BEST book series I ever read. This book was worth writing my first and only review on. Allegiance, as well as the first 2 books are inspiring, emotional and pieces of art. I was heartbroken and happy at the same time. I was a rollercoaster of emotions.This book is full of plot twists and unexpected events . While I am SUPER excited for the movie Divergent to come out, the movie will have, in my opinion, a hard time living up to this sensational series
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King didn't disappoint...It's been years since I read The Shining but Doctor Sleep was so well written that I immediately fell back in with the characters and really enjoyed the plot.  Great read!
B009AMAGQM|4.0|As much as I enjoyed the book, for once I actually liked the film version better. Ethan is impossible not to like. funny. Sad, scary.... It has it all!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Would really rate this a 5 if moving forward in the levels didn't require spending money to enhance play and speed through the levels.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put down this book! Ms. Moriarty weaves the lives of her characters in a way that is continuously intriguing, without confusing the reader. The Husband's Secret leaves you questioning the choices you have made in your life. Real lives, real pain, real joy!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Im addicted to the story. When i put down one book i start the next, always thinking whats going to happen now.
B00000IREA|4.0|I remembered this movie from several years ago, and I had a desire to see it again.  It was just as absurd with the acting and the &#34;special effects&#34; as I had remembered it.  Not everyone will appreciate this movie, and I will agree it should only be watched once in a long while; still, it is a classic to me for good versus evil.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book gave a lot of insight into the computer industry growth during the past 30 years.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in technology.
006202406X|3.0|Some chapters I left unchanged, those who have read the book will know the parts that I altered.<br />But again, I did copy, word for word, some of the chapters from the book just to keep the story the same. All I changed was the ending and some minor details.<br />I added about 8 chapters of my own writing.<br /><br /> CHAPTER FORTY-NINE -TRIS<br />The death serum smells like smoke and spice, and my lungs reject it with the first breath I take. I cough and splutter, and I am swallowed by darkness.<br /> I crumple to my knees. My body feels like someone has replaced my blood with molasses, and my bones with lead. And invisible thread tugs me toward sleep, but I want to be awake. It is important that I want to be awake. I imagine that wanting, that desire, burning in my chest like a flame.<br /> The thread tugs harder, and I stoke the flame with names. Tobias. Caleb. Christina. Matthew. Cara. Zeke. Uriah.<br /> But I can't bear up under the serum's weight. My body falls to the side, and my wounded arm presses to the cold ground. I am drifting...<br /> It would be nice to float away, a voice in my head says. To see where I will go...<br /> But the fire, the fire.<br /> The desire to live.<br /> I am not done yet, I am not.<br /> I feel like I am digging through my own mind. It is difficult to remember why I came here and why I care about unburdening myself from this beautiful weight. But then my scratching hands find it. The memory of my mother's face, and the strange angles of her limbs on the pavement, and the blood seeping from my father's body.<br /> But they are dead, the voice says. You could join them.<br /> They died for me, I answer. And now I have something to do, in return. I have to stop other people from losing everything, I have to save the city and the people my mother and father loved.<br /> If I got to join my parents, I want to carry with me a good reason, not this -- this senseless collapsing at the threshold.<br /> The fire, the fire. It rages within, a campfire and then an inferno, and my body is its fuel. I feel it racing through me, eating away at the weight. There is nothing that can kill me know; I am powerful and invincible and eternal.<br /> I feel the serum clinging to my skin like oil, but the darkness recedes. I slap a heavy hand over the floor and push myself up.<br /> Bent at the waist, I shove my shoulder into the double doors, and the squeak across the floor as their seal breaks. I breathe clean air and stand up straighter. I am there, I am there.<br /> But I am not alone.<br /> \\"Don't move,\\" David says, raising his gun. \\"Hello, Tris.\\"<br /><br />CHAPTER FIFTY -TRIS<br />\\"How did you inoculate yourself against the death serum?\\" he asks me. He's still sitting in his wheelchair, but you don't need to be able to walk to fire a gun.<br /> I blink at him, still dazed.<br /> \\"I didn't,\\" I say.<br /> \\"Don't be stupid,\\" David says. \\"You can't survive the death serum without an inoculation, and I'm the only person in the compound who possesses that substance.\\"<br /> I just stare at him, not sure what to say. I didn't inoculate myself. The fact that I'm still standing upright is impossible. There's nothing more to add.<br /> \\"I suppose it no longer matters,\\" he says. \\"We're here now.\\"<br /> \\"What are you doing here?\\" I mumble. My lips feel awkwardly large, hard to talk around. I still feel that oily heaviness on my skin, like death is clinging to me even though I have defeated it.<br /> I am dimly aware that I left my own gun in the hallway behind me, sure I wouldn't need it if I made it this far.<br /> \\"I knew something was going on,\\" David says. \\"You've been running around with genetically damaged people all week, Tris, did you think I wouldn't notice?\\" He shakes his head. \\"And then your friend Cara tried to manipulate the lights, but she very wisely knocked herself out before she could tell us anything. So I came here, just in case. I'm sad to say I'm not surprised to see you.\\"<br /> \\"You came here alone?\\" I say. \\"Not very smart are you?\\"<br /> His bright eyes squint a little. \\"Well, you see, I have death serum resistance and a weapon, and you have no way to fight me. There's no way you can steal four virus devices while I have you at gunpoint. I'm afraid you've come all this way for no reason, and it will be at the expense of your life. The death serum may not have killed you, but I am going to. I'm sure you understand -- officially we don't allow capital punishment, but I can't have you surviving this.\\"<br /> He thinks I'm here to steal the weapons that will reset the experiments, not deploy one of them. Of course he does.<br /> I try to guard my expression, though I'm sure it's still slack. I sweep my eyes across the room, searching for the device that will release the memory serum virus. I was there when Matthew described it to Caleb in painstaking detail earlier: a black box with a silver keypad, marked with a strip of blue tape with a model number written on it. It is one of the only items on the counter along the left wall, just a few feet away from me. But I can't move, or else he'll kill me.<br /> I'll have to wait for the right moment,  and do it fast.<br /> \\"I know what you did,\\" I say. I start to back up, hoping that the accusation will distract him. \\"I know you designed the attack simulation. I know you're responsible for my parents' deaths -- for my mother's death. I know.\\"<br /> \\"I am not responsible for her death!\\" David says, the words bursting from him, too loud and too sudden. \\"I told her what was coming just before the attack began, so she had enough time to escort her loved ones to a safe house. If she had stayed put, she would have lived. But she was a foolish woman who didn't understand making sacrifices for the greater good, and it killed her!\\"<br /> I frown at him. There's something about his reaction -- about the glassiness of his eyes -- something that he mumbled when Nita shot him with the fear serum -- something about her.<br /> \\"Didyou love her?\\" I say. \\"All those years she was sending you correspondence... the reason tou never wanted her to stay there... the reason you told her you couldn't read her updates anymore, after she married my father...\\"<br /> David sits still, like a statue, like a man of stone.<br /> \\"I did,\\" he says. \\"But that time is past.\\"<br /> That must be why he welcomed me into his circle of trust, why he gave me so many opportunities. Because I am a piece of her, wearing her hair and speaking with her voice. Because he has spent his life grasping at her and coming up with nothing.<br /> I hear footsteps in the hallway outside. The soldiers are coming. Good -- I need them to. I  need them to exposed to the airborne serum, to pass it on to the rest of the compound. I hope they wait until the air is clear of death serum.<br /> \\"My mother wasn't a fool,\\" I say. \\"She just understood something you didn't. That it's not sacrifice if it's someone else's life you're giving away, it's just evil.\\"<br /> I back up another step and say, \\"She taught me all about real sacrifice. That it should be done from love, not misplaced disgust for another person's genetics. That it should be done from necessity, not without exhausting all other options. That it should be done for people who need your strength because they don't have enough of their own. That's why I need to stop you from `sacrificing' all those people and their memories. Why I need to rid the world of you once and for all.\\"<br /> I shake my head.<br /> \\"I didn't come here to steal anything David.<br />I twist and lunge toward the device. The gun goes off. Then again. But this time it sounds different. Pain pulses through my body. I hear Caleb's voice repeating the code, as if standing behind me helping me, encouraging me. My vision is starting to blacken. It will not end here. I won't let it. I hear Caleb's voice again as I finish typing in the code. The green button.<br />So much pain.<br />But how when my body feels so numb?<br/>I start to fall and slam my hand onto the keypad on my way down.<br />A light turns on behind the green button. I hear a beep, and a churning sound.<br />I slide to the floor. I feel something warm dripping down my forehead onto my cheek. I raise a shaky hand and touch it.<br />Red. Blood is a strange color. Dark.<br />From the corner of my eye, I see David slumped over in his chair, a bullet in his shoulder. It doesn't make sense. But then again, nothing does anymore.<br />I feel a hand interlock with mine. I must be dying. Death has come to guide me to my fate.<br />I am done here.<br />It's when I feel a squeeze that I open my eyes to see Caleb, lying next to me, gun in hand.<br />He had come back for me. But not from guilt. The look in his eyes tells of a different reason.<br />Love.<br />As we both drift off into the unknown, I whisper, \\"I love you\\" just before he is gone.<br />Caleb is dead. He came back to help me. He couldn't let his sister die for him, for his guilt. He may have chosen Eurdite, helped Jeanine, and delivered me to my own execution, but the last little part of him that was Abnegation told him that running away wasn't the right thing to do.<br />Fighting side by side with me, he died like my parents. For me. For something bigger than all of us.<br />Everyone in my family is dead, but they did not die for nothing.<br /><br />And I won't have either.<br /><br />The threads of the serum that tugged me earlier tug again.<br />This time I do not resist. I go with them.<br />I am done here.<br /><br />CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE  -TOBIAS<br />Evelyn brushes the tears from her eyes with her thumb. We stand by the windows, shoulder to shoulder, watching the snow swirl past. Some of the flakes gather on the windowsill outside, piling at the corners.<br /> The feeling as returned to my hands. As I stare out at the world, dusted in white, I feel like everything has begun again, and it will be better this time.<br /><br /> \\"I think I can get in touch with Marcusover the radio to negotiate a peace agreement,\\" Evelyn says. \\"He'll be listening in; he'd be stupid not to.\\"<br /> \\"Before you do that, I made a promise I have to keep,\\" I say. I touch Evelyn's shoulder. I expected to see strain at the edges of her smile, but I don't.<br />I feel a twinge of guilt. I didn't come here to ask her to lay down arms for me, to trade in everything she's worked for just to get me back. But then again, I didn't come here to give her any choice at all. I guess Tris was right--when you have to choose between two bad options, you pick the one that saves the people you love. I wouldn't have been saving Evelyn by giving her that serum. I would have been destroying her.<br />Peter sits with his back to the wall in the hallway. He looks up at me when I lean over him, his dark hair stuck to his forehead from the melted snow.<br /> \\"Did you reset her?\\" he says.<br /> \\"No,\\" I say.<br /> \\"Didn't think you would have the nerve.\\"<br /> \\"It's not about nerve. You know what? Whatever.\\" I shake my head and hold up the vial of memory serum. \\"Are you still set on this?\\"<br /> He nods.<br /> \\"You could just do the work, you know,\\" I say. \\"You could make better decisions, make a better life.\\"<br /> \\"Yeah I could,\\" he says. \\"But I won't. We both know that.\\"<br /> I do know that. I know change is difficult, and comes slowly, and that it is the work of many days strung together in a long line until the origin of them is forgotten. He is afraid that he will not be able to put in that work, that he will squander those days, and that they will leave him worse off than he is now. And I understand that feeling--I understand being afraid of yourself.<br /> So I have him sit on one of the couches, and I ask him what he wants me to tell him about himself, after his memories disappear like smoke. He just shakes his head. Nothing. He wants to retain nothing.<br /> Peter takes the vial with a shaking hand and twists off the cap. The liquid trembles inside it, almost spilling over the lip. He holds it under his nose to smell it.<br /> \\"How much should I drink?\\" he says, and I think I hear his teeth chattering.<br /> \\"I don't think it makes a difference,\\" I say.<br /> \\"Okay. Well... here goes.\\" He lifts the vial up to the light like he is toasting me.<br /> When he touches it to his mouth I say, \\"Be brave.\\"<br /> Then he swallows.<br /> And I watch Peter disappear.<br /><br />The air outside tastes like ice.<br /> \\"Hey! Peter!\\" I shout, my breaths turning to vapor.<br /> Peter stands by the doorway to the Eurdite headquarters, looking clueless. AT the sound of his name--which I have told him at least ten times since he drank the serum--he raises his eyebrows pointing to his chest. Matthew told us people would be disoriented for a while after drinking the memory serum, but I didn't think \\"disoriented\\" meant \\"stupid\\" until now.<br /> I sigh. \\"Yes, that's you! For the eleventh time! Come on, let's go.\\"<br /> I thought that when I looked at him after he drank the serum, I would still see the initiate who shoved a butter knife into Edward's eye, and the boy who tried to kill my girlfriend, and all the other things he has done, stretching backward for as long as I've known him. But it's easier than I thought to see that he has no idea who he is anymore. His eyes still have that wide, innocent look, but this time, I believe it.<br /> Evelyn and I walk side by side, with Peter trotting behind us. The snow has stopped falling now, but enough has collected on the ground that it squeaks under my shoes.<br /> We walk to Millennium Park, where the mammoth bean sculpture reflects the moonlight, and then down a set of stairs. As we descend, Evelyn wraps her hand around my elbow to keep her balance, and we exchange a look. I wonder if she is as nervous as I am to see my father again. I wonder if she is nervous every time.<br /> At the bottom of the steps is a pavilion with two glass blocks, each one at least three times as tall as I am, at either end.This is where we told Marcus and Johanna we would meet them--both parties armed, to be realistic but even.<br /> They are already there. Johanna isn't holding a gun, but Marcus is, and he has it trained on Evelyn. I point the gun Evelyn gave me at him just to be safe. I notice the planes of his skull, showing through his shaved hair, and the jagged path his crooked nose carves down his face.<br /> \\"Tobias!\\" Johanna says. She wears a coat in Amity red, dusted with snowflakes. \\"What are you doing here?\\"<br /> \\"Trying to keep you all from killing each other,\\" I say. \\"I'm surprised you're carrying a gun.\\"<br /> I nod to the bulge in her coat pocket, the unmistakable contours of a weapon.<br /> \\"Sometimes you have to take difficult measures to ensure peace,\\" Johanna says. \\"I believe you agree with that, as a principle.\\"<br /> \\"We're not here to chat, Marcus says, looking at Evelyn. \\"You said you wanted to talk about a treaty.\\"<br /> The past few weeks have taken something from him. I can see it in the turned-down corners of his mouth, in the purple skin under his eyes. I see my own eyes set into his skull, and think of my reflection in the fear landscape, how terrified I was, watching his skin spread over mine like a rash. I still am nervous that I will become him, even now. Standing at odds with him with my mother at my side, like I always dreamed I would when I was a child.<br /> But I don't think I'm still that afraid.<br /> \\"Yes,\\" Evelyn says. \\"I have some terms for us both to agree to. I think you will find them fair. If you agree to them, I will step down and surrender whatever weapons I have that my people are not using for personal protection. I will leave the city and not return.\\"<br /> Marcus laughs. I'm not sure if it's a mocking laugh or a disbelieving one. He's equally capable of either sentiment, an arrogant and deeply suspicious man.<br /> \\"Let her finish,\\" Johanna says quietly, tucking her hands into her sleeves.<br /> \\"In return,\\" Evelyn says, \\"you willnot attack or try to seize control of the city. You will allow those people who wish to leave and seek a new life elsewhere to do so. You will allow those who choose to stay to vote on new leaders and a new social system. And most importantly, you, Marcus, will not be eligible to lead them.\\"<br /> It is the only purely selfish term of the peace agreement. She told me she couldn't stand the thought of Marcus duping more people into following him, and I didn't argue with her.<br /> Johanna raises her eyebrows. I notice that she has pulled her hair back on both sides, to reveal the scar in its entirety. She looks better that way--stronger, when she is not hiding behind a curtain of hair, hiding who she is.<br /> \\"No deal,\\" Marcus says. \\"I am the leader of these people.\\"<br /> \\"Marcus,\\" Johanna says.<br /> He ignores her. \\"You don't get to decide whether I lead them or not because you have a grudge against me Evelyn.\\"<br /> \\"Excuse me,\\" Johanna says loudly. \\"Marcus, what she is offering is too good to be true--we get everything we want without all the violence! How can you possibly say no?\\"<br /> \\"Because I am the rightful leader of these people!\\" Marcus says. \\"I am the leader of the Allegiant! I--\\"<br /> \\"No you are not,\\" Johanna says calmly. \\"I am the leader of the Allegiant. And you are going to agree to this treaty, or I am going to tell them that you had a chance to end this conflict without bloodshed if you sacrificed your pride and you said no.\\"<br /> Marcus's passive mask is gone, revealing the malicious face beneath it. But even he can't argue with Johanna, whose perfect calm and perfect threat have mastered him. He shakes his head but doesn't argue again.<br /> \\"I agree to your terms,\\" Johanna says, and she holds out her hand, her footsteps squeaking in the snow.<br /> Evelyn removes her glove fingertip by fingertip, reaches across the gap, and shakes.<br /> \\"In the morning we should gather everyone together and tell them the new plan,\\" Johanna says. \\"Can youguarantee a sage gathering?\\"<br /> \\"I'll do my best,\\" Evelyn says.<br /> I check my watch. An hour has passed since Amar and Christina separated from us near the Hancock building, which means he probably knows that the serum virus didn't work. Or maybe he doesn't. Either way, I have to do what I came here to do--I have to find Zeke and his mother and tell them what happened to Uriah.<br /> \\"I should go,\\" I say to Evelyn. \\"I have something else to take care of. But I'll pick you up from the city limits tomorrow afternoon?\\"<br /> \\"Sounds good,\\" Evelyn says, and he rubs my arm briskly with a gloved hand, like she used to when I came in from the cold as a child.<br /> \\"You won't be back, I assume?\\" Johanna says to me. \\"You've found a life for yourself on the outside?\\"<br /> \\"I have,\\" I say. \\"Good luck in here. The people outside--they're going to try to shut the city down. You should be ready for them.\\"<br /> Johanna smiles. \\"I'm sure we can negotiate with them.\\"<br /> She offers me her hand, and I shake it. I feel Marcus's eyes on me like an oppressive weight threatening to crush me. I force myself to look at him.<br /> \\"Good bye,\\" I say to him, and I meant it.<br /><br />Hana, Zeke's mother, has small feet that don't touch the ground when she sits in the easy chair in their living room. She is wearing a ragged black bathrobe and slippers, but the air she has, with her hands folded in her lap and her eyebrows raised, is so dignified that I feel like I am standing in front of a world leader. I glance at Zeke, who is rubbing his fists to wake up.<br /> Amar and Christina found them, not among the other revolutionaries near the Hancock building, but in the family apartment in the Pire, above the Dauntless headquarters. I only found them because Christina thought to leave Peter and me a note with their location on the useless truck. Peter is waiting in the new van Evelyn found for us to drive to the Bureau.<br /> \\"I'm sorry, I say. \\"I don't know where to start.\\"<br /> \\"Youmight begin with the worst,\\" Hana says. \\"Like what exactly happened to my son.\\"<br /> \\"He was seriously injured during an attack,\\" I say. \\"There was an explosion, and he was very close to it.\\"<br /> \\"Oh God,\\" Zeke says, and he rocks back and forth like his body wants to be a child again, soothed by motion.<br /> But Hana just bends her head, hiding her face from me.<br /> Their living room smells like garlic and onion, maybe remnants from that night's dinner. I lean my shoulder into the white wall by the doorway. Hanging crookedly next to me is a picture of the family--Zeke as a toddler, Uriah as a baby, balancing on his mother's lap. Their father's face is pierced in several places, nose, ear and lip, but his wide, bright, smile and dark complexion are more familiar to me, because he passed them both to his sons.<br /> \\"He has been in a coma since then,\\" I say. \\"And...\\"<br /> \\"And he isn't going to wake up,\\" Hana says, her voice strained. \\"That is what you came to tell us right?\\"<br /> \\"Yes,\\" I say. \\"I came to collect you so that you can make a decision on his behalf.\\"<br /> \\"A decision?\\" Zeke says. \\"You mean, to unplug him or not?\\"<br /> \\"Zeke,\\" Hana says, and she shakes her head. He sinks back into the couch. The cushions seem to wrap around him.<br /> \\"Of course we don't want to keep him alive that way,\\" Hana says. \\"He would want to move on. But we would like to go see him,\\"<br /> I nod. \\"Of course. But there's something else I should say. The attack... it was a kind of uprising that involved some of the people from the place where we were staying. And I participated in it.\\"<br /> I stare at the crack in the floorboards right in front of me, at the dust that has gathered over time, and wait for a reaction, any reaction. What greets me is only silence.<br /> \\"I didn't do what you asked me,\\" I say to Zeke. \\"I didn't watch out for him the way I should have. And I'm sorry.\\"<br /> I chance a look at him, and he is just sitting still, staring at the empty vase on thecoffee table. It is painted with faded pink roses.<br /> \\"I think we need some time with this,\\" Hana says. She clears her throat, but it doesn't help her tremulous voice.<br /> \\"I wish I could give it to you,\\" I say. \\"But we're going back to the compound very soon, and you have to come with us.\\"<br /> \\"All right,\\" Hana says. \\"If you can wait outside, we will be there in five minutes.\\"<br /><br /> The ride back to the compound is slow and dark. I watch the moon disappear and reappear behind the clouds as we bump over the ground. When we reach the other limits of the city. It begins to snow again, large, light flakes that swirl in front of the head lights. I wonder if Tris is watching it sweep across the pavement and gather in piles by the airplanes. I wonder if she is living in a better world than the one I left, among people who no longer remember what it is to have pure genes.<br /> Christina leans forward to whisper into my ear, \\"So you did it? It worked?\\"<br /> I nod. In the rearview mirror I see her touch her face with both hands, grinning into her palms. I know how she feels: safe. We are all safe.<br /> \\"Did you inoculate your family?\\" I say.<br /> \\"Yep. We found them with the Allegiant, in the Hancock building,\\" she says. \\"But the time for the reset has passed -- it looks like Tris and Caleb stopped it.\\"<br /> Hana and Zeke murmur to each other on the way there, marveling at the strange, dark world we move through. Amar gives the basic explanation as we go, looking back at them instead of the road far too often for my comfort. I try to ignore my surges of panic as he almost veers into streetlights or road barriers, and focus instead on the snow.<br /> I have always hated the emptiness that winter brings, the blanket landscape and the stark difference between sky and ground, the way it transforms trees into skeletons and the city into a wasteland. Maybe this winter I can be persuaded otherwise.<br /> We drive past the fences and stop by the front doors, whichare no longer manned by guards. We get out, and Zeke seizes his mother's hand to steady her as she shuffles through the snow. As we walk into the compound, I know for a fact that Caleb succeeded, because there is no one in sight. That can only mean that they have been reset, their memories forever altered.<br /> \\"Where is everyone?\\" Amar says.<br /> We walk through the abandoned security checkpoint without stopping. On the other side, I see Cara. The side of her face is badly bruised, and there's a bandage on her head. But that's not what concerns me. What concerns me is the troubled look on her face.<br /> \\"What is it?\\" I say.<br /> Cara shakes her head.<br /> \\"Where's Tris?\\" I say.<br /> \\"I'm sorry, Tobias.\\"<br /> \\"Sorry about what?\\" Christina says roughly. \\"Tell us what happened!\\"<br /> \\"Tris went into the Weapons Lab instead of Caleb,\\" Cara says. \\"She survived the death serum, and set off the memory serum, but she was shot... in the head. She's alive... but it doesn't look good. I'm so sorry.\\"<br /><br />Most of the time I can tell when people are lying, and this must be a lie, because Tris is fine. Her eyes bright and cheeks flushed and her small body fully of power, and strength, standing in a shaft of light in the atrium. Tris is fine, she wouldn't leave me here alone, and she wouldn't go into the Weapons Lab instead of Caleb.<br /> I take off running to the hospital wing where she remains fighting.<br /> As I'm running I realize: of course Tris would go to the Weapons Lab instead of Caleb.<br /> Of course she would.<br /> Christina yells after me, but to me her voice sounds muffled, like I have submerged my head underwater. The details of the halls are difficult to see, the world smearing together into dull colors.<br /> When I reach her room, I look in. All I can do is stand still--if I stand still I can pretend everything is all right. That she isn't dying right in front of me.<br /> All I'm doing is standing still. Helpless.<br /><br />CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO-TOBIAS<br />As I sat next to her bed, I remembered when her body first hit the net, all I registered was a gray blur. I pulled her across it and her hand was small, but warm, and then she stood before me, short and thin and plain and in all ways unremarkable--except that she had jumped first. The Stiff had jumped first.<br /> Even I didn't jump first.<br /> Her eyes were so stern, so insistent.<br /> Beautiful.<br />CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE  - TOBIAS<br />But that wasn't the first time I ever saw her. I saw her in the hallways at school, and my mother's false funeral, and walking the sidewalks in the Abnegation sector. I saw her, but I didn't see her; no one saw her the way she truly was until she jumped.<br /> I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.<br />CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR -TOBIAS<br />I've been with her for a week now. They say she gets better every day, but she's a fighter, I hoped she would. I'd be excited about her progress, but everyone has warned me that when she's finally awake, I might not have my Tris back.<br /> They don't know what she'll be like. No one's ever survived the death serum. Not to mention she was shot in the head, and laid there dying while everyone was gassed. And I was nowhere near her.<br /> I should have been there. I didn't feel right leaving her alone with this big of a task.<br />I'm always right, I can hear her say.<br /> But this time she wasn't. I've let her down so many times because I wouldn't listen to her. For trusting my own instincts over my own.<br /> I was so worried about letting her down again, that I ignored what I felt completely.<br /> And now she's here. And it's my fault.<br />CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE  -TOBIAS<br />I'm in a daze. I haven't slept, but I don't feel tired. I try to keep busy, keep the company of others, and am crippled by loneliness when I leave them. I feel like I have lost everything. I watch everyone else recover from the memory serum that altered them permanently. Those that are lost are gathered into groups and given the truth: that human nature is complex, that all our genes are different, but neither damaged nor pure, and Tris is a hero. They were also given a lie: that their memories were erased because of a freak accident, and that they were on the verge of lobbying the government for equality for GD's.<br /> My hands shake as I stop by the control room to watch the city on the screens. Johanna is arranging transportation for those who want to leave the city. They will come here to learn the truth. I don't know what will happen to those who remain in Chicago, and I'm not sure I care.<br /> I shove my hands into my pockets and watch for a few minutes, then walk away again, trying to match my footsteps to my heartbeat, or to avoid the cracks between the tiles. When I walk past the entrance I see a small group of people gathered by the stone sculpture, one of them in a wheelchair--Nita.<br />I was there for some of Uriah's last breaths. Christina found me to let me know that they were unplugging him.<br /> We go to the observation window, my body aching with each step. Evelyn is there--Amar picked her up in my stead, a few days ago. She tries to touch my shoulder and I yank it away, not wanting to be comforted. I don't deserve it.<br /> Inside the room, Zeke and Hana stand on either side, holding his hands. I notice a doctor standing near the heart rate monitor, extending a clipboard not to Hana or Zeke but to David. Sitting in his wheelchair. Hunched and dazed, like all the others who have lost their memories.<br /> \\"What is he doing here?\\" I feel like all my muscles and bones and nerves are on fire.<br /> \\"He's still technically the leader of the Bureau, at least until they replace him,\\" Cara says from behind me. \\"Tobias, he doesn't remember anything. The man you knew doesn't exist anymore; he's as good as dead. That man doesn't remember shooting--\\"<br /> \\"Shut up!\\" I snap. David signs the clipboard and turns around, pushing himself through the door. It opens and I can't stop myself--I lunge toward him, and only Evelyn's wiry frame stops me from wrapping my hands around his throat. He gives me a strange look and pushes himself down the hallway as I press against my mother's arm, which feels like a bar across my shoulders.<br />\\"Tobias,\\" Evelyn says. \\"Calm down.\\"<br /> \\"Why didn't someone lock him up?\\" I demand, my eyes to blurry to see out of.<br /> \\"Because he still works for the government,\\" Cara says. \\"Just because they've declared it an unfortunate accident doesn't mean they've fired everyone. And the government isn't going to lock him up just because he shot a rebel under duress.\\"<br /> \\"A rebel,\\" I repeat. \\"That's all she is now?\\"<br />\\"Of course not,\\" Cara says softly. \\"She's a hero now, but as far as everyone is concerned now, it was an accident. Confusion. It was chaos around here. No one knew who the good guys were.\\"<br /> I'm about to respond, but Christina interrupts, \\"Guys, they're doing it.\\"<br />In Uriah's room, Zeke and Hana join their free hands over Uriah's body. I see Hana's lips moving, but I can't tell what she's saying--do the Dauntless have prayers for the dying? The Abnegation react to death with silence and service, not words. I find my anger ebbing away, and I'm lost in muffled grief again, this time not just for Tris, but for Uriah, whose smile is burned into my memory. My friend's brother, and then my friends too, though not for long enough to let his humor work its way into me, not for long enough.<br />The doctor flips some switches, his clipboard clutched to his stomach, and the machines stop breathing for Uriah. Zeke's shoulders shake, and Hana squeezes his hand tightly, until her knuckles go white.<br />Then she says something, and her hands spring open, and she steps back from Uriah's body. Letting him go.<br />I move away from the window, walking at first, and then running, pushing my way through the hallways, careless, blind, empty.<br />CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX  -TRIS<br />Bright lights.<br />Am I alive?<br />My name is Beatrice Prior...<br />I know nothing else.<br />CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN  -Tobias<br />I wake up to Christina standing over me, eyes wild with excitement.<br /> \\"Tris!\\" She's pants. \\"She's awake!\\"<br />Before I even realize it, I'm jumping out of my bed and take off running. When I reach the hospital, I shove doctors out of my way and practically kick her door open.<br /> She stares at me. She's there. Awake.<br /> I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this.<br /> She looks the same, yet different. She's quiet and still.<br /> And she's scared. She's looking at me like a stranger...<br />She doesn't remember me.<br /><br />>>>>con't in next post
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was the first book I've ever read by Jojo Moyes, and couldn't put it down.  I was holed up in my room for hours and hours reading this book.  Be prepared to have some tissues on hand.  It is a tear jerker.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I've enjoyed the challenges of this game.  It is an exercise in strategization. Perfect for Halloween. And... it's fun, too!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great Movie.  I love the cast . very suspenseful.  Will watch it over and over. Hope they keep making more like this
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Although this novel is classified as a romance, it is atypical of most romances that I have read.  Nonetheless, it is truly absorbing and worthwhile.
B00C6Q6OAG|4.0|The dolls shipped quickly and arrived in a timely fashion. They're pretty much as awesome as other Monster High dolls, with the attention to detail, detachable limbs to make getting their clothes on easy, etc. The journal is cute and does a good job of showcasing the personalities of Ghoulia and Cleo, which is nice. My daughter is very happy with these dolls. She has a labcoat and a Cleo De Nile costume so that will probably become a thing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i don't have to tell you this game is AMAZING!  I didn't have a phone to support the app until just recently - only played online.  The app started me a level 1 unfortunatly & I'm at level 110 through FB, but that's ok, since my &#34;Candy Crush&#34; skills have me flying through each early level.  A must have!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Does not start off slow and there is lots of action.  Ending was a little weak but much better than most movies of the same genre.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I just downloaded the app and it seems to offer more than the old one did. I hope it shows completed listings so I can do research on item values on site.  I haven't tried that function yet,  If that doesn't work right I would only rate the app about a 3.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one beautiful story in my opinion.<br />Moyes pulls you into this novel and you will not want to put it down.<br /><br />There are books that touches the heart to any who pick it up...this is one of those book.<br /><br />Great great great read!!!<br />Well don JoJo Moyes!
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It Was Great That I Could Print From My Kindle Fire, But Not.that You Have To Be In sPrint First.  So There Are Still Things I Can't Prin, Like Emails.
B00FRMCYQ4|4.0|If you have kids in the 3 to 6 age range you can't go wrong with this movie. I found it far more entertaining than I expected and my 3-year old son loves it.<br />Once you can get past the fact that the hero is a snail, (which kids don't care about), it has all the familiar elements that make this kind of animated movie fun for kids to watch.
B000E9910W|5.0|One of my top five bands from the last 30 years. Amazing musicianship, vocals, harmonies, and lyrics. Truly a must have for every Doobies fan out there. Listen to the Music.
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|Good movie. I actually found myself into the plot. Great animation and 3D affects. Get this one, it is worth it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series was amazing! If liked Hunger Games you'll like this.  Wish it didn't have to end the way it did though...
B004YOEFG8|4.0|Not the greatest 3d I have experienced but pretty darned good. It is a nice way to show off that 3D TV you payed for.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I recommend this book for mysterious people who like awesome mysterious books! I couldn't stop reading them till the very end!  I hate the people who rate this a one star.  Any ways, this book is meant for kids like 9+. ONLY give this to a kid younger than 8 IF they are one of those super smart genius kids like me!
B00A7Z8KAU|3.0|It's alright, but for straight drawing I like sketch guru better which is free. The two apps compliment eachother well though. It is good for textures, effects, and painting but sketch guru is much closer to using an actual pencil or charcoal.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Actually a pretty entertaining game. I got it when it was free on the free app of the day. Free entertainment!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Grandson likes and so do I. It is a challenge and you sometimes have to be creative on your process. Good mind game.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't see the allure this game has.<br />I love games like Tetris and Bust-a-Move but this one left me wondering...WHY?
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I got this a the free app of the day because I simply could not pass it up. What I played was one of the best apps I have ever had. The gameplay is very simple. Granny Smith is chasing a thief who is trying to steal her priceless apples. While the logic is very low, the graphics and controls are absolutely spectacular. The graphics are an odd mix between 2d and 3d due to the way the camera slants on the replays. It has never been this satisfying to see granny do a back flip and crash through a window, all for the sake of her beloved apples. The sound effects are hilarious and clear as a bell when I use head phones. Also, I like the fact that other is only 2  buttons to worry about, making the task of controlling granny much easier. The difficulty gets harder and harder with every level. Before you know it, you are gritting your teeth at another failure all while laughing at the funny sound effects. However, with enough persistence, you can finally beat the game. So, even though the app is not free now, it is very much worth the 1.99 price. In fact, I would even pay 4.99 or possibly more! So, enjoy!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just a good book! Highly recommend reading. It's slow in spots, but I loved it. Can't wait to read the third book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|awesome book. couldn't put it down. had to get the hardcover as well. loved it. this is my first Grisham novel but watched the movie a time to kill which is a classic. hope he keeps writing books like this
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is such a captivating book, I've read it twice and still I want more! A must read for everyone!
B003WQT2YY|5.0|Watched it for school but actually enjoyed it. Great movie! I would watch it again even without having an assignment for it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Easy to use.Almost everything runs on Adobe.I now have more access to things on internet .Thanks for making it easy to use.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The style of this book - jumping about in narration from character to character left me union vested in any of them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thanks, it was a good show.<br /><br />Why the strong arm tactics on how many words it takes me to tell you I liked the product? This kind of stuff discourages me from responding to your requests for feedback in the future
1936608898|5.0|Finally, an eating plan that actually works and can be adapted to everyday life. I always knew there HAD to be such a thing out there and, for me, this is IT.  I followed the Whole30 meal plan about 90% compliant for the whole 30 days and I intend to continue on it for good health from now on...with the occasional &#34;guilt-free special-occasion deviation&#34;, of course! I'm happy to be down 7 pounds in 30 days, but that is really a secondary benefit. The best part is just knowing what to eat and what to avoid, and proving for myself that there's an eating plan which can, at the same time, deliver both gustatory satisfaction and optimal nutrition. Thank you, Dallas and Melissa Hartwig!
B008KWHM6U|5.0|Good record by two door cinema club, another  cd for my collection. Fast delivery, didnt have any problem with it or the product.
B00D2BHO44|4.0|Whenever I play a game, watch a movie, tv show, I pay attention to the music. And when I hear those songs that spark an emotion, I love to relive them and make new memories with the songs. There are a lot of great songs on this album and I spent many a night listening to it while writing poetry and eating dinner. You can tell that there was great care in creating all of the songs and moods they inspired.<br /><br />Standout tracks:<br /><br />&#34;Home&#34; --- Great guitar sounds<br /><br />&#34;All Gone (Aftermath)&#34; ---- Absolutely stunningly beautiful, I love the instrumentation and the part when the guitar comes in<br /><br />&#34;Vanishing Grace&#34; (Childhood) ------- This is the title screen music and I really recommend you put it on just when the sun is going down on your way home from work. This one might make you cry if you've got the memories to think about as you listen to it.<br /><br />&#34;The Last of Us (You and me)&#34; ------ Put this one on repeat where it belongs. The acoustics are extremely deep and while some may think it's boring, this isn't an active listening song - it's a thinking song.<br /><br />Happy listening and I hope you too will listen to it while writing your girlfriend/boyfriend a love letter, contemplating the meaning of your life, thinking about someone who has recently passed away, and while writing poetry.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is truly addictive! It's a lot of fun, but very frustrating when you get stuck & you have to keep going back over & over again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought the season went really well aside from Milton scenes which annoyed the hell out of me, I really loved the third season. I just wish that Andrea was more of the badass character she was in the comics and rejoined the prison group fully. I loved how the season ended, unlike many other people, and thought it was a great twist. If you liked season 2, you'll love season 3.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Downloaded this game,from the,kindle store it,was fun to play but once I quit and,wanted to play,again all that would come up was ads for other games and I could not get into the game itself.
B007UXTG8M|3.0|Great acting, albeit of a dysfunctional family.  Not always pleasant to watch, but a common issue happening today.  They were very powerful together.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's been a long time since I enjoyed a Stephen King book. Frankly, I haven't liked anything he has written since Tommyknockers. However, Doctor Sleep was awesome. I really enjoyed the story and found the True Knot to be interesting villains. Without spoiling too much, I like that he made them desperate. Somehow, that made them far more entertaining than if they were just plain bad guys with unclear motives.<br /><br />Also, King has always had a tendency to ramble, to go off on tangents, but he kept it under control in this one. And even the rambling he seemingly DID do, all ultimately contributed to the plot.<br /><br />Overall, very well done.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This &#34;free&#34; game sucks you in and then slowly requires more and more in order to continue to progress.  More time, more &#34;friends&#34;, and ESPECIALLY more money.<br />Every other week or so, you'll have to log back into iTunes to get the &#34;updated version&#34; of this game.  It's required.  If you don't update, they limit all of your gift giving capabilities, and believe me, you'll want to be able to give gifts to your &#34;friends&#34;...they're the only things keeping you afloat/sane in this god awful game.  For MONTHS, I did nothing but eat, work, and play MM.  There is a never ending supply of gifts, collections, and quests to be found. Sooo many levels to this, it's crazy.  Then they give you JUST enough supplies to get through one or two rounds before...OH NO! You've run out of the keys to get back into the room! You'll need to give &#60;short story: more money&#62; to continue.  Did I mention this is your SECOND set of keys?? First you need entirely DIFFERENT keys (yes, those keys = money) to get into the WAR that enables you to give the SECOND SET OF KEYS to get INTO the bloody room.  Oh, but WAIT!! First you have to WIN the war! And THIS requires items that you have to use against whatever it is that you are fighting.  Don't have enough items? That's okay.  They will sell you more for additional &#34;diamonds&#34; (which ultimately translates into MORE MONEY). It seemed cheap enough at first...$0.99 here, $0.99 there, it all QUICKLY added up. The amounts are extremely misleading: &#34;Buy this chest for $0.99! You get 300 keys to enter X room!&#34; Holy crap!! Three hundred?? What a steal!! Yeah, well it costs FIFTY KEYS to enter that room, so that will get you in six times. Not much, when you can find all of the items in about a minute. (I was blowing through $10-$20 a day...do the math over a month.)<br />But if all that wasn't bad enough, the most recent upgrade did away with the $0.99 option and you now have to spend $4.99 on items (threechests!!!) you don't even need in order to possibly get the ones that you do. AND it came with several glitches that totally screwed over several players during an added &#34;contest&#34; feature...several hours and dollars down the drain. I submitted a ticket with Game Insight that was completely ignored. That's it. I will see myself off the crazy train now. Thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|On my computer I'm on 458. On the Kindle it will not go past 440.  Why? It is irritating not to be able to play only the levels I have already played.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Seriously, what can I say besides THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER.  No really, this is such a great show, and since I do not have cable, I am happy that I can get it the very next day from Amazon.
B005XZR4NI|5.0|I literally laughed out loud. This was one of the best movies that I've seen in a while. Hysterical!  /
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Ridiculously fun and all consuming.  If you like defense games, you will love this game. I love this game and I am awesome.  Trust me.<br />Just get it.  Do it.<br /><br />I have no regrets.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Read the book so fast but also did not want it to end. I love the book, will look for more by Moyes.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|There are two reasons it does not get five stars - it keeps pushing you to connect with facebook and when you get to various levels; you either have to pay or get your facebook friends to send tickets.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to be able to play on my kindle.... now for them to release it on my Windows phone....
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|If you are a McCartney fan you will enjoy. If not, take a pass. Enjoyable, not revolutionary. Paul should break out one more time.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|It was good.  I liked the first one I read better than this one.  But---it had a good mystery to it.  I learned alot about the characters since I had read the 2nd one before the 1st!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun i cant stop playing it infact my whole family plays it theres trains<br />And more I especially like the mystery boxes there filled with all sorts of fun<br />Stuff so thats my reason you should download this app
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Arcade Fire's Reflektor may not reach the heights of 2004's Funeral or 2010's The Suburbs but it is an excellent edition to the group's catalog. The album will divide some fans over the direction the band chose. The shift in sound has been compared, and rightfully so, to the direction changes similar to U2's Achtung Baby after the Joshua Tree and Radiohead's Kid A after OK Computer. If you are a person that didn't like those corresponding shifts you will probably not like this album. Regardless, I recommend that everyone give it a listen especially if you are a fan of the work of James Murphy, the Talking Heads, U2's Achtung Baby, or Bowie's Berlin Trilogy. I also urge those that purchase it to give it more than one listen because it grows on you very quick.<br /><br />I am not going to argue that this is their best album since I think Funeral and Suburbs are a toss up for that spot due to the concise excellence found on those albums. It is not far off from those albums and I found it much better than 2007's Neon Bible.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Reflektor, We Exist, Joan of Arc, and Afterlife.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I read the previous reviews and thought that would be fun. I also liked the graphics. However, once the game opened and I started to play, it just got to the point of: 'really? Is that all there is to it?'<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are some entertaining elements to the game... (the humor is occasionally laugh-out-loud, and as previously stated, the graphics are very entertaining). But I find that just continuously searching for that 'next match' over and over and over again slightly tedious
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that you finally got it :)<br />Waited a long time for this !!!!<br />It's great to be able to finally play it on my Kindle....<br />Thanks for adding &#34;Candy Crush&#34;<br />Laura
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A great true story about a sad nation and a want and desire for freedom.. A human tragedy and a dream realized..
0316204366|4.0|This book is very thought provoking. This is a typical Gladwell piece. It is an easy read that you will consume in one sitting. If you liked his previous books you will like this book. Malcolm Gladwell takes the reader through a journey to examine the dimension of power. He looks at it from both ends of the equation through various stories. These stories for sure will cause any rational reader to start to think. These stories also might forever change how you view the subject of power.<br /><br />Some of the power stories are very interesting and they will stay with you forever. For example the story of the girls basketball team in CA, that without experience or ability won the championship. They did it by reformatting operations to take their advantages and not playing the typical game they were not equipped for. The chapter on dyslexia will forever change the way you look at that situation. His stories of people succeeding with that condition is very inspiring. The analysis of the NY and the Northern Ireland counterinsurgency operations will cause the brain cells to work on overtime. I am sure his story of Martin Luther King's demonstrations in Birmingham AL will for sure upset many. That chapter does use the cover of the Disney briar rabbit story is very Machiavellian. Malcolm here does defend that line of thought. I was a bit surprised at that. However the argument is well explained and laid out logically.<br /><br />I do think everyone will love this book.
0061120073|5.0|I can only express feelings of admiration and respect for main character Francie Nolan, whom the story is centrally focused on. Betty Smith takes readers on a journey through the most essential years in a young girls life. She allows students like myself to see in a different light, to throw away societal perception of what is beautiful and see a time period through eyes of innocence.<br /><br />  The Nolan family is comprised of mother Katie, Father Johnny, Francie, and younger brother Cornelius (Neely). The Nolan's live a life of simplicity; they are warriors in my eyes, staying alive under the poverty line. The Nolan's however, do not dwell on their situation; instead they do what they must to eat. They are resourceful and Francie learns at an early age how to be \\"street smart,\\" and bargain with even the slimiest of vendors.<br /><br />  What's interesting about Francie Nolan is her hunger for knowledge and her portrayal of beauty. She becomes a thriving bookworm and channels her energy into answering life's most challenging questions. Smith allowed me to follow Francie as she maintained a mindset of positivity in a world full of heartache, and I couldn't help but be moved. Through when she was violated to her Fathers death I cried, while Francie grew stronger. She holds it together, and she does what she must for her family and at a point gave up her education.<br /><br />  Smith constantly writes of a tree which we later come to realize is actually a symbol of Francie herself. Brooklyn made Francie, the tree growing out of cement, and Brooklyn watched her grow. In the end, as Francie is to leave for college, she comes to a realization that gave me goose bumps. She will never see this tree again.<br /><br />  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who needs to be inspired. I warn you, Francie Nolan has that power.
B00EVW013E|5.0|Amazing best action movie I have seen in a long time. You will love it if you like action thrillers.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|The most original new artist of 2013. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. You've already wasted too much time without this exquisite music in your life.
0671449028|5.0|All the items listed above arrived on time as estimated.  My granddaughter was absolutely thrilled with the backpack and water bottle.  The quality of the items was excellent.  My little one said I was &#34; the bestest Mamah in the world!!!!!&#34;<br />The reading books are for Christmas.  She loves books and these are sturdy because of the cardboard pages.  She&#34;ll look at these for hours.
0741470314|5.0|This book is exellent. Not only does the author tell stories never before told (which is highlights to any fan) but also portraits Michael as a human beeing not so different from the rest of us, but at the same time how he has to deal with common daily chores and struggles to maintain his privacy as the worlds most famous superstar. She takes us behind the scenes into his personal daily life as a family man, artist, person, businessman and what have you.<br />In a lovely and truthful way she portraits Michael with insight, with love and with respect! She also in a way condem those who might, can, and tries to make money off of Michael for their own benefit (which clearly happened all the time (and still does), without not revealing to much of the sources - and I respect the author for bringing it up so any reader that might not be a hard core Michael-fan really can hear the truth and scrap their minds of everything that they have read, heard and 'believed' from the tabloid junky press!<br /><br />There are a lot of books written about Michael out there, and as far as I am concerned most of them are crap to read regardless if you are a fan of MJ or not! Most \\"unbiographical\\" books also tell the same story all over again from how it all started with the Jackson 5 - (we heard that one to many times now), well, this is NOT one of those books. So if you want to know more about Michael as a person and how he dealt with everything surrounding him (come stories, memories and anedotes from his closest entourage) - this is the book!<br /><br />The title 'defending' follows through the entire book. The authors brings up the trials and lawsuits i several chapters, but over all she is defending the MAN as a person, as a superstar that had to deal with exceptional and special things and happenings in his life, as a father - giving his children unconditional love and support in everything they might encounter now and in their future and as an idol that loved his fans more than anything.<br /><br />And why does anyone have to 'defend' Michael like this! Easy; common people does not have a clue who Michael really was as a person - thanks to media, tabloids, press and anyone and/or anything that make up stories just to sell seconds in the spotlight or to cash in that dollar to their bank account.<br /><br />It is really difficult to portrait Michael as person and superstar even in an 500 page book! But this author speaks out to the world what the fans really want to say about Michael as a person, and she does that in a great way that is completely supreme and radiate. Thanks for giving us a voice through you!<br /><br />It's a glorious tribute in all it's meaning.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Finally an original scary movie!! It did not have the same type of characters with the same type of religious back round!  I have been waiting for a movie like this for a long time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My husband and I fight over who gets to play! We ended up having to take turns. This is a great game.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Angry birds is the first thing I reach for when I walk in the door! This game is a great stress reliever. I can come in and play for hours and take my mind off of my day. I ended up getting my son his own because he always wants to take it from me. Lol! Graphics are awesome and I love the different challenges. You guys did a super job with this one!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book started a bit slow with all of the background on the life in the silos, but once it picked up, whoa!  A page turner. Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love this game! It's so cute. I love the little bat. Also the art in the background is beautiful.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New updates ruined this app. Sorry, I'm not doing this new stupid points thing on there now either, and what are these pictures? Why is it all complicated now? I just want to check my weather! I'm really sorry I updated this app because now I have to delete it. The new layout sucks and is ugly and NOT cool to use. Thanks!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game with good graphics. A good game for family to enjoy . I like to play this game in my kindle everyday.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Contrary to the 1 star reviews, I actually liked this movie when I saw it in the theater.  Sure, Keanu was kinda scruffy, but Sandra looked great.  The acting wasn't half bad, either.  A little flat, but other than that, better than most daytime TV soaps.  It didn't pretend to be anything other than straightforward, mindless entertainment.  And that's what I liked about it.  I even sighed at the end.<br />So, I went ahead and bought the DVD.  Two, in fact, one in fullscreen and one in wide.  The fullscreen disc started fine, then abruptly stopped after Alex and Kate finished kissing outside her surprise birthday party.  I bought a second one, the widescreen version, this time.  That disc took a long time to start, probably about 3 minutes after the film company logo appeared.  Then it played fine, until again, it stopped abruptly.  At the same exact spot!  Bad batch?  What?!<br />Like I said, I really like this movie, but I'm almost afraid to buy another DVD.  Thus, the 3 star review.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can join other servers but not my sis and no one can join my own can I get some halo on this plz
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am so sad to see this series end, but it couldn't have been done in a better way!  I am completely satisfied and a little overwhelmed!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent device. Easy to install and setup.  Would be rated 5 stars but it needs more apps that can access it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I understand why you wanted to kill Tris but I still hated it.  The beginning is boring but if you make it thru the ending for Chicago as well as other characters is satisfying
0756407915|5.0|Does 'Wise Man's Fear' suffer just a little in comparison with the tale of the first (stunning!) day?  Yes. But will I still queue up for book 3? Sure. You bet. It's still a fantastically entertaining and endearing read. While we more or less patiently wait for Patrick Rothfuss to finish the third day's account, I discovered R. A. MacAvoy's &#34;Lens Of The World&#34; [[ASIN:B00J48FCDY Lens of the World]].  She really gives PR a run for it with this one - hard to know which story I like better (and I like PR's first book a lot..). So here's a recommendation if you own a Kindle (MacAvoy's physical books are hard to find)..
B005XUC398|2.0|The movie was just flat for me...no suspense, mumbo jumbo dialogue and I never did quite understand what the problem was.  This was probably a movie for the wall street type not the average joe.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I originally bought this alarm clock in case the power went out (again).  I ended up liking it a lot. The numbers are large and not bright but easy to read when I'm bleary-eyed in the morning. I also like that I can wake up to my own choice of music.
B000YDI9UG|4.0|I love these boots, they fit great, keep your feet dry, very comfortable. Since I got them I can't take them off my feet!<br /><br />So the shipping... Well I bought these boots on a impulse with the intention of using them for my Halloween costume on Saturday night 10/26. I bought them on Friday, I paid for the upgraded shipping to have the item overnight to me... Well Saturday nights party came and when and I was Timberland Earthkeeperless.... The shoes ended up arriving that Monday 10/28. In the end I'm not devastated because they are awesome boots but Amazon guaranteed delivery by 8pm 10/26 and I paid for the upgraded shipping!
B007Q476KU|4.0|Spielberg in top form. The countryside scenes are spectacular.  The war scenes are incredible and not for the faint of heart nor for children.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was for the ridiculous horse training scenes where people would walk up the horse and explain what they wanted him to do, and then say &#34;Understand?&#34;
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor and Park has leaped to the top of my all-time favorite, literary YA novel list--all books that I found extraordinarily memorable, with characters so real and lovable and profoundly moving that I hated for them to end, and with writing so beautiful that I mark golden lines continually. Other books I've adored, which share spots on the same favorite list are Drums, Girls and Dangerous Pies; The Perks of Being a Wallflower; Looking for Alaska; Curveball; and Catcher in the Rye. (I would also include on that list Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, and My Sister's Keeper, which aren't technically categorized as YA.) Rainbow Rowell is an extraordinarily talented author who captures the innocence of the teenage perspective, even when that innocence is marred by harsh realities. Finally, an honest, non-snarky voice for YA readers that I, as a writing teacher of teens will have no reservations about recommending to every one of my teenage students. I could keep going about this book, but I must now go write my own, with Rowell as my role model!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game gets fun once you have built a lot of stuff. but, it doesn't have the best features. minecraft Pc has ALOT more stuff than the pocket edition. otherwise, great app!
B00EWPW4EY|5.0|Heard this group on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and purchased it the following morning.  Enjoyable album from start to finish.  They are an Irish group and you can hear that influence in their music.
B00A285OOW|5.0|The story is gripping albeit different from anything I've ever heard from my family of staunch Tudor supporters.  I've now read several of Philippa Gregory's historical novels and I think she's gotten better with age (perhaps mine).  The intrigues of the courts of the various rulers are well wrought and stunningly pictured.  This book certainly whetted my appetite to learn more of the actual history of these times.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good game to play when you are waiting...<br />Easy to get addicted and play when you should be doing other things!
B0089LOG02|5.0|All who have felt alone or abandoned will love this book.  The author also weaves two lives from the early days and modern days very well back and forth, so the reader knows which is which, and you can keep them clear in your mind...  It is also a very emotional book, too and the author does a good job of characterizations.  I didn't want it to end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never rated anything before now, yes it is that AWESOME!!!!!!!! The price who made this did a fabulous job.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This novel Instantly made my all time favorite list. Kept asking &#34;how did he do this...&#34; Highly recommend this book to everyone.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This season is great...most of the episodes are creative and thought provoking.<br />We get to know our favorite characters even better.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Excellent Movie. Lots of action and Mark Wahlberg style suspense. Really enjoyed it.<br />The car chasing in mini coopers was fun to watch.
B008476HBM|5.0|I loved this because it is so tender.  I loved all the parts in it.  Have read it many times.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It's been a blast  an  I can nott stop playing next on to the frontier and  on to victory yes
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is thrilling and amazing to see how they're love for each other and the fight for survival are so strong
B004TUDMD4|4.0|This album brings together all of the poetry, insight and talent of Lou Reed. His insight into the ugly American slaps you in the face as you cling to the power and rhythm. Move over Bob Dylan, Lou Reed cuts to the heart of the ugly American.
0765356147|5.0|I loved the reading of this book. It had and unexpected ending.  I hated to see the trilogy end. I look forward to more mistborn novels.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|I had to purchase this CD because I lost the one sent to me from Netflix.  Thank you for sending me a good copy
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Many story lines going on at once that weave together and apart which makes it interesting.  I find myself wanting to know what will happen next.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great series and I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would based on the other reviews.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love everything about these books. I read all of them. Cant wait till the final book arrives. May 2014... yay
B000FCKGPC|3.0|****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />This book is ok but not as good as the others in this series. Martin comes right out and says that the next book is not going to advance the story. At least he's honest. I'll wait until the 6th book comes out before torturing myself with book 5. This review is not intended to discourage potential readers though. The series overall is amazing; I'm obsessed with it. I named all of my virtual pets after Game of Thrones characters. I'm  even considering changing my 6 year old's name to Arya. Yeah, it's that good.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|There are no better words the whole series was exceptional I would anything she writes. The story was in my mind very original and I couldn't put it down if I didn't have a 5year old I would have read them all in one night. I don't usually preorder but I didn't want to have to wait for the final in the first place. I didn't just love the main characters I loved them all. I have tried to decide which faction I would be in but so far no luck. The ending was unexpected and I cried just like Harry Potter which from me is a huge compliment. Please read this so Veronica will keep writing.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I really do love this game! The one on Kongregate is just slightly more fun, but they are both awesome!
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is a movie for music fans. Really tells a great story about American music history and how the industry has changed over the years to makes albums cheaper with no soul to the recording process. Can't believe the industry bitches about napster after seeing this.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really enjoyed the previous books in this series, and felt the overall premise was interesting and provacative.  However, this final book was very poorly written, plodded along without much of a story arc, and was actually quite difficult to get through as it never really caught my imagination (which was not the case with the previous books).  The ending, while it may disappoint some fans, would have been fine if it wasn't just 'cut and pasted' in with very little plot linkage.  A hugely disjointed novel that was not at all satisfying to finish.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is a Johnny Depp fan. We watched it together and agreed that it was a movie with a twist and certainly not one to watch alone. I'm glad I bought it for my friend.
B005NNV044|4.0|Doing what the do best..<br />A calming atmospheric journey from beginning to end.<br />no drugs needed to experience the trip :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I sure am! And you don't have to spend money  if you don't want to. When you run out of plays just wait awhile. After all playing games is just a time killer anyhow!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Although not the brand new edition, our grand daughter watched it straight through two times in a row. The animation is Disney - nothing more to say. Excellent and exciting. Perfect match for an Ariel costume.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely positively loved this book. I wish there was a fourth. If there was a fourth I would read it without a doubt.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great read. If you liked the Shinning then this continuation of that story is a must read. Mr. King is still at the top of his game. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story written by a master.
B00G32OER4|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, and that it is based on a true story.<br />The acting was very good. I hope there's a sequal.
0425261360|5.0|I love the Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell novels.  I'm a mystery, suspense reader and Patricia Cornwell never lets me down.  This is her latest novel and it hits the mark for entertainment, mystery, suspense.
B00DJYJPLO|1.0|Without a doubt, it is absolutely the worst movie(if you can call it a movie) I have seen in years. I don't know how it got its rating, but it is a shallow, unfocused , narrow piece of tripe. The only possible comment it makes , is that the current rating system is a flawed, corrupt and a completely non-objective forum. Don't waist your money. , Its a chic flick on steroids and any males that can sit through it and actually like it, well . . . they have surrendered their man card.<br /><br />If you enjoy endless, meaningless, conversation that is void of any focus you will love it.  Perhaps you may then also enjoy riding public transit and listening to random conversations.
0440246008|5.0|I read all Lee Child books.  I reviewed what had been published and filled in the blanks recently by ordering what I had missed.  Sad to be caught up and must wait for another book to be published.  I always recommend Lee Child for suspense, good stories, lively characters who come to life.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I didnt see this when it came out because of mixed reviews,<br />so I was amazed at how good it was, you can feel the Speilberg magic<br />all over it. J.J. ABRAMS YOU ROCK!
0446699616|5.0|This turned out to be one of my favorite Demille books! I was hooked years ago by The Charm School.  This one grabs you early on and although it's a big book, I couldn't bear to put it down and then was sorry when finished.  It's a good blend of history, culture, mystery, suspense.  Highly recommend!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci has now joined David Rollins and Lee Child with a MP as the protagonist and, like the aforementioned, succeeded in delivering a highly entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable novel. A great, relatable hero supported by interesting characters and a plot with plenty of surprises and twists. Another great read. Highly recommended.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|My husband loves this movie and introduced it to our 5 year old. She and I both love it now. If you have kids or are a kid at heart, it's a must see.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is really awesome, i can see movies from my laptop to TV without any disturbance.  Thanks to Google for such a nice player.
B0089LOG02|5.0|When I start reading a book , I always hope that it will be one of the ones that grabs me from the start , moves me in some special way and stays with me long after I read the last page. This is one of those books.<br />I started it on Thursday night and finished reading on Friday night and I know it will stay with me for a long time .<br /><br />Niamh ( later known as Dorothy and finally Vivian) , is an Irish immigrant whose sad circumstances in her short time in America , make her an orphan at the age of 9 . She becomes part of a program known as the Orphan Train which takes homeless children without families on trains a across the country to find families that will take them in . This sounds wonderful at first until you realize that many of these children were taken in as a source of labor and suffer abuses at the hands of the people who take them in . At the start of the story , Vivian is 91 .<br /><br />Molly is a 17 year old orphan who has had a childhood of suffering and trouble and is living a miserable existence in foster home.<br /><br />Vivian's and Molly's paths cross and the stories of their pasts are unfolded in alternating narratives. The relationship that develops between them is heartwarming . Molly gives Vivian the strength to get back a part of her past that she thought was lost forever . Vivian is able to give to Molly the hope that she can move forward without letting all of her past define who she is .<br />I had no knowledge of the Orphan Train until this book . Thanks to Christina Baker Kline for teaching us about that time in our history .<br />I loved this book . It is heartbreaking at times , but it offers hope as we see the resilience these two people .It is quite possibly one of the best I have read this year .
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Too much eagle league in book...The big mystery was pretty apparent midway thru..DIsappointed ,expected so much more from this writer.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is user friendly and simple to navigate. Even your technology repellent parents could use this stop pro with ease
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I ordered this, software says I have it. But there is no where on my computer that I can find this game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A really interesting read. Learned a lot .Loved the characters and couldn't put it down ! I'd definitely recommend it !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the 3rd season of Downton! It is full of great characters,an incredible storyline and it will totally make you happy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun for horse lovers! I love it! Some prices could be lowered, an hour task should be one gem to finish early not 3
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A+ this app is one of the best one you guys have.... ittook you guys a lil to get it but at less you got it it be nice if you guys could get kik too
B008MVPHPM|5.0|The Wearer -- My Husband<br />His stats -- 6'5 Tall -- size 13 -14 shoe size<br /><br />As a tall guy with big feet, for years we've had problems finding shoes that fit him comfortably or that lasted more than a month or two without falling apart or (and this was a big problem) stinking so bad that we'd just toss them. But that all changed when I took chance based on other people's reviews of Crocs and bought him a pair. He LOVES them and now I can't convince him to try another kind of shoe. As he said, &#34;After 25+ years my feet are finally in heaven&#34;<br /><br />I've tossed fashion aside and purchased him a couple of pairs so far. Not one pair has fallen apart -- but they do wear 'down' (the bottoms) with all day, everyday wear and stink is no longer an issue.  He really (really) loves the Duet clog. He says there's even more cushion and support with this version and they are officially his favorite in his expanding collection of Crocs.<br /><br />Note: his are the yellow/grape and they are BRIGHT. Like neon bright (which he also loves)
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Best book ever! Nicholas sparks is one of my favorite authors!! It has an amazing storyline and it keeps you interested all the damn book
B003B02OOG|4.0|Love anything by John Grisham and only gave four stars because I prefer reading his full length books. Don't let the lack of a five star rating alter your opinion about buying the book ... great author who never writes anything substandard.
B001BANK32|5.0|I'm a long time King fan and have read many of his books. Somehow, I never got around to reading The Shining until now and only did because I'm anxious to read Doc Sleep. I have to say, it's my new favorite!  The characters are so well defined and the creepy factor is at an all time high. I used whisper-sync and part time listened on audible when in the car. There were times I wanted to pull over and double check the back seat! Late night reading in bed led to, being ultra sensitive to every creak or sound during the night.<br /><br />This is classic King where you get the chills from imagining the horror and fright, and not all the extra gore and grotesque that some of his other works have now.  There's plenty of gross but the fright factor outweighs it.  The character development is outstanding. King does his normal brilliant job of painting a vivid picture in the readers mind. One that stays with you long after you've closed the  book for the night.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks at his usual &#34;best&#34;. Haven't read any of his works that I was disappointed in and would highly recommend anything he writes. I cry though many of his books and swear I'm not going to read another one; but as soon as the next one's out I can't wait to read it. There's sadness in many of his works but above all, there's a stronger feeling of real love. Excellent author!
B00E5I2M9K|4.0|Exciting fantasy adventure.  The retelling of norse legend with gods and heros coming to modern day earth.  Great visuals and action.
1452101248|5.0|Pros: A 5-star book, the food is delicious and inventive. The recipes are well-written and easy to follow. Each recipe even includes some background on the origins of the dish and there's a great introduction about the author's motivation to write and cook for a vegetarian audience. Great pictures of each dish.<br /><br />Cons: He uses quite a few rare ingredients; a food processor is a must for many recipes. As a beginning cook, I'm definitely a little out of my league.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Good movie lots of quick action. Very nice.<br /><br />Good guy movie. Well done movie. Enjoyed thoroughly.<br /><br />Scenes in Europe down windy roads chase scenes good.<br /><br />Don't want to give anything away  - just watch it you won't be disappointed if you're a guy.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Josh Groban has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard, and this cd is no exception! Love him &#60;3
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was the best to date. It is a beautiful sensitive look at Afgan culture and recent history. It was hard to put down.
B00000E2WH|4.0|I bought this recording just for the rendition of Valse Triste.  I was not disappointed.  It is beautiful!  Thank you!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Best hunting app I've found. Nice job. Would love to see more regions in update and cheaper upgrades other than that perfect
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so addicting but fun. The only thing I would change is the ability to buy the blue tokens with the gold coins. Otherwise it is great fun.
B000IZXR20|2.0|The whole second half goes way downhill, as soon as you find out who the villain is.  Pretty lame I'd say.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I do not like to have to buy new bubbles all of the time and find this to be quite annoying!  HOpe that a newer version will permit one to have enough bubbles without having to purchase them at the most difficult time!
B0007ODLCS|5.0|7 Studio albums, 1 live album in this collection. Ideal for someone that may be getting into Townes Van Zandt. A good price for what you get.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very entertaining! One of the better hunting games I have played! I would highly recommend this game!
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Fun game.  I love the noises it makes.  The steps you have to take to complete each level are progressively harder and challenging and makes you think of New and better ways to put out fires and cross over things.  I haven't gotten to all the levels yet, but the levels I have passed have been fun playing.  It's a game that makes you smile and have fun.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I loved this movie they know just what to do to make kung fu funny and the slowmo moments are pricless. My favorite funny movie of all time.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a fun game.  It is one of the first games I have gotten on Amazon and I was hesitant at first, thinking it was more of a kids game.  But, it is a lot of fun to play.  Not so easy that you get bored with it and not so hard that you loose interest.  I'm glad I took a chance with it and am looking forward to getting more games from Xendex.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|I preferred the first one.  4 isn't as scary as the previous ones.  The first one was the best, and they have steadily been getting worse!
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Don't waste money purchasing or watching this nonsensical nameless nothingness bit of viewing. Is this what this actor has abased himself for the love of the almighty US buck? This film is enough to make one wonder about the state of mind of the main character. I remain astounded that Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan (loosie goosie in her choices as well) chose to include this disgusting piece of rubbish in thier repertoire of film making. Utterly shameful. So much for that.
B000007R1E|5.0|I love listening to the Moody Blues. I am very pleased this this purchase. I am always watching for their CDS and DVDs.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|All the characters get their moment to show off their best; excellent scripts and subtle comedy and covers every season/holiday
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is a cute movie, and I recommend it to anyone who had small children and want a fun movie that isn't scary.
B001ANYDAO|1.0|At 3.99, I thought I was getting a deal. Not the first time the ny times list has failed me..... I wish I could get my money back. This book states the obvious, which is harmless.  But then the author extrapolates into the realm of ridiculousness. Save your time and your 3.99.....
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|This is a cute movie.  It moves quickly; the music in it is fun and &#34;swinging&#34;. My grandchildren love this movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really can't believe that more people are not playing this game.  It is fun and super addictive. Can't put it down. Bravo for making this game!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellently planned and executed; the revelation of details and scale keeps the reader engaged tightly through a series of violent changes.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|it grabs you from the very beginning. A great book for a book club discussion.  Very well written. I didn't want it to end.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Really good book and movie...would recommend this book...well always be a classic book and a very good series...well BUY IT
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is pretty addictive.  It's a fun little game, not too challenging, and good for passing the time.  It works well on my kindle fire HD.  The only problem I have is it occasionally misfires before I want it to but, although that's a slightly annoying glitch, it's nothing I can't get over.  The graphics are pretty cute too.  The game does include in app purchasing, but I don't find that necessary to progress.  I got this app when it was free, but I think it may be worth the price, especially if you enjoy puzzle type aim-and-shoot games.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Poignant thoughts on how we treat those who live with death. Thank you for making for making your characters smart and sassy.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|I love Sonic The Hedgehog and all of the other charaters to. The game can get difficult when you start, but you can get the uang of it. Recomined this game!
0399255370|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book! You'll smile and laugh and love it each time you read it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Playing wise, great game but I would rather buy this app for let's say $3-5. Why create a game where the players have to dish out money everyday?! Also, I have to buy to proceed to the next level? Sorry Candy Crush Saga up until level 35 you guys had a customer who played daily. Now I will delete this app until I can purchase it without extra buy-ins thrown into my face every time I play.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Thanks for making a great app.  So simple to play but way more challenging than it looks.  Both adults and kids will love to play this.
B007EC27QM|3.0|I love that it's big numbers and that it shows you what you're doing. It shows what you added or subtracted etc..<br /><br />I recommend it!!..
B0089LOG02|5.0|Not only is this an excellent story, it also depicts a very important part of the history of the United States. I recommend this book to everyone, of any age. There are two sides of every case in the foster care program, there are problems with the program but they can be fixed, they need the attention of everyone. I know that in the past that more children were helped than were hurt, I truly hope that that is true today, it could be.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I just watched Taken last night. WOW!! Great plot, Liam at his best and non stop edge of your seat action. Can't wait to see part 2.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|There are challenging levels that require strategic thinking, the levels seem to alternate in difficulty and then somehow still teach you how to beat the more difficult ones.  I like a challenge and this ones worth taking.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The Avengers is a great family movie. There is enough action to keep your attention throughout the film. The acting is good and the storyline appeals to all ages.
B00006YXEK|5.0|When this album was released, I so wanted to get this version, not just for the box but also the DVD. I asked for this for my birthday. I got the smaller version. Was still happy with the quality of the album, the songs and the spirit that this was George's last deliberate contact with our Material World. When I went out to look for this so that I could have the collector's version for my collection, I was sadly disappointed to not be able to find a single copy around! Everyone who bought one, held tightly onto it. I didn't see it used in Music Stores, couldn't find one in a store for pick up. I thought I missed my chance.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon.com, I'm the happy, obsessed fan hoarding my perfect copy!
0761172726|5.0|This is a terrific family calendar, with room for everyone's activities and notes as well.  And fun stickers to go along, and because it is more than 12 months you can get the whole academic year on the same calendar.  It's great.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|I was very happy to be able to enjoy this film in a more controlled environment (Darker and Quiet). Did not get the effect of the film in the theater.<br /><br />I want Hollywood to try their hand more at these Less-is-more-Horror/Suspense Films and less of the Gross-Out/Convulsion-inducing &#34;Horror&#34; that we're getting time and again. Hitchcock needs to stop by this planet one more time.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Stories entertaining the lives of Jews in Eastern Europe prior to the advancement of Hitler have always fascinated me. You find yourself wondering if they had some inkling that something was coming. In the case of Fischer's \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners\\". some of those questions are answered.<br /><br />Greta Weissensteiner, in particular, is charmingly naive. Her love for Wilhelm, a German, is forthright. It takes her father asking her what Wilhelm thinks about her being a Jew for her to even address the thought.<br /><br />Fischer's tale weaves around Greta and Wilhelm's trials and tribulations with their love affair doomed by both time and circumstance. I do not want to spoil the story, but I will say that Fischer has constructed a heck of a story.<br /><br />I'll be looking forward to reading his other books.
B003PIUC02|4.0|I somehow caught this show in glimpses during it's original run. I think I didn't start seeing full episodes until the Gods of the Arena series started showing. The effects are very comic book like but the action and sexiness of the compositions keep my senses occupied. I thought I would hate the graphic use of blood and sex, it was there on schedule but the movement of the plot helped me through this. I was so disappointed to hear of Andy Whitfield's demise, as this happened while I was catching up on the season. Gods of the Arena is good but this one is far better than any of the other seasons.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Expected nothing less from Bill Bryson. Guaranteed to be funny, informative, interesting and written so well. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. He has done some amazing non travel books.
B004GF244K|5.0|Obsessed Dark Horse fan again, I was eager to see this after I was told by Eric Idle to expect this release. The best tribute I have ever seen! The production/audio quality is on-point and the spirit is paralyzing!<br /><br />I was happy to find the Blu-Ray edition. Received it quickly and in great condition.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Season one story line started off a bit slow, it did get better by season 2.  At first i thought the characters were a bit uninteresting especially the role of the husband. The characters improved by season 2.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Coming from an obsessed Beatle/Dark Horse fan, I was expectedly excited to see this film and even more excited to learn that an album and book were slated to be released with the Blu-Ray Collector's Edition. I'm so happy with this, I know George himself would be sublimely touched by the attention to detail both in Martin Scorsese's film and the production quality of the collectible materials. This was lovingly created and executed. Same could be said for the shipping and condition of the package!<br /><br />A resounding thanks!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i loved all three seasons of this show.  It is well made, the characters were well chosen. The actors portrayed their roles excellently and the story line was brilliant.  I cant wait to see season 4.

B007THA4FI|1.0|There was nothing redeaming about trying to read this book.  Life is too short to be filling ones mind with the negativity that made up the bulk of this work.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|Wouldn't load because it didn't get pass my firewall. This is honestly the first time, out of the dozens upon dozens of apps I have downloaded and play, an app has done this.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|This is a great Halloween movie. I had not seen it in a long time and had forgotten alot about it. My 11 year old daughter wanted to watch it. I had forgotten about the F-BOMB that Beetlejuice hurls, just for no reason at all, in it. That is why it does not get 5 stars from me. But, it is rated PG. And my daughter loved the story of the daughter in the movie and she loved the ghost story and the creepy things in it.
B004SUYMPM|5.0|This book will help you deal with procrastination and enlighten you on how to get things done effectively on time.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm one to read a good book in one to two seatings. The first two installments of this trilogy I devoured in a matter of days. Yet, it has been over a week with this book and I have been pushing myself to try to finish it. I really cannot get interested in the characters or the story line that I have invested so much time with.  I'm barely at 70% of the book in my kindle and I feel like when my mother forced me to eat liver, I just can't do it.<br />Other reviewers have stated that readers should save their time and money with this book, I can't help but agree with this statement. To put it in lame terms this book is darn boring.<br />I'm hoping that the book gets better towards the end and that I'm able to change my rating, but it seems highly unlikely.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|can't wait to keep watching. brilliant characters, especially claire danes, she really surprised me with her acting skills. also, the plot is amazing,
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This is a fascinating book and really resonates with me as a person and a teacher.  It has made me rethink how to motivate my students and also my own children.  &#34;Drive&#34; is also well written and an easy read.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|the quality of the picture surprised me. there were no skips, etc. downton abbey is a great series, looking forward to more
B00F35BV64|5.0|I've enjoyed almost everything in the Star Trek franchise over the years, beginning with that five year mission to go where no man has gone before.  It's so easy to suspend reality and go where I have never gone before with Kirk and Spock.  As to this film, the  actors selected fit very comfortably into my notions of a younger version of the characters.  There is the bonus of special effects that are much better than forty years ago.  Triple bonus: Benedict Cumberbatch.  His voice is wonderful, and he can look evil if he sets out to do so.  This is a simple review.  For a couple of hours I was transported away to another place and I enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Compelling series. Brilliant actors, fabulous  location, historical accuracy. Wonderful viewing. Can't wait for series 4, whatever the plot. Great expectations!
1250029465|5.0|I love this cat!  James tells a great story. Can't wait to read more stories.  The British tell great stories!
B009IJJ8UM|5.0|With the movies and the BBC series, how can this show compare. I'll be honest, after seeing the movies and both seasons of the BBC series, I was skeptical this could even come close to being as good. However, I was wrong. This series is fantastic.<br /><br />This rendition of Sherlock is great, and is by far my favorite. You actually start to build an emotional connection with Elementary's Sherlock, which is something that is missing from the movies and the BBC series. Sherlock seems more human than ever, and it all plays out through the relationship with a female Watson. The relationship is no where near sexual, but a platonic friendship that you see blossom throughout the season.<br /><br />My top shows are Dr. Who, Sherlock Holmes (BBC series), Arrow, Burn Notice, White Collar, and Walking Dead. Out of all those shows, Elementary beats them hands down (well maybe not Walking Dead) in my top spot.
B008EL25LE|5.0|This is a highly addictive little game with endless re-play value. It's basically a matching game, but with a variety of challenges. There's a storyline behind the game and each puzzle solved is a step closer to resolving the tale. Having played the first Azkend game, I was really happy to snag this one for free, but it's totally worth buying. A really fun game!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Easy to use and with the large display, the numbers are easy to see.  Would highly recommend this app to to family and friends..
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|This game is harder than it looks. Sure, it looks like a kids game, but it's way more challenging than that. It's a fun way to pass a few minutes, or an hour. Sure am glad it has a &#34;skip&#34; button for the puzzles that defy solving!

B00D48BSBA|3.0|Anyone else other than Forsyth would have got a 4 star from for this book, but the Author has set such high standards earlier that even a slight weakness brings him down from his pedestal, several notches.<br />The book is topical for today and the plot development particular to Forsyth. Obviously he had done his research.<br />His style remains sparing as ever though I believe he seems to have lost his edge somewhat.<br />I read the book through without nodding off, which nowadays I tend to do often.<br />I consider this a benchmark for myself and my personal tribute to the Author.<br />Perhaps he may consider raising his style a little
0316247545|4.0|Was really awesome. Loved almost all of it. I only wish that it had more info about the characters it kinda shorted out on some of the more interesting things but still was a great buy

0765334798|3.0|What you think of this award winning sci-fi novel all depends on what you think, or how you feel, about Star Trek.<br /><br />If you are a fan ( A Fanzie?  A Trekkie?) you may really like this novel.<br /><br />BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU ARE BUYING A \\"SEND UP\\" of a Trekkie story.<br /><br />The \\"Redshirts\\" refers to the droves of red-shirted underlings who died by the dozens on \\"away\\" missions with Kirk, Spock, et al.<br /><br />I am not a Star Trek Fan.  So from the get go, a 'comedy' based on a Trekkie story line does not - and did not here - appeal to me.<br /><br />WHICH WAS MY OWN DAMN FAULT.  If I had remembered....I would not have bought the book.<br /><br />Otherwise, the writing here is rather bare, no good dialogue, no interesting characters or plot twists, not much done with<br />the central premise.<br /><br />The HUGO voters must have been scrounging to place THIS novel in company with DUNE, or LeGuin, or Asimov, or Clark, or Bujold, or Willis.<br /><br />This is ultimately a one joke book not very well told.

This book however, is about precisely that, in that all fourteen of its learned contributors from at least seven different European countries express varying degrees of concern regarding many of the decisions made by the European Court of Justice.<br /><br />In the words of its publishers Edward Elgar, this thought provoking book examines the multi-faceted nature of the quite frequent accusations of judicial activism at the ECJ, focusing on the rationale behind the criticism and the responses to it.<br /><br />The book, they explain, questions the political role of the European Court while also stressing the resulting opportunities for further criticism and analysis, as well as, more importantly, the corresponding responsibilities on the part of knowledgeable observers to jolly well keep on criticizing.<br /><br />The inference here is that no institution, particularly one with such power as that conferred on the European Court, should be above criticism and immune to demands for accountability.<br /><br />Interestingly, one is tempted to add that issues like these are precisely why there is such a groundswell of opinion in the United Kingdom against staying in the European Union.  Increasing power without a corresponding increase in accountability strikes terror, or at least concern, in the heart of the average Brit.<br /><br />As three of the contributors mention in the book's introduction, it seems that criticism of the European Court is now becoming more widespread and increasingly focused `not so much on the outcomes reached by the Court, but on the lack of sustained reasoning leading to those outcomes.'<br /><br />Too much speed, they add, might well reduce efficiency.  They quote Advocate General Sharpston's remark on the ECJ in the Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies, that `in a difficult case, speed may come at the expense of quality.'<br /><br />All of which -- and more -- makes this book very current, very topical and very relevant to academics and researchers (not to mention EU officials), as well as practitioners involved in any way with the European Court.  For those seeking a pan-European perspective on the political role of the European Court of Justice, this book is a useful acquisition.  The publication date is cited as at 2013./>Too much speed, they add, might well reduce efficiency.

It is interesting to be reminded of the profound and wide ranging influence exerted by what has been termed `the Imperial Copyright Act' of 1911 forged and implemented when the British Empire was virtually at its height.  This, as indicated by the introduction, is `Albion's legacy.'<br /><br />Yes, British imperial law has been largely eradicated within nations previously within the empire and now independent, yet the `legacy' still manifests itself in any number of ways, within national laws, as well as various international conventions and agreements, including the recent TRIPS Agreement of 1994 on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.<br /><br />The book, therefore, provides a scholarly overview from at least ten expert contributors from a variety of jurisdictions on the impact and evolution of this pivotal piece of legislation. In addition to their rich array of international qualifications and experience, editors Uma Suthersanen and Ysolde Gendreau are professors of law at, respectively, Queen Mary, University of London and the Universite de Montreal, Canada.  The book's other contributors, both academics and practitioners are variously from such jurisdictions as Australia, India, Israel, Jamaica, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa as well as the UK.<br /><br />`A Shifting Empire' is an appropriate title for this book, as the story of copyright law within the old imperial nations is one of evolution; a continuing movement in the direction of legal systems which ultimately are designed to meet each individual nation's individual needs.<br /><br />`Despite the fact that all the stories within this volume represent a different legal evolution,' say the editors, `it is still possible to say that they are all a part of the British copyright legal family.'<br /><br />An interesting example is cited in Ysolde Gendreau's essay on Canadian copyright law in which she remarks that `the Imperial Copyright Act actually heralded Canada's copyright emancipation'.  Indeed, she raises the possibility that the foundations for copyright sovereignty were laid with the British North America Act of 1867, the constitutional basis for the then new nation.  Unsurprisingly the first Canadian Copyright Act was enacted in 1868.<br /><br />This book is a valuable and certainly topical contribution to the world story of copyright law, which has evolved almost alongside developments in worldwide commerce, creativity and trade. For researchers as well as practitioners and all interested in copyright, the careful footnoting is prodigious and there is a handy index to aids navigation.

B00EA8UEZ4|3.0|I'm very undecided about this book. Having now read (and re-read) all three of Gary's books I would say the first (Disappearance of the Universe) was by far the best - I really enjoyed it. But the second and third were less interesting. As in the second book, Gary continues to describe how hard done by he is. I assume he was providing reasons why this book was so late in arriving. And perhaps that is why I was less than thrilled with the results - expectations that kept getting higher as time went on - waiting, waiting, waiting. One point that I still haven't accepted has to do with certain buildings in NYC - I'll let you read the book.<br />But then there is a positive side. In this book Gary continues to describe how we make choices and how forgiveness works. That is really what his books are all about and he does that part well.
0857932780|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moPQBTL7N7MQ2T]]<br /><br />A CONTROVERSIAL VIEW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This book delivers with gusto a radical and critical new look at patents and patent policy and is nothing if not challenging, both for practitioners involved in patent law and for the general reader, not to mention all the inventors out there seeking to patent their inventions.<br /><br />But how inventive does an inventor's invention have to be to be eligible for a patent?  This is only one of the questions posed by author Hazel V. Moir, a well known patent expert who takes vociferous exception to the granting of patents to products and business processes that may not be all that inventive<br /><br />The motivation behind procuring some, or indeed a lot of patents seems to be monopolistic; the desire to restrict others and other businesses from pouncing on and exploiting an innovative idea - which may not be all that innovative - and profiting from it.<br /><br />`Patents are a fascinating example of how well-meaning economic policy can go wrong,' insists the author and when one reads the overwhelming weight of evidence she puts forward to support this view, one is inclined to agree.  Patent policy is economic policy', she adds, basically asking whether the costs of preventing innovation in rival firms and raising prices will ultimately be justified by the resulting benefits, depending on what those benefits are of course.<br /><br />The process of analysing all this and related questions is indeed a challenge which the author certainly tackles head on, demolishing any number of pre-conceived notions about patents, patent law and inventiveness along the way.<br /><br />The result is a particularly intriguing read for anyone involved professionally in patent law and its economic implications and consequences.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great, but I had difficult with the setup on the computer. Had to do the initial setup on the Iphone in the end. Windows 7 would not connect till I set up on the Iphone. I also had to connect to Chromecast WiFi first to get it to setup and connect with the program. Instructions don't tell you that. In the end once programmed and set up it worked fine.

0143039431|5.0|The novel I had recently, The Grapes of Wrath, talks about the story of Tom Joad and several meaningful short stories. In the times of the book that they have Tom Joad, it would describe the misfortune the Joad family would encounter after the release of their family member Tom Joad after being imprisoned for four years and for good behavior was released early and placed on parole. One their new difficulties was the tragic death Ol' Joad, the family's grandpa, this had a terrible toll on the family's will to survive and the luck. As I read through the I had noticed that this family was not the only ones being targeted by the government if one was to look back at into history the government had taken away land that had belonged to many hard working citizens. This event made me feel like it was a wrong for such a thing to happen because it had caused many Americans to migrate to California without any idea whether or not there would be a sign of hope for them in having a normal life again. Overall I give this book five stars since it goes into great details in realism. I especially loved the ending of the novel, however I'm not going to be a spoiler and tell you. That is something you have to read to find out. In the end I would recommend this novel to peers that are hungry for the twisted truth about history and how it had effect the lives of others.

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I have been a Backstreet Boys fan since I was a child.  This album is a more mature sound from older albums.  Great songs from my favorite group.  It is a little less &#34;pop&#34; than older albums with a slower sound than before.  However, I LOVE this album.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Sometimes, less is more. This movie is really good, and it's because they didn't try to go over the top with the action AND dialogue AND hollywood-over-sexiness. The movie sure has action, but not in a Michael Bay, so much action it's boring kind of way. The dialogue is simple, and it works, because Dredd has something deeper to his personality, and Urban does a great job maintaining a mystique. Thirlby is a foxxx by the way. Ya, three x's.

B0002KQNJU|1.0|This low rating is for ONLY what we believe to be the misleading language calling the special feature a \\"making-of featurette.\\" Entitled \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers: Vampires 101,\\" this is a 1967 short directed by Michael Mindlin Jr., with the role of a British professor acted by Max Wall. There are scenes of \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers: or Pardon Me, But Your Teeth are in My Neck,\\" but you will not learn anything additional about Mr. Polanski's film or its cast and crew.

1451666179|5.0|As soon as a friend of mine turned me on to Allie's blog a few years ago I read the entire thing in one gluttonous binge of a sitting. When I was done I could hardly breathe as my diaphram was sore from laughing and hardly see through my burning, tear filled eyes. This book includes everything I loved about that first encounter with Hyperbole and a half along with some scrumptious new material. I see some complaints about some of the stories in the book having already been published on her blog, but really, how could you NOT include \\"God of Cake\\" or \\"Simple Dog\\"? How else will I get old people to read her stories if they weren't in print? If I could give her 6 stars I would.

Works pretty well on my kindle fire HD, now I saw com's on here about not working good on a kindle fire that it crashes sometimes but Fire HD it's fine on mine. Few things need to be fix like the leaderbored button and objectives that doesn't work but u see them after u do a mission. Not the but.... It would be a 5 star game till I got on the menu screen a update, now didn't up it yet maybe the two buttons are fix Idk but my prob is that there's 3 at least more permissions that ant cool at all .These apps devs don't need all our info on a paid app at that. But besides that the game it self rocks.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best novels John Grisham has written; as someone who grew up in Montgomery, AL, during the 1960's and vowed never to return after witnessing the same tired, brutal racial intolerance from so many of my childhood friends once we reached adulthood. Beautifully written, slap-you-in-the-face accurate descriptions of Deep South communities both in times past and present times(1980's), I found this novel to be both heartbreaking and full of love and contrition. A must read, in my opinion.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|it is addictive once you get the hang of it. great animation<br />not like the real thing but then again when will I get an opportunity to hunt this type of game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive that I could play it all day. I am so glad that it is finally on Kindle Fire. I just wish  new &quot;lives&quot;&quot; came through quicker. It is pretty odd that we only get max 5 at a shot..

B008JFUNJQ|4.0|I'm a big reader of science fiction, and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series is probably my favorite. The only things that come close are Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. I've read Ender's Game more than 10 times, including two or three occasions on which I finished it in a single sitting. One of my college papers is based on the novel and is published on Card's website.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a fan.<br /><br />So, as you can imagine, I have been looking forward to an Ender's Game movie long before I ever thought it might happen. For me, it had the potential to be the best science fiction movie ever made, if done well. After assembling a strong cast, my expectations could not have been higher as I sat down to watch the IMAX version today.<br /><br />The basic premise is that an alien race, known as the Formics or Buggers, invaded Earth fifty years ago. The invading fleet was defeated, but another attack is expected. In order to be ready to face a species that learns from its mistakes, the International Fleet has come up with a strategy: A program was established to observe the behavior of young children, hoping that the best young geniuses of the time would be able to become the top military strategists by the time they were needed. Ender Wiggin was chosen as one of the trainees.<br /><br />The movie deviates considerably from the book, but it's necessary. I am not here to tell you why the book is better, I'm here to tell you whether Ender's Game works as a movie. However, I must explain some of the key differences. In the book, Ender begins his training at the age of six, while all of the trainees in the movie appear to be 15 or older. I understand that it would be impossible to find dozens of 6-year-old actors capable of carrying this story. Also, the sequence of events is different. Bean, who is a key character, meets Ender immediately, rather than a few years into his training. Ender's training is supposed to take around eight years, but it seems to happen in months.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of the movie is the way the battle training is condensed. Again, I realize that few people would want to watch four hours of training, but some of the suspense is missing because so little time is devoted to key events. Some events in the book seem unfair to Ender, but without the background information, anyone who hasn't read the book will miss the significance. Whenever I read Ender's Game, I become Ender Wiggin and experience the satisfaction of his achievements. I'm glad to say that I experienced similar feelings during the movie.<br /><br />IMDB claims that the movie is an action movie, but that's not the case. Don't go into this expecting battle sequences or laser fights. They do exist, but not in the form you might expect. I am actually impressed that Hollywood didn't ruin the movie by trying to include too much action.<br /><br />Ender's Game is essentially about leadership, and why individuals choose to follow certain people. Everyone in the school is a genius, but Ender is a good leader because he gains the trust, loyalty, and even love of his followers. The book is full of tactics, and we see Ender and his army discover and develop skills over the course of several years. The armies are comprised of 40 soldiers who are typically split into four Toons of 10 soldiers during battle. I doubt a casual viewer will come away from this movie even knowing what a Toon is. We certainly aren't shown how Ender's Dragon Army uses tactics that are completely new. On the plus side, the ending could not have been better, and I was excited to see an important scene present and handled well.<br /><br />So, does this movie work at all?<br /><br />As someone who knows all of the background to Ender's story, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it come alive on the big screen. The acting was good and the special effects spectacular, although my Kiwi friend reliably informs me that Ben Kingsley butchered the accent. Most of the key events in the book are touched upon, and a fan of the series will automatically catch the references and fill in the blanks. A complete newcomer to the story will probably have a good time, but come away wondering why Ender's Game is often regarded as the best science fiction book ever written.<br /><br />I hope that the movie will be successful enough to spawn a sequel. Speaker for the Dead is a much deeper story, and shows what happens to Ender after the war. However, with some people boycotting the movie due to their dislike of Card's politics, I'm not sure whether a sequel will be possible.<br /><br />I'll be adding Ender's Game to my collection as soon as it is released on Blu-ray, but it would be wrong of me to automatically give it 5/5 just because I love the books. That said, it's a good attempt to make a coherent story out of very difficult material. It's hard to show people thinking. If you do like the movie and haven't read the book, I urge you to do so. I imagine it would considerably enhance any future viewings.<br /><br />By the way, the trailer gives away almost everything..

B00873GRU4|5.0|This book was well written. After reading he first 2 chapters, I was happy to keep reading. Now I'm off to buy the next book!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|From what i can tell it works good for a lot of people. It is either going to connect to your router or not. If it doesn't it isn't going to. Just my opinion after reading Google forums. I have a Windstream router. May be 5 stars for some but i give it 1 because it would't work for me.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm glad I stuck with this book. It was much more than I first thought it would be. lovely story.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Before starting any book, it's pretty disheartening when all you hear are bad reviews--two stars here, one star there, and words like \\"disappointing\\" \\"boring\\" and \\"awful.\\" The first thing I thought was, oh no, there was a terrible twist! Maybe the loose ends don't quite meet up? Perhaps it's a cliffhanger? No matter how many times someone says \\"Don't waste your time,\\" you're going to read the book, and that's exactly what I did. After finally finishing, I disagree with a majority of the reviews.<br /><br />-SPOILER ALERT-<br /><br />I'd like to address some of the major points of the novel that seemed to have caused the most distress to readers.  After reading pages worth of rants (and no raves), I've come to believe it is the fact that Tris dies that has really riled everyone up. Which left me asking myself, how could she not die? How this upsetting to people? I thought it made perfect sense, and it was a brilliant move on Veronica Roth's part. Tris was so careless throughout the series, to the point that I was waiting for some tragic moment. She made stupid decision time and time again.  She gave herself for the cause, and I think that's more than any character can ask for in a dystopian novel. It is unfair to hate a book because it doesn't have the Hollywood happy ended you wanted. Did it move you? Were you saddened by Tris' passing? That, right there, is good story telling.<br /><br />A few other things...<br /><br />The fact that the Tobias/Tris chapters had no tonal or stylistic distinction was not really off putting to me. Perhaps people are forgetting that they're reading a book categorized as \\"Young Adult.\\" None of the novels are superbly written, but I think that stems from the fact that this series is story-driven and not character or style driven. Veronica Roth's point was to tell a story about a place and time, with an emphasis on love and forgiveness--you're not reading the novel for its flowery language.<br /><br />Also, on the note of characters, thefact that Caleb lives, Peter isn't absolutely terrible, and Evelyn becomes a loving mother, aren't deal breakers for me. The way I see it, the environment in which these characters exist influenced their actions. When their environment changed, it was a gateway to revelations for these characters. Pointing out improbable sequences of events with serums, governments and explosions seems kind of like nonsense, especially in this type of story. If something plagued you that badly, just think, \\"there's a serum somewhere for that.\\"<br /><br />The last thing I can say is give it chance, because you've already come this far in the series.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Great Christmas Album.  Michael Buble does not disappoint.  Something a little different from the usual Seasonal album.  I highly recommend it!
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|You might think its the same old story of brotherly love but think again excellent casting and nolte is great ..
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I love this game. It's great if you already play KSP and want to have something similar to take with you on the go.
B001BANK32|5.0|If anything it was more scary.  I read it during the Halloween season, and it was the perfect read.  I love King - I don't love all his books, but this was one of his finest.  Highly recommended.  If you saw the movie, like I did, you might find yourself transposing the movie characters into the book as you read it.  I did that, couldn't help it, and it seemed to work ok.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|&#34;Super 8&#34; is a charming movie about people in their early to mid teens making super 8 movies way back in the 80's.  It's also a suspenseful movie about about a very big and violent extraterrestrial with legitimate grievances against the human race.  Somehow, the movie blends these two threads seamlessly together.  The young people who play the leads are excellent actors.  'Super 8' is probably the best teens & alien movie ever made.  Don't forget to watch the credits all the way through.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is a compelling read, equalling 'The Kite Runner' & 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' in its intensity. The story of a brother and sister whose lives are torn apart as children and the heart rending consequences. I have just finished this book. I thought it wonderfully written, meandering, as it does, back and forth through time.

006202406X|1.0|This book is a huge disappointment, after the 1st 2 books were so engaging. Simply put, it's a mess. Veronica Roth said in an interview with MTV that she didn't outline or plan this series ahead of time at all. She made up her world and plot lines as she went along, and had no idea what was outside the city, what being divergent really was, or where the series was headed until she wrote Allegiant. The lack of planning finally caught up with her in this book. Characters and subplots are introduced randomly, then unceremoniously dropped before they are fleshed out, or even particularly relevant (Nita and the fringe, for example). Characters from previous books act so out of character that it's jarring at times, especially Evelyn and Tobias. Tobias in particular becomes a completely different person for a portion of the book, then is suddenly himself again when it suits Roth's purpose. Evelyn goes from ruthless dictator to mommy of the year in the blink of an eye, just so that VR can resolve the faction war quickly. It's as if she decided that she wanted to write an epic book, with a powerful ending, and then threw in every potential situation she could think of at random. She clearly feels that the only way to have a powerful ending is Tris's death, but Tris's motivations don't align with the point Roth says she's trying to make. Tris, who has been the moral compass of the series, and who felt so guilty about Will's death that she couldn't even hold a gun for all of insurgent, is okay with wiping the memories of everyone in the compound, even the relatively innocent bystanders who don't fully understand what's happening, and the GD staff who have no power in the situation at all, and killing whoever gets in her way? It's not truly selfless to sacrifice the people you don't like in favor of the ones you do. The story would have been much more interesting if it had stayed focussed on the city, and showed how the various groups worked out a truce and a compromise government and lifestyle. Instead, we got a meaningless death and a simplistic, unsatisfying ending. Killing off the heroine in a futuristic dystopia can be done while still having a satisfying, earned, but not happy, ending. For an example, check out Feed, by MT Anderson.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|WHAT THE HECK VERONICA ROTH!!!! JK Rowling needs to call our dear friend VR and tell her how to write final installment.<br /><br />First off....Tobias was my book crush...I no longer have a crush on the Tobias that was in Alligant. Don't make this mysterious, strong hunk of a man sound like a weenier. Keep the Tobias we all new and loved going, don't make him so weak on the inside. He became uninteresting and he started to sound like Tris. Now I KNOW my boyfriend and I do not have the same thought process or ways of speaking, you'd know who was thinking what immediately. If she had not written who was speaking at the beginning of the chapters I would have no idea. There were no distinctions and I'm pretty sure that there were several distinction between tobias and tris in the first two novels.<br /><br />Second...THERE WAS NO NEED TO KILL OFF TRIS!!! Especially by DAVID!!!! he wasn't even a good villain!! He wasn't worthy to kill of the hero! Tris escaped everything that happened in \\"Chicago\\" AND a death serum but David is the one that manages to kill her off?? It was SO unnecessary!! Nice try at shock value VR but I no longer respect you as an author.<br /><br />Third...How confusing was all the GD and GP crap? I sat through half the book confused. It sounded thrown together and so not thought out. VR has shown that she is an amazing writer that can create interesting story lines but this book was hardly interesting.<br /><br />Fouth...So they can shut down an entire city with memory serum and death serum and have serums to create complete hallucinations but they haven't created something to CURE a COMA! Really Uriah died from a coma? In the least heroic way possible!!<br /><br />Fifth...The overall book seemed random, not thought out and who kills off main characters for no reason. If you have a movie deal where people are going to connect with Tris through the big screen and the novel why would you crush their hopes? We see enough death everyday in the real world that we don't need to see it from our heroes in our imagination. Viewers and readers are going to HATE the third movie. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Borrow this book from someone or download it, but don't spend your hard earned cash on this book!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|The book starts off slowly, and you wonder what you could be in for, but as the story unfolds, it has you smiling and captured and wanting to find out how it concludes.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Wonderful film, Nicholson most assuredly owns his role in this film like no other. I only gave four stars instead of five because the captions are about a minute to fast which makes them both distracting and effectively unusable.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I used the 30-pin one and once I upgraded to the 5S I knew I had to pick this up too. This is one of the sturdiest, most durable car chargers I have ever used. The flat head on the side that goes into the cigarette lighter allows me to plug it into the armrest and still close it. The cord is coiled and doesn't lose its shape. I can charge any device with a lightning port in the car and rather quickly too. I highly recommend this charger.

B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I was a bit worried about buying an Intel Nuc without an i3 cpu but decided to go with a celeron cpu since it was much more affordable. I am happy to say the unit has more than enough power to be used as a HTPC running openelec. Note, it does not come with ram, flash drive, and wireless card. They can all be purchased serparely. This intel NUC can run videos coded in H.264, mp4 format, avi format, mpeg, etc. The only thing that has given me trouble is videos with AC3 video. I think this is a limitation of Openelec and not the device. I would recommend for the smallest HTPC that you can buy. It also produces almost virtually no sound

B004RJMUJO|5.0|Great fun for the whole family! My daughters can't put it down. Fun for all ages. Great for the kids on those long road trips.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Despite some of the bad reviews, this movie is good enough for a second or third watch.  One, to have a better understanding of the plot. You need to listen to everthing that Jack (Cruise) narrates to understand what happens at the end and why everything is not what it seems.  Two, the plot is good, it is original story with some likeness to other scifi with similar apocalytic last person or people on Earth plot.  However, I had not seen this story repeated in another movie.  You don't have to be a sci-fi or Tom cruise fan to like this one. What I do like about this movie is that its not about the origins of man like other sci-fi movies of the past decade. Oh, Morgan Freeman, enough said.  :-)
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved this book. Gilbert's ability to capture the imagination if memorable and remarkable.  A truly fine read for all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hook line and sinker. Be prepared to lose your mind playing this.  The more you play the harder it is to put down!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Life in Pakistan told thru the experiences of a child. I would put this one up there next to The Diary of Anne Frank. A must read for every girl and boy growing up in 2013...
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|Waste of my time...very poorly written...amateur skills at best .....not sure why this book was ever published..the dialogue was 'cheesy' which ruined a potentially good plot...wish I could give it less than one star
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was good, but not as good as some of the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid were like Rodrick Rules is.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|Good movie overall. Just remember there is not a lot of talking so it's not so entertaining for older kids, my 1 year old loved it because of everything else going on.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was awesome. The characters are so alive and the story flows perfectly. Rick Riordan weaves a tale of teamwork and strength. This series is UTTERLY fantastic and i wish it never had to end.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I love disney movies. My son is 1 and he loved watching all the monsters. Great movie for the whole family.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I thought I'd give it a go. I ended up reading this in just over a day, I could not put it down. It is so well written and leaves you on the edge wondering how it will end and I can say I did not see the ending coming!! This is a must read!
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|Great movie for kids. I loved it! It is also great for the parents. Movie is very cute for all ages.
B004YD1KTO|5.0|This is the second novel I have read written by Rosamund Lupton and I can honestly say I have been left wanting to read more of what she has written. The whole way through the book it leaves you with little leads to the ending but once again the ending is not really what you would expect. I am definitely a big fan of this author!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Very cute movie. Has a great story for everyone to understand and the kids will love it very very much.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|You get exactly what you should expect. What I like, you don't have to spend time on a backstory, which is what seems to bog down most super hero movies.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|Awesome! Everything I hoped for. Too bad there are no more seasons :( it was a great series that needs to continue
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It is a great replacement for Swype and even corrects words that are typed in.  Like how it remembers words that you use more often. Definitely would recommend to friends
0857685848|5.0|Great for grandson [12] who wants to be a paleontologist.  He also is very artistic so this book supports both of his interests.  Of course, GREAT ILLUSTRATIONS.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I haven't been playing for long and they ask me to rate Candy Crush Saga ...okkkkkk.  I don't think I've gotten to the Saga part yet.  I'm on level 12 and I'm taking my time.  Basically it's like other game apps I've used.  Repetitive.  I don't see why people believe it is addictive, though I don't usually spend much time gaming.  It is fairly fun to play and I feel it gives my eye sockets a good work-out after staring at a screen only reading words and such.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's basically for me to watch Netflix on my TV<br />If i Could stream TV shows from the networks it would be great........
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  Have it  on my phone, tablet, PC and Kindle.  When I run out of lives on one device, I go to the next.
B00E9P957Q|4.0|I won't review the music as anyone who knows Rush knows exactly what they are getting with these albums, and the opinion of the Rush fan will vary wildly.  I personally love every era of Rush for very different reasons, and these albums all have their musical and lyrical peaks.<br />What I will review is the packaging and quality of the set.<br />Going into this purchase it was very unclear whether these would be remastered, until the final word came that they were indeed remastered.  I can confirm this - and the remasters do exactly what they say they will do - make these albums a little more mp3 player friendly.  They don't sound radically different from the previously remastered CDs, but they have a slightly different sound stage and some definite areas that are cleaner.  I won't review the differences in each and every album, as they are pretty subtle to my ears, but overall listening in the car on an mp3 player does sound better in a side by side comparison does sound better to the original releases.<br />Worth mentioning is the Vapor Trails Remixed album, which others have given exhaustive reviews to.  It is a much different, more accessible recording now and can now be enjoyed fully than the original.<br />The packaging of this set falls a bit short, but this is understandable because of the price of the set.  The album covers are faithfully reproduced as miniature album jackets.  However, the liner notes are condensed into a single nondescript booklet without and frills - just lyrics and credits - no stories, amusing anecdotes, Jack Black tributes, etc.<br />All in all a very good set at an excellent price with a bonus of being remastered and sounding better in the car.  Your mileage may vary.<br />I'd have given it five stars if the album liner notes were intact and they'd have given sleeves to the discs rather than just the cardboard sleeves, but overall it's worth the money for the casual and hardcore Rush fan alike.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I've been hooked on this Series basically to see what was going to happen to them next and what adversities they were going to face in their Survival..
159463176X|5.0|Even having read his former two works, Mr. Hosseini is still able to amaze me and cause me to be emotionally moved by his writing. As cliche' as it sounds, he truly paints a picture in your mind with his words. He tells the characters' stories in a way that causes you to sympathize with their decisions in a way you would never have believed before reading them in Mr. Hosseini's words. His writing has always had a magical way of transporting you back and forth in time, bringing you on a journey that in the end gives you a full picture. In this novel, the story is complex - more characters, more intricate than his previous novels - but not in a way that if off-putting. It reminds me off a piece of fine lace that someone has woven. It takes time and patience but is still enjoyable along the way and the end result is beautiful and worth it.<br /><br />I also want to mention that no culture is as in need of Mr. Hosseini's (or any accomplished writer's) beautiful words as the culture in which he bases his stories. Afghanistan is viewed unkindly in today's world, to put it mildly. Through his writing, however, we can understand that it once was a thriving land with people not that different from ourselves. I wish more people would read Mr. Hosseini's books and see the country differently than the way it is portrayed in movies and the media today.
B001NOVSQW|5.0|The Cast of Characters was Excellent and the Efforts the Allies went through to capture it were literally breathtaking. The importance of the Enigma Code machine was paramount to the Americans breaking the U-Boats Code.
B000V4NX04|5.0|You are surprised at every step. The metamorphosis of one of the main characters is the heart of the story, which is rich, interesting and always surprising.  This is one of my favorite movies. I really has a message,  a human message.
B00DM0UTPQ|4.0|I wasn't sure of what it would be like so I watched the Trailer and Liked it enough to watch it...Good Story and Cast of Characters...
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I bought this item as a gift for my boyfriend.  He loves it and watches it daily.  It looks brand new even though it was used when I bought it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game and my son does too. we have side by side competitions with my kindle fire and his ipod.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't normally play games but this is mindlessly addictive.  I take my kindle everywhere with me so if I have to wait I can play
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Great actors! It was basically MIB with different actors but I am very glad I rented it and love using Amazon instant video!
0920668372|5.0|I received this book from my daughter several years ago and loved the msg. so much I decided it was a book I could share with my niece when she had her first child.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|This was another great movie. I never was really into comic books but when they started coming out with all the new releases they really made it fun! Robert Downey Jr is amazing as always with his cocky attitude and good looks.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love lps i buy the toys too!And when I saw the new lps I decapitated them (THEY ARE DEMONSSS) . I know the cover has the new ones from the show but when I played it its way too fun to hate. lesson learned: Dont judge an app by its cover.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love that they are doing these movies. I love having the ability to just watch this on my smart TV using Amazon instant video!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|For a man of my generation (60 years young) raised in a strict Catholic environment, it was quite interesting to learn all those facts like that Jesus had many siblings for instance  or the Bible was an oral tradition until about a 100  years later when some people using some apostles name started to write a new and improved story about Jesus. The guy was crucified because he was considered like a trouble maker like many others Jews of the last century of the Roman presence in the area. So we were told a story while History is very different when it comes with facts. Very interesting how the story was built to suit the time and the people so the Roman Catholic church was able to create a myth, a legend about an uneducated Jew, that was considered as a pariah by his peers that became the saviour of of our souls. Kudos to the church, it is still the best story ever told. And the author is from a muslim family, it doesn't get any better. Buy it and pass it on.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|You will not be disappointed.<br />There is no lack of intrigue and debauchery, with a strong sacrilegious overtone.<br />What could be better to view it, while you sip on wine on a tousled bed with your favorite companion:)<br />So sad is over, can we bring it back?
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|great old movie from the 1990's 2 watch over and over and over again along with kids 2 watch with.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Emma is always endearing, the young lady played her roll very nicely.<br />A high quality production and a bit of a vacation for the senses.<br />Fun and amusing story as always.
B00CTNUMPO|5.0|great kids program to watch about 2 dogs falling in love and the cats 2 fout the kids to enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I give it 5 stars and its very addictive but you should give more tries after you loose. But I recommend anyone who loves games like this to play it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was very excited to read this installment because I really enjoyed the first 2.  I couldn't follow the two-person perspective and the ending was completely depressing and ridiculous.<br /><br />Don't bother with this one, just make up your chosen ending and skip reading this book altogether.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|While the game itself is fun, I find the constant nagging to buy more &quot;boosters, lives etc&quot; a disruptive annoyance.<br />But what is especially aggravating is being stuck on level 28 for days because the game is rigged so that it`s nearly impossible to clear the level unless you purchase boosters or annoy your facebook friends with continual requests for more lives. Also, when your 5 lives are lost , the game kicks you off for a minimum of half an hour until you regain 1 life and 2 and 1/2 hours to regain all five lives.<br />All in all, Bejeweled is a much better game with the same exact gameplay and none of the annoying Candy Crush garbage.
0143123173|3.0|Good example of the progression a writer can make over time<br />As a first book the bones are showing and that's okay<br />Enjoy the series<br />If you can't read watch the television series
B006ICOK00|1.0|The camera is clever in concept, but completely terrible in execution. You can never really tell if it's recording or not. This is a serious problem when you actually want to record something. Don't buy it.
B0084670FU|1.0|There is a very unnecessary and extremely inappropriate scene very early in the movie. We turned it off and won't attempt to watch it ever again.
141970642X|5.0|my kid love it and read the book as soon as he got his hand on it. thanks a lot
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Typical Zombie movie reminded me of Will Smith in I am Legend.  Story line was obvious most of the movie regarding what was going to happen; ending was good.
1451666179|5.0|Got the book yesterday - and was so excited to open and read - gosh what a surprise when I flipped open the first page!  Full color - great drawings - just like her awesome website.  I wondered how they would do - translating a vibrant and exciting site to a paperback and they have done a super job.  I would have happily paid more.....<br /><br />I am only allowing myself to read a few stories a day so I can make it last - so far GREAT!  A few old stories from the web and some great new stuff mixed in.<br /><br />Everyone should enjoy the drawings, stories and meaning behind each tale.....thanks Allie, thank you publishing company for keeping Allie, Allie.<br /><br />Guess what my loved ones will be getting for Xmas!
B00AQNOCZ0|1.0|I returned this item because it is not the US Release version.  I'm sure it would have worked just fine - but it's not what I wanted to order.  The title of at least the first movie is different, the ratings are different.  It's the same movie I know, but I wasn't going to risk $50 and have it not play in my Blu-Ray player.  Returned and bought the US version for $8 more.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|One less thing to pack when traveling or on vacation. Has all creatures of a good alarm clock that plays you music. I use this as my regular alarm clock. To keep the headboard clutter free.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. I play mostly waiting to pick my son up at school and watching t.v.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am not sure how long I will continue to play. Level 275 is too hard.  The bombs only have 3 moves before they explode. They are uncovered easily.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|&#34;Get information about the currently or recently running tasks: a thumbnail representation of the tasks, what activities are running in it, etc<br />ccom.android.vending.BILLING<br />Access coarse (e.g., Cell-ID, Wi-Fi) location<br />Access the list of accounts in the Accounts Service&#34;<br /><br />Spyware is spyware and does not belong in a game/app that the seller is charging the end user a fee to own. I can somewhat understand greedy programmers putting sypware in free games, but once you start charging a fee for a game/app, all spyware should be removed. Ratings will suffer for those greedy programmers who insist on putting sypware in paid games/apps. Fair warning!!!<br /><br />Another problem is the BILLING permision, which does not belong in a paid for game/app. When a programmer charges for a game/app, the buyer would expect that it is complete, not missing parts which would require additional payments.
B003FAJTOA|5.0|I don't mind subtitles in movies, as I've seen some amazing foreign language films (i.e.The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). The sceneries and vistas shown take you back to ancient Japan, and you feel the emotion, frustration and torment that comes with power, war and family. Starts out quickly giving you insight to the passing of the torch from an elder dictator, to his distrusting and often weak sons. This movie also shows you the lesser characters that have their own agenda and scheme deviously to get what they want, as well as the outright bold ruthlessness that often shape warring cultures. Great film.
B009NY43NY|1.0|She should have killed Sookie off instead of just giving her to SAM. I beleive not much thought has went into this book regarding the plot or characters. Feels like Charlaine didn't  care if the readers enjoyied this book as long as it was completed and she got paid. I have been reading about Sookie since 2001 and am disappointed in this book regarding Sookie just going to SAM.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|This is a great family film that tells kids the Peter Pan story through the eyes of grown ups, and dares them to suspend their disbelief in the story and the existence of Never Never Land and the like. Cleverly woven into a modern story, the plot gently pushes you into recalling the characters and fear that is evoked by Captain Hook and his pirate hoard, as well as the magic of Tinkerbell played wonderfully and at times, very funny, by Julia Roberts. I love the suspense built up before introducing the sinister and melancholy Hook, and his man Friday Smee. But you really get behind Peter and the lost boys as they're made very human by the way the orphan background is connected to their lives and the story. Great movie to remind all of us grown ups, that childhood is brief, and we should always keep a our own inner child near the surface.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|i got this for my 10 year old grandson and he has played with it non-stop ever since.  it even took over minecraft, which is saying alot.  not one for reading directions or help tips, he has had a great time with it by just pulling it up and going at it.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you were born in the 60's or 70's, you will enjoy this more, although bands from the 80's and 90's are prominently featured as well. This film starts out being about a particular recording studio, but quickly turns into the story of some bands formation, some artists early careers and the new life rock groups brought to the people who depended on the success of their recordings. I love movies that offer insight into the people and personalities of a special time or place and this film does a wonderful job of showing you how luck and circumstance sometimes create a magic that's hard to define. I think Dave Grohl is an amazing talent and personality. Very contemporary but with an appreciation of music's history and artists that have entertained us for so many years. This is a warm, personal retelling of some historic, famous and private moments in modern music. If you are a music nerd, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM!! I LOVED IT!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I first met the group, Alabama Shakes during an appearance on TV. The music and Brittany's delivery is gritty, sometimes dark, but so different than other groups. I'm not sure exactly how I would classify it re: genre. There are definitely rock/folk;/soul overtones and sometimes just crazy, fun, loud noise.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|The planet Vulcan was not blown to bits.  It was there for Star Trek; the original.  Too much special effects these days.  Where are good old movies like Sleepless in Seattle?  Being an old Star Trek fan, I was hoping to check out the new Darkness one and, ended up with this one that I had already seen.  My mistake.  I still hate the movie.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wild by Cheryl Strayed was chosen by a member of my book club group and I am so glad she did! My mother died 20 years ago and so much of Wild resonated with me about the mother/daughter relationship. Cheryl's naïve approach to the trek (doing a lot of research, but almost no training) astonished me. Her grit and courage in meeting obstacles is an object lesson for life. The language in the book was enchanting.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I chose 5 stars because of the story, moves along and is very interesting about the future of war. I would recommend this book to anyone 12 or older.
0312383320|5.0|How could you not love Stephanie Plum and her zany crew? I also have the other books in this line. Plum Lovin' and Lucky. You can't go wrong with Janet Evanovich.<br /><br />  In God we trust.<br />  Pat
B009WUBERW|3.0|Explosions, excitement, guns, blood and all done with the A-team of ass-kickers from the 80's, 90's and 2000's!  Acting isn't going to win any awards, but if you watch this, you kind of suspect that already!
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I've already heard most of these songs live, but honestly I've had this album since the first day it came out and I still blast it in my car everyday. AMAZING!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is free and soo worth it. It does exactly what it's meant to do simply, quickly, and without ad's. The only thing I wish it did extra would be to kill the apps that run in the background too. But hey like they say there's an app for that too ;-)
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|My son loves this game! Good music, good animation and great colore. Please, insert more levels and more weapons or different controls.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The third book was weak compared to the first two stories.  Struggled to follow how the characters rationalized their actions and many actions did not seem to align with their values mentioned a couple chapters earlier in the same story.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|classic movie awesome pinball game  very easy to play and looks and sounds great<br />i would recommend this game to all fans of both star wars and pinball
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing in the evenings to relax.  It can be frustrating though with delays in response time. Possibly/probably due to connection speed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love this author.  It gives us such insights through story of the culture of the Middle East.  We will never hae peace in this world as long as we keep ourselves separate.  I love meeting new people and discovering their cultures.  It may be through meeting them in person or through meeting them and discovering their cultures on the written page.  It is always an adventure and I don't need to leave home.
B00124PXW8|1.0|This movie is really not scary but it is extremely vulgar. It must have been very scandalous in the 70s when it was released.
B00004YM0D|5.0|This movie soundtrack does not disappoint like some do.  It has the great music from the movie and is fun to listen to.
0811879542|2.0|My niece loves the Herve Tullet books like Finger Worms.  This one was sort of baffling.  It is probably slightly above her age level, but the concept was still a bit weird.  Her father was sort of skeptical about its simplicity, and I don't see this being a book she will grow into loving.  I'd recommend about any of his other books over this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it! Surprises me every episode! The characters are wonderful you can't help but love and hate some of them at the same time! So sad when they leave the show.
B00FP1NNJY|3.0|The song is good but very original.  Took me awhile to understand what she was saying &#34;going timber&#34;. Kinda confusing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game...love the challenge. A little exercise for the mind never hurt.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys brain teasers.
B0065CCT6U|5.0|Chris Cornell is simply THE MAN, he seems to get better with age.  Also nice to hear him solo with just his acoustic.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|While a sometimes confusing plot (who is the story teller now?), it is a compelling read. Our Library Book Club gave it a thumbs up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game becomes addictive.  When you are winning you want to get to the next game and when you are having a hard time passing a level you want to keep playing until you pass it.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I love anything Emma, and these other 2 boys were equally awesome.  This is a movie you must own! Now, I have to read the book!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Super-creepy, excellent show!  Jessica Lange is amazing, the rest of the cast is fantastic, too!  Great show for the Halloween season, great show all year round.
B00006ADD5|5.0|It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movie ever made. The story, as implausible as it may seem, did happen. The timeless conflicts of the Middle East were shown in all its splendor and, although made in 1956, David Lean work of art is still unsurpassed for its magnificence.  If you have to own just 3 videos, this must be one of them. It is that good. The story is absorbing but the filming is amazing!
006202406X|2.0|I forgot Ms. Roth was a hardcore Christian. In my opinion, her belief system (and agenda?) are really what shine through here. It isn't a pointless message per se, but it is a simple and heavy handed one, and one I personally didn't think I was signing up for when reading books 1 and 2. I would have read some CS Lewis if that's what I was looking for. I feel a bit duped. In retrospect, I should have seen it coming. Fool me once, though. I certainly will not be reading anything else she writes in the future.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Arcade Fire does it again.  This album is one that takes a few listens to really take hold, but then it doesn't let you go.
B002UD56I6|4.0|I like michael jackson and all,  but the only reason why i bought the blu ray is cause the audio is great.  Lots of extras,  and it put me over the 35$ marker for free shipping :P
B000J159N8|3.0|A semi-decent re-enactment of the Vietnam war. However, when Hollywood or Paramount Studios raises its ugly head to sensationalize what the 'War' really was doesn't add to the film credence. Mel Gibson is assigned to portray a family man on the air training base and then, through his script, have to portray a 'Pattonesque' style of leadership during that same training and in the field of battle. With young men dying all around him and his co-star, he manages to escape the onslaught unscathed. This is an acceptable film for the viewers that have little or no knowledge about the Vietnam War. Good attempt, but I don't think this version was based on facts. This is my opinion. I must admit, I did not watch the last 1/4 of the film. This was dramatization; better yet, watch real time footage on film and/or documentaries of the actual war that are available.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I like this app a lot. I am a fan of games where you get to decide what you are using to solve the game.  There is a wide range of objects that you can use, ( including some weird ones ).  I highly suggest this to anyone that is creative and thoughtful, because some of the levels are tricky!  I am a long-time fan, and I love this app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and the regeneration is structured in a way that you can play without purchasing anything.  Prizes are easy to win to gain bonuses.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is awesome.  I have to say that when using it from my computer, it's less effective and tends to buffer a little more often.  I think that's because the WiFi is using more bandwidth through my computer than it is through the tablet or phone.  That said, when I use my phone or tablet to stream, it's PERFECTION.  Perfect picture, I can still use the tablet for phone for whatever I want to use it for even if I'm watching a show on Netflix or something.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is searching for an easy, quick-set-up device for streaming to your TV.
B00005ATQD|5.0|What an outstanding drama!  I had long heard that this movie is controversial, and this dvd really proved that to me.  Very nice product.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You will not want to put this book down once you get going.  The twists just keep coming at you and you won't know what to think half the time.  I even caught myself skimming sometimes because I couldn't read fast enough!!  Definitely recommend it.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|I watched this once back in 1987, I believe, and its just as fun now as it was then.  Nicely packaged product too.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I.  LOVE.  THIS.  BOOK.  Tina Fey's wit and genuine way of expressing herself are so refreshing.  She's hilarious (which we all expect) but she's also incredibly honest and vulnerable in her book.  She talks about strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures, fears and overcoming them.  She's not glorifying herself but she makes you love her even more anyway.  The letter to her daughter is one of the most amazing things I've ever read.  Ever.
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|The CD is what I expected...the complete series of 2 CD's. As always his music is one of the best.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Snow White and the Huntsman was a fabulous movie, especially a Snow White movie.  Lot of drama and adventure.  A movie to watch over again.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I would read another of her books if it wasn't for the ending of this book. The ending was very disappointing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 3 has great stories just like Seasons 1 and 2 but this one probably won't make you happy at the end.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|What works on this game is fairly challenging - or at least the tutorial was.  However, I finished that and have tried many, MANY times to start the actual game and, as many times as I've tried, all it does is turn off.  It offers an &#34;Epilogue&#34; but I didn't want to play that until I finished the game.  But, since it won't let me play the game, I'm playing the Epilogue.
B0083H6AQA|4.0|One has to like Robert Pattinson a lot to really like this movie.  There was some good sex during the movie.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|It is a great movie.  Mirren was fantastic.  Also, renting it off amazon was wonderful.  We were visiting my mother and we were able to really enjoy it with her through amazon
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I agree with others that this version sucks the battery life.  I had to uninstall it from my phone.  The battery would die after only a couple of hours.  New maps are slow to load and refresh.  Bring back the old version.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was really disappointed in this book. The ending could of been so much better . I can only wish she had changed the ending.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|this was the best program ever for a scyfy i just loved it they need to make more season 1 and 2 were the best were did it go??
0810970686|5.0|book was in great condition my son loves it and has had some good laughs too. it was right on track with the other books in the series.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love it. just wish it stop freezing so I can enjoy the game.  atleast it saves my puzzle that I'm on.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book and it is outstanding. Just remarkable. It is about a little boy in 5th grade who has an abnormal face. He is facing the troubling task of middle school. I mean, he has always been homeschooled. Join August Pullman and his friends and family on his brave adventure through life. A wonderful book for kids 4-6 grade.
B0055N0FZM|5.0|Anne was an incredible young woman. She endured so much, I doubt many children her age now could tolerate the things she did for 2 hours, let alone 2 years!<br />I get riled up when people want her thoughts censored. For her own privacy I understand, but not because of your prudishness. Get a life, seriously. If you haven't discovered your genitals by the time you're in high school, there really isn't much hope for you. Plus her anatomical descriptions are rather solid, so this diary makes for a good sex ed lesson!
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Drawing on influences from the 1980's and Caribbean sounds that are certainly a nod to the band's Haitian connections, Arcade Fire puts out another outstanding album full of complexly, layered music with meaningful lyrics. No, this album doesn't sound exactly like their previous works, but you know it's Arcarde Fire the moment the music starts from the orchestrated detail that goes into the opening track. The title track, Reflektor, is getting a lot of airplay on SiriusXM, but for a little variety, check out Normal People and Afterlife. Normal People is that upbeat guitar track that every good rock album needs, while Afterlife is your classic Arcade Fire anthem that keeps us playing their music over and over. The only track that some people will find challenging is the closer, Supersymmetry. It's an instrumental track that sometimes leaves you wondering when the real song is about to start. It won't be the one that you skip to for a quick listen, but in the context of the work, it fits. Like Arcarde Fire's other albums, Reflektor is a to be digested as a whole album. There are several songs that stand alone, but you can't appreciate a book by randomly reading chapters and you won't gain a full appreciation for this album by forever skipping through songs at random. Get in the car and turn this album on and see where you end up.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|From the beginning, this entire story gave me the impression the author hopes to land a (bad)movie deal.  It was corny, \\"forced\\", and too predictable.
B008PU8SR4|4.0|It is very good the way the writer develops a story inside another story, I tought the boy was really the author of the book.
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|As a teen I was a huge fan of the Battletech book series which was about huge robotic war machines used in like the year 2350 after we'd gone to the stars. A few years ago there was talk about a movie being made about those books. After seeing this movie I wish they would have. This movie was very well done, but the Battletech books were far better story-wise and could have been great for an ongoing series of movies. There was more than 50 books.<br />Seeing how many people liked this one I hope some canny producer might think about doing the Battletech again.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I did not expect much from this offering as it was in and out of the theater in record time. It was surprisingly decent and the special effects were very good. If you enjoy movies like Men in Black, you will enjoy this movie as well.
0393338398|5.0|I read it many years ago and I bought it for a friend who likes baseball. It's a tough read if you don't know at least a good share of baseball terminology, although you don't have to be a seam-head either. Since Michael Lewis is the writer, it's also good if you know a little bit about Economics, since that is pretty much what the book is about, but give it a shot, it's a different approach to a sports book, and Billy Bean is a very likeable person.
B00DHNJCKQ|1.0|This movie was a turd. It had the slowest pace ever to come to a conclusion that made the entire movie not worth watching. Overall, it took way to long to reach a pointless climax in a style of movie that had been done so many other times. I do not recommend anyone wastes their time on this picture.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Movie was excellent. Tom Hardy was brilliantly insane! He actually became Charlie Bronson and I loved him for it! I'm going to watch it repeatedly.
B00004U45G|5.0|Great price.hard to find a decent price on this cd set.jimmie page picks another great match for the best of the best.Who else could pull off doing zepplin tunes no doubt this show kicked butt
B0028OF7TA|5.0|I absolutely love this collection, it's full of hits and favorites,  I really wanted this collection for the 5 separate cd's, an absolutely awesome combination.  Thanks!!!!
0689815816|5.0|My grandson loves this book. They read it at nursery school so ordered it for home. He is 4 .Fast shipper
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The pictures were blown up and pixelated, not clear as on the iOS version. More work needed to provide clear view on kindle fire hd.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga<br />I do play it every day.  I play it for hours on emd some days.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great. Found some of the rooms challenging. Some were easy. A good mix of both. I would like to see even more difficult levels. Only reason for 4 stars is that it needs way more levels!!! Thanks for the fun!
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|A lot of games on the Amazon app store claim to be &quot;strategy&quot; games, but this is the first I've seen that really requires thought to win. It feels like controlling the Enterprise from star trek. You have control over every crew member, every weapon, every shield and dodge move. The ship-to-shop combat is tense and fun, and actually feels realistic. The guns take about 30-45 seconds to warm up, and while this might seem like a long wait, it gives you time to tinker with your strategy and micromanage your crew. I won't give away to much about this game, because it has a surprisingly well written story, but TL;DR, it's like controlling an episode of star trek. BUY IT!!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Couldn't get this app working. Kept freezing and when videos did start, it was only for a few seconds before cutting off. YouTube works fine in the Silk browser, just use that instead.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like to check on the weather were my sons are serving in the military. One is in North Carolina and the other in Japan. This app. give me access to do so....love it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Who knew guiding a virus, bacteria, or parasite to kill every last man, woman, and child could be so fun? As a game, it certainly highlights how disease spreads, but isn't so complex to disinterest the player. There certainly can be challenges with different disease behaviors, geographic considerations, and different traits to develop. Plus they have some humorous headlines put in between the game progress (My favorite has to be, &#34;Child reinvents wheel, Engineers baffled.&#34;) Overall, very fun and addictive.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|This album blows it out of the water! far better than I had anticipated! The guitar work is great. They have really outdone themselves. Definitely worth the buy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was intrigued by the thought of Danny all these years later.  Stephen King brought the memories all back in detail and shows us how the kid inside us all continues, grows, reframes, accepts and circles around and begins again.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS ONE OF GAMELOFTS BEST FREE GAMES AVALIBLE OUT THERE TO PLAY I JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Like many others, I had heard Passenger's wonderful new single &#34;Let Her Go&#34; on the radio and was unable to get it out of my head. I came to Amazon to use a promotional mp3 credit and had only intended to purchase that particular song but decided on a whim to buy the entire album. If you're on this page for similar reasons, I highly recommend buying the full album. The unique quality of his voice and his slight accent add an extra layer of raw emotion to the already melancholic, heart-wrenching lyrics that the folk-rock genre seems to lend itself to.<br /><br />This album is a gem. Don't pass it up.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Good old rock and roll is hard to find now adays.But is easy on Amazon.This is my new Favorite!Rock on Amazon!
B00ESNE696|5.0|Just when you think the show may be winding down because you can't possibly imagine how it could get any better, BOOM! IT DOES! Latest episode is a RIDE!
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Drake went all in on this one. A new style Drake but out but one if the greatest for sure.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This great book has so much detail! Very action packed and keeps the reader reading! I just love Suzanne Collins!!
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|I thought this was incredibly creative and was really cool to read. Definitely something I'd occasionally go back and read
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My kids and I had hours of fun with this app and I am sure you and your family will have a very good time with this app.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show is based on an interesting concept. The &#34;good wife&#34; is an attorney married to a politician who is jailed on corruption charges. One of the central questions is whether she will be a successful attorney. Another is whether she will ever again trust her husband. Good acting by leads and supporting cast. Beautiful, well-dressed women.
1439190976|3.0|The redundant McKinsey mantra is too heavily repeated. The world knows McK's guys are Airedales - so stop saying so. Gets a little boring.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch is the story of the murder investigation of an eleven-year-old boy named Danny Latimer, whose body is found on the beach early one morning.  DI Alec Hardy played by David Tennant and DS Ellie Miller played by Olivia Colman investigate over a series of eight episodes.  I'm almost never surprised by a mystery -- I usually guess the culprit right away and when I don't, it's usually because the culprit doesn't make sense.  That's not at all the case here.  When the big reveal happens in the last episode, you are surprised.  They throw a few red herrings in along the way, but about midway through the series I began to understand that if they were leading me toward a suspect, he/she absolutely wasn't the killer.  As the investigation continues, the town seems to fray at the seams and the underbelly is exposed, bit by bit.  I started watching the series for David Tennant because I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who, and he is not the Doctor in this at all.  He is someone wholly new, so if you're looking for the Doctor in different clothes, you won't find him.  Instead, you'll find a flawed man with a tortured past, and you'll desperately want him to find peace.  Olivia Colman is terrific in this too.  She's the heart of this series, and it unfolds mostly through her point of view.  Add to that the gorgeous location shots, and you'll be riveted.
B004JK61K0|1.0|It was hard to find a good app for hotmail for android.  This one wasn't it.  Don't waste your time.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|I was not prepared to accept their information gathering nor their advertising conditions so I immediately uninstalled the dictionary product
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is a love story. Guys - get past that.  It appeals to everyone.  The acting is top notch through and through and demonstrates the extraordinary range and talent of Swank in particular.
B000IDEORY|5.0|First, I can't believe so many years have passed since this movie came out and was such a hit. This is really a feel good film. I remember a concert I went to featuring all of the music and groups involved in this movie and it was so much fun! I am so glad I found it on amazon.com. I look forward to watching it many times and remembering growing up and being a teenager during the sixties. What great memories!
B00F8OUBXE|3.0|I really, really hate to do this but, as a person who listens to a lot of metal music, I can only give this album 3 stars. I was disappointed. I have to question some of the reviews on here. Did they listen to the album? There isn't much new on this album. Nothing that grabs me anyway. I won't be biased by the fact that this is Metal Church, one of my all time favorite bands. Back in 1986 I got \\"The Dark\\" album and was blown away by these guys. Those first two albums were the best they've ever done. This album is ok but it's lacking in...something. It has a \\"hurry up and get it done\\" feel to it. Just look at the album cover and tell me it's not one of the worst metal album covers you've ever seen. Once you get past the cover and into the music, It's not a terrible sounding production and yet the songs suffer from a two-dimensional feel that I can't seem to shake. I don't know. Maybe a few more listens and it'll hit me like it's hit the rest of you, because I really want to like this album. I will say it's better than anything Metallica has done in the past 20 years but that's nothing to go on and just my opinion. Ronny Munroe does have a good voice, there are some cool intro's and build ups but that's about as far as it goes. They should have gone with more breakdowns and experimented a lot more musically and lyrically. The lyrics for the most part are forgettable. Sorry guys. I hope people still check out the album for themselves to form their own opinions but this is my two cents for what it's worth.
B000PAU032|5.0|I have been a fan of Zimmer FOREVER!  If he creates the score I watch the movie!<br />Some of his very best!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!!! It is absolutely amazing!!! The only things that could be worked on more is common game crashes, laying, and making it more like the computer verdoin. Honestly, I think the game needs some serouis updates because compared to the computer version it is kind of lame. Compared to any other game it is perfect!!!
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|I enjoy playing pool for real so this virtual game is fun also.  I just started playing so cant wait to get further along.  Hope everyone enjoys this game as I do.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|As a mother and a wife who is about the same age as the characters in this book, I can relate with their way of thinking.  The secret makes the book quite interesting.  I'm almost done...but not quite.  Can't wait to finish.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app it is so good it helps me understand the word of God better people in my church. use it love it
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Shameful how they try to nickel and dime you at every turn to play this game. This is not Candy Crush--meaning I can buy a deck of Uno cards and play all I want. Why on EARTH would I keep pumping money into this app which is a simple card game?? Unbelievable...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app in the WORLD!!! You can battle the mobs at night or build the thing of your dreams!! In this game the possibilities are ENDLESS!!! A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE!!!!!!
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|Took me a while of listening to this album, like all NIN albums, before I truly appreciated. I personally enjoy the later songs on this album, but that is just a personal preference.<br /><br />The instant MP3 download was nice also.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Amazing!!!!! This album is a masterpiece. Great experience start to finish! &#34;Afterlife&#34; is my new favorite Arcade Fire song... Absolutely beautiful!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I always want to see how much better I can do, so I play frequently.  Helps my to relax in the evening.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|A fitting culmination to a terribly terrific series!<br />Probably one of the best in the genre, and doubly good by being so true to what might have been from Robert Jordan himself.. Thanks for the complete tale...
B00471Z3CI|5.0|Ah Cuesta Verde estates, ideal suburbia, well Spielberg suburbia , you half expect E.T. to be on the bike going down the street.  This movie will definitely  have you reconsider what land your house is built on, creepy trees, and that clown doll yikes! Need a fright? then this will do the trick, i hear a remake is upcoming or at the very least a sequel, so ya never know when we will make a trip back to Cuesta Verde, they miss us!
B00ESB6GBY|2.0|...but this season is dragging so far. The characters have been reduced to caricatures of their former selves, the road trip plot line is getting old fast, and the Farhampton Inn set is very claustrophobic and doesn't allow the diversity of all the NY sets. Hoping it picks up soon...
B00280LYIC|5.0|I watched the first Movie and loved it! I bought this book the same night and stayed up till 2 am reading the first half of it. At some times you can tell it was written for middle school boys but being a 25 year old female with a Harry Potter obsession, I just couldn't put it down!
B005LAIIGW|1.0|When Gravity ended my friend and I looked at each other and said simultaneously: &#34;That's It?&#34; We both thought the movie was far from over! It's the first time in years I had to literally apologize for picking such a lousy movie for a friend to see!<br /><br />Sandra Bullock's acting was terrible and unconvincing. And, she looked like she was constipated most of the time. George Clooney came across just too perfect for such a life and death situation. He was too much like a saint in outer space!<br /><br />I also felt mightily deceived by both the film's movie trailer  and by the official news media critics that fawned all over this pitiful movie! Gravity is so tame and lame you could take a child to see it without a second thought! It certainly won't offend a soul on planet earth!<br /><br />But worst of all, was the ending! After you a watch a film you want to feel like there was a beginning, middle and end. In Gravity your jaw is left hanging because there's was no satisfying ending. My friend and I both felt like we were in the the middle of the story when the film ended! BORING!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I finally gave in and read the book. though the story kept my interest (I finished in less than two days) it wasn't written all that great...its a step up from an urban novel. will I read the next two books? yes. if my mr.grey is out there... lol #ijs
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|The book speaks to a lot of arguments against remote work, and great counters to each. It also talks about difficulties and pitfalls and ways to avoid them.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|must get soooooooooo worth $6.99.Try it on pc 2. But needs updates and it will be perfect. :) :) :) Creeper give<br />5 stars.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I listened to the audio (Audible) version ... although, I thought Audible was 'part' of Amazon (sort of) but buying it from Audible apparently still doesn't 'translate' into a 'verified purchse'... point being, I paid money for this, I was looking forward to this, and previous to this, I ADORED the series.<br /><br />My Initial Reaction:<br />Hrm. Gotta mull this one over. Not happy. 1-2♥'s... can't quite decide between the two yet.<br /><br />Edit 11/1/13: (Reaction a week after reading)<br />I've decided, due to each passing day causing an increase in loathing for this book... it's officially going down to one star. If I could, I'd only give it .1♥'s, maybe mixed with some negative stars for the complete loss of faith in this writer and series.<br /><br />It becomes more and more sour the more time passes. The entire series has been devastated for me, and cannot be re-read. Doubt I'll see the movie; with the ending of the series, what's the point of the slow torture?<br /><br />In regard to the use of Two POV: While I liked 'seeing' into Four's head... I didn't think what I saw there really matched up to his character/personality from the first two books. (I haven't read the novella from his POV, so this is the first chance I've had to 'see' into his head.) I've heard many readers got confused as to 'who' was speaking at any given time, but listening to the audio and having a male a female narrator really alleviated that fact.  In all honesty, I really think Four's manhood was stolen by this book.<br /><br />I'll give one prop to Veronica Roth, she certainly goes balls-to-the-wall on her 'vision' for the series. No pulling punches- she goes ALL OUT.<br /><br />I didn't come up with this thought, but it sums everything up everything nicely without spoilers:<br /><br />Veronica Roth:<br />You are dauntless. I wish you had been more abnegation. Thanks for destroying the series.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is fun but very challenging at times! it could use a little more twists to keep me interested when I get frustrated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting!!!! Every level is a challenge. I am not crazy about having to wait to re try levels after so many attempts.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|the game is fun.  i'd give it 3 or 4 stars, but i need to give 5 to unlock a bonus level
B00003CXC6|5.0|I bought this DVD for my father for Christmas, and he absolutely loved the film. He is a huge Kurosawa fan, and he ranks this film at the top.
B00BHWG0EK|5.0|Unfortunately I am completely biased when it comes to Star Trek. I totally love everything about it and so will always give 5 stars. I have not yet had any bad experiences with the sets I have bought. I bought the &#34;orange faces&#34; boxed set this time but did notice that the &#34;grey boxed set&#34; is cheaper than the one with the orange colored faces so I will go with the grey boxed sets in the future. Price is my only motivation for doing this though.
1932100385|5.0|The book is a clear concise explanation of the basis for a lot of our nations health problems:  Eating animal products.  The book  takes highlights from the joint US/China study commissioned by the Premier Chou Enlai whose was dying with cancer at the time.  The book takes statistics from the extensive surveys of specific segments huge Chinese population to correlate eating habits with diseases in that segment of the population.  As an example, a specific county in china was vegetarian because of that counties sub-culture, and economic status bars them from being able to buy and consume meat.  The health issues of this county's population was then correlated with those of the more afflulent meat eating portions of the culture.  The vegans (no animal products consumed) had few to no cancers, heart disease, etc.<br /><br />The book also argues that the current model of studying one isolated elements influence on the body with double blind testing makes for good papers but does not necessarily present the whole story.  The isolation method ignores any interactions the one element may have with another in the real world.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I think that this series was especially well done. I really like the care taken with developing all of the characters and their relationships to one another in the village of Broadchurch. Each week I could not wait for the next episode!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Way too short. Decent book. Really over rated. Could have been a lot deeper and less obscure. Tried to hard to be deep
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|This CD arrived packaged well, in good condition.  I love getting to replace some of my older vinyl albums with CD's at affordable prices.
1594203334|5.0|We heard about this book a couple years ago when it got some press and decided we were interested in reading about how parents in the U.S. might be raising children differently than in France. They are a U.S./British born couple living in France. The author's take is basically a personal ethnography on her experience raising children in France. She tells you when she feels like she is being biased to her personal experience and when she feels like she has found a ton of information from a number of different people/parents/research (which she cites). I really like the ways she notices how U.S. parents tend to put babies as the center of the universe and French parents... just don't. It's a fresh perspective on a parenting trap I likely would have fallen into without having read about a different culture's way of viewing parenting.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|I have never written a review before but I feel like I must warn people about to waste their money on this.  If you are absolutely in love with Ryan Reynolds, ok, rent it and turn the sound down so you can at least get some kind of visual thrill because I can't imagine any other scenario that would have someone walking away from this and saying even something mediocre about it like \\"Hey, not bad\\".<br /><br />I saw it at the movie theater.  I took my 10 year old son, who loves the MIB movies (yes the plot similarity is definitely there, just not the entertainment aspect) and he asked me about halfway through if we could leave.  He thought I would be upset for spending money on it and hearing him complain.  In actuality, I was thrilled for the opportunity to not waste another hour of my life watching this garbage.  His words, \\"That's the worst movie I have ever seen\\".  Folks, he's 10.  Until this, he had never seen a bad movie, because young kids RARELY think ANY movie is bad.  But he was right on about this.<br /><br />Wait, I have one positive.  Jeff Bridges character could have been great.  In fact, it should have been great.  But the rest of the movie failed all around him so completely that it reminded me of the old saying \\"If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around, does it make a sound?\\".  Jeff Bridges was the tree, and NOBODY was around him.  His parts were so isolated and disassociated from the attempted meaning of the movie it made me shudder.  Don't rent this.  Watch it for free on cable if you recently made a home movie and are thinking you made the worst movie in the history of movies.  It might make you feel better.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|i love this show, both the classic and newer episodes! special feature galore! will definitely buy more until i have them all!

B00B5NXBZ2|4.0|It is still somewhat intriguing how Woodkid popped up on the music scene. Working more behind the scenes as a music video director and graphic designer Yoann Lemoine (Woodkid) made the decision to take the plunge and start making music. Surprisingly he does not disappoint.<br /><br />His first EP arrived on the scene in 2011 featuring the single \\"Iron,\\" a very larger than life piece with ambiguous but heavily thematic themes. With \\"The Golden Age\\" (2013) he continues to use chiefly thematic methods of writing and composing. The man is French so it is quite dramatic but also has a sweet romantic element included in it which can be found in songs like \\"The Shore.\\" It feels like a moment in a French film when two lovers are finally reunited and walking hand in hand on an empty beach. The lonely piano plucks away at the chords while the strings sway back and forth with the horns. Then there is the more grandiloquent \\"Conquest of Spaces\\" with its pumping ethnic drums and slightly more electronic sound. It is as if Simba is making his way back home to claim his place as king.<br /><br />He is far beyond his genre which has been termed \\"neofolk.\\" He is so much more and credit also must be given to his arranger Ambroise Willaume. The pair creates a sweeping and epic setting against Lemoine's vocals. It would be interesting to see them do more orchestral work for films and the like.<br /><br />\\"Golden Age\\" is not without flaws though. He has a ways to go to expand his larger than life, filmic sound. The album is a bit reminiscent of Coldplay mostly due to Lemoine's delivery of lyrics, tone of his vocals, and the buildups of each song. \\"Iron\\" has to be his most original release to date but it cannot support an entire album's lack of complete individuality. In all, this is a great listen and a great first album from Lemoine. There are a few sparkling gems, just keep your ears open.

B005LFS448|5.0|In terms of genre, it is hard to put a single word on was Mr.Blake is trying to convey. In this case, the best way to describe it on his terms would be experimental. Not quite dub-step, not quite a big dance tune, not quite a ballad. Just an electronic and harmonic space.<br /><br />That's definitely something to love about James Blake. He manages to produce a wonderful \\"space\\" in his music. One minute the music is phasing his electronic rhodes and auto-tuned voice in all directions then two tracks later he is singing a cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"A Case of You.\\" Dude has range! Some standout tracks are:<br /><br />1. \\"Once We All Agree\\" - Repetitious lyrics and chords. This is a song that, when in the right state of mind, one can become completely lost.<br /><br />2. \\"We Might Feel Unsound\\" - Again, Blake doesn't stray from repetition but this time it has more of a pulse. The tone is a new extention of the previous track with tight drums answering to one another.<br /><br />4. \\"A Case of You\\" - A big favorite of fans and Blake alike, this is a fantastic cover of Blake's favorite artist Joni Mitchell. He sings beautifully and with such conviction.<br /><br />James Blake clearly creates the music that he wants to make. There are no outside influences twisting his sound into something more palatable, consumable, or sellable. If you enjoyed Blake's first album then give this one a chance. Don't be so swift to shut it out. And remember, keep your ears open!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|We love Fringe!!  The Sci-fi is kind of way out there, but the characters are great.  Dr. Walter Bishop is our favorite.  He is an amazing actor.  His emotions are so real that I honestly forget he is acting.  Tears come to my eyes so many times when he is playing an upsetting scene.  I never saw him act before Fringe.<br />After each episode ends, it is way too hard to wait until we can watch another one.  It is so addicting.
B00G2SIW7M|3.0|Good, nothing really stood out from the rest like on other albums. The sound was interesting enough to be listened to more than once. Looking like or could be one of those that has to grow on me if it can.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this story...perfect time of year for ghoulish Ghosties, &#34;human like&#34; beings who live for thousands of years and feed on the screams of pain and suffering from others, lapping up their blood post-torture like a puppy at his dish. Written with King grit, who always finds the right world to nail the sentiment of any dialogue and never, ever leaves us uncertain, wondering what just happened. Doc is the &#34;redrum&#34; kid all grown up yet King doesn't spend too much time taking us all the way back ( to The Shining ) , the novel stands on it own. It's certainly strong enough on its own. Character development is such a gift of King's!!! He's the master! Dive in! You will find yourself creeped out in the best way possible!<br />I think it's time to go back and re-read his oldies. I had almost forgotten how witty and brilliant he truly is.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A must have. Very user friendly. Keeps your recent history, very useful. Best calculator I have used. I have recommended to many friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am going through withdrawal.  I really hope that when we get back that Matthew is alive in one of Dr. Clarkson's  hospital beds.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|Take to the stars and gradually build your ship up.  Take on alien boarding parties and try to survive via strategy..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My friend recommended this game. I love it but sometimes it drives me crazy. It is a challenge to reach your goal.
0307719774|1.0|This is too small for practical use.  Questions are kind of silly and I found this purchase to be a waste of $
B009LROCJI|5.0|Can't stop listening. I don't listen to much classical music, but when I do, it's four seasons. Good deal on Amazon.
0316247545|5.0|Lots here for a MLP fan to read about and look at.  This is not a story to be read aloud but probably better suited for an independent reader
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I would like to thank the author for giving us a &#34;what if&#34; scenario at the end of the book. A really good book.  Will definitely recommend to my friends.
B00FAOPMTK|5.0|It's good quality, looks good, fits my new iPhone perfectly, fits in my pocket easily and comes in a great selection of colors.<br />V happy with this purchase.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a book! I loved Drew and all of his infinite wisdom, Especially his not so delicate deliverance of that wisdom! Hot, sexy, funny as hell, what's not to love?!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Rarely does king let me down and this was another thrilling ride from start to finish. I really enjoyed getting to know Dan as an adult and seeing his world thru another character, this time a little girl. The monsters, ghosts, stream sucking vampires, and everything that goes bump in the night was brilliantly composed by king. I loved it.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|This book is great if you want a quick, light-hearted read.  It's a cute story and written in the same style Sophie Kinsella fans have come to love and appreciate!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I bought this book for all my girlfriends at work. It made me laugh so hard. Probably THE best book i have ever read. I cant wait for the next in her series. Great job Emma Chase. Awesome book
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|A dozen or so gems from the blog with additional illustrations and tidying. Well worth it for more on the helper dog.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|The bibliography on this work shows how much research went into it but it cannot explain how a master writer could put all he read into such an educational and entertaining account of this most amazing time in the history of the United States. All of the big stories are there but it is the stories of things I've never heard of that were most fascinating. His description of the people competing with Lindbergh to be the first to cross the Atlantic was riveting. Everyone interested in US history should read this book.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My kids and I watched this movie and we enjoyed it very much. It is funny, entertaining, exciting , and interesting.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I was a little disappointed in the pre-order though. I did get a refund for the difference when the price went down before the movie was released on Blueray but I it was on the shelves at Walmart for two days before it was delivered to my house, which kind of defeated the purpose of pre-ordering.
B009WUBERW|5.0|it looks so 3D like and the characters are the coolest acting people ever, but I like more the characters
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|So much laughing occurred while reading this, not only because it is humorous but because it is truly relates to my life and the lives of others. This blog helped get me through one of the most difficult times in my life just by helping me laugh again. Thank you Allie!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Best book!!! Made me go wow at the end of each chapter of it. Need to get the next book now!!! Get this book!!! Want to find out what happens next
