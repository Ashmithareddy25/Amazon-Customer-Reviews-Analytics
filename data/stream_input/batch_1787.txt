B009EP3DJM|4.0|Ke$ha's 2nd album delivers the goods - energetic, catchy pop club anthems to get you pumped up on a Saturday night.  She doesn't diverge too much from the Animal/Cannibal blueprint, but if it ain't broke...<br /><br />She still has the attitude and (possibly) tongue-in-cheek snide put-downs and come-ons that have become her trademark.  Overall it is a well-produced, well-written, highly-addictive collection of songs that achieve their goal. Love Into The Light and Past Lives even slow things down and provide atmosphere and a bit of emotional depth, as well.  Really, the only misstep is the pseudo-Taylor-Swift-pop-country tune Wonderland, which just sounds too manufactured, too blatant an attempt at crossover potential to be convincing.<br /><br />If Madonna or Lady Gaga had a sense of humor and didn't take themselves so seriously, they might be able to make music this fun.  After all, it's pop music, folks, not bilateral international arms negotiations.  In the end, I doubt anyone who enjoyed her previous work will be let down by this release at all and there are enough potential singles on here to keep Ke$ha on the airwaves for the next year or so.

030758836X|5.0|I finished reading Gone Girl a couple weeks ago and I am STILL thinking about it. I have not read a book that gripped and haunted me like this in so long. I downloaded the eBook when I noticed two of my social network friends were reading it. Since the first chapter, there was not one moment when I regretted dropping everything to read this book. In fact, I curled up in Cocoa Comfy (my reading chair) with a snuggie and hardly moved until the last e-page was turned--excluding the moment when I damn near threw my NOOK across the room and cursed aloud. Gone Girl was unputdownable!<br /><br />By now, you're wondering what the heck is this book about?! **deep sigh** Where do I begin and how do I explain without spoiling the story or the ending? And yes, that ending has stirred up rants everywhere.<br /><br />On Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary day, Amy disappears. The house shows signs of struggle and like most disappearances, the husband is always the prime suspect. Clues and evidence are revealed as Nick tries to prove his innocence. Readers will find that the characters are challenging and unpredictable since the story is told from alternating points of view between Nick and Amy. Their thoughts, incomplete truths and actions unfold in a twisted mystery that grows with each chapter. It is a classic case of He Said, She Said in literary form.<br /><br />Psychological thriller Gone Girl is not overrated. It deserves to be named as one of the best books of the year. It deserves the awards, praises, 3,000+ positive reviews and conversations. Read it. Period. Point blank. Then find me online to discuss because you WILL want to talk about this book with someone else who has read it.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews

B00136NVYW|5.0|This band grew on me. The overall feel of their music at first, wasn't completely my taste. But via friends, I heard a ton of their stuff. This is my favorite album from this group, so I had to pick it up. It's dark, it's depressed and has a little edge to it.<br /><br />If that's what you are looking for, pick it up. If you aren't sure, find a way to listen to it a few times prior to purchase, as you would with any album.
0316154687|5.0|So where \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" began the process of ripping my marriage apart at bedtime -- my silent, yet violent laughter forcing my husband to sleep on the couch -- \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" is helping to heal our marriage.  One night I slipped into bed, alone, and started to read loudly from the chapter \\"That's Amore\\".  Despite my laughter, snorts and breaks to wipe laughter tears away, I eventually saw my husband's eyeball peering through the opening in the door jam, wanting more.  Helen brought my husband back to me.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I had read two other books in the Reacher series before picking up this, the first in the series. I'd enjoyed the previous two enough to read more but not so much that I raced out with the intent of reading them all or of recommending them to my novel-reading friends. And so I came to Killing Floor with hopeful curiosity. I was hoping to get a better handle on who this guy Jack Reacher really was, how his travels began, what made him who he had become. And as I began reading, I got just this. I loved the first several chapters. I did get a feel for Reacher, this former military cop that, after being released from service, decided to take to the road and simply live as a free spirit. As a child, he'd been a military brat, moving from base to base, often country to country. He had no roots to come home to. There was no place he could begin to call home. I also enjoyed the concept of Reacher exiting the bus, on a whim, in the town of Margrave, Georgia, to learn what had really happened to a blues musician that had gone missing decades ago. Unfortunately, Reacher  is almost immediately picked up for a murder he didn't commit.  And thus begins the story proper. I really did thoroughly enjoy the first third or so of the book. But the further I got into it, the more I was required to suspend my disbelief. Police simply wouldn't let a wandering outsider direct their murder investigation, they certainly wouldn't essentially offer wordless shrugs when he kills people - bad people, yes, but still, he kills them. These are cops after all, and by this point in the story they've only known Reacher for a handful of days. As well, I'm never fond of a character that has all of the answers and everyone else simply nods their heads offering no additional help or insight. These supposedly experienced detectives follow Reacher around like puppies on a leash. There are some good twists. Some great thrills. A decent love relationship. But Reacher is the only character with any true depth.I enjoyed the story. It was a finally crafted plot with plenty of twists and turns and reveals. But it's peopled with one dimensional stick figures. I wanted to love it more than I did. I really wanted to jump fully into the Reacher camp and walk away wanting more. And likely I will read more. But they'll be spaced out months, perhaps years apart. I'll enjoy the occasional visit with Reacher, but we won't become close. Maybe I'm a bit of a wanderer too.
0547884591|5.0|Great book. Timothy Ferris embodies hacking. He does a great job in this book and if you are an original 4 hour work week reader, you will see he has mastered the 20/80. You can also see this is his style of book writing not 4 hour work week which has a lot of stories. This is a great tool. I am guess the next book he comes out with will be called 4 hour instrument i think thats the only thing missing that tim hasn't really touched on. Not sure if it is because there is no hack for it or he needs a lot more time to study instrumental notes. Great book none the less.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and my kids love it! I like the big buttons while I am trying to balance my checkbook.
B0091LS07E|4.0|De Novo Adagio (Intro) - I was pretty happy that Alicia Keys' returned back to her piano introductions, when her last album didn't have one at all, I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a bit of a beat or breakdown after the slow piano tunes, however, I loved how it connected to the next song of the album.<br /><br />Brand New Me - This song seems to be the highlight of the album. Period. The emotions that Alicia brings in the song, you could tell that she has been through a lot, and it really gives out a great message to those who wants to be someone or change, even move on.<br /><br />When It's All Over - A mixture of hip-hop, pop, and jazz is included in this song, it's very amazing how great she sounds in the song, and it's not really a style she would perform in. The ending with her son, Egypt, was most definitely a cute and adorable moment.<br /><br />Listen to Your Heart - A smooth sound and a soft and mellow voice that is a very interesting part of Girl on Fire. Clearly, Alicia Keys is saying that \\"you gotta listen to your heart\\", and using \\"heart\\" as if it was a person by using \\"he\\", which is pretty awkward if you ask me, but it still works well, then the song fades and then.....<br /><br />New Day - BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The drums blow in, Swizz Beats really impressed me with this song, he adds in hip-hop and classical music all in one, this is a very amazing song, and maybe I must say that I do like this version 10 times better than the version with Dr. Dre and 50 Cent.<br /><br />Girl on Fire - I'm honestly glad that this version was included in this album. Out of all of the versions, Bluelight and Inferno were definitely my favorites. Without adding her Roman, Barbie, and Martha in the song, Nicki Minaj puts out her pure Onika in this song, she's more family-friendly in this song, and as a Nicki Minaj fan, I give her plaudits for that. The \\"con\\" of this song is some of the lyrics, which seem to be weak and confusing.  How can the \\"girl\\" go from \\"having her feet on the ground and having her head in the clouds,\\" to \\"on top of the world?\\" Oh well, overall, it was great.<br /><br />Fire We Make - I'm actually shocked that this is Maxwell's first duet of his whole career. But I'll say that this is definitely the sexiest and mature song of the album. I love that Alicia starts to sing similar to Maxwell's voice range, this song was definitely worth it.<br /><br />Tears Always Win - A not-so radio friendly song that, in my opinion, is a really great song of the album, it's more of her style from her As I Am and The Diary of Alicia Keys days.<br /><br />Not Even The King - From the time I heard this song, I had the feeling that Emeli Sande contributed to writing this song. Although very quick and simple, it has a very amazing meaning to it.<br /><br />That's When I Knew - Starting off with an amazing background guitar, and amazing vocals from the one and only.<br /><br />Limitedless - When I first heard the beginning of the song, it sounded as if she was going soft rock or alternative, and when the beat drops, everything changes when she brings out her reggae to the entire song. It's definitely interesting, because it's not really what you would expect from Alicia, she's trying new and unique styles to make the album more great.<br /><br />One Thing - This Frank Ocean written piece is very good, not so great, if you compare it to Brandy's version of \\"Scared of Beautiful\\" on Two Eleven. It was good.<br /><br />101 - The final song of the album, a very lengthy one also, is where things start to get haunting, she saves the best for last, actually. As the song goes on, is where things start to blow and get more crazier. It was definitely an impression.<br /><br />Overall, I must say, although Girl on Fire has a little bit of flaws, it was really an improvement from her last one, The Element of Freedom, which was honestly not that great as I wanted it. This and The Diary of Alicia Keys are definitely worth buying. :)ng her feet on the ground and having her head in the clouds,\\" to \\"on top of the world?\\" Oh well, overall, it was great.<br /><br />Fire We Make - I'm actually shocked that this is Maxwell's first duet of his whole career.

0062183591|4.0|Dan Ariely:  The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty:    I certainly appreciate a comedic approach to life in general.  Dr. Ariely cleverly applies wit and humor to subjects not ordinarily associated with either.  The humor in lying is a novel concept especially when \\"cheating becomes much simpler when there are more steps between us and the dishonest act.\\"  This quote I had to reflect on long and hard, as I identify with being an honest person.    The analogy I most identified with and can attest to is cheating on a diet.  As each day passes my will powers goes out the window as I try to convince myself that the next day I will get better.  I try harder and then the defeatist moment when I realized I am only cheating and fooling myself into believing I will get back on the wagon, tomorrow.    While insightful and entertaining, some of the experiments are poignant and some are limited in the deductive reasoning behind the experiments for example the \\"fudge factor\\" people cheat a little bit.  I would have liked to have more information on what prompted the experiments and ultimately what is done with the research.  Someone obviously pays for the data analysis, how is it then applied and what areas benefit most from this type of research.    The text is a required read for my course; Carlow University Masters of Science in Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis: [...]; therefore I am interested in its practical applications.    The practical implications of the text to me as a fraud investigator can help clarify some of the reasons people lie about such things and the mental and moral justifications they go through to accomplish this.  .

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Let me start by saying that I normally don't write reviews for books. I like what I like, whether its a literary masterpiece or some brain-trash... I read for me....<br /><br />But after reading some of the poor reviews given to this novel, I feel compelled to defend it. Some people have written reviews and I have sat here wondering if they and myself have read the same book?! Its like they didn't comprehend the story or the details<br /><br />Let's begin by stating that this book is not meant for people who like action packed testosterone filled books. The pace of the story is slow but eloquently written. You must pay attention to understand the timeline of events as the author jumps between different times throughout the book. So if you like being spoon fed information, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU.<br /><br />This book was written for the romantic, the believer in the notion that love conquers all. It is not written in a format that is fantastical, although it is a fantasy book... it is written in a prose that if you believed in the unbelievable, you may believe that this could actually happen under the noses of those who are to blind to see that magic in the world is real.<br /><br />There are parts of the book that literally brought me to tears as the contestants become aware of exactly what this \\"game\\" they are playing will mean, as lives of innocents are lost and two lovers must find a way to be together and the sacrifices they are willing to make so that the other may endure. I was happily surprised with how much I enjoyed this book. And I hope that more people would give it a chance. Happy Reading =)

B005COO1X6|5.0|This book by Stephen King was very well written and held my interest.  It addressed what one would due to better their life, at the expense of losing there life.  There was a lot of drama and yet it showed how friendships were made knowing that only one would survive the ordeal of walking miles with no rest  and no regard to weather.  It demonstrated how they showed concern for each other even thought they knew only one would survive.

B008IJTFYW|1.0|I love everything about this product, I helped me get to sleep for the first time in a long time, but it doesn't automatically kick out of the app after your timer stops like it said it would. Woke up to find that the battery was almost dead even though I had it on the charger all night. Once they fix this problem I will download it again, I need my kindle for school and work so it doesn't help having to charge it all morning. I recommend not getting this if you take your kindle to work or school with you.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed and quickly gave up after a week of using it. It's a good job it was free or I would have had to have gotten a refund. Don't waste you're time on this. It may be OK for teenagers, but it wasn't for me.

The concept follows closely to the Percy Jackson books with a new group of heroes (one who is the son of Jupiter (Zeus' Roman form).

Each new movie is better than the last one.<br />What the movie lacks, the soundtrack makes up for. The music for all the Twilight saga films are fantastic. I'm really not sure what it about them that makes them so good, but they are.<br />Muse plays a big part on all of the soundtracks, but I believe that is because the author is obsessed with Muse - every book's acknowledgements reflect back to Muse. When I listened to their song \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" I can't call myself a Muse fan. That's just not my type of music. The same is true for Paramore`s Decode song. Just not my type. However, once you get through those tracks, you come up to The Black Ghosts. They have a song called Full Moon, which is the opening song of the first Twilight movie. It is a really good song with a good rhythm and interesting lyrics. Then, Linkin Park has Leave Out All The Rest on the album, which is probably, hands-down my most favourite track on the album. That is my introduction to Linkin Park. Most of the other songs, I consider to be just okay. Meh. They make up for most of the movie`s music, but they still don`t really appeal to me. Except for Iron & Wine, the 11th track. hey have a song called Flightless Bird, American Mouth on there. It is a beautiful song that I adore and could listen to repeatedly. That song is also used later in the movies, at some of the most anticipated scenes of the Twilight saga. This isn`t the first soundtrack this song can be found on.<br />I`ve criticized the soundtrack, all to say that it was still an okay album. It`s not 100 % to my liking, but it is a good album nevertheless. It is the weakest soundtrack in the Twilight saga.
B004YCKJSS|5.0|A classic feel good movie that I carry in my library.  I recommend this to anyone that likes a light and friendly approach to love stories.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I would like to say first of all i found this book months ago i put it in my \\"to read\\" list and left it there. Until i get a phone from a friend telling me i had to read it asap. So i did.<br /><br />I have been stuck in a \\"fifty shades funk\\" for months now. No matter what i read or tried to read i found nothing compared to it. Beautiful Disaster got me out of my funk!<br /><br />I loved this book. I loved the storyline, the characters, the names of the characters ( i have never heard of the name America before. At first i didnt like it but it grew on me. Now i Love it!)the drama, but most of all i fell hard for Travis!<br />I was consumed by this book from the very start. From when he first calls her Pigeon ill admit it i thought to my self WTF? but I think its unique.<br />I could go on and on about this book but i wont. All i can say is read it. You wont regret it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is a very fun and entertaining app to play. Although I had to start over from the beginning because my old kindle fire broke, you can level up pretty fast. My storm8 ID is Ceven
B0096HNDXY|1.0|I bought this CD...thinking I would have Kylie Minogue.  This  is a sleeper...cd....Dull....it's not worth the 14.00 dollars it cost. and in time it will be laying around in bins...or collecting dust.  what a disapointment...and a rip off...I'll NEVER support this artist again...Randy capps  KC/KS
B006ISJQBM|5.0|Great transaction.  The movie was a must have as we are fans of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.  Johnny Depp again proves to be a great artist and the story is entertaining while the cinematography was just beautiful at times.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Simple and study. Beautiful color<br />Fits my Kindle perfectly. My kid decided she needed it for her Kindle, so I am purcahsing another
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Nolan is a genius. Must watch! I love the way how the movie play backwards. I watched it a second time and its still great,
B0035V35P8|1.0|If you understand the demographics this pathetic filth is trying to target (snot nosed, acne prone, pea brains who play idiotic video games all day and have never read a real book in their life, with the IQ of a dead corpse), then you can understand how it garners such high reviews on movie sites.<br /><br />But don't' be fooled, it's an inept, violent movie that doesn't offer a thing except more mindless violence. Yes, the violence looks like an awful cartoon but to the uninitiated mall geek, it's nothing but a sugar rush of violence for the few brain cells inhabiting their empty skulls.<br /><br />This movie was so stupid my fellow professors couldn't even watch more than 6 minutes of it, and even that was too much. I sat through the whole fetid rotten egg of it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with a brain. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Looks more like a shoddy video game than a movie, which probably explains the high ratings it gets from 11 year old boys.<br /><br />The fake CGI action is entirely inadequate, and completely unrealistic. The action scenes were overdone to the point that they were ridiculous. Heads getting sliced in half. Arms getting hacked off. It looked so fabricated. Rain as Raizo, the lead protagonist, was eminently mediocre, and everybody else was wretched. What a pile of garbage.<br /><br />Ninja Assassin is a painfully, tortuously slow movie. I absolutely love martial arts films and action/adventure films but this movie was nothing but blood and excessive gore with no plot, and no really interesting action.<br /><br />Save yourself some time and watch something else more enjoyable, like trees growing.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  It is one of the few Disney princess DVD's that we need to complete the collection.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Actors put heart and soul into the greatest roles ever written.  And director Ritchie really finding his pace after exhausting the Hackney genre.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie had a good theme, good for kids, good for adults, good for me!<br />So glad I downloaded it.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|I had the misfortune of seeing the premiere of this DVD at a hostel in Belgium.<br /><br />This is one of those dumb 80-minute, crap-concept movies that might appeal to coma victims, brain dead teens, snowboarding losers, and mall rats, but it is ridiculously impossible to accept that these three moronic friends could even manage without tripping or killing themselves from the get go.<br /><br />Three incessantly whining, narcissistic, teenage dummies decide to spend their night roaming around a ski mountain. Yeah, that same old setup.<br /><br />Add the three most incompetent idiots on the planet, the most feeble ski lift chair ever assembled, the most belligerent wolves ever born, the most inexplicably sharp braided steel cable ever manufactured, and what do you get? A more than flawed survival \\"thriller\\" in the snow.<br /><br />Perhaps I feel this way being a self-taught German Alps climber; the plot, idiotic and full of holes, the characters unlikable and numskulled; I legitimately wished for them all to die.<br /><br />The idea of a pack of \\"blood thirsty\\" wolves on a ski hill, ridiculous. Wolves in fact hardly ever assault humans unless they are menaced. They are pack animals that govern their territory from other predators (wolves). They are more interested in human presence as observers as opposed to man eaters. The dialogue and tonal shifts were not very convincing.<br /><br />I was unpleasantly rewarded with an inadequate 90 minute snow flick.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|We got this to give to the kids on Christmas eve.  I think it is hilarious and I know they will enjoy it as well!
B007QUUJMG|4.0|i found this book extremely enjoyable. a fantastic read! it was definitely one of those books you struggle to put down
B000UX6THK|5.0|It was shipped and arrived fast :) All episodes and product came as advertised. I am very happy with my purchase of Twin peaks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead Season 3 is one of my fav TV shows ever!  One of my favorite things is watching the makeup of the zombies.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I bought this one to help complete my collection and to watch all of them prior to the release of the last movie in theatres.  Love this series.
1596434252|1.0|The cover led me to believe that this book was multi-layered and would could me to linger over each page.  Instead, it is just a black and white clever paper folding.  I was looking for something spectacular like the cover.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Great story and definitely enjoyed the premise of this movie.  For all ages and a fun ride for the whole family.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I kept falling asleep during the movie....that should tell you something.  The reveal at the end was sort of poignant though and I felt that Josh Brolin was a believable young agent K.  The first Men In black was definitely the best.  They should have quit when they were ahead.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I got this DVD to help complete my collection and so that I could watch all of them prior to the release of the last movie in theatres.  Love it!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I don't know exactly what it is about this soundtrack but it works perfectly for me for studying.  Some of the songs originally came up on my pandora station and I liked them so much I decided to buy them.  The CD was much cheaper to buy from Amazon then import it than to buy directly from iTunes so I did that.  The music is calming, a little eery, and not too dynamic - but perfect for focusing!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is very useful. it helps you know how much time you have left on your kindle so u if you need it for school you know if u have to charge it. I love this app.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This has been wonderful to watch--excellent acting and sometimes the story line is not really believable but its tv afterall!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|In my humble opinion, this one is one of the best xmas movies i have seen, it is good for all audiences!!!
B001IF252M|5.0|This is an inexpensive knockoff of the real apple thing but it works just as well and so far I have had nothing wrong with it.  I really appreciate the small size and sleek design.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|At first playing, I was a bit disappointed because I felt they stripped it down too much. But the more I listen to this record the more I think it is AWESOME.<br /><br />All of the tracks could be singles but my favorite tracks are: sunset/tides/swept away/our song.<br /><br />Can't wait for album #3!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|The story of Snow White was started in the dark ages as a way to tell and perpetuate the story of Christ and his claiming of the world and eliminating evil.  This story, while not Disney style feel good treat, is probably a good representation of how the original story was probably told.  It is a very sinister, and yet uplifting tale of good over evil.  Little glimpses early on with Snow White reciting the Lord's Prayer while in captivity in the town is a forshadowing of the filth and evilness that will come and what she is going to have to endure to recapture the throne.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, disturbing, and wonderful, &#34;alternate&#34; telling of the timeless tale.<br /><br />Have fun, I think it is a must see.  The special effects are worth the admission alone!
0547884591|5.0|This book was truly everything I thought it was going to be and more. Every night since its inception, my life has consisted of cooking and reading this book. Beyond cooking it offers some great insight on learning. More importantly steps and system of deconstruction that really can be applied to anything. Since I started following Tim from his frist book and blog he has been the kick in the ass motivation for my business and journey of learning. The book I truly believe whether you think it or not will have something that can be directly applied in anyones life. Thanks TIM!
B0055EDCGU|5.0|I have been following this band for years. I own all of their albums and they continue to be one of my favorites. This album is a decent release in my opinion, some dark guitar licks, kick a** drums and bass and some solid vocals. Glad I bought it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For 30 bucks this set is a total deal, especially for blu-ray. I was just going to purchase the dark knight rises but after seeing this on sale for 30 bucks, i just went for the set.
B003B02OOG|1.0|These stories were not worth themoney. Each ended in a weird way and abruptly. I felt like these were stories that were not good enough for a book so they were cast aside. I usually like Grisham.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The history you learn in this book is awesome!  Stephen King did tons or research in order to make this book very realistic!  Great read!
B008XNZMOU|3.0|My 7 yr old niece loves her. But if you're not a 7yr old, or doe eyed teenager in love- probably not the cd for you.
B00384NXX6|5.0|This is one of my favourite dark comedies, poking fun at religious dogma in an intelligent way, but never missing the cheap shots either. Read the reviews on imdb, rotten tomatoes etc.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very inventive apocalyptic tale with engaging characters.  Like Hunger Games, it was hard to put down.  I would have given it 5 stars other than the jarring and inexplicable appearance of the F bomb coming from the character's mouths in the last chapter that almost made it appear as if another author had taken over.  It was so unnecessary.  I would not recommend this for younger readers because of it.
B001HN6918|5.0|I would like to say thank you .This movie along with several other items i purchased arrived nice and fasrt.Also was in really great condition.I do not see scratches or anything .Thank you so very much
B009329Y30|5.0|Great love story, read the book first because there are details you'll miss out on. After reading the book I looked so forward to seeing the movie. Just right. :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok I wish the points accumulated faster! maybe some better graphics. some games are boring others are impossible. needs to be more creative
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Now I can watch Netflix and Hulu on my tablet (Netflix app will not work).<br /><br />Do not need Hulu plus.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|I was very happy with this item. All three movies were perfect. Thewy did not skip or anything. my son is very happy with these. Thank you so much you guys
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|I have seen Polar Express many times...however, this was the first showing at my house for our 2.5 yo and 5 yo.  They were enthralled by the story and loved watching it.  From a parents perspective, this is a great Christmas movie full of magical wonders.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this Bible App. I now have access to reading the Bible more because I have my Kindle Fire in my purse.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good MahJong game. Plays quickly. I find this game relaxing--clears the mind!  Can be challenging, too. Hope you like it!
B003FXXNH6|5.0|thank you so much.I am always very pleased when an item i ordered arrives quickly.And when things arrive in great condition as described when shopping.This dvd also is a christmas gift.Thank you for makeing it available at such a great price.Thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE SEVEN BUCKS!!!!!  I'VE BUILT SO MANY THINGS So I HAD TO CREATE LIKE...  15 WORLDS ALREADY! IT\\"S REALLY GOOD FOR ROAD TRIPS. THE GAME WORKS PERFECTLY. NO GLICHES OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT YOU SHOULD BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEAT PHONE/IPOD GAME EVER! GAME IS FOR ALL AGES.
B006T5G73Y|2.0|They had a chance to make a great movie but failed. They spend too much time on the gay rumors. Its basically what 2/3 of the movie are about. Don't start thinking I'm a homophob because I'm not. I just wish they would've stuck with the facts.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want Pc but I think its prettty cool because all my fronds play it so I think its cool&bull;
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Yes i recieved my dvd very quickly. When i opened it and checked it out ,i was very happy to that it is not scratched up.It is in really great condition. And i am very pleased.Thank you very much
B0072OFM28|5.0|Was very good second season.  It continued quite well was surprised to see lucy lawless come back.  The replacement Spatacus did a good job.
B001VNB54A|4.0|The Pacific is great. I'm about to catch a lot of heat for the blasphemy I'm about to say but I think the Pacific is better than band of brothers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I put off reading this for a while because I just didn't like the idea behind it.  What a mistake.  The books read like a mystery, and they honestly get better the further you get in.  I'm on the 6th book now and I have to sum things up with this:  If you don't like these books, then you sir or madam have no ability to appreciate a tragic and beautiful story.<br /><br />This will be a classic.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Yes i have recieved this dvd movie along with other items.I am always pleased when my items arrive quickly.Especially so closer to chritmas as this is a gift for someone else.Thank you very much
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|When I listen to Mitch as lead on the Bell Carol, or, I believe, Avi, lead O Come, O Come Emmanuel, I actually tear up at the beauty of their voices.  Kevin does a trumpet solo, with just his voice, and Scott Kirstie are amazing as always.  The vocal talent of this group is simply unsurpassed.
B006YC74E8|4.0|This is the best photo editor app by far for kindle fire. I really like it because its the only Fire app with custum cropping. By custom I mean it lets you touch the parts you want to crop. The app is hard to get used to but it gets easier to use after several uses. I think it could get better by including a tutorial or better directions. There are better apps for iphone but this is the best one for Fire.
0547884591|5.0|Whether you love to cook or hate it, the 4HC is a terrific read and extremely educational. Just the section on knife skills could have taken a month in a classroom.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie pretty well. It followed the book's storyline & the characters were depicted well. The werewolves were a bit fake, and hard to take seriously in one scene. There were a lot of romantic scenes between Bella & Edward, which were in the book, but didn't need to be fully portrayed in the movie (I think the director got the point across). Definitely a good end scene, which made me excited for Part 2 of the movie. I would recommend this movie to young adults and adults (ages 15-60), but not to young kids or elderly people; my grandma would not have been able to handle the movie, especially since she couldn't even handle the first movie (Twilight). Overall, a good portrayal of the much-loved book, Breaking Dawn.
B005IUYE1S|5.0|Much to my surprise, this wasn't a romantic tale about boy meets girl (with a bunch of commotion thrown in).  It was about a man's dream and the conquest of a mountain.  Written with dignity and really makes you care for the characters.  The reader was also very good.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
0547884591|5.0|I must confess unloved the book before I cracked the spine. Who else could right how to books that you look forward to like a Serial trilogy?<br /><br />And boy did it deliver. Only 2/3 through and I have memorized pi to 20 places, cooked 4 outstanding dishes, butchered my own chicken (the difference in the cost of organic pieces to butchering paid for the book) and I learned to shoot a three pointer.<br /><br />How many cook books can say that?
B001HLZMUE|5.0|love love love love love love this movie.<br /><br />love. so much love.<br /><br />buy it. buy it now.<br /><br />that is all.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Good looking phone case; not clunky.  I've dropped it a few times (by accident, of course) and my phone still works fine. Makes it easy to find my phone when it's inside my purse.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|My daughters ages 6 and 10 enjoyed the movie, but unlike many other Disney movies aren't asking to watch it again and again.  I'd definitely say it's worth renting or perhaps owning if a person is a Disney collector.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and would surely suggest anyone who likes Men In Black get this.It's a great addition to the Men In Black series of movies. The only reason I didn't give it another star is that I felt a bit more back ground filling in might have helped. A good buy.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Apparently very glitchy. I try to open it and it checks for updates then says I'm not connected to the Internet, even though I just downloaded the additional 32mb. I tried restarting my kindle, I tried reinstalling the game, but nothing worked. Still not working.
B007YOC4RW|5.0|I had held off buying this CD, expecting to receive it as a Christmas gift. When Amazon offered it as a download for $3.99 I had to get it and plan to offer an apology in a couple of weeks. But honestly, after listening through the CD about a dozen times in about a week’s time, I'm not really sorry I got it early.<br />Joe Bonamassa is an exceptionally gifted guitar player. He can play Blues; he can play Rock. He is at his best when he smashes them together in a driving, heartfelt, sweat-stained way that leaves you almost breathless and wanting more. Driving Towards The Daylight accomplishes that very nicely... I want more. I give the CD just 4 stars but feel like I'm cheating it a little bit because the more I want is to hear these songs played live. I can only hope that Bonamassa's next live release will include a few tracks from Driving Towards The Daylight.<br />The title track is a masterpiece and is worth the price of admission. Dislocated Boy, Lonely Town Lonely Street, Heavenly Soul and Somewhere Trouble Don't go round out my favorites but there isn't a bad song on the disc. Each time I listen, I replay a different song or two because they catch my ear just right.<br />If you are new to Joe Bonamassa, you can't go wrong with any of his albums. If you are a Bonamassa fan, buy this CD and request next-day delivery or get the digital download and avoid the wait. Aw heck! With a recommendation like that, I've got to give this album 5 stars. It really is that good.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|You either have to love this show to buy it, or be a collector, becuase by the 5th season we all know the punchline.<br /><br />This was probably the most exploring season in terms of character's backgrounds (foregrounds, sideways-grounds?) in the alternate reality world. I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it yet, but this is a must have for any LOST fan!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I chose 4/5 because I think that this book is absolutely lovely. It read it during 2 days because i could not stop reading, and the only negative thing I can say about it is that for maybe a few score of pages, the story slows down and slightly breaks the immersion. Otherwise though, this book is incredible!
0425263908|5.0|You will love this even more.  Alot of likeness at first that was kind or irritating, but once you get into this, you will fall in love with Gideon and be saying &#34;Christian who?&#34;
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|The game functioned properly on my Galaxy SII SkyRocket. I played the game for a few days, probably 20 or 25 games. It was okay. Nothing overly good nor overly bad about it. I just didn't find myself drawn to  it when I had a few minutes to kill or to keep playing it for long once I started.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Amazing price on the complete Harry Potter collection. If you are a true fan (not hardcore, like some) then this is the collection for you. All 8 feature films in one packaging. This collection will make for the ultimate Harry Potter marathon.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|The selections are not the usual Christmas songs.  Give a warm, calming feeling for winter; however, there are selections that really make you want to move around to get warm.  Enya's interpretations are always interesting.  Love the change from the usual Christmas music.
0425263916|5.0|I love Gideon and Eva,  I have to say, this trilogy has 50 Shades beat!  And I loved 50 shades as well.  I wish it wasn't going to be so long before book 3 comes out.  I am longing.....
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is one of the GREATEST APP EVER!!! I donwloaded it on 2 devices! If anyone doesn't like this app I'm upset with.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|el articulo llego rapido, bien empacado y en buenas condiciones. la serie sigue siendo una de mis favoritas. tiene mucha accion e intriga.
B00632HWOG|5.0|easy to use. i would recommend this to everyone. also easy to access and organization of mails is convenient and easy.
0345803485|5.0|If you have not read this trilogy by now, all I can say it WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  Amazing and well written.  Buy all 3 while you are here!
B00540G3G6|5.0|I can't say enough about how good The Nightmare Before Christmas is.  It's a great movie to watch on Halloween or Christmas and is definitely a great all around family film.  Like most Tim Burton films, some of the characters may be a bit creepy to some very small children, but it shouldn't be too much to handle.  The movie has a nice blend that is enjoyable for both kids and adults and will have you singing along throughout.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|el articulo llego rapido, bien empacado y atractivo empaque. vi la serie completa. mucho dramatismo y accion. bla bla bla
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I tried to read the book.  I thought the premise sounded fun and interesting...For the life of me I couldnt make it past chapter 2<br />No connection between the two, no fluidity in reading.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|Excelente!!! A great disc, powerfull and beatiful!!! the best disc of the year 2012, Dylan in fire, regards, victor morales
1442337966|4.0|This book opens your eyes to other possibilities in this world. It opens up your mind to new thinking. very good book
B004UIOUHC|2.0|You'd think someone would come up with a good web browser for tablets! Actually the Chrome browser is good but doesn't work on all tablets.  This one is no better than trying to use a cell phone's browser which means you can't see anything much on the screen and nothing works.  For instance if I try to open Hulu dot com it freezes before all the pictures are displayed on the screen and none of the videos will play!
1609611543|5.0|You will love it! It is perfectly laid out and a breeze to read! Very informative and wonderful resource book.
8866130931|5.0|Perfect companion for a high tech girl. Back up for all things digital. A nice place to jot down ideas, meetings and other items. Keeps me on track. And, with Moleskine, I'm in good company.
1451673442|5.0|I have just started the book but I can already tel this one is going to change my life!<br />D. Myers
B000AM2L1O|3.0|Overall, I was not impressed by this doll.  The plastic is hard, not \\"soft to the touch\\" as described.  The face is not as cute as the picture either.  The one we received has a lazy eye and two teeth that you can't see in the photo.  It's also made in China just like all the other dolls you'll find at Target or Walmart, so I'm not sure how they justify the $30 price tag.  My daughter shows no interest in Calin although she likes to play with other dolls... perhaps she'll like it more when she's older.  If I hadn't thrown away the packaging, I would return this doll and purchase a different one for half the price.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I was so happy to receive this movie so quick! It will be a Christmas present! Thanks so much for your speed!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book has lots of action as expected from John Grisham. Also, it shows a new segment of the shady side of the law.<br />Worth readying!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Interesting plot, better than I expected. I've seen better sci fi, but I did enjoy it. Liked the actors and effects
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't generally read anything military. With a spouse that was former 82nd and a son in the Rangers as well as one that aspires to be an Army sniper, anything military makes me very nervous. But I couldn't put this down. I thought it was well written
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Kesha is back and better than ever. Like others have been saying, there isn't any filler on this album. Hopefully quite a few of these tracks will be huge hits. Highly recommended for any pop fan!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Adventurous and entertaining. Not normally into books of this genre, but it had a more real life message behind the story.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Fun, sexy movie. Good entertainment, but predictable. The two actors have great chemistry together. Recommend if you want a chick flick.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss single handily saved anyone that needs a Christmas gift and they don't know what to get!  The amount of information in this book is unbelievable, I've already started cooking more food, strengthening my Spanish and learning how to speed read.<br />The color pictures are a huge help to folks that are more visual and the way he breaks down recipes make great meals look possible for a novice.<br />Thank You Tim Ferriss for another excellent Book.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|as stupid as stupid can be.but thats great comedy.THE DICTATOR reveils sascha cohen doing what he does best,stupid things greatly.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I downloaded this to give as a gift for a tree-trimming party & surprised myself by acually enjoying it! [insert my shocked face here] It's not as giddy, I guess, as the the stuff played non-stop in restaurants, grocery stores, etc. ad nauseum this time of year. And I find Zoe's voice restful -- clear as a bell, simple, not too try hard. I've actually listened to it a few times! & still enjoy it. Four stars on a Christmas album from me is like 10,000 stars from the average person!!
B005SBCVFI|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows on the air right now. Missed this one and the DVR didn't record. So convenient to stream a missed show! Very easy and a relief not to have missed it!
B004SBX112|4.0|This app, like the other Angry Birds apps, doesn't update or make the updates available on my Kindle. VERY frustrating.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I love this app!  Easy set up and works beautifully!  I have used this app on previous versions with other devices accessing my PC but this is my favorite with the increased landscape on the Kindle Fire.
B004W5T2RG|4.0|The actors are really good, especially Gwyneth Paltrow. Good story, good chemistry, I really enjoyed it. She would make a great country star!

B007IE4DT0|4.0|Fantastic vinyl for any Harrison fan. The audio quality is also excellent on these 'demo' tracks. Overall I was very happy with the purchase.

B0041KVV8K|5.0|(all music links are to vintage LPs)<br /><br />Of the three compilations released in America while the Beatles were actively recording, (\\"[[ASIN:B000FHDSN4 Yesterday & Today]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000RTSDKI Yellow Submarine]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000TBI40I The Beatles Again - Hey Jude]]\\"), YELLOW SUBMARINE was and is the most universally dismissed. Yet, this record truly deserves a fair shake, for it has more than its share of quality rock and orchestral music.<br /><br />Side One of the album is absolutely solid. Yes, the title cut and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" are retreads-- but they're GOOD ones! \\"Hey Bulldog\\" stands among the unit's best recordings, as an expression of joy and a work of solidarity. \\"All Together Now,\\" with its odd noises and pure enthusiasm never fails to bring a smile. \\"It's All Too Much\\" can be hypnotic and you strain to hear everything as it slowly fades away (\\"MUCH too MUCH too MUCH too MUCH...TO-OO much TO-OO much TO-OO much...\\").<br /><br />This leaves the record's masterpiece, George Harrison's brilliant exploration into compression and out-of-phase sound, \\"Only A Northern Song.\\" Originally intended for [[ASIN:B000MU4F5Y SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND]], this swirling, disorienting track has to be heard through quality headphones (\\"cans\\") to be fully appreciated. (PS-- don't let anyone convince you that the \\"remastered\\" CD version which stripped away all the original's special effects, or this 2012 LP MONAURAL take are superior, cuz they ain't!)<br /><br />Now, on to the record's (dreaded) second side-- George Martin's moment in the sun, as it were. The instrumentals vividly call to mind moments from the animated [[ASIN:B00000JRUQ YELLOW SUBMARINE]] (1968) feature they were extracted from. \\"Pepperland\\" stands on its own as a superb recording, whiile the meandering \\"Sea of Time\\" and \\"Sea of Holes\\" are gently psychedelic-- 4 am music, perhaps. \\"Sea of Monsters\\" is indeed an aural nightmare. \\"March of the Meanies\\" has an effectively sinister air and \\"Pepperland Laid Waste\\" draws forth mental images of that magical place in ruins. The set ends with the martial \\"Yellow Submarine in Pepperland,\\" a recapitulation of the title track and a celebration of good Beatles over bad Meanies!<br /><br />Also recommended:<br />The American LP of [[ASIN:B000TBG8HY MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR]] is a superb mix of singles and atmospheric pieces like \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Flying.\\" Also included within the gatefold cover is a 12\\"×12\\" booklet of stills from the \\"Mystery Tour\\" BBC TV special.<br /><br />SIDE ONE:<br />[2:38] Yellow Submarine<br />[3:27] Only a Northern Song<br />[2:10] All Together Now<br />[3:14] Hey Bulldog<br />[6:28] It's All Too Much<br />[3:47] All You Need Is Love<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />[2:24] Pepperland<br />[3:00] Sea of Time<br />[2:21] Sea of Holes<br />[3:40] Sea of Monsters<br />[2:22] March of the Meanies<br />[2:15] Pepperland Laid Waste<br />[2:11] Yellow Submarine in Pepperland<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 39:57pperland Laid Waste\\" draws forth mental images of that magical place in ruins.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book is alright......people compare to 50 Shades while I can see the similiarities they are so different in their own way..I will read the 3rd in this series.......
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Sort of boring movie...couldn't really get into it. I like the Evil Queen and then lost it...the first was beautiful.

B007EHCNA2|5.0|Following its August 1966 debut, the Beatles' REVOLVER (ST 2525) was #1 for six weeks on Billboard's 200 Albums chart.<br /><br />The British LP (PCS 7009) is definitive, for  \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\"and \\"Doctor Robert\\" were removed from CAPITOL's American version so that the cobbled-together [[ASIN:B000TBIABQ YESTERDAY AND TODAY]] (T 2553) collection could grab a few million extra bucks from fans. Just another example of corporate greed taking precedent over artistic vision.<br /><br />Just as [[ASIN:B007Z2IAAI ABBEY ROAD]] (SO 383) was Paul McCartney's masterpiece, \\"Revolver\\" is John Lennon's greatest Beatles record. It is incredibly inventive, a nearly flawless work that belongs in every rock music lover's collection.<br /><br />Highest recommendation!<br /><br />PERSONNEL<br />Besides Paul, John, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, all playing many instruments, others who contibuted to this album are:<br />Backing vocals on \\"Yellow Submarine\\": Brian Jones, Donovan, Marianne Faithfull, Neil Aspinall, Pattie Boyd and Mal Evans (he also plays bass drum).<br />On \\"For No One\\": Alan Civil, French horn solo.<br />Producer George Martin plays piano on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" plus Hammond organ on \\"Got to Get You Into My Life.\\" He also arranged and conducted the horn section on this track and the string section on \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\"<br />Anil Bhagwat plays tabla on \\"Love You To.\\"<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[2:36] Taxman<br />[2:11] Eleanor Rigby<br />[3:00] Love You To<br />[2:29] Here, There and Everywhere<br />[2:40] Yellow Submarine<br />[2:39] She Said She Said<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[2:08] Good Day Sunshine<br />[2:03] For No One<br />[2:30] I Want To Tell You<br />[2:31] Got To Get You Into My Life<br />[3:00] Tomorrow Never Knows<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 27:47

B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|Dr. Seuss was an important ally in my children infancies. His works -in writing- gave them understanding of our english language & consciousness of pertinent issues with a political view in the best sense of politics: Get involved. Now. Use your sense of right and wrong -those are not negotiable- and seek the best for your community, even against the authorities (Of course, the USA is the country which started that by starting herself.)<br />A charming, funny, lesson-laden good movie. I'm happy I bought it.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Atticas shows how to be a real man. Taking on all things from mad dogs to racism. A great movie, especially in black and white, it is so powerful.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This movie is very good for a super hero flick, however I felt like the 3D version was nowhere near as good as it was in the theater.  They should have added more depth rather than using gimmicks, such as flyouts.  Overall - good movie, poor 3D presentation.
0345803507|4.0|I really, really liked the whole series.  From the first book you start getting to know the characters, the second book leaves you hanging, and this book completely leaves you smiling.  This book was definitely my little guilty pleasure.  It was hard to put down.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Better than most second books in a three part series.  Held my attention to the last page.  Looking forward to the next.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app. It helps me sooooooo much.What is great about it is that it tells you exactly how much battery is left, and how long it will need to charge. You can also customize the battery's color.  So I think you should get it:)
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Excellent book, well written and researched.  There are some sections of this book that will absolutely enthrall you and there are some sections that you will have to struggle through.  The story is phenomenal and worth those few moments of struggle.

B007KQ6XYY|1.0|When I try to run this game on my Toshiba Thrive, it reboots endlessly.  The original Cut the Rope HD - which I bought from Google Play, however runs well and I love that game. Even my 5 yr old is getting the hang of it now.

B00321MGPG|5.0|I am plenty satisfied with a 42 inch TV. But when I watch programmes like this - informative with amazing photographic footage, I wish my TV was an 8K model and the size of the whole wall..

0345803485|5.0|got this book for my wife to read and found myself reading it.  She has not even open it yet but I have finished it.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|It was entertaining, but not the best Reacher book I've read. Interesting plot but it plods along a bit too long in developing.
1439199388|5.0|This author has brought incredible scholarship to a poorly understood but extremely important health issue. His exploration of the latest discoveries in allergy, autoimmune disease and autism is masterful and nothing short of riveting. Highly recommended.
0525423656|5.0|Matched is one of my favorite Dystopian reads of all time, so I was very excited to read its sequel Crossed. Crossed is told from both Cassia's and Ky's POV. I felt this was very interesting and helped me get a better understand of Ky and why he's so reluctant about certain things. I also liked the read the conflicting things both Cassia and Ky think of each other, it helped me understand their love for each other and get down to the root of it. Crossed starts where Matched left off, Cassia sorted Ky into the group of men that were sent to the Outer Provinces to fight for the society. Cassia having realized her mistake and that this is basically a death sentence for Ky goes looking for him.<br /><br />I'm going to be quite frank here; I'm having mixed emotions about this book. Scratch that, I think the book was good I'm having mixed emotions at how little Ally choose to include Xander in this book. Excuse me while I rant...<br />When I first read Matched I was leaning towards Cassia ending up with Xander, even though I myself loved Ky there was something about the way Xander loved Cassia that made me want them to be together. In crossed the story is told in both Cassia's and Ky's POV, I found this both entertaining and annoying. Xander is only in the first few pages of the book which really annoyed me, I wanted to get to read about him more, Ally includes him in little things he leaves for Cassia but it still annoyed me, he should have been in the book more. While we do learn something completely mind blowing about Xander in this book I couldn't help but feel Xander never really got a chance to have the girl.<br /><br />In my opinion, Crossed suffered a bit from second book syndrome but not a lot. My biggest and really only problem with this book was how little Xander is in the book but other than that I found it quite enjoyable. Cassia and Ky's love proves to grow stronger throughout the series and the many obstacles they face both inside the society and in the outer provinces. I found the use of the story being told in Ky's POV help me lean a bit towards my favor of him ending up with Cassia but I'm still more team Xander.<br /><br />One of the things I loved most about Matched other than it's complete originally was how Ally's writing style was very poetic in its self. It was very beautiful. I felt that in crossed where were only a few moments when we got to see that again though. Crossed also features a set of new characters, Vick, Eli and Indie. All three contributed in making the story what it was and I felt Ally couldn't have created better characters for the people Cassia and Ky meet in the outer provinces. (SPOILER ALER) Although if I'm being frank I found myself not liking Indie all that much, it probably had to do with her liking Xander randomly.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual with Vince Flynn I could hardly put it down.  I can't wait for Flynn's next book.  Hurry Hurry!!
0679805273|5.0|I cant read this book to my 4 year old without getting a little teary-eyed. This book is a true representation of Seuss at his absolute prime!
0547884591|5.0|You will either love him or hate him.<br /><br />If you are a disrupter and not afraid to do the unpopular, you will love Tim's books.<br /><br />If you are a person that likes to conform, this book may not be for you.<br /><br />Tim is radical and a obsessive maniac, some people will love it, some people will hate it. At least he is saying something.
B000SC245E|5.0|Brother's HL-4070CDW printer is my work horse,  I recently had to replace the belt unit.  So far it is working as well as the OEM belt unit.
1451695195|2.0|I found this book very disappointing.  It was presented as evidence and yet, no clear evidence in the traditional sense was presented.  the arrogance of the writer was off putting while the unsophisticated, flat footed approach was somewhat condescending. I expected more from someone who is quick to flaunt his credentials.  I hope he is a better brain surgeon than writer and I hope that he doesn't think that he has to experience things to have proof if it is not in the current science teachings.  If this serves as a wake up for him to his own potential and consciousness awareness, great. But really? He writes as if the profundity of his experience trumps the other NDE experiences of others.  Shame on Eben's arrogance.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Is really fun to play.... does get expensive to by stuff though. Also, i can't log in to facebook for the posts. Missing out on free stuff because of this.
B001H5X7JS|2.0|The dvd skips and picture cuts outs, watched directly after receiving and opening so not a consumers fault, not happy with the quality of purchase
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I usually don't watch anime things, but the Final Fantasy VII story intrigues me.  You see the usual anime shenanigans (people making impossible jumps etc.) however, there is an explanation of how it done in this story.<br /><br />Advent Children is the last in the series (following Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, and Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus).  However, Advent Children is the only one in the game series made into a movie.  It might be nice if Takahiro Sakurai did the other three games as well, since their are references back to events that took place before the movie.<br /><br />It is the story of Cloud Strife, after things have fallen apart on his world.  People are now getting sick with geostigma.  Cloud is trying to find a cure to help orphans who have it as well as himself.  He is being stalked by three brothers with ties to his old enemy, Sephiroth.  There are sword battles and martial arts, as well as mystery, romance, and redemption.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Even if you have heard these songs before, Jeff Lynne still makes them sound new and fresh with his mellow voice, still great for over 40 years.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|can't wait to see the final conflict part two. this is to me the best of potter, glad to see him finally grow into his destiny.A+ on this movie too. this one makes you hate to see it come to an end.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|the movie itself is a great movie but the transmission was somewhat poor.  The movie would freeze and then go altogether
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really surprised me when I read the book and tried to reconcile it with the brad pitt movie trailer.  Wow, if the Zombies are that much faster than they were in the book, and in the book they almost exterminated manking, I fail to see how on Earth they are going to survive in the movie.<br /><br />Great book, sometimes I wished they would focus on one protagonist but I got used to the book style eventually.  The author sure knows how to add lots of different things from many different specialists throughout the narration, it reminded me of David Gerrold's Chtorr War.
0226264211|1.0|The problem with such idealism is that things like freedom are abstract concepts that only have meaning in relation to the context of human relations and social organization, thus it is difficult to define. Capitalism is a class antagonist system by default, so it begs the question, what is freedom? And moreover, who has it, and when? Capitalism has long been equated with freedom by its proponents for decades now, but what they don't tell you is what they mean by \\"freedom\\" - they mean freedom for the ruling, parasitic capitalist class to subjugate the labor of others, while they sit back and do nothing because they have an army of wage slaves to do all the work for them. And the freedom to discriminate against others based on their gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, etc. When they aren't doing that, they spread more pro-capitalist folklore and rhetoric (such as the myths that capitalists are the job creators and that the free-market solves all of societies problems, and perhaps the biggest myth of all - that capitalists and workers have the same objective interests - scientifically this is impossible: workers and capitalists have diametrically opposite and irreconcilable interests. This is a fact.), so the status quo stays intact. Capitalism has become so deeply entrenched in society, it isn't just a political economic system anymore - is has become something of a religion, with its dehumanizing alienation, \\"commodity fetishism\\", and reactionary politics - sold to all of us as our own enslavement guised under meaningless catch phrases and talking points like \\"freedom\\", \\"democracy\\", \\"individualism\\", \\"liberty\\", and \\"patriotism\\" - these are all idealistic and subjective, social constructs that bear little relationship or relevance to the material realities and objective processes of capitalist social relations - just ask women, minorities, the lgbt community, atheists, and normal working class folks. This book is one big neo-liberal logorrhea. Lol-bertarians and Randroids will cherish this book of course, but anyone with any sense who doesn't fall for the religious doctrine found within it should read Das Kapital instead or at least in addition to this, and learn the truth, because contrary to what capitalist propagandists will tell you, Marx was in fact RIGHT (yes, I am an unapologetic Marxist, because it is the only logical thing to be given the legitimacy of materialist conception of history) - his critiques and scientific analysis of the shortcomings and paradoxes of capitalism were, as Marisa Tomei once said, dead-on-balls accurate.. At worst, he underestimated the ability of the ruling class to protect its interests by making grudging concessions such as social welfare policies, but this only proves the Marxian point that capitalism does NOT exist on its own merits, and requires a heavy handed powerful State to protect ruling class interests and to keep the illegitmate system propped up, by any means necessary - whether through direct coercion, or though propaganda and deceit/false consciousness and table scraps for everyone else to discourage revolutionary measures . Most of the time, it operates under the latter, but when the system reaches a crisis and the interests of private capital are threatened (which, as Marx correctly noted, is inevitable because of capitalism's internal contradictions), direct coercion becomes necessary and we begin to see the development of fascism: a stronger police state, more military spending and jingoism, austerity towards important social programs, attacks against workers rights and unions (unions are actually capitalist institutions, but that is irrelevant to the point I am making here), racial scapegoating, and nationalistic fervor and xenophobia. So much for freedom - freedom to do what? To vote for your next bourgeois ruler every 4 years, even though both major parties are one and the same (since both major parties serve the interests of private capital)? Freedom to be a goodconsumer and blind patriot (want the latest ipad? no problem. Want universal healthcare and affordable education? not a chance!)? Yuck. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result. Books like this might be able to pull the wool over many peoples eyes, but certainly not over mine.  Capitalism is the biggest sham ever sold to humanity, besides religion itself.

B0026OE2O8|1.0|This so-called \\"documentary\\" has beautiful cinematography with most shots taken from what appears to be a blimp camera platform. Only a few shots are actually from space.<br /><br />Once you get past the beauty of the visual properties, the narration is 100% baseless propaganda. We had to switch the audio off, because we just could not listen to the preaching anymore.<br /><br />The narrator opens up with false claims that we have done more \\"damage\\" to the Earth in the past 60 years, than all of history combined.<br />The narration mainly consists of the usual \\"humans are bad and the poison of the Earth\\", and \\"we need to save the Earth from the evil humans\\". Much (if not most) of the film focuses on aerial shots of African farmers. The narrator then goes on to tell us how great these people are, and how society is destroying them, blah blah blah.<br /><br />DVDs like this should have to have a disclaimer label on the front warning us \\"Caution: The contents within is 100% bs\\"

A lesson I think needs to be taught to children, but only after a certain age of maturity. These present death scenes in a slightly graphic way but not so graph is as to describe every gory detail. Over all I really enjoyed them. :)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show. Best show on TV right now!!! Totally can't believe the the freak got killed. Wonder what will happen next???!!!
9626344695|5.0|Love this story and especially love it being read to me as I drive to work and back. Playing the Glad Game is so exciting and such an inspiration.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a good read - but after reading &#34;certain scenes&#34; I got tired of it. I would skip that part and go back to the story - which was really good.
B000000H40|5.0|I think everybody agree: this is the best Obituary's album...<br />very well structured songs, good sound, powerful riffs and guitar solos.
0440423023|5.0|This was another great novel in the Jack Reacher series.  I haven't missed any books in this series.  Mr. Childs, please keep them coming.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A little slower than some Reacher novels, but delivers suspense and Reacher's brand of humor. I will always read Lee Child.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not as good as book one, but definitely better than book 3. If you can stick to the story and not so much &#34;junk in bedroom&#34;, it really was a good story. Those scenes just got redundant...
0786962984|4.0|I had to buy it for the Nostalgia of the original old game...it is a great starter into the role-playing genre...without the role playing.
1439102430|5.0|Another great author with a fantastic new novel.  I really enjoy reading them, so Kathy, please keep them coming; can't get enough of tempe Brennan.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite writers.  Over the years I have read all of his novels.  This novel was well crafted and exciting to read.<br /><br />John Corey always entertains.  I look forward to the next John Corey tale.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in how quiet the Paul Brenner character was in this novel.  I remember him as much more outgoing in The General's Daughter and Up Country (one of my favorite novels).
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This last book was rushed - I think the author got tired of writing or ran out of things to write about. It seems she just wanted to wrap up the series....
B001EN71CW|5.0|I would recommend Fire Fly to everyone.  It is one of the best shows ever put on television.  I think it was just a bit ahead of it's time.
B000PMFS2I|2.0|Over hyped!  Not even good photography.  Would not recommend it.  Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors.  I have been reading his books for over 30 years.<br /><br />I enjoyed the second installment of the Century Series.  I would rate it as equal to Fall of Giants.<br /><br />It took me a while to remember all of the different characters from Fall of Giants with their children and others in 1933 when Winter of the World starts.<br /><br />I appreciate Mr. Follett's depiction of the raise of Socialism in Western Europe and was surprised at how close Western Europe was to voting in Communism after the war.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not normaly write reviews but felt compeled to after reading \\"Wool-Omnibus edition\\". I am not a fast reader, uselly takes me 2-3 weeks to read a book I like. But I got to a point in this were I couldn't stop. I had to know what was going to happen next, then after that, and so on, till I ran out of book. :( Didn't finish untill 1:30am. I read the \\"Molly Fyde\\" series and really enjoyed those so I tried out \\"Wool\\" Loved it!!! Thank you Mr. Howey I look forward to reading more of your work.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely love this game! Everyone that I have ever seen encounter this game has become addicted.... It's fun, funny and leaves you room to develop your own personal zombie-killing strategy.... It's one of those games that you can play over and over again! :)
B009KKLQKO|3.0|I'm a lifelong Beach Boys fan and was really hoping to catch one of the anniversary shows, but unfortunately wasn't able to do so.  I was hoping this DVD would be an acceptable substitute, but in fact what it did was make me happy I didn't spent the money on tickets to the show.  I'll sum up my feelings my misquoting Grace Slick when she stated that 60 somethings shouldn't be playing rock and roll, it just makes them look stupid.  It's even worse for 70 somethings.  The music had no energy, no urgency.  It was almost like Lawrence Welk does the Beach Boys.  Not even close to the energy I experienced at the  Macca show last year.  Sorry, but no more Beach Boy live shows for me.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly continues to keep Harry Bosch interesting and exciting.  As always, I enjoyed the relentlessness of Harry Bosch as he unravels this cold case.
030759565X|5.0|This book has great pictures, great stories and lots of new recipes. The cover under the book jacket is darling.  I like it much better than the jacket cover displayed her.  I'm a long time fan of her blog and this book is saving me from printing so much. :-)
1469984202|5.0|I am usually long-winded with reviews, wanting to speak on all aspects of that I'm reviewing. I'm not going to do that here, because after reading a dozen reviews here, I can clearly see everything I'd say has been, for the most part, already said.<br /><br />I do feel inclined to add that while this story may start off slowly, it builds so much steam that it becomes hard to put down. And, that the Wool series is without a doubt the best thing I've read in years. I feel incredibly lucky to have stumbled upon it.<br /><br />Well ok, one more thing to say... how often do you see a book with 2,584 reviews and only 358 of those are less than 5 Stars? And only 17 of those 358 rated it 1 Star. That should be an indication of the quality of the story/writing, as well as the low risk factor in spending the small amount or $ to purchase this great series.
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|Heart Pounding! I feel as though I should not be as enthralled with this series as I am, but I cannot get enough. It boils right down to the core of human nature when confronted with the need to survive; the best and the worst. We could all use a little reflection on stressing over morning traffic or fighting to get the greatest holiday sale. Yeah,it is just a TV series you say...perhaps I am being a little overdramatic. But...what if? What would you do to survive? The plain truth is we take the very fabric of our modern society for granted because most of us have never known otherwise in our lifetimes......if history proves anything it is that the only constant is change. Can't wait 'till next week.

B0036EDVS0|5.0|My wife and I love it!  This is by far our favorite version of this classic Halloween tale!  All of the actors do a great job and Tim Burton's vision of upstate New York in the late 1700's is just brilliant!  If you are looking for a great Halloween movie to watch, pick this one!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|i only hope this dosent really portrey the police orgs portreyed in the book. but was a very good story with a real different twist at the end.
076115678X|5.0|....but I will try not to. I grew up in eastern Canada close to Lake Erie where it wasn't uncommon to see the temperature reach 100 degrees Farenheit (before they went metric) and 100% humidity....yes, at the same time. It was like being in a steam bath, a hot steam bath...with mosquitos. And I was blessed with curly hair and my dear Mum's was naturally straight.  That meant she had no idea what to do with mine. She meant well when she gave me a Toni home permanent. After all, perms worked for her! I spent that summer with a bush on my head. When I reached my teens I began wearing rollers, hard ones, to bed, so my hair would be smooth for school. Fast forward to 2012. I am a senior citizen now, living in California, where at least humidity is not a problem. But all these years I have struggled to subdue my curls. No more! I discovered Curly Girl while perusing Amazon. And voil&agrave;...here I am, a curly girl and proud of it! I ordered two books for a couple of curly friends and one for my daughter. All three have been liberated, in fact one friend said it has been a life changing experience. I am going to send a copy to a dear friend in Canada as well. Poor dear is still trying to subdue her curls. Now I actually look forward to doing my hair and I have been getting lots of compliments.  They probably think I've had a perm! Life is full of surprises and this was one of the best!<br /> Olivia Wilding
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging and requires lots of thought. It is a great time absorber. It can become addicting. Even my granddaughter enjoys it and she is 7.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|Neither my wife or daughters liked this movie.  In fact, they thought it was very borring.  Unless you are just making a collection of show tunes, I would not suggest this move at all.
0307877523|1.0|The 1st 3 CD's said nothing and were very boring! I could hardly listen to them. Finally he said some practical things on the 4th one. I hope I'll have a better opinion after the last 4 CD's if I can get through them.<br />What a waste of money
B00571F26Y|3.0|Really enjoyed the book, especially the history of wheat. I have been on a gluten free diet for about a year and this book was a great resource. I also found some epic gluten free desserts in this book.[[ASIN:B0096FMC9M Gluten Free Diet? 50 Gluten Free Recipes for Yummy Gluten Free Desserts. (Healthy Diet Cookbooks)]]
0761169253|4.0|I really enjoyed this one, quick, easy, gets your neurons connecting.<br /><br />Good reminder on seperating yourself from computers when it comes to producing creative type work. We need that divide more than ever these days...<br /><br />Remix/The imitation chapter was really great. Loved the insight about not just copying from the masters, but learning about artists vision/perspective on things.<br /><br />Anyways, finished in a little over a hour! Cool illustrations, his website is pretty nifty too. Nice one Mr. Kleon.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This is a well thought out script with great action. Nice to see something original for a change. i would definitely recommend this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another thrilling Rapp adventure!  Vince does a great job bringing back past characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Vince's previous books.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Neil Gaiman paints a gigantic almost psychedelic picture on America's vast landscape both historical and geographical. Moving between fantastical tale and an insightful commentary this book is a must at least for those who have spent some time living and not just visiting the USofA.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|We saw the movie in the theater on Mother's Day!  Couldn't wait to buy it!!  So, it was a Mother's Day gift and now a Birthday gift as well!!  :D
B000H225MW|5.0|I sent this to my nephews as a christmas gift. My grandfather read this to us cousins as kids and when I saw it again, I HAD to get it. I know they will love it! No response yet, it isn't christmas!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Usually, to use a game hacker (such as GameCIH or GameGaurdian), you have to root your device (like jailbreaking) BUT, when you root your KF, like I did, you void your warranty. For some people, thats a big no no, but with this, you can manually change values and block ID's without all the confusing hex and hacking. Its very easy to use, there is no file or document browsing needed,  and as far as some parents are concerned, this should be absolutely no harm to a Kindle Fire. Great job!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I replaced another &#34;dead&#34; App for radio with TuneIn, then upgraded to Pro.  This App is much better than the old one. If I have any complaint about it at all, it's that it does not appear to allow me to set the &#34;favourites&#34; screen as the default first screen. It wants to start in &#34;Browse&#34; mode - a minor inconvenience. Upgrading to Pro is well worth it - given that I paid over four times the cost for one that vanished with no recourse. The speed and buffering are good and the search function is fantastic. I can search for a favourite syndicated show and have it list several stations where that show may appear. The &#34;Related&#34; tab also allowed me to jump directly to a different but related show after the first ended. Get This App!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really did not believe that Ken Follett could write a book that I LOVED more than I loved Pillar of the Earth.<br />However, Fall of Giants has put Pillars in number three and probably forth after the last in this trilogy<br />is released.  Thank you for your history lessons and the best thriller I have ever read.
B008COPZ60|5.0|this is a great cd i really enjoyed listening to every song. They dont get old you can just replay the cd over and over
B009GX69RK|5.0|Super funny cast - once again a great way to catch up on episodes without streaming issues or commercial breaks
1612191290|1.0|I must admit that I jumped into purchasing this book based on the sheer volume of positive reviews. That was a mistake.<br /><br />Read the 1, 2 and 3 ratings and then delve into some of the raging commentary associated with them. It will temper your enthusiasm and help you evaluate the real value of this book. If you are an anthropologist or a political wonk who wants to read between the lines, then by all means, buy this book and wallow in all of its complexities and contradictions.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/7/12--------------------------------------------------------<br />Note that virtually EVERY review on this book has one or more ratings. Note the pattern of reviews. Anything below a five star rating gets at least one or two negative ratings, some unfavorable reviews get HUGE negative ratings that are uncharacteristic in this forum. Conversely, any review at a rating of five gets at least one or two favorable ratings.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/23/12-------------------------------------------------------<br />Today, a major New York newspaper published online a very interesting article on the problem of manipulated reviews and steps this site has taken to remedy the problem. The review patterns for this book serve as a good example of the problem. Many of the comments to the article raise the same issues cited in my review.<br /><br />P.S. This is the first book I have ever purchased from this vendor that I discarded rather than passing it along to others. It is that bad.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really liked this book even though I pretty much knew where it was going from page two. I just couldn't put it down to see how it was all going to happen. I think like a dog, so really got into each page.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Impossible to put this book down - the intertwining of families and events simply thrilling and the way Follett kept the reader's interest was masterful.  Now reading part 2 with the same passion!
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|So easy to watch - no streaming issues, no commercials - best way to catch up when you are behind on episodes

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love hidden object games, so this was very fun to play. Graphics are very nice on the kindle fire.
B004QYTRRS|4.0|I know several people have given this movie lower ratings.  However, if you are going in with the idea of having and enjoyable evening, this is a fun movie.  I'm not rating this as a technical masterpiece, but rather the appeal.  There is love, action, suspense, and even some chuckles.  If you enjoy Johnny Depp and/ or Angelina Jolie, you will probably enjoy this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The plot was super predictable and disappointing. The Racketeer was definitely in the Grisham style but not up to his standard.

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This movie did NOT fall into the same trap as other re-makes, sequels, prequels, etc.<br />The attention to detail and references to the original TV show were great!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this story and I love Nicholas Sparks' writing.  I won't give away the ending but it is happy.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|Hiromi is a musical force that must be heard (and seen) to be believed. Her technical ability, combined with unparalleled improvising skills, are incomparable. This DVD captures her at her best.  Her band mates,  drum legend Simon Philips and bass god Anthony Jackson, rise to her challenge and make this recording a must-have item for any serious jazz-rock fusion lover.  Certainly, it isn't your run-of-the-mill jazz band.  There is not much that is 'traditional' about it, but, on the other hand, they never venture into 'smooth jazz' territory either (thank God!!!).  This DVD captures a marvelous performance, sometimes manic in tempo and full of ferocious improvisation, at others, highly lyric  and sweet; it is one of Hiromi's finest recordings yet. So, if you're in the mood for some unbelievable pianism, brilliant invention, and truly inspired music-making, this is the show for you!<br /><br />As an aside, this is Hiromi's latest concert DVD - her fourth.  I would highly recommend all of them.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a light, easy read for me.  Nothing earth-shattering, but fun.  Some good humor, and good chemistry between Meagan and Connor.
B002SRQ214|4.0|I wanted to give my HTPC, which I also do light gaming on, a speed bump. I was planning on just grabbing an i3 or i5 along with a new motherboard and new memory. Once I found this I decided to keep my motherboard and memory (DDR2) and pray that this would give me the speed I wanted. It really did give a great boost over the previous AMD X2 4000. It matches up fairly close to an i3 and when you consider the fact that the i3 would have cost more by itself, let alone getting a new motherboard and memory, this is a winner.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I hated was just how freaking loud the stock fan is. WOW, I have never heard a CPU that is this loud. Once I replaced that with a much quieter one I was happy.
1423140605|5.0|(written by a 13 year old)<br />  I first got into the Percy Jackson when I was in 5th Grade. Instantly hooked in, I couldn't wait for Rick's sequel series.<br />  So how is the Mark of Athena? Well, after 2 considerably solid books, Rick has made a better, darker, and more mature book, with humor thrown in for good measure. I seriously was surprised by the maturity of this book. Sure there's still comedy in there (team Leo, anyone?), but for the most part, it's pretty serious.<br />  Characters:Percy: I've read other reviews that state that Percy doesn't go through much character development in this book. I can see why they say this, but that doesn't mean that Percy still doesn't have any inner conflicts. He's just met Annabeth again after 8 months, and he doesn't want her to go out on her mission. A part of him wants to help her no matter what, but another part knows that this is something Annabeth has to face alone. This provides for some interesting thoughts from Percy. He's still that goofball we've all come to love, but he's gotten a bit more mature since the first book.<br />  Annabeth: Annabeth is truly the main focal point of the book. She had always been my favorite character (strange seeing how I'm a guy), and I had always wanted to know more about her. Rick goes all out in Annabeth's narrative, and we get to see just how Annabeth thinks.<br />  Leo: Leo literally hasn't changed a bit. Sadly, I had thought he would've been the third wheel of this novel, providing only comic relief. However, he actually goes through his own conflict too. He feels guilty about *spoiler*, and wants to make up for it. By the end, he is also a bit more mature.<br /><br />Rick has proven, once again to be a master at delivering cliffhangers that want to make you scream. I don't think I'm the only one who can't wait for House of Hades.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child has found an enduring character in Jack Reacher.  His novels are intriguing mix a little fact with fiction.  Suspenseful, compassionate and believable.  I recommend this novel and all other Jack Reacher stories.
0547884591|5.0|I've only tried a couple of recipes, but so far, so good.  I'm planning on working my way through the &#34;Domestic&#34; section after the holiday season, following Tim's plan in the book.  For now, I'm trying out recipes here and there, and they've worked out well.  (except where I've taken liberties...  I guess I should be following them exactly the first time, THEN modifying.)<br /><br />What I especially love, and this is true for all of Tim's books, are the commentary, humor, and embarrassing stories he puts in.  The only times I've felt the need to read something aloud to my wife over the last couple of years have been segments from Tm's books.  (and I read a lot)<br /><br />Also - I love reading books on my kindle, but I'm glad I got the hardcover of this book.  It's full of fantastic photos of food and food prep that I'm sure would have been lost on me with an ebook.  (I suppose you'd be okay with a tablet, but who wants to play with your ipad or kindle fire with your hands covered in cooking mess?)  Trust me and buy the hardcover!<br /><br />In short, I hope this book can turn me into a whiz in the kitchen, but regardless of the outcome, I already know I'll have a great time reading and following along!<br /><br />One side note, as I believe Tim reads these reviews -<br />Will there be a &#34;corrections&#34; blog post?  I was trying the &#34;Coconut Cauliflower Curry Mash&#34; recipe, and noticed that the shorthand instructions include 2T of water, where the longhand doesn't mention any. I only noticed because there wasn't really anything in the pot to bring to a boil in the next step.

030746363X|5.0|The year this book came out, I went on the HCG diet with some friends at work.  I lost around 20lbs in the space of a month, but was miserable by the end.  As soon as the HCG reducing phase was over, I went on the Slow Carb diet from this book.  I felt healthier, and lost another 10 lbs before I started to cheat.<br /><br />You know how it goes:  First there's a beer after work on Friday, even though Sunday is my cheat day... Then you think well.... I had a beer Friday night, and I'm off on Saturday too, how bad could a Sonic breakfast burrito be?  Oh, it comes with tater tots?  Don't mind if I do!  Then... the wife gets off work Saturday night and wants to meet for beer and pizza.  Finally Sunday rolls around and it's really cheat day!<br /><br />That being said, with the release of the 4-hour Chef, I'm getting back on the SCD!  Re-reading this book, along with the 4-Hour Chef made me realize how much I love Tim's writing.  I constantly find myself reading passages aloud to whoever will listen.
0547884591|5.0|I approached all three of Tim's books with a degree of skepticism however all three times he's proved me wrong showing his methods do work and they are good.  Do I use all of them? No, of course not.  But do I use a lot of them?  Yes. From losing weight, to implementing business techniques and now cooking like a fancy chef?  Hell yes, it's great.  I like how Tim writes because it's easy to jump around in his book.  He gets a lot of praise through the media and comes off as cocky, I know.  But man, he knows his stuff and I'm a fan - if he came out with the 3 Hour Chef, I'd probably buy that at this point.<br /><br />Good job Tim.

0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl wrote this book after having survived a concentration camp in Nazi Germany.  He realized that while we may not be able to control the circumstances we find ourselves in, we are able to control how we deal with our circumstances.  Most problems pale in comparison to what he went through, so if meaning can be found in the worst of places, meaning can be found in every situation.

B007Q0OUNA|4.0|This is my 3rd Lego LOTR set. I bought this one because I intend to use this to improve the other two sets which I love so much (The Mines of Moria and Shelob Attacks).<br /><br />The set as a whole is average. I don't find the scene memorable nor the Weathertop structure resembling much of Weathertop in the movie, thus I would find it more fun and challenging to use these pieces to instead improve on the other two sets.<br /><br />I would love for the Mines of Moria scene to have all of the Fellowship members present - so I get Frodo with green cape, Merry and Aragorn from this set; Sam from Shelob set; Pippin, Gimli, Boromir, and Legolas from the Mines set. I am only missing Gandalf which I am planning to get from the Hobbit's Unexpected Gathering set (when that set's price goes down a bit).<br /><br />The extra Frodo minifig goes well too as I will have a stung Frodo with the gray cape, Shelob, and Gollum for my other scene/set. I am still trying to figure out how to improve Shelob's lair using the rocks and the spiral staircase from the Weathertop structure.<br /><br />I would've love to have 9 of the Ringwraith w/ horses figures to have another potential scene/set, but that will be quite expensive to collect. I will be able to find other uses for the two Ringwraiths w/ horses that will be left (as well as the extra One Rings).<br /><br />Also, I bought this Weathertop set from a seller which cost me $44.50 (shipping and taxes included) so the price is fair enough (with 430 pcs, it is just slightly above $0.10 per piece). So overall, I believe it is a good buy.

1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed reading this but then towards the end it was too technical for my taste.  I did like the subject and his veracity for telling this experience.
B000YAFE0M|5.0|I really enjoyed the Columbo movies and TV episodes with Peter Falk, because he so irritated the murderer in his quest to prove guilt.  In this movie, the murderer taunts the rising-star prosecutor from the District Attorney's office and completely outsmarts him.  But the prosecutor has a bulldog resolve to prove guilt, even after the game is up.  Not many slow moments in this film.
0547884591|5.0|I ordered the book, both the kindle and print version. I follow the instructions, first time cooking meet. Everyone I shared with and fed gives the food 5 out of 5 starts. I've learned a ton about cooking, I've learned even MORE about learning. Must buy. Get the print version if possible, the pictures and lay out are killer.

B009O2XY12|4.0|Very addicting game to play.  I'm kind of happy that you have a limit on your energy or I might play longer and get nothing done.  Only &#34;problem&#34; is that I can't seem to figure out how the points system works.  I feel like if I solve a level quickly my points should be higher.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was nervous about spending this much money for a headset. I've had bluetooth ones and all kinds of turtle bay headsets. But this is top notch. So glad i got these. Only had them 1 day but already blown every other pair out the water. Easy to set up.<br /><br />***********Edit*********<br /><br />After having these headsets for a while. I can give some interesting feedback. Originally i was using Win7 when i wrote the review and these headsets worked great. Then i updated to Win8 and that's when things started to go down hill. The drivers for Win8 are not 100% and i have been experiencing drops in the connection. It's really annoying playing a game and in the middle of a cut scene the sound goes out. It typically re establishes a connection within 2-3 seconds but still super annoying. So beware if you have Win8 or plan on going to it. I installed my Win8 with a fresh install and did all the online fixes that i could find. (Connect to USB 2.0 port, use old drivers, etc.)
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love the app bc it gives me the convenience of Amazon on the go. I don't like that I can't sort by &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; like I can on the computer.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very engaging right until the last page. I would recommend this book to all my gal friends.I have read this author before and enjoyed her style of writing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a quick and easy game to play. I play it when I am waiting for my kids from school. Easy!
B00338QENI|3.0|It was just too wordy.  There was even a huge part at the end where the author substantiates every quote they made, who said what.  It was like an appendix of an appendix. The facts were interesting but it is written so that it reads like a giant list that gets repeated.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app for mixing your own ambient sounds.  I love that it's cross platform, and have it on my Windows Phone too.  just wish you could sync between the two through the cloud.

0205313426|5.0|If you write, you have to own this book. I suppose you could get all the info on the internet but nothing like having this reference with you as you are writing in a cafe, at home, wherever. It's not if you will buy it, it's when.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Great music. Great album packaging (attention to details!) that opens up and has a lyrics insert/booklet and even a black dust jacket to match. Nice heavy vinyl. Really aesthetically pleasing to hold.<br />I ordered this with another vinyl, and both arrived in perfect condition and pretty quickly with minimal wasted packaging. Overall great value for what you pay.<br />Stand out tracks: Freedom at 21, Love Interruption, Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy, Hypocritical Kiss, Take Me with You When You Go

B003O86FMW|5.0|The story is just as good as the first book.  At first the basic story seems similar to the first book but it plays out very differently with an older, more experienced group of characters.
B00422LESO|3.0|I guess I expected a little too much when I read this. I was expecting to be wisped away like I was when I first read Pride and Prejudice or Emma. That's not saying this novel wasn't good, because it was. The novel is a modern day remake of Pride and Prejudice where Jane is going to a resort where she would be playing the role of an Austen character, and actually ends up becoming a modern day Elizabeth from Pride and Prejudice. Now, the Mr. Darcy was pretty swoon worthy...that I will admit. I liked everything about him and his surly attitude. But, they are all actors so I wondered if he was really like that. Mr. Darcy isn't Mr. Darcy without the surly attitude and I'm not sure I would love him if he weren't surly. The novel was a cute read that had me smiling, but I found there were a lot of things that seemed a bit slow, and not necessarily important. I did expect some of the other characters to fit Austen's characters more, and some did, but some also didn't and I guess I will a little disappoint. But, I mean I couldn't expect just a modern retelling of the original story, because that would not be what Hale had in mind. I have to admit I still like the read. I smiled thinking about all things Darcy and all things Miss Elizabeth Bennet. I was brought back into the world of Austen and it would be a dream come true if I was able to spend a day in the story of Pride and Prejudice. I think I would potentially feel like Jane Hayes if I spent more time there that a day or two. I would probably get bored and want a shower. But still, one can dream, right?<br />Good:<br />Jane--a pretty good modern day Elizabeth Bennet with some twists of her own.<br />Mr. Darcy--the original bad boy always makes me swoon, and to dream that he could be real and in our modern world makes my knees go weak.<br />Bad:<br />The novel at times was a little slow.<br />Overall (Writing style, story line, and general):<br />Overall the novel was well written. I never had to re-read, and I never misunderstood anything. The idea of going to a place called Austenland was original and inviting. Some of the story line was a little slow, but overall the characters were unique and interesting to read about. And of course anything to do with Jane Austen and her characters makes me smile.sunderstood anything. The idea of going to a place called Austenland was original and inviting.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The overall plot is good, but there were two things that bothered me.  The editing / flow / style seemed very different from the first two, almost as if the author was rushed.  But most significantly is the atrophy of the main character.  The once strong Katniss is listless and dull.  Even in the midst of her heroism near the end she seems as though she doesn't care at all about anyone, anything... making it hard for this reader to embrace her character, and harder still to understand why any other character would want to, either.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the series on tv and watch it every season.  I am going to get season three as soon as it comes out
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was fantastic. It's not horror, but there is good and evil throughout.  The extent of details about the time period make you feel as if you are there.  I won't say what the ending is - but it genuinely surprised me.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|It works fine for Me! In fact I'm very impressed. My computer's OS is Windows7 64 bit and the 3.0 software works without a hiccup. I just received the Eagle Eye yesterday and within a half hour had it up and running in COD MW3 on the PS3. I had a new (old) Lite-on (Silitek) USB Keyboard SK-1688U lying around and an equally old OCZ MSQRD laser mouse that's adjustable (on the fly) up to 2500 dpi. And they both work great. After a brief initial trial in the game, I set the Look sensitivities up two points from where the were, and the Advanced Scope sensitivities up four points from where they were. Both mapped to the same Keyboard key, as advised. The in game sensitivity I set all the way up for the moment, I plan on playing with these settings as time goes on, but for now they work fine. Other settings like the deadzone might still need some further tweaking but that's not apparent at the moment. I mapped the Mouse with Fire, Reload, Crouch and Melee. The mouse movement is very fast and accurate and with the scope its hard to miss. I'm able to hit an enemy if even the slightest bit of him is showing as he ducks for cover. The same if he's running and weaving. I could never do that with a controller, not with any consistency.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The Author goes into great detail in expressing his own feelings and experiences about what he (his spirit) went through while out of body.<br />Not having experienced anything of this nature, none of us can try to explain it in terms of what our physical minds can conceive.  The Author did a great job in trying to express this in his book.  It is an excellent read for those who have the slightest interest in the afterlife, or concerns you may have about what happens after we leave our physical bodies and this planet.  I agree that our time spent on Earth is only a test that will determine how and where we spend eternity.  That decision is not ours and we have no recourse.  We will be judged in front of God himself when that day comes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book and the story continues to get better and better. Can't wait for book four of the series to find out what is going to happen next.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great story telling and science information that is not med-speak (written so the lay person can understand). I highly recommend this book.
0061474355|5.0|In Sabriel, and the rest of the Old Kingdom stories, both the world and the characters in it feel completely fantastic and startlingly realistic, allowing the reader to feel completely immersed in the magical world.
0553801473|1.0|I hunkered down and read Dance with Dragons having read the previous four in the series.  Ended up skimming the whole thing and even that was a waste of my time.  All the really good characters are left unresolved for the most part.  Dumbest thing ever.  Really, really, really frustrating and disappointing. I can't recall being so completely disgusted with a book and an author.
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena is so awesome like there is know way to explain it.<br /><br />1. But first things first the love triangle between Leo Hazel and Frank. No offense to Team Frank I'm way on Team Leo. For some reason there is a connection between Leo and Hazel.<br /><br />2. Shouldn't Grover be in this to. Can't Percy get a connection with him, I just miss Grover and his nature jokes.<br /><br />3. I like the way Rick put Reyna between Percy and Jason and how  Percy and Jason fight for the role of the leader.<br /><br />  I can't believe that Rick made me suffer through one year for the Mark of Athena and now I got to wait for another bloody year to pass by. And another thing I am going to cry if RR makes Percy and Annabeth break up or if they don't survive the FALL Dunn DUNN DUNN! And i think it was very romantic when Annabeth woke up Percy in the middle of the middle of the night and took him for a private tour of the Argo 2 and then they fell asleep. Then in the morning Frank went to go get them and seen them sleeping Annabeth woke up and said they went to go on a tour and Percy said well there was a little kissing. Annabeth muttered Not helping. Well right u guess make. Please review! If u like I'll write u back BYE BYE AND HAVE A NICE DAY OR NIGHT OR HANUKKAH! AGAIN BYE BYE:]

I've tried a few of his cooking tips and they are quite effective. I prefer it more for the other stuff than the fancy recipes though--I like food but cooking is still not one of my favorite things. Love the book though!
B0041KKYGU|3.0|Thought this movie was suppose to be HILARIOUS like so many people had said, but this ain't no &#34;Old School&#34;!
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Sometimes still hard to follow like most Mission Impossibles.  This one they had funnier characters and they tried to make you care more for all the people involved, it had more heart.  I don't know how Cruise is still pulling these stunts off at 50, but he's still fun to watch.  I would watch it again, but probably not own it.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|I love Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole series. But as it has gone along the books have gotten more and more violent and more fantastic. Plus I have gotten tired of the whole Harry/Rakel love story. His last book, \\"Leopard\\" made me not want to read his books anymore because it was to over-the-top violent for me. So going into this book I didn't have a  lot of expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked how I got some of the story from the point of view of the dead junkie and I also felt the story was a bit toned down. Plus I think it was his shortest Harry Hole book, a mere 300 some pages! It is certainly violent and there are cetainly some parts that are just too fantasitcal for Harry to survive, but the book was good enough for me to overlook those parts. There are lots of twists and turns and intrecacies to the plot that I have always loved about Nesbo's books and this did not dissapoint particularly the end. Enjoy!

0061474347|4.0|\\"Lirael\\" is the sequel to \\"Sabriel,\\" though the events of the story take place nearly two decades after the happenings of the first book.  \\"Lirael\\" does not focus on the Abhorsen Sabriel, the magical banisher of the dead, but rather on a young woman named Lirael and her canine companion, the Disreputable Dog, in their search for Lirael's raison d'etre. If you were particularly attached to Sabriel and Touchstone, you may have to adjust to the new characters, but you can do it. I believe in you.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" is a 'coming of age' story for multiple characters. As such, it is rife with passages of self-doubt, moodiness, and denial, particularly in the first third of the novel. Sameth, a secondary hero and companion to the titular Lirael, is also trying to find his place in the world after his Abhorsen mother begins to call him the Abhorsen-in-Waiting.<br /><br />Many reviews complain about the early portion of Sameth's journey, which gets a bit of a slow start. The tale does move slowly at first, before all of the characters have been united, and Sam's beginning is the most difficult portion of the Abhorsen trilogy to slog through. Lirael's journey through the Library of the Clayr can keep you hooked, and if you struggle through Sam's portion, just remember that you have Lirael's portion to look forward to in the next chapter.<br /><br />Lirael's humanity, her doubts and flaws in self-image, resonate with a reader who has felt dejection and exclusion. Lirael's relationship with the Dog is so real and touching; the reader desires a companionship so strong and honest. It is the scenes between Lirael and her best friend that give \\"Lirael\\" her heart. The Dog is one of the most charming, loveable characters I have ever read.<br /><br />If you have read \\"Sabriel,\\" \\"Lirael\\" is a must-read. If you are new to the Abhorsen trilogy, start with \\"Sabriel\\" and see if you like it.
0439023491|5.0|VERY GOOD! i loved the book just as good as the 1 st book! 10 stars if i can give it that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series since prison break...... i love it.  Trying to catch up so i can go to walking dead viewing parties at my local bar.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I agree with the one star reviews.  To accept this absurd story and ending the author was trying to shock us. It was an insult to our intelligence.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I do love this movie.  If you ever worked in a big corporation you will recognize many characters in this movie.  Really enjoyed the simple story. Mr. Lumbergh very funny!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great puzzle game, tons of fun.  All the puzzles and pieces of the puzzles make logical sense unlike a lot of other similar games in the genre.  Music and graphics are very relaxing.  If you loved Grisly Manor (which I did) you will love this one too!
B000066C6Z|5.0|Loved top secret.  A really stupid movie but makes me laugh as I did the first time.  Younger people may thing this is the worse movie ever but if you are around 35 will enjoy it a lot!!

B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love all of the Out lander books. I have read them all and nowI own them and will read them over and over.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|If you live with mental illness to a large degree, this film will resonate with you. You will understand completely the Bipolar mania that is usually so hard to describe, let alone act out. Bradley Cooper is perfect. His emotional highs and lows and so intense and spot-on, it's easy to root for him even though you're also quite scared of the next outburst. Jennifer Lawrence is superb and matches Cooper's intensity take for take. She was a favorite character among a perfect cast. She's also got an ass that won't quit, but that has little to do with how wonderful the movie was.<br /><br />The sexual tension is palpable, without there being more than one scene of sex that doesn't even include the two favored characters! That's good writing...when you can feel the emotion between the lines without everything being spelled out for you. One look shared between characters and the tears immediately start to rise because you just...GET IT. OK, I know that I am being a cheesy girl right now, but seriously. I mean it.<br /><br />Go see it.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Was better than I expected. Come in a attractive book with lots of extras plus the series of course.<br />Bought it as a gift / Then kept it!

0345803493|5.0|This book made more sense to what you were wondering from the first book. Questions were answered and you learned a lot about both man characters. The details were still just as descriptive and another volume that had me keep reading to see what was going to happen next.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a book reader but I read this book in two days. I was excited about downloading book two.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|From season one to season two they writers have really done a great job! The characters are great and so is the plot of the show!<br />This season will have you at your seat wondering whats going to happen, and in some episodes have you wanting to cry.<br />its definitely a mix of emotions but dramatic as well. The company now is seeing a lot of changes and harvy and jessica arent having it!
B006H5120E|5.0|This was great...definitely gave new life to an old favorite with the help of my 3D blu-ray player! It was awesome...it was like it was right in front of me!
0345803507|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books from the author more than ever. I expected the third to be the same, however, I did not feel that way. With the other two books I kept reading it none stop wondering where things were going, and what was going to happen next.  On my previous reviews I noted how this, but once I started the third book I just wasnt as interested as the others.<br />It wasnt the same.. and honestly I never even got to finish it. I didnt even want to. It had me reading more slowly and it wasn't having me pay attention like the other two.<br />There was somethign about this one that I believe could have been better. Now.. granted I didnt finish the whole third book but I got at least 4 or 5 chapters in and had to stop.

0060935464|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a literary classic on many levels. The book was a landmark work written in the context of the burgeoning civil rights movement. Harper Lee was a born and bred Southerner and she provided detailed descriptions of what is was like to grow up in the South. Her analysis was not autobiographical, but she clearly explained the peculiar mores, religion, academic institutions, and social norms of the era. Her detailed descriptions had a great deal of authenticity.<br /><br />She described the pervasive institutional racism of 1930's Maycomb County, Alabama. Tom Robinson, a black man, was falsely accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Atticus Finch was the lawyer who defended Robinson at the trial. Robinson was convicted despite spurious evidence and contradictory, inaccurate testimony on the part of the defendants. Scout and Jem finch were Tom's children. The story is written from Scout's perspective. She was a young grade school girl who came of age. Scout and her brother were forced to learn the sad reality of inequality and racism of the time.<br /><br />Lee was a talented wordsmith who described the setting and characters with intricate details. She was able to maintain suspense throughout the novel, especially regarding the recluse neighbor Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. The story was always coherent and even minor characters in the book were memorable.<br /><br />In short, this book was a masterpiece of the highest order. It is a compelling tale from a narrative perspective. The social implications of the book are as relevant in the present day as when it was written. This is a tale about how children come to the realization that the world is not always fair and there are people who are victims of discrimination and violence. This is a phenomenal book, one of the very best and most significant novels I have ever read.

B008O69SZ0|4.0|This album is,in my opinion,the best thing Hunter has done since the \\"Rant\\" album. There's more rock and roll and like any great Hunter album,some of the songs almost seem like you've heard them before. They have a familiarity about them. No one writes or sounds like Ian Hunter. You either love him or you don't,very few people are on the fence about that one. But once you get into this guy and his music,it sticks with you forever. It's like you're a member of a very cool,selective club. I've had the privilage of meeting Mr. Hunter and the late,great Mick Ronson when they were touring for the \\" Y U I Orta \\" album back in 1990. Ian signed a huge stack of stuff for me and was very gracious for the fact that I had been a fan for so long. I own everything the guy's ever put out.I've seen him live twice...once with Ringo's All Stars where he basically stole the show and previously with the Hunter Ronson band.<br />  \\" When I'm President \\" finds our man rocking again after the more laid back efforts of \\" Shrunken Heads \\" and \\" Man Overboard \\" ( both are really good albums )and the band is sharp and the production warm and punchy. Now in his early 70's,this guy rocks like a person a third his age. I hope we keep getting new stuff from this guy for many years to come. Like I said before,he's not for everybody,just for those of us who enjoy real music and not the stuff that corporate radio and VH1 try to shove down the thoat of the consumer. If he tours anywhere near me you can bet I'll be there. Thanks Ian...from another lifelong fan.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Great star power, one liners, full of action....storyline is only ok but are u really concerned about that when considering this type of movie?? im glad i rented it and u will be too.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Pro: A lot of light in a small unit. Great price point. The on/off sensor works extremely well (almost too well - pets trigger it). Battery life seems to be pretty good, usng alkaline batteries. Solid, well made unit. Con: I ordered two and one came with only 7 LEDs functioning. Credit and replacement was easy. If installing flat (like on a ceiling or under a shelf) the adhesive tape won't hold the weight of the unit with batteries .. you will have to use the mounting screws.

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My 10 year old son and 6 year old daughter love this game.  I spurs their creativity and they've been enjoying it for months now on our ipad.  I added it to my daughter's kids tablet and will add it to my son's as well.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I can listen and drive, and it reads to me.  It has a bunch of other features but I don't really use it.  I think it could be simpler though to operate.  Or it could just be me.....
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|The Eagles are so wonderful to listen to. Words, harmony, and this CD is played over and over again. Long Road out of Eden, and NO more walks in the woods are my favorites. The Eagles are timeless.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|Pretty funny movie. It was nice to see a fresh movie with most of the same faces. We enjoyed it. Same old cheesy comedy.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Only UV digital copy? No thanks. I won't be buying this. While I'm sure the movie looks great, I don't buy Blu-ray/DVD's that don't come with digital copies other than UV. UltraViolet is DRM Hell and useless.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME, so excited to finally buy this book, i am i big fan and supporter of Ferris and his books never cease to be both fascinating and educational. The methodical approach takin to learning skills is my favorite part of this book. I would recommend this book to just about anyone I know. This is a book you can go back to over and over again, it contains a vast amount of knowledge and insights.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|I'm here to help somebody out, hopefully you are the reader and Wiz Khalifa fan I'm speaking to. I'll try to keep this concise as possible. Now, where to begin? If you're like me, you only want the best for Wiz because he's such a game changer and his potential to put out monumental records is probably 2nd to none. He pushes and raises the bar in Hip-hop in such a way that goes under appreciated by many of your \\"Top 40\\" fans.<br /><br /> The production on this album is amazing. I believe Wiz has found and mastered his sound. It's so unique, uplifting and full of life.  His lyrics offer introspect and great ambition. In a way most rappers simply brag and claim to inspire, Wiz is genuinely encouraging his listening audience.  His union with Amber Rose only makes it better. There are less lines, if any, about fast women and more about getting to the money and less concern with the fame, your average rappers favorite topics to revisit again and again. It's ironic that when less of that is present, the fans who loved his past music start falling by the wayside, because he's not saying enough to them. He comes off as a lot more mature, especially since his star first started rising, and more intelligent than the competition. He's all about business, and his business is his art. He ups the ante on a few songs and shows off some of his new techniques that people who wrote him off for his content and favorite subject matter will indeed notice. I never want to hear Wiz Khalifa and the term \\"weed rapper\\" in the same sentence again. Wiz's game has completely elevated.<br /><br />\\"Taylor Alderdice\\" had raised a lot of expectations for this album. \\"Cabin Fever 2\\" felt like more of gift when he suddenly dropped it only weeks prior to ONIFC with zero promotion, so it was hard to appreciate from a critical point of view.  The concepts he introduced on \\"Taylor Alderdice\\" are fully realized on ONIFC. If you're a fan of that mixtape do not, I repeat, do not hesitate to support this record! The beats by Seldgeren (Initiation), Drummer Boi (It's Nothin), and Jerm (The Bluff), amongst others thump all throughout this project. By no means am I saying this is more of the same, so you'll like it. I mean the music has been completely enhanced and you'll absolutely fall in love with it. Not to mention, bang for your buck value with 17 tracks (20 on the deluxe edition).  If I had the opportunity I would like to personally congratulate Wiz on his success and thank him, his team, and the people working behind the scenes for painting this perfect picture of what he and Taylor Gang have to offer my favorite form of music (that seems to be going through a renaissance of its own, as of late). There's a lot of young talent out here folks. Oh, and lest we forget, it's Taylor Gang Or Die!ord!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is a new type of book for me.  Usually I read more science fiction and horror but I found this series a great read and hard to put down.  I started reading it before I watched the HBO series and now I cannot wait for the new season to start In March 2013.  I cannot wait to read the rest of the books.
0061474355|5.0|I've been reading fantasy for 20 years and this is one of the four fantasy books I recommend to anyone who says \\"I love fantasy.\\" It's amazingly well written story - and a refreshingly different setting.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wish this story were true!  Excellent book, beautiful, witty writing.  I found myself going back and reading the beginning again because there are so many interesting connections to be found.
0061474355|5.0|I must thank Mr Garth Nix for solifiying my appreciation for this genre. I read thisbook as a teenager and could not put it down. This book has truly stayed with me and is one I don't mind re-reading. I have since completed my collection and read the entire trilogy. It has remained on my bookshelf for over 10 years now. Unique and interesting story and characters. He pulls you into their world! Highly recommended!
0547884591|5.0|In my house I assemble stuff from the fridge and the cupboard on plates after using alchemy to changes some if not all of it.

Get this and short cut your way to great food.  If all else fails you can substitute the book for the gun and use it to stun a potential dinner.<br /><br />Keep being different, Tim.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Fast Five was the best movie of the Fast & Furious franchise to date. With the inclusion of Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson, the movie improved greatly. I'm looking forward to Fast Six.

0812993357|5.0|Highly reccomend this, essential reading for anyone remotely interested in fashion and styling.  Not so much about Vogue but more about life, a free spirited inspirational tome, about being yourself and making soemthing of opportunity and passion.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Humor is joined with action in Rick Riordans newest book. He really knows how to make a very good book.

B004MNE9US|5.0|I gave one to my young nephew, and another to my old father. both love it and enjoy very well. maybe a little pricey for simple toy, but if you see what toy you could buy for the same price,,, maybe this is a good choice.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book - it was an easy read that I was able to complete in a day (or two).  It had a wonderful message about perspective on life.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss has made a name for himself being an \\"Outlier\\".  I have read all his books and do not agree with everything he says, but I know if I read a Tim Ferris book I am going to be introduced to ideas that may seem crazy at first. Ideas that will improve my life if I implement them. This book is a new introduction to learning first and a plan to teach you to cook second.  Both parts of the book are great but in my case the first is more beneficial.<br /><br />This book will teach you how to learn or in my case teach.  I run a small  successful company (more successful and fulfilling after reading and implementing ideas from [[ASIN:B006X0M2TS The 4-Hour Work Week]]). I have implemented procedures to automate and streamline processes but still struggled getting 100% compliance on the procedures from employees.  It may be because the procedure manual was 10 pages of dense reading.<br /><br />Since reading the book I have redesigned our procedure manual to be more conducive to reading and retention. I've had the book for a week and my office is already running smoother.<br /><br />I know critics will try to undermine sections or ideas in the book, in some cases they may be right. I didn't agree all the points in [[ASIN:B006X0M2TS The 4-Hour Work Week]] either but I implemented the things I did agree with and we went from a hapless startup to a very successful business.<br /><br />Tim - Thank you for writing your books and blogs, please continue.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First book I have read by this author and i will definitely watch for other books by her.  Every page was entertaining and suspenseful.  The ending left me in a bit of a shock for about two days!

0316066524|5.0|This is one of those rare books that demands that you ignore the reviews.  Yes, I realize that I'm writing one, but trust me on this -- no one can do justice to the experience of reading Infinite Jest without actually reading the book (like comedy, and a frog, it tends to die when dissected).  So what should you know about this book, then, in order to decide whether to read it?  Do you enjoy reading books where the footnotes tell the critical parts of the story?  Do you enjoy books that are occasionally lucid tracts on addiction and at other times bizarrely comic slams on American consumerism? Do you like with Quebecois sepratism?  How about tennis?<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />You see, it just isn't possible to turn this into a linear narrative worth \\"explaining\\" and everyone who tries inevitably makes it seem boring, foolish or pretentious or some combination of all three.  Instead, think about it this way: Infinite Jest is a tour of the mind of brilliant polymath who desperately wanted to understand what it was to be happy or fulfilled when he could never do it himself, and the addictive ways we fool ourselves into thinking that we are actually happy.<br /><br />Random detail: I interviewed DFW when Infinite Jest came out, and he was a charming, self-effacing man with a keen eye for the absurd and so much self-awareness and minutae crammed into his brain that it must have been debilitating (he was like the narrator of the Borges story, Funes The Memorious, about a man who never forgets anything).  His death was a great loss, and reading Infinite Jest explains why.  That, I guess, is why you should read the book -- to understand how a great American writer could find America and still be so lost.
B0054U56B4|3.0|The sophomore slump definitely hits Gatlin, South Caroina in the second installment of the (generally) wonderful Caster Chronicles.  The first book in the series, Beautiful Creatures, was a fantastic effort to bring classic southern gothic tropes to a more traditional YA supernatural thriller/love story.  It even had a touch of literary aspiration, in the occasional echoes of Jeffrey Eugenides and the Virgin Suicides, and even Faulkner.  It wasn't perfect, but it was a great read and enormously promising.  Beautiful Darkness, by contrast, is still a great read, and still fun, but it lacks the resonance of the first book, and often resorts to some pretty lame genre cliches in order to move the story along.  No spoilers, but what had seemed like a simple story of a young woman forced to chose between the light and dark sides of herself (narrated, intriguingly, by her boyfriend -- and the male perspective on a story like this was quite clever), has turned into a rehash of many of the storylines of the Harry Potter story.  This is a story that works best when it isn't trying to save the world, but is instead trying to show us teenagers learning how to understand their own place in the world.  Still worth reading (I'm starting the third book now) but feeling a bit nervous that the story will trend more towards Twilight and less towards The Night Circus.  We'll see.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|This is a very good compilation of some of the best of the Stone's tunes.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that several of their really fine standard songs are not included!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Wow, this is very eye catching! A lot has been put into this game to make it just astounding to look at. The sound is okay, better than most games. I found myself playing it for the last two hours and it felt like oly five iTunes went by. In other words, look out, this is addicting!!<br /><br />The puzzles are great. Don't use the cheats, it really is more fun to figure it out o our own. I love it when something clicks and you make progress. This is a great ame, they should really make more like it. I think what I like is the layering within.... Sometimes a screen doesn't make sense until you get a vital clue... Or change the seasons... And then it becomes manageable.<br /><br />Bottom line: a ton of fun, beautiful, and challenging!
B000002JPA|5.0|To me argueably the best DT album.  Musicians that show they have the prowess to do anything with an instrument and with the addition of James Labrie on this album, it makes the band complete.  For those not familiar give the band a chance, they are and continue to be one of the best progressive rock bands of the time.  DT 30 years on and still making new material, try this album as one of DT's first.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I actually read Mark Millar's \\"The Ultimates Omnibus\\" which had a very similar tale to the movie but changed some things which I felt made it more interesting than the film. That said, the film is still awesome enough per my grade below.<br /><br />Many of the Marvel superheroes who had their individual movies are now brought together when Nick Fury (played by Samuel Jackson) using the \\"Avenger's Initiative\\" to call them up during a crisis related to the Tesseract (an all powerful energy source among other things) which eventually leads to showing the Avengers going from disjointed to united and especially so in the last part as Earth has to deal with an invasion from aliens. Who else but the Avengers is going to save us?<br /><br />It's an all star ensemble playing various Marvel heroes and mortals (who all get their little personal scenes before they join the big story): Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Hulk, Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Jeremy Ranner as Hawkeye, Chris Hemsworth as Thor. Clarke Gregg as Phil Caulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Paul Bettany as Jarvis and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper. Yes, that's the voice of the old Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, and look for the usual Stan Lee cameo.<br /><br />One of the greatest strengths is surprisingly in the characters and how they show their different views on getting the job done. Compare Iron Man (a la Tony Stark character) to Captain America (a la Steve Rogers character) when they begin their big argument. I'd say the best presentations were a tie between the \\"new\\" guy, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr., the \\"old\\" guy of the Marvel films. Also, as far as supporting cast go I was quite impressed with how they developed and presented the character of Phil Caulson (played by Clarke Gregg). Note that I am basing this on an action superhero movie, not character driven tales, so it's a bit of a curve you could argue.<br /><br />Action was over the top and flirted at the borderline of losing the audience to special effects but I felt they pulled it off well enough.<br /><br />Hardcore purists might argue that Hulk should be the only unstoppable force followed by Thor but I'm just getting into the Marvel comics so I can't fully comment. All of the heroes got to be awesome and that's what one would expect from the all star cast. They aren't going to agree to play a lame or non memorable character, right? Another viable criticism by said group is that the Avengers were not formed in the movie way but most people probably don't mind.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $220M and it made over $1.5B at the Box Office. A sequel is naturally expected. Stay after the credits for the two teasers. That's pretty much something you need to do after every Marvel fan these days, I suppose.<br /><br />Trivia and spoilers below.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.<br /><br />TRIVIA (IMDB sources): Edward Norton was originally set to reprise his role from The Incredible Hulk but negotiations between him and Marvel Studios broke down. Norton was replaced with Mark Ruffalo.<br /><br />According to Joss Whedon, the film is strongly influenced by the early 1960s Avengers comics, which he was a fan of while growing up: \\"In those comics these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team - and that is the definition of family.\\"<br /><br />This film holds an unusually high number of Academy Award nominees in the cast/crew for a comic book movie, or most movies for that matter: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, director Joss Whedon, and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, possibly many others. This tops Iron Man 2, and Iron Man which each had four nomineesa piece.<br /><br />According to director Joss Whedon, the original cut of the movie was over 3 hours long. About 30 minutes of the excised footage are included on the Blu-ray, most of which revolves around Steve Rogers (Captain America). Whedon revealed that one of these scenes involved Rogers struggling to adjust to the modern world in his Brooklyn apartment and another revealed Steve Rogers' reunion with Peggy Carter, his love interest from Captain America: The First Avenger. Chris Evans has since announced that the deleted scenes with Captain America will be used for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br /><br />To prepare for the role of Agent Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Jeremy Renner was trained by Olympic archers.<br /><br />After Thor takes Loki off the Quinjet down on the mountain side, two large ravens fly by them as they are talking. In Norse mythology, their father, Odin, had two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who would bring Odin information from Midgard (Earth).<br /><br />The twelfth film to surpass the $1 billion mark worldwide, and the tenth to surpass the $400 million mark in the USA. It tied with Avatar and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 for surpassing the $1 billion mark worldwide in the fastest time (19 days) and set the record of surpassing the $400 million mark in the USA (14 days).<br /><br />Amanda Peet was considered for the role of Agent Maria Hill.<br /><br />Loki's staff which has a glowing blue gem in the spear head that allows him to control the minds of others is a reference to the Mind Gem. One of the seven Infinity Gems used by Thanos, who is the character shown in the post-credits scene to be the leader of the Chitauri.<br /><br />SPOILERS: I thought Thor broke the portal between Earth and his homeland so how did he return? I know how Loki returned but it seemed as if Thor was already hanging out on Earth before that incident. BTW, what happened to the Natalie Portman character?<br /><br />Hulk had the funniest action scenes, especially when he picked Loki up and beat him to a pulp. Loved it!<br /><br />Thor is a God, not a demigod per the picture. Was that said to satisfy the religious types who don't want \\"pagan\\" Gods being called, well, God?<br /><br />Most fans wanted to see Thor go at it with Ironman and Captain America and then at a later point with Thor. You got it. I would recommend you also check out the graphic novel I mentioned above.<br /><br />I liked the Thanos teaser and I'm curious to see what they will do with him in Avengers 2.
B0000AFX64|5.0|I loved the series in the late 70s but never saw this opening 2 hour movie. I was impressed by the video quality of the DVD and enjoyed being back in the 70s for awhile.
B004EPYZQC|3.0|The popular franchise continues though this is the first of the bunch I have seen and critics say it's the best of the current five.<br /><br />Tale focuses on a team of criminals who break out their leader, played by Vin Diesel, and then escape to Rio. During a car heist on a train which defies the laws of physics at time they stumble upon something bigger which puts them deeper into the criminal underbelly. Enter the DEA agent played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Overall, I was more impressed with the action scenes and cinematography and found the story and characters hit or miss at times though I did like the bait and switch move at the very end and the reaction of the DEA character played by Dwayne Johnson, who played an edgy, buffed out no nonsense style character who still had a sense of humor.<br /><br />The action scenes in the latter half are so many at times in the tale that it felt like it diluted the overall story. That said, let me reiterate the action scenes were borderline awesome at times and the shots of Rio from above as well as the city made me want to visit. There's enough quality in the picture for me to probably check out the earlier films.<br /><br />This film was partly filmed in Rio. The budget was $125M and it made over $626M at the Box Office.

B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Very nice and funny movie, my kid enjoyed it very much and we also liked it. A nice story and different one too.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|Two buddies with very different lifestyles (Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman) make a wish together that they wish they had the life of the other and guess what happens? It's a tale that has been done many times in the past but the skill and comic delivery by the two actors really pushes the quality of this picture up. It isn't so much in their beginning roles but when they switch off and you see said actors playing their counterparts quite nicely.<br /><br />Also starring Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and Leslie Mann. Sorry but the nudity scenes were mostly body doubles and CGI, people. Did I destroy the fantasies? Heh.<br /><br />I didn't care for the potty humor, especially in the beginning, but it picked up thereafter. The ending is predictable. I would have liked it if the two characters made another choice.<br /><br />The budget was $52M and it made a bit over $75M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; HUMOR: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of November 2012 (non rated version); OVERALL GRADE: B.
B009JBZH54|1.0|Not a knock on the movies, but the Batman Geins disc was not included in the package.  THe holder was simply empty.  I have started the replacement process.  The book looks great.
0307887448|4.0|Won't get into the details. Here's a list of all the overarching factors that I think come into making a book either good or not:<br /><br />Voice/Narrative: First person POV. Distinctive, believable and consistent throughout the story. The main character doesn't get lost into too much exposition, but he doesn't assume too much either--which is important in Sci-fi! Though some parts seemed rushed, the narrative did a good job of maximizing the appropriate effect in the various scenes and events of the story. 4/5.<br /><br />Plot/Storyline: Unique and extremely specific. If you didn't grow up in the 80's, make sure you keep close to your laptop when you crack this bad boy open. Believable and legitimate turns of events, ending wasn't obvious nor was it totally oblique either. Kept my interest throughout all 300+ pages. Never loses pace. 4/5.<br /><br />Characters/Setting: The setting for me is just another character in the story and here, I think, is where the book is at its best. Both the world and characters in Ready Player One are, in a word, sublime. Complex, charming, and just plain awesome! And if your wondering which do I mean here, the world or the characters--I mean both. 5/5.<br /><br />Last but not least...<br /><br />Figura/Symbolism: This I attribute to the philosophical issues a book addresses or brings to light. Those things that make us stop reading a moment and tilt our heads slightly the left. Throughout the book, I thought I could detect a subtle hint of something. It was faint, and neither the characters nor plot acknowledge the issues they seemed to dance around. This is understandable, since I assume that was not what the author was intending to accomplish when he wrote this book. Its just not that kind of novel, bro. Still, theres a little something there, and though those of you who like to question gravity would probably be itching for a more explicit approach of these issues, just know that the rest of the story will more then make up for it. 3/5.<br /><br />Overall, as my rating obviously displays, this is a definite must read.<br /><br />Also, if it means anything, theres a movie on the way!!<br /><br />This has been Malek, over-and-out.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|A delightful story.  The ending is a bit odd.  Haven't quite figured out what it all means but I'm glad I read it.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|All 5 stars...everything about this film is fabulous...acting, storyline, script, and cinematography...even the sound.  John Goodman is superb and headlines this ditty about religious fanatics gone berzerk.  A must for movie buffs.  There's nothing in this genre to compare it.  ALL 5 STARS!!!!!!
B007SSEBCU|5.0|The movie provided great look into English government. Meryl was wonderful.  My whole family enjoyed it and I would recommend it highly.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Loved the show, hated that it was canceled. So glad when they made a movie, & happier when I found it again, here. Quick delivery & good packaging. Disc is in excellent condition.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|This App does not work on the Kindle Fire HD. I really hope Amazon gets it together soon because syncing my FB photos would be wonderful!
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Lost interest early when it got too weird. Scanned rest of book. Glad I didn't read it as it only got worse. This is just not my interest. My fault for not knowing it was more science fiction than mystery.
1451695195|1.0|My BS alarm rang off the wall when the good doctor explained that because his was such a deep death he was able to go far beyond those people who only experience an NDE for a short amount of time. And for that reason, he did not experience the life review, meeting his spirit guides, appearing before the Council, etc. that other visitors to the afterlife experience right up front. Well, if those short timers expensive it, why didn't he experience it immediately after crossing over on his way to a \\"deeper\\" experience?<br /><br />There is precious little information about the afterlife in the book. And what information is presented is done so with maddeningly little detail. Read the Michael Newton books if you want to know what really happens after death. Start with \\"Journey of Souls.\\" Interesting that none of the Michael Newton books are listed on the reading list at the end of the book. How could someone who supposedly has read about and investigated in depth stories of the afterlife not include the Newton books in his reading list? What a joke.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is one of the christmas gift,it come on time and was everything i wanted tahnks very much. love it
B002APU580|5.0|Grab the popcorn this is a good version of the book.  Fun and well acted.  Love me some Darcy :)
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Do we really need to be in touch this much? Twitter is kind of a joke IMHO. I mean, do I really care?
B009GED3HS|5.0|Definitely one of the best shows on TV! I didn't think they could get any better but season 8 is hilarious.
B004N8CP8K|3.0|Check your hardware requirements to make sure that this product will work. Bottom line? I don't think that my droid will ever take over the PC
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive. you never want to put the game down! I hope u enjoy this game! have fun with collecting the puzzle pieces!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|While interesting and maintaining the usual glib dialogue, I found MIB3 to be slow and somewhat tedious. Still, I enjoyed watching and always enjoy the &#34;aliens.&#34;
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am very new to my kindle fire and also new to the solitaire game.  I am not able to exit the game without deleting it from my carousel.  I guess I can't fault the game but in conjunction with the newness of the fire... it is frustrating.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Really enjoyed the story in this film. The actors/actresses were superb. You know, it's sometimes great to see a good story without anything blowing up. We all are going to arrive at this stage eventually. . .
B000002KHF|4.0|I've always enjoyed his music, but one of my many favorites is Caravan, which I got on this CD.  I've seen a video (it may be from The Last Waltz) of him doing Caravan and it shows his intensity and feeling for the song and lyrics.
B009PAETCG|2.0|This game is so glitchy, and add-filled that you barely get to play the game. It also takes up your space, and is not fun or addicting like other soccer games that I know
6303477259|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Pink Floyd back in the 80's and 90's - but received The Wall as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago and slowly started expanding my music collection.  I think David Gilmour is an amazing artist and can't get enough of seeing and hearing his talent.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I was skeptical like many others, but I LOVED this!  The original was a favorite of mine growing up and this remake was done very well.  They kept enough of the original, but updated the right amount too for newer generations.  The dancing was great and the music was fitting.  Loved it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldnt put it down.  I love Mitch Rapp and the gang. I hope there is a new one soon.
B005J2UM9S|4.0|This movie started off as the B horror film I expected it to be.  About an hour into it I think it really deserves credit for being a good movie.  There was good build up, but sadly I do feel like the ending was rushed as other reviewers have stated.  All in all I consider this one of the better free streaming movies I've watched with Amazon Prime and did enjoy it for what it was.  I did get a scare out of it and that's what I was looking for so the movie did its job.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put it down, great drama and enough technical stuff to make a kid from the space race 50's happy.
1589949811|5.0|Say you don't have anyone to play CCGs with?  Say you can't stand set rotations and manufactured rarity of Magic and similar games?  Say there hasn't been a good Middle-earth themed card game since ICE went out of business?  Well, I have good news: This game is the answer to your search.<br /><br />I love this game.  It is infinitely customizable and a real blast to play.  It really does capture the &#34;feel&#34; of LOTR and the designers really know their lore.  The gameplay is smooth, fast and tension-filled.  It will take you a while to learn the rules entirely, but after 2-3 playthroughs, you'll be able to do it without referencing the rulebook.  It might be a bit advanced for new players or kids, but if you've played Magic or any other CCG, you'll pick it up fast.<br /><br />The best part of the game: it can be played single player or with up to 4, in a cooperative team mode.  Soloing requires many different tactics and strategies, and not all decks will survive a solo game.  But part of the fun is coming up with new deck ideas to beat the scenarios. Multiplayer adds a lot of depth and strategic planning.  You really need to build your decks together!  One word of warning: the core set's cards can be pretty weak, you really need to buy a few of the adventure packs to round it all out.<br /><br />Oh, and the art: this is hands down the best CCG art I've ever seen, with some truly excellent renditions of Tolkien favorites.  It's a joy just to look at the cards.  High production values, as usual for FFG.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like CCGs and Tolkien, buy this and a few expansions.  You will not be sorry.
0547884591|5.0|Weather you're interested in cooking or not, this is a great book for learning the way to optimize life.  For the extremely cheap price you get a 600+ pages Full-color manual for life.  My husband and I have loved his other books as well.  His style of attacking challenges seems to be unparalleled and the opposite of most conventional wisdom.  Learn from the jack of all trades, Tim Ferriss!
B000002H38|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for my mother. Anita's smooth grooves, made my mother reminisce about the past! Overall this CD is a classic and AMAZON you give great service to your customers...THANK YOU!!!
076115728X|5.0|This is a beautiful story. The illustrations are wonderful and I would recommend it as a gift for children and adults.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|When everyone heard that Britney was releasing a new album in the fall of 2007, people were skeptical if it was going to a commercial success or a commercial flop due to many factors. The first one being that 2007 was definitely a year filled with drama for Britney, the second one being her not-so-perfect comeback performance of \\"Gimme More\\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards and the third one being the negative press she got that year. Fortunately for Britney and her fans, she came back with a bang. Blackout was released on October 26, 2007 with sales of 124,000 copies in its first day and generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. It also spawned the hit singles \\"Gimme More\\", \\"Piece of Me\\" and \\"Break the Ice\\". Not only are the three singles released from the album good, but there are also other gems on the album such as \\"Radar\\" (which was later included on her Circus album in 2008 and released as a single from that album), \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)\\", \\"Freakshow\\", \\"Toy Soldier\\", \\"Hot as Ice\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\". For everyone that thought this was going to be a terrible album, Britney certainly proved those people wrong and also proved that through all the heartache and heartbreak and drama, everything is worth it in the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this app! It is really so much fun! It is actually better than temple run! So cool!
B0063IH60K|5.0|good app! Lots of fun, and keeps your mind running with numbers in your head.You will love this mind challenging game. I garentee it.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|&#34;Brilliant, for ever being played in my car. A peaceful man and a terrific mentor on Australia's &#34;The Voice.&#34; Great.&#34;
1250006341|5.0|I enjoyed reading the back story about the show, its characters, costuming, etc.  Charming.  Highly recommend to all fans of Downton Abbey.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|&#34;Absolutely brilliant.....play it all the time. A shame the &#34;preacher&#34; had to pass over, what a singer and inspiration to others.&#34;
B0043GAZYS|1.0|i am pretty sure this isn't amazons fault, but, i have to write it up as such.  the photos shown on the product page clearly show a slip cover and a digital copy; neither of these items are included with the movie.  i'm sure these photos are uploads by users.  my complaint to amazon is that you (amazon) should make sure that the pictures displayed that represent the product to potential customers is true to what you are actually selling.<br /><br />of course i expected to get said slip cover and digital copy as shown (the slip cover says this movie contains a digital copy.)<br /><br />i love the movie and yes, what they sent me was not damaged and was on time so that gets 4 stars, but, i gave a one star because amazon doesn't police what is being shown and representing what folks are going to get by customers without ensuring that it in fact is what they are going to receive.<br /><br />again, the movie is great (really funny) but don't be fooled by the pictures on the product page, it does not come with a slip cover and it has no digital copy.  some people do collect slip covers (i do not) but i expected it to be there because it and the digital copy mention on the slip cover where shown.<br /><br />please do better in the future to get this under control so people don't buy something because they see the pictures and get it and it's not what's in the pictures.
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|Absolutely love it! It's my favorite show ever. It's scary, sad, thrilling, gripping and awesome. Love the cast and the story.
B009JBZH54|5.0|the definitive have for anyone who enjoys a good batman movie. just having the dark knight is worth it, but you have the whole trilogy in your hands in a collectors pack. ++++
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Good application with a lot of information. I like how it puts a number to show the exact percentage of battery power that I have left in the top bar on my phone. The only drawback is that the app always hijacks the screen when you plug in the power cable. That can be annoying when you're doing something with the phone when the power gets low.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Great series. Not one of the best in the series though.  I've read every one of the Jack Reacher series books.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Sad, but very enjoyable, Highlights the love a dog can have for his master.. must confess, I did show my emotions.
B005KDJCE2|5.0|A while ago I pretty much decided that there will never be an album that comes close to hitting the prog rock heights that Pink Floyd did from Meddle to The Wall (and all the albums in between that time period).  There are other great albums out there, but groups that tried to capture that Floyd sound always fell short.  And then I discovered this album, and now I stand corrected,  because this sounds as if it could have been released between Wish You Were Here and Animals.  The guitar playing sounds so much like Gilmour that its scary.  The keyboardist sounds a lot like Wright, and the lyrics sound like something that Waters would have wrote.  The vocals of Gilmour and Waters I prefer to the vocals of Airbag, but that isn't saying they are bad, its just my preference.  If you have been looking for something that sounds like Floyd but still is entirely original, this is your album.  A great concept album from beginning to end.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Been honest i bought this memory to a friend. I received it in good time. He never call me to anything bad.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I also don't buy any DVD/Blu-ray which aren't compatible with my apple products, specifically my apple TVs and with airplay and iCloud delivering the stream to my mobile and TVs there's just no good reason to complicate my life with Ultraviolet.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's hard for me to give this a five star review, because contrary to some of the other glowing five star reviews, this isn't a perfect book.<br /><br />Ever since the movie [[ASIN:B000IZXR7U Mad Max]] there has been a vast post-apocalyptic genre, but unlike the other gun-toting survivalist stories, this story's environment delivers a quaint, quiet existence where you quickly learn that something is subtly and undeniably wrong.<br /><br />What you'll find in the first 20 pages is that while this sci-fi tale takes place in a survival silo, a la Fallout style, it could have easily taken place in a spaceship or some other isolated dirigible.  For some reason, it reminded me of Disney's [[ASIN:B003V40SGS The Black Hole]].  The real magic in this story though lie in that this is classic science fiction - one that suspends your disbelief before calmly and logically wrapping you in a cloak of mystery and dread.<br /><br />The author's prose is purposeful and clean, Characters are easy to pick up, and he does a good job of hooking you early on, which really makes this a page turner.  My only qualms is that this is such a short collection, and that the antagonists are a little too one dimensional, though not to the point that they are predictable.<br /><br />I recommend reading Wool if you are into science fiction and looking for something refreshing from our current age - I would even recommend it if you are a fan of H.P. Lovecraft.  If you're into the deep philosophical science fiction or something that will keep you occupied for a time, then you should probably keep looking.
0201433079|5.0|I read this for the first time after taking an operating systems course as undergrad. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Then time passed and I am teaching advanced programming at the same university. This book is really a classic.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about a book that for the most part would be a reference seated in your desk waiting for the obscure reference to that argument on a system call (that you can as well find in the man pages) but this book gives example code and you know visiting it from time to time would be of benefit. Students may be overwhelmed, but rest assured that if you read this with time, if you test the companion code and experiment yourself, Unix will be beautiful understood.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I fell for the series hook line and sinker. My<br />complaint is that I have to wait for the next<br />book to come out. This is the fifth book in the<br />Game of Thrones series. Actually, I could complain<br />that my favorite characters are gone or that<br />the story of power and domination resemble<br />life today for many around the world.  The books<br />are unpredictable, captivating and totally without<br />regard for my wish for happy endings and justice<br />for all. So perhaps because of that rather than inspite<br />of those things, I tremendously enjoy this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazingly fun. If you are the kind of person that enjoys coming up with strategies, this is the game for you. Subway Surfers is a popular game everyone should get it!
B004WR125O|1.0|Had to return it. Other wifi devices in the same location work just fine. This one did not. Signal strength was poor.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|so I love the game I gess it is cool it has sweet mini games and in all it is FUN!!!!! so enjoy get the game and try it 4 your self!!!. BYE BYE#!!!!!!!!!! %) $) ;) :) ;/ :/ jk lol got u screaming what the ell hahaha
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This is the first time I've read anything by Nelson DeMille. I thought this book was very entertaining. I love John Corey's sense of humor.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony. my favorite ones are pinkey pie and rambo. lil so just get the game I gess.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|just about everything Mark Lanegan produces is a winner. An artist that a up and comer should learn to emulate.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I first watched the movie based on this novel and was intrigued, and disturbed, by the relationship between Eva and Kevin. I hoped the book would delve into far more detail regarding their relationship and it didn't disappoint. For me, this was the most interesting part of the story, revolving as it does around the argument of nature versus nurture in the development of a child's personality. Eva is a somewhat unlikable character at times, to the point where one's sympathies almost lie with Kevin. She is somewhat redeemed in the end, however, when she realizes that she finally does love her son even after all that has transpired. Read this book, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Now, if only Shriver would write the story from Kevin's perspective!
B008AU7F3C|4.0|She's turning in to be one of the more consistently good artist out there. hope to see her in concert
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Fantastic story probably his best for a long time, I have enjoyed all John Grisham's books that i have read,
B009X2CUYA|5.0|Another triumph for Kate Morton. She never fails to surprise me with her wonderful story telling skills, and character portraits. The Distant Hours will keep you up all night, trying to get to the end, to solve the mystery.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey,Just a load of rubbish, reading for an idiot, or a very deprived person, I suggest you take it off the shelf
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Another great book by Kate Morton. She never fails to enthrall.  A mystery right to the end. Could not put this book down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham did it again. Very exciting and interesting ending, A must read I could not put the book down.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A great read, very twisty plot,  It's a different subject for Vince Flynn but I throughly enjoyed it. He's one of my favorite author's and I so happy he's is feeling better and continues to write amazing thrillers.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Delivery of the DVD arrived in a timely manner. The movie itself: Mansfield Park is brilliantly done with superb acting and costume design. The story by Jane Austen is a 19th century \\"soap opera\\" of sorts with more class. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of period movies.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I love this series so it was nice to be able to view it on DVD whenever I want to watch the show. Only wish I had gotten it befoe now. Now just have to wait for the prices to go down again on the remaining seasons so that I can start enjoying them as well.
0547884591|5.0|[[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]]<br /><br />What can I say about this book? It's a dream come true! Being the creative type, I love a book with variety. I've read some reviews criticizing certain subjects in the book stating that they aren't practical. True, you might not want to kill a squirrel and eat it out in the wild, but I'd be willing to bet you'd want to eat steak that makes you strong like bull in the bedroom haha. I mean come on people, have you never read a Tim Ferriss book before? They're entertaining! One of the reasons I like reading Tim's books is due to the \\"choose your own adventure\\" format. So far I've learned that I can amp up everything that I thought I knew about food, I can improve in anything I want to improve in and do it all in record time. The book is beautifully illustrated and color coded, so definitely get the hard copy version over the kindle. Honestly, I love my kindle but I'd be awfully confused attempting to read it on one.<br /><br />After reading his last book the 4-Hour Body [[ASIN:030746363X The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman]]<br /><br />I lost 35lbs, got better sleep, improved my sex life, and learned to heal my old injuries. I can't wait to see how much I can improve on after I finish reading the 4-Hour Chef.<br /><br />Five Stars!!!! Kudos Tim!
B009MF56GC|4.0|I enjoyed this film moreso than the recent individual releases by Jason Statham, like Safe.  The plot is very simple and has typical action movie structure which was great.  I hate it when an action movie is too complex or deep in it's story that you can't follow it.<br /><br />This movie features Van Damne as the main villain and he does a great job.  I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a more elaborate ending fight between Stallone's character and Van Damne.  It seemed to be more wrestling than martial arts and this was a letdown to me.  Schwarzenegger has his typical one liner &#34;I'll be back&#34; which was cool but it too is getting a little too used recently.<br /><br />Definitely see this movie as it keeps you entertained all the way through.  I would, however, skip the original Expendables as Eric Roberts as the main villain doesn't have the star power to carry the film.
B006H5120E|5.0|I would like to say first that THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY ABOUT THE BLU RAY 3D PRESENTATION OF TITANIC and not the actual movie.<br />We loved Titanic and have waited for its blu ray release for a long time. After watching this on 3D, I must say, IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT! The Blu ray 3D is that beautiful! Even if you have seen Titanic when it was re-released in 3D in theatres (April 2012), Do NOT give up on this 3D edition. The theatre 3D doesn't come any close to the picture quality and 3D depth you will feel here.<br />The 3D presentation of the movie is truly SPECTACULAR. It is so realistic in depth that you will forget the fact that this was converted from 2D to 3D. Every frame, every scene, and every moment tells you how much efforts have been put into making this edition so flawless. The color, contrast, sharpness and overall depth of the movie never loses its' grip from beginning to end. Last, but not the least, the SOUND! It's so immersive and realistic, you will thank yourself about this purchase after watching it at home. If you are a fan of this movie, you gotta have this in your collection. It is debatable that what format one would prefer for repeated viewing (2D or 3D Blu ray). However, if your preferred format is 2D, then watching this 3D once will surely make you think again about your preferences! (It's that good!)<br />Final Remarks:<br />Having seen many Blu ray 3Ds, I can certainly say that Titanic 3D offers one of the best 3D presentaions I have ever seen on Blu ray. The movie has been given a royal treatment (which it deserves) and this every bit of work reflects in every single moment on this Blu ray. Experience it to believe it!
B007TK77QE|5.0|Even though I read constantly, this would rate as one of the best novels I've read in ages. When not reading it, I constantly thought about the characters. I was very sad to reach the end. Rowling has created such &#34;fat&#34; characters.  She has imbued them with some of the most realistic characteristics we humans possess, from unsolicited compassion to spiteful self -interest. I've never read a Harry Potter, as that style of fiction does not appeal to me.  So therefore, it was with a little reluctance I embarked on The Casual Vacany. I sincerely hope Rowling continues with adult fiction. Sadly, I'll have to try to locate my next read, knowing it will probably not capture me, the way the people in Rowling's town of Pagford, did.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My family love this film, language does not include any cussing. Kids can relate to this movie. I recommend reading the book first then watching the movie a great way to sneak in some reading too.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Well, actually some of the visuals are quite remarkable, but the plot and acting disappoint.<br /><br />Well, technically speaking, the plot \\"wasn't any better than I was expecting\\", which isn't exactly the same as being disappointed. It sort of wanders around looking for the next special effect. And in the end there's a sort of showdown and the movie ends. And then you get another beer and look for one of the backup movies you rented, because while this movie is reasonably fun and sort of entertaining, it left me distinctly unsatisfied.<br /><br />[edit] OK, I'm not being entirely fair: there is a trip sequence in the middle (keywords: dwarves, mushrooms) that is quite awesome. The rest of the movie, though... uh... I just can't recommend it. Definitely worth watching for that part, but if you get bored after the trip sequence, you have permission to turn it off and watch something else.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great story, wonderful timeless songs that I never get tired of hearing. The scenery is spectacular and Julie Andrews is wonderful.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|Would let a younger sibling watch this, nothing gross or perverted like most children's cartoons are today. Very Cute Story
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Another movie we always watch during christmas. You never grow too old for the Muppet's. The classic story is told in a the fun muppet way.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Polar Express captures the magic and wonder of childhood. It is a reminder of the value of friendship that goes beyond adult drawn boundaries. Children have the ability to see the world simply and purely because they have not been tainted by cynicism.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Love to watch this every christmas with the kids. I think it is one of Jim Carrey's best performances. The dog is great also!!!!!
B005KELQEU|5.0|I love this and easy use to put way. Or use while travel anywhere and it awesome to use alots.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every novel that Michael Connelly has written.  I also attended one of his book signings.  He is a truly gifted author. The Black Box, like all of his novels, is fast paced, well written and has a few surprises.  For anyone who enjoys this book I would stronly recommend my favorites.....The Concrete Blond and Nine Dragons.  But they are all wonderful and I suggest you start with his very first novel and read them in succession to truly appreciate Harry Boshe.  Enjoy.
B00005QCVY|5.0|This holiday story is a timeless class for the entire family to enjoy.  It speaks volumes of how important family and friends influence one's life, and vice a versa.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Started for a grandchild and got involved myself. The dragons are varied and I find myself spending time trying to breed the specimens I particularly like. Grandchild thinks they are cute.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This application works much better than the actual dictionary I have on my Kindle Fire.  If you have to look up a word in the first 5 or 6 letters of the alphabet, the actual dictionary works well.  However, if the word you are looking up is at the middle or end of the alphabet, the actual dictional can take more than 10 minutes to find it.  The dictionary app works in seconds.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I don't know why Warner Brothers is insisting on being anti consumer with this stupid UltraViolet stuff. No watching Dark Knight Rises on my Apple TV, or any other apple devices without an internet connection. I refuse to use Flixster and put myself at the mercy of their license termination. Either rip the movie, or just get it from iTunes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire, I'm glad it's offered free on they kindled fire. I would enjoy playing this game when I'm bored.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Very good, we watch over and over, we are excited to order the second season and third season. Everyone will enjoy this series of shows!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoy the puzzles and would recommend this game to anyone no matter the age. Nice pictures to put togather
030758836X|4.0|It was very captivating. I couldn't put it down! The story line held my attention, even though the characters were dispicable!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is one of the most addictive games I have played & challenging to get the bonus coins in the right area to collect them before they fall over the sides.
0062124293|1.0|Book was vulgur and not at all what I expected.  She took the issues a bit too extreme for my liking.
B008AU7F3C|4.0|It took a few playthroughs to fully appreciate this album.<br /><br />It slowly grew on me. There was no knockout song. It is a true album that really should be listened to as a whole.
1608193381|5.0|Great book, unfortunately the people who most NEED to read it probably won't: Teapublicans, Free Marketeers, right-wingers, evangelicals, Chicago School \\"freshwater\\" economists, CNBC & WSJ \\"reporters\\", and white male Republican Congressmen. Also read the author's previous excellent book, Bad Samaritans, which focused exclusively on right-wing myths about Free Trade and protectionism. The only critique I have is, because the book spans 23 Free Trader myths, it doesn't do as thorough a job with any single one of them as it might. Nonetheless a nice primer on \\"saltwater\\" economics and easy read for any Teabaggers in your family who will not read anything too long or \\"difficult\\".<br /><br />Also highly recommend: DON'T BUY IT: The Trouble with Talking Nonsense about the Economy
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great Cast with great chemistry.  Very entertaining.  I really don't have the required number of words to submit this review.
0385528752|5.0|A very enjoyable book to read. It moves along easily, with great examples of incredible changes made by real people with seemingly miniscule resources at hand. This book will likely inspire you try out the simple concepts on at least one project in your life that has gotten bogged down. I've purchased another as a gift (I wasn't yet ready to pass along my own copy - I may want to re-visit some of the advice)!
0547884591|5.0|Humor is a major theme in this book and I enjoy that in learning.  The color in the book looks amazing and well worth the price alone.  There are so many subjects that I never get bored with this book, even though I have a short attention span.  Definitely a great way to pass down time on deployment.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Super 8 released in 2011 is an excellent movie borrowing classic sci-fi movie settings and makes us reminisce good ol' late 70s when The Knack made a great hit MY SHARONA, Blondie THE HEART OF GLASS, and Electric Light Orchestra with a number of huge hits such as DON'T BRING ME DOWN. The movie was set in 1979 when \\"Alien\\" was released and the child characters are shooting the zombie film for Super 8 film festival. The drama starts off with teens making a film but when they encounter the strange train derailment scene they are drawn into the military situation, sort of X-files or Taken plot that what the train cargos were carrying was actually an alien. The accident was dealt beautifully just like seeing Hayao Miyazaki animation film in live action. Since then so much sci-fi cliches go on and on. But despite of similarities to previous hit films I love this movie overall. It has heartfelt drama the feel of E.T in it. Elle Fanning,the sister of great child actress Dakota Fanning, made a striking presence as the heroin of the film Alice Dainard.<br /><br />Verdict: Tributary film to great sci-fi movies<br />Rating: 90 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Early Spielberg film fans, late 70s pop rock fans.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|the book is well written and easy to follow.  Just wish there was more on the expeirence then on the &#34;family&#34;.  Other than that its very inspiring.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Its ok for something different to watch on a Friday, but dont expect too much. I just could not see giving this movie more than two stars.
1936608618|5.0|The author starts off by explaining the age old approach to endurance training: Run, run, run, volume, volume, volume. He then discusses why this often results in chronic injuries and why it often leads to plateaus in athletes and presents a different approach to endurance training.  He states that his approach takes less time, causes less stress on the joints of the body and improves overall performance.<br /><br />He then goes through running technique and provides quite a few pictures and drills.  He then has a section on cycling technique and drills.  The next chapter is the same thing, but except for swimming.  He then goes through various strength training exercises based on a cross fit endurance model.<br /><br />The next few chapters are dedicated to demonstrating movements to improve mobility and prevent injuries and a section on nutrition/hydration.  He closes up the book with examples of various training regimens based on different goals.<br /><br />I have found the book to be very interesting and informative.  He does not shy away from scientific details, but it is written in a manner that I think most people would understand. lots of pictures and spoke demonstrating the various techniques and faults.<br /><br />I think his book is valuable resource endurance training, triathlons, athletic performance in general.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|Not the best story or the best dialog but i loved it. I thought it looked stunning with its documentary style grittiness and what i think was visually stimulating. Best alien invasion movie of its time. (not like those retarded movies like Skyline)
B0015AARJI|5.0|Its dosent have anything diferent of the original, its the same controller, and work good . . . . .
B004E547D8|4.0|I love this movie so much but, when i watched it i was super disipointed when i found out there is no special features whatsoever and thats pretty much the only reason why i buy blurays in the first place.<br /><br />But i cant blame anyone else but me because it clearly states (apparently i cant read) MOVIE-ONLY EDITION<br /><br />SO ALWAYS READ BEFORE YOU BUY<br />... its only a few $ differences oh how i screwed myself there
B0041KKYCY|5.0|fantastic actor gritty movie kept me on edge one major thinng never do that to a woman you will pay for it in the end
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Love it --getting a paper copy for my son! I think it would be a good book for anyone and can be applied to life or business.
B00018D3RI|5.0|classic shows will always be the best todays world not to much talent like these to guys alot of action great acting
B007EECSFA|5.0|Love, love, love. Kate Morton rocks. The twists she creates keeps you guessing till the end and you won't be right.<br />Read it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|He has a great voice and great songs that really get you in the Christmas spirit!  I totally recommend this to others who are wanting a good Christmas CD.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just got it but loved the size, speed, sound and picture.<br />Have it for a few days but used a little every day and is what I expected to be
B00A77II0U|5.0|I usually wait for these to get a little cheaper but wasn't terribly dissatisfied by playing on the expert settings. It gave me about a day and a half of play time, wonderful graphics,  the story was truly a little creepy,  and the seek and find scenes were trying at times. Overall great game.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Of course I appreciate how amazingly talented Heath Ledger was, but you cannot compare someone who gets to do things like that to someone who has to wear a huge mask and be so much quieter.  Tom Hardy is amazingly talented, and his Bane made me actually go see The Dark Knight Rises three times in the theater (paid for reserved VIP seats all three times).  The moments with Tom and Marion toward the very end are so touching and powerful, thank you! So many characters and storylines to follow and this movie is so very long, but thank you to Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman - I don't have a lot money but I'm never sorry I spend it on you.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|This is the kind of book you are bound to find elements of yourself in.  Worth a read for that alone.
B009K0P10K|5.0|So far, Season One was better but we are hooked!!! And we love Amazon Prime's streaming. We watch it on our large HD TV and the quality is great. Enjoy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it!!! i find the coolest stuff on this site!!! its def my favorite. no problems on kindle with the app im so happy to have it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game has something for everyone. YOU can go at your own pace on your own or play with thegame. HARD Puzzles for seasoned players and simpler ones for beginners!
0451418441|4.0|A welcome continuation of Pillars.  After two centuries, the characters are as deep and complex as their earlier family. The nuances of personality are evident in the major characters.  I had to reread Pillars of the Earth to fully appreciate the character development. Follett is a master at depicting strength and weakness in both the major and minor characters.  I would recommend World Without End to anyone who enjoys a thoughtful, engrossing novel.
B003E88TKS|3.0|George Clooney plays a man whose job it is to travel the country firing people. If the complexities of that issue - the stress of having such a role, the pathos experienced by those thus fired, the perversity of the corporations who needed to hire outside help to perform that function - were investigated, this could have been a very interesting film. Instead, the story is primarily about a man who, by having opted for a job in which he spends more time traveling than at home, pursues his two primary goals: that of avoiding any deep human connections (we're treated to lectures he gives in which he encourages audience members to imagine that a backpack - placed conveniently next to him at his lectern - contains all of the important people in their lives. &#34;Now imagine lifting it,&#34; he says), and of achieving 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles. We watch as he (almost) gives up on the former, and achieves the latter. While the manner in which those milestones occur are certainly very entertaining - and worth watching the film for, if you're in the mood for light fare - they're certainly not treated with any depth. There is much more reality and human drama in the brief segments in which people react to having just been fired. I wish the film had spent more time on those, and less time on the significantly less substantial &#34;main&#34; story.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Excellent series and price. This is one of the best show after Lost. Cannot wait to start watching and catching up to 3rd season.
B0098460O4|5.0|I watch both of them on youtube, love them then, so bought there cd and it is awesome. My wife leaves it in the player and listen to them almost everyday. If you want to just listen to awesome singer then this is the one.
B009AJD5E0|2.0|Turn off the volume and make up your own lines. Great space ship, graphics what have you and absolutely the most inept and ridiculous written story possible. Looked so much forward to this and it's crap. Bought it anyways - guess I shouldn't judge the inept writters without looking in my own mirror. Major disappointment that as a s-f fan, yet you'll will still purchase or rent.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I like this remake better than the older version, but they are both a must have for Christmas time viewing.  Well played and believable characters.
B005LAIII0|2.0|This was advertised as an adventure movie and the 3D is good and it is well acted.  But this is more of an intellectual spiritual adventure.  This movie is too violent for kids and they won't get it anyway.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This is a historical period piece that takes us back to Alexandria during the final days of the Roman Empire.  The newly allowed faith, Christianity, threatens to disrupt the centuries of learning that have taken place at the famed Library of Alexandria.  The lead character is a historically real person, Hypatia, a genius female teacher in a male-dominated world.  This gripping (and mostly true) story is fascinating, engaging and well-told.  By covering the screen for a few seconds here and there, I have been able to use this in my middle school science classes to discuss the differences between faith and science.  EVERY CHILD in classes has said they love this movie.  Not like, LOVE.  If it can hold the interest of jaded middle schoolers, any thinking adult should love it.  Accurate, moving, poignant, especially as the debate about faith and science still rages.  As a person of faith, and a teacher of science, I am impressed how this movie brings the debate to our &#34;Agora,&#34; our Marketplace, and we also get to wrestle with these ideas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app!!! I think its better than temple run... it has holiday themes its just mine wont change to Christmas idk why. and it doesn't have the different hoverboard options like my friends does. But overall I love this app
1451695195|5.0|My husband and I read an excerpt of Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander..  My husband immediately told me to order the book in paperback when it came out. as it was written by a Neurosurgeon and his experiences.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book.When I finished the first book I felt like I could feel what Katniss was feeling...empty and alone. I felt desperate to read more and more like it was the only thing that kept me alive.When I finished the second book I felt like I was a piece of lead being broke into dozens of pieces.But when I finished this book my mind was blown!!!!!!!I don't understand why a lot of peaple were disappointed by this EPIC journey to find that this trilogy gave a lot of detail and the auther really put A LOT of work to put such amazing HEART into these books so I thank you for making these AWSOME books, Suzanne Collins.YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S.These Hunger Game books are very riveting, chilling, detailed, and even more words to describe it.(AWSOMLY)Get this BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
0545265355|1.0|I usually don't bother with reviews. But I am bothering for these books. I think I hated them more than Twilight. At least Twilight does not decimate (either physically or mentally) every character you love in the series (or just plain every character in the books period). While these books are substantially better written and, I will be honest, are page-turners in that you want desperately to find out what happens, it is not worth what you go through as a reader to find out. These books delve into the depths of morality, virtue, and humanity while making a distinct and easily understood commentary on what our society could someday become (but hopefully, others would stand with me to prevent this type of travesty from ever happening). But they do so in a way that is depressing, brutally graphic, cold and psychologically disturbing. The horror faced by the characters in this series definitely states that no one comes through life unscathed but the lengths to which this point is driving home are unnecessary.  The author has to be twisted in some way to be as calculatingly cruel as she is to her characters, and through them, her readers. I would *NOT LET* a teen read them, let alone any younger child. And I will not be recommending these disturbing books to anyone else. They may have a place in the history of literature for their commentary on society, morality and ethics but they do not belong in the hands of children so that they can read about the slaying of characters that could, if real, be their peers...or, worse, themselves. Don't listen to the hype and ignore the movie. Skip over these books unless you are an adult who enjoys sorrow and morbid depression. They are not \\"feel good\\" in any way, shape, or form. If you insist on reading them, don't say that you weren't warned.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|must see dvd for all of arnolds fan's.great special effects,fight sceen's were great as well.very well acted,because i am a big arnold fan.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Great, easy read. Good book for middle schoolers, but fun for adults, too.<br /><br />Grisham writes good suspense without the trash found from other authors. Thank you, John Grisham.
0547884591|5.0|I think the book is amazing. Worth its value tenfold for the Meta-Learning chapter alone. It makes me feel excited about learning new skills.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love the music on all the twilight movies. I have every soundtrack and every movie. They picked great artists
B00932A2MC|3.0|If you like a little sci-fi and action, you'll like it.  I like how they made a relation to the actual board game at a few points.
0547884591|5.0|Just like the 4 Hour Work Week wasn't really about working, or the 4 Hour Body wasn't totally about health and fitness, the 4 Hour Chef isn't just about cooking. It's another fact-based, fascinating and fun run around a kitchen via the rest of the world and personal experiences. Love it! Great to learn a better way to cut an onion, peel garlic and cook a steak but even more fun to learn about testosterone stimulation, deer hunting (and rifles!) and the origins of food. The \\"pairings\\" create more fun. Plus, it was nice to learn the way I am teaching myself Spanish actually makes sense. If you want to call it the \\"story of Tim Ferriss\\", fine...to me, it's interesting and useful! Who can argue with that?  I can't even begin to imagine what he'll deal with next \\"in four hours!\\" But I'll be waiting.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'd been wanting to get this set for a while, and when I saw it on sale, I jumped on it.  No complaints here.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is great. Either you love the series or you do not. Personally it is one of my favorite ones.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good game to pick up and put down whenever.  Good game to turn you mind off for a while and past time.
B0007KIFGO|5.0|I love love love this movie! Very inspirational. Tom Hanks performance was superb. This movie is a must have to any movie collection.
0547884591|4.0|Tim is a very entertaining and innovative writer. Whatever you choose to take from the book, for certain you will find value and something new to share!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|My 10 year old loved it! He loved reading on the iPad for his homework. I would recommend this book!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|How could his story be unknown until recently. After having seen the movie &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; I just had to have the Cold Fact CD. I absolutely loved the music, loved the story, loved Rodriguez, loved his family, and hate whomever is responsible for stealing all the money that Rodriguez was entitled to, but never got. In later years he did receive money once his tours in South Africa were such a phenomenal success. But just think how different his life could have been! It is a poetic justice that he his finally getting the recognition he deserved all along. And the music is just fabulous. Highly recommend it.
B0053O89RY|5.0|This is the best show---I can see it over and over and laugh as if I just saw it for the first time.  Modern Family: The Complete Third Season is a hit!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This app is no good - by far the worst i have ever installed on any device.  It rarely launches and when it does it soon thereafter crashes.  Half the time it locks up/freezes the Kindle as it crashes, and a full re-boot is required.<br /><br />On the few times, and for the short while, that it does play, its fun and the graphics are good.  I wish i could uninstall it as its not worth the disappointment of occasionally trying to play it.  I have spend far more time rebooting and trying to get it to work than playing this game.  It would suck if it were free, but having it pay for it is a scam.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I choose 5 stars because I LOVED this game. It was spooky at times. And I lined the hidden objects part of the game. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|For a well known mobile game I was astounded as to how terrible this was.  The gameplay itself was fun and addictive, even if the difficulty did ramp up quickly enough to make it relatively frustrating in a fairly short number of levels.  The combination of the touch screen interface, and the way the game is setup makes it more based on luck then skill, as &#34;aiming&#34; is very limited.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was terribly unstable.  I could hardly play for 5 minutes without it crashing and having to be restarted  (often multiple times while attempting to beat a single level).  This is the first app I've installed on my tablet that showed real stability problems.  Too bad, it WAS fun, but I uninstalled it the same day.  I have better things to do with my time then mess with apps that crash every 5 minutes.<br /><br />I guess Angry Birds just goes to show, you don't have to have a product that actually WORKS in order to make a mega hit.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Great graphics, solid game play. Fun way to relax and unwind. Cool story line and theme. Good way to pass the time.
0670022411|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read.  Love the mature story line with history and science mixed in.  Much, much better than Twilight.  Warner Bros. purchased the movie rights.  Let's hope they do as good of a job as they did with the Harry Potter movies and don't destroy it like the Twilight movies did.  Read it twice before going onto the sequel - Shadow of Night, which thus far is just as good as this one.  A very strong recommend.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|I just Love it !!!! I will never lose my micro sd card again. Just insert my card and go.
B007RTAR64|5.0|She's exactly as I expected her to be. Very pretty, and her outfit is really well made. A must have for any fan.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|An interesting take on the whole cinderella theme, am looking forward to the sequel of this story.  Like that it pits the moon and the earth against each other.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|This album is ok, but it just doesn't grab me like her previous albums. I guess I need to give it a few more listens before I am hooked.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is mesmerizing television!  My son and I are on the edge of our chairs each week as we watch.
0547884591|5.0|Awesome as usual.  Quirky, funny but full of great information and ideas.  Used 4 recipes already with great compliments!  Hope he keeps them coming!
B004SIP6N6|5.0|Included on the Blu is a documentary that chronicles the story of Kevin Smith and getting Clerks. made called Snowballing. It is extremely interesting and gives you a lot of insight on what Smith was up against while making the film. The documentary alone makes this Blu worth it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I liked that It's a more challenging version than the other Angry Birds I play. I like the extra help with the star ships.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|As fun to read as to watch!  While not the true Christmas story, it certainly captures the spirit of Christmas and the effects of living one's Christmas faith in the incarnate Lord Jesus.
1451648537|5.0|wonderful book about a fascinating man.  I recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in Steve Job or apple.
B008KW43TE|4.0|This plays really well and sounds good too. It's been in rotation since my purchase. I am happy with this purchase.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard great things about this book and was a little disappointed.  It was too long, the characters were not likeable and the ending left me flat.  Overall I did not think it was a great read and certainly not one of the best books of 2012.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I read someplace that the lyrics were dark and that is a fair statement except not melancholy. This is nearly 3hrs of music and although it sounds mixtape-ish, that doesn't take away how great this album flows. I can listen to this from start to finish and each track I like as much if not more than the last. I love his wordplay :)
B000N2HBSO|5.0|There was nothing in the book that I disliked. I particularly liked the way Goodwin expanded each of the rival characters that I knew very little about. I saw Doris Kearns Goodwin speak about her Rivals book in the Lincoln Library in Spring- field & was very impressed by her. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in Lincoln or in history.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great John Grisham book. The tension keeps up through totally unpredictable twists and turns. A truly fascinating must read for Grisham fans.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|some stuff happens but Harry's owl dies and so dies a lot of weasles sesame weasle weasle wealsle coin dozer weasle weasle weasel weasel
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Maybe this movie is acceptable with a younger audience.....?.  (My age 49.)<br /><br />Seriously, I could go on a very long rant about how dumb this movie is.  I put this on my watch list because it had many positive reviews.  I rarely get my husband to sit down and watch a movie with me.  We both were amazed at the pure stupidity of the plot or lack there of.  Trust me just don't waste your time!  The only reason we finished it is because we were riding our trainers and it would have been difficult to put on a new movie.  The trailer did make it look interesting, however I cannot actually find words to express how silly and lame this movie is!!  Beware.
0064431622|4.0|Eric Carle's books are all lovely, and this one is a particular favourite of my grandson.  I would recommend it
0425263908|4.0|purchased as a gift and have not heard if it was good nor have read it myself.<br /><br />hopefully along the lines of 50 shades
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|They charge a bit more than AMD, but I've never had any serious problems with Intel. Their RMA process if you need it is relatively easy, and now they even sell overclocking insurance if you want to get stupid with the voltages.
B005CRQ3RK|1.0|I was never able to read it because it said that I downloaded the kindle version and I just have an andriod tablet.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Challenging for any age. My husband and I like to challenge each other.  Even my five year old enjoys this game.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This was the first brook I read on my kindle. I love the classics and cannot believe I've waited 21 years to read this book. Also, the immersion trading was spectacular, I flew through.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is really fun and can keep you busy for hours. I like how you keep earning coins when you're not in the game. I just wish the bucks were easier to get. There are things that cost over 50 bucks and I only have like 5. Other than that, I love it.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Fun, last stage was tough. Looking forward to more! Upgrade should allow the upgrades in firing to continue just a bit longer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I want to know what happens next! Read the book in a few hours just couldn't put it down until I finished it now maybe I will rent the movie
034580404X|5.0|I love love love these books. They are simply amazing. Once I started reading them I couldn't put them down.  There really isn't anything I dislike about them. They met my expectations. I would recommended this book for all adults to read lol. 5 stars!
0547884591|5.0|I've skimmed through the entire book so far and have made the first three lessons. The wife loves the results. I love the simplicity and clarity of the lessons, and the anecdotes of how the lessons and the book evolved are inspiring (funny too). I've even started the 30grams of protein plan in my first 30-minutes awake each day and that appears to be making a difference already. Also, a smooth and painless transition to the slow carb approach to eating. What a winner this book is. Thanks Tim!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly tells these stories that make you a bit uneasy, for reasons you can`t explain, and that you cannot put down.  How do you do that?  Another great read....
0525952926|3.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth and World without End. I liked Fall of Giants a lot, but was disappointed in the writing of this volume. Did not always feel like Follett himself did the writng.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was original, good effects, great sound, good story too. It wasn't as good as the original 'Alien' though.  I expect there will be a sequel to it
B005P06AAO|5.0|Typically I would scoff at an MTV show, but I happened to land on an episode while channel surfing, and it caught my eye. Flash forward months later and I finally sat down to watch the pilot episode...and fell in love. How could I not have heard about this show? It's funny, it's sweet, and it's real. The plot and characters remind me of Juno and Easy A; the characters are individuals with wise-cracking wit and are very believable. The creators of this show have found a great balance of maintaining humor and drama and serving up a good teenage-centric story without falling into the typical story pitfalls that we've all seen a dozen times. I love it!
B0077190MO|1.0|Of the five discs that came, only one was readable either in my blue-ray player or my computer. I had to send back the set.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The first thing we have to say is that this season is slightly tricky. The previous ended on the take-over of the cosmos by a social-climbing angel, Castiel, who had eliminated all the archangels that could oppose him and had managed to fool Crowley and he had his last final words demanding everyone to get on their knees and obey their new God. That was drastic, that was horrible, that was un-human. And that couldn't last long.<br /><br />And it did not last long because Castiel, like all these angelic people do, always forgets that God always puts something evil in the middle of anything good. They forget about the apple. Everything was good in that Garden of Eden, except for a snake, an apple tree and an apple, though it probably was a fig tree and a fig. So why should Purgatory be different? And it was not. Actually Purgatory was invented to put away one complete failure of the creative power of God, that is to say his first living creature created for the vast water expanse that existed before he started creating his playthings. And that creature was Leviathan. Note God is never able to destroy his failures, to repair his mistakes. He can only hide them away, generally under the carpet. His husbandry is absolutely primitive.<br /><br />So Castiel opened the gates of Purgatory and swallowed all the millions of souls there, which made him super powerful, powerful enough to finish up the last archangel and to take over the whole universe, but he had forgotten he had also swallowed Leviathan who waited for its time and moment to come and then without any more ado decided to take over this strange angelic body-vessel in which it was trapped and then to manage that dumb ass of an angel into freeing him and for him to get the upper hand on the planet. Simple Dr Watson, simple, a real child's play. And that poor Castiel will have to repent for ever for his crimes and his dumbness.<br /><br />The dark black Leviathan was created in water before light even existed, by the way it is not in the first chapter of Genesis but later in the Old Testament coming up on the Biblical soup like the bad monster Anzu that had taken all waters prisoner in the Zoroastrian and Sumerian tradition some two or three thousand years before the Bible. So that monster is as black as night and it rots Castiel from the inside. Castiel turns black and starts feeling the call of the deep ocean and Castiel manages to obey, willy nilly, more nilly than willy, and he goes down into a lake and liberates Leviathan in the water that gets into all the pipes of the city and maybe beyond since that lake was a drinking water reserve. Dean and Sam can satisfy their sadness by picking Castiel trench-coat from the lake and keep it as a keepsake. But one thing is sure Death refuses to intervene. It is the responsibility of those who released that monstrosity to get rid of it, and hurry up that must be done by the end of this season.<br /><br />I am of course not going to follow the episodes. You have to work a little bit. Now the worst and most monstrous creature of God has been released onto the world we can go back to business as usual and run after various monsters of all types. For example an old  acquaintance of Sam's, when he was a young teenager and was more or less ten or something. He was starting to experiment with girls but he has never been very lucky with this female subspecies of the human species. He gets that from his mother I guess. This girl who is now a woman was already what she still is, a brain-sucker sucking brains directly from the live skulls of a living humans, at least if possible for the last part. But Sam is in love again and he remembers how he was nearly the victim of her mother and that it is this girl who killed the mother at the crucial moment of the brain \\"surgery\\". So when he discovers she has a son and it is for him that she killed he gets soft and accepts her promise never to kill again. He let her go. But Dean disagrees and what will happen? The punch line is fantastic and the punch hatred from Sam is enormous, though it will come later.<br /><br />You will like how Sam and Dean get in-between a married couple of ancient witches who have been living through centuries. But they love each pother so much that they are bored of love everyday and they set some mustard on their daily bread and start accusing each other of treachery and unfaithfulness, etc. And they start creating havoc in the place for fun and entertainment. But Dean is a genius and manages to bring them back together and Sam is a darling for all suffering sentimental creatures and he helps them by instinct. But if it were that simple it would not be funny. So in the end Sam and Dean are no longer the saviors but the potential victims of some curse that has to be smoothened up by their friends the witches, or is it only one? But which one is it?<br /><br />The dear Leviathan, the master of them all, is able to mutiply and the baby can enter any body they want, what's more the body becomes like a snake skin and they can change their looks on demand, back and forth. They are shape-shifters by profession, affiliation and confession. And what about if two of them were assuming the bodies, the looks and appearance, language and everything going along with these bodies of Dean and Sam? Embarrassing since these two clones could lead the police to them committing all kinds of crimes and that would be very embarrassing indeed. But luckily there is always a way out of a trap, provided you have the proper tools. And a little help from your friends. And it is Bobby, in his new lair, since his old Bobby's Salvage Yard has been torched down by the Leviathan or maybe some other demons, who finds how to destroy these Leviathan, at least the lower layers of them. Using a simple product anyone can find in a proper kitchen. And cut their heads off, but keep the head trapped away from the body otherwise it will go back onto its body.<br /><br />They will of course spend some time saving some mentalists from some vengeance coming from some lured customers. That will enable you to see under the table of the mentalist, and all her tools to make you believe your grandmother is taking a bath in the garden's bird-bath<br /><br />Dean and Sam will also settle some accounts with the old Becky from the time of the pulp book serial and the first Prophet. She has always been a fan of Sam. Her Internet identity is Samlicker81, Sam is a licker, She wants to lick Sam, She wants to drink Sam's liquor and all that playing billiards with two holes and one cue, a real trouble shooter cue, and the number of balls can vary I guess from two to nine. And on the Internet she is responsible of a Wincest site meaning she believes Dean and Sam are \\"morethantbrothers\\" and yet she wants to marry Sam. So she has to drug him, with a devilish elixir she gets from a devil of her friends' and she will be surprised she has not been able to consummate anything, though she has to tie Sam up on the bed for him not to escape and she cannot even then manage to consummate. Funny, funny, funny, but tricky like hell to get Sam out of this rape story.<br /><br />But the best things cannot last for ever and in the fight against the main Leviathan, a certain Dick Roman, a multibillionaire who has been invaded by Leviathan who is trying to use the money of this personality to create a food empire that will transform humanity into game for hunting and various pleasures in the west part of the USA, cattle in the south and part of the Mississippi valley and laboratory testing animals to research and develop the perfect drugs to produce the three categories of human chattel they need. They find out that the master Leviathan and some around him are not really killed by the kitchen product we have already spoken of. Luckily for the suspense otherwise it would have been too simple. Unluckily Bobby gets shot by the master Leviathan and is at the door of death hesitating and trying to come back. In the end that battle cannot be won, except two minutes to give the \\"boys\\" a number code they will have to understand. And then he dies. At least that's what you are supposed to believe.<br /><br />They will then use a substitute, Frank or something like that, for Bobby whose number they find in Bobby's agenda or address book.<br /><br />By accident Dean attacks a certain God Chronos, the God of time who is some kind of vampire who kills to suck the red soul out of hid victims and thus be eternal. But he has the power to travel in time and Dean finds himself in 1944 with Elliot Ness mind you chasing after a monster that Dean has to bring back along with himself to the precise time and place where Sam is waiting. Complicated but funny and the trick is so simple after all. It is always very simple but they make it look as if you needed to have a 250 IQ to invent it. So all will be well and end well, as we knew it would, but after a lot of angst and suspense.<br /><br />The best encounter though is that with the tribe of the Amazons. Dean who is always easy on the female side of the world gets trapped by one. An Amazon gets pregnant instantly, delivers within 36 hours (in the film it is more like six hours) and the child at the end of the day will be a teenager and the following day a young woman. Of course these Amazons only deliver women, un-naturally. But the daughter has to do something before becoming a full-fledged member of the tribe: kill her father and cut his two hands and his two feet off while alive and then cut out the sign of the tribe in his chest while he is still conscious and losing his blood. That's what children are after all, nothing but giant bloodsuckers biting after the blood of their parents.<br /><br />We discover in the mean time Sam is afraid of clowns and yet a whole shebang of crimes happen in a daycare center for children entirely organized around and with clowns. Sam and these clowns are having a good time indeed. And yet the pervert who kills what and who the children draw is found out not to be a clown, far from it. Poor chap. How can one be that deranged! But luckily Dean and Sam are the guardian angels of the children.<br /><br />And the past is never very far away. A serial killer exorcised by Dean and Sam in the past is back to recapture his demon. How selfish and ungrateful some deranged people and perverts can be! You cannot trust anyone any more and the poor chap you help along the road turns into a biting venomous snake in no time when he feels comfy and warm on your chest.<br /><br />And you will find a small antique store full of mysteries and ancient objects that kill and make other people kill. That's a little bit a clich&eacute; from Dickens redressed in modern colors. I think too this one is quite close to Stephen King's \\"Needful Things.\\"<br /><br />A new development appears at this moment that is going to make Sam completely crazy. Lucifer, who is locked up in his cage with Michael in the body-vessel of Adam, the half brother of Dean and Sam, has the power to get into Sam's mind and make him believe he is still down there, and then when this is solved he starts torturing him by preventing him from sleeping by all means. Guantanamo revisited, though he shouts \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\" all the time which seems to be coming from another film about the Vietnam War. I guess you all see which one. The one with a US military forces' radio anchorman to entertain the combat troops down there in Vietnam. This revisiting the past brings a new discovery. Castiel has lost his memory and is living like a nice husband with his girlfriend. Dean will have to drag him into curing Sam, which he can't do, but he can something else that liberates Sam of some kind of green demon. Dean and Sam are accused of having scratched the wall built a long time ago by Death and some angels between Sam's soul and his memory of Hell. That's why Lucifer can come up from the cesspool.<br /><br/>Now and then they can use the help of a young hunter of Bobby's and Franck's stable, a certain Garth. But nothing very brilliant. Just entertainment. To exorcize a spirit you can only see when drunk is tricky. Frank's hideout has been attacked by the Leviathans and his hard drive has been stolen by Dick Roman. But there is a girl at his headquarters who can help break it and she can also help Dean and Sam. She cracks the hard drive but pretends to Dick Roman that there is nothing concerning Dean and Sam, the only thing Dick Roman is interested in. But on the side she manages to copy and export the whole hard drive of Dick Roman himself. Note he has memorized his pass code to enter his computer. Must some monsters be so proud and sure, vain and silly to believe their security is so good that they need not fear anyone?<br /><br />The last big development is the appearance of the \\"word of God\\", an engraved stone that Dick Roman wants, that Dean and Sam steal and have transcribed by the \\"Prophet\\" that comes all by himself on his own unconscious drive that he has to go and to go to the stone. That gives the recipe to get rid of master Leviathan which will get rid of all his clones. But Dick Roman manages to capture the Prophet and have the stone translated again under duress (the Prophet's mother is kidnapped and Dick Roman blackmails the Prophet, by the way a certain Tran, probably Vietnamese). Dean and Sam need several ingredients to make a powerful weapon against Leviathan. The blood of an Alpha, and there is only one left, an Alpha vampire, but also the blood of Crowley who is of course in-between Dean and Sam on one side and Dick Roman on the other. Dick Roman actually trust Crowley. At least Dean and Sam never do that mistake.<br /><br />The season ends up dramatically. The confrontation with Dick Roman will end up with the destruction of the master Leviathan, but his death sends Castiel and Dean back to where he Leviathan came from, Purgatory where all kinds of monsters are roaming. Good Morning Vietnam indeed. Sam is all alone at Dick Roman's headquarters that are under some menace to explode or self destroy. And just before this confrontation Dean and Sam has burned Bobby's silver flask to which he was attached and that Dean was using all the time. So Bobby is gone for good this time. And the Prophet Tran was taken away before the final destruction of the master Leviathan to a place no one knows.<br /><br />Suspense, suspense.<br /><br />This season though has left angels and archangels aside (easy for the latter since they are all dead except Michael who is in Hell with Lucifer). We are no longer dealing with a dominantly Biblical saga since Leviathan is not typically Biblical, far from it. The demons are plain demons, ghosts are plain ghosts, witches are plain witches. But at the same time we have lost a unifying thread that really keeps all episodes together. It has become looser in a way.<br /><br />On the other hand it has also become more socio-political. It denounces with maybe too much weight the danger of a consumer's society and the weapon that corn syrup represents against our health and well being. It also goes back to H.G. Wells' \\"Time Machine\\" saga in which the human race is transformed in pure chattel but with three main categories: game, cattle and lab-testing animals. The Morlocks are just as dark and horrible, but the Eloi are not all meek and passive and have been differentiated into three different types, slightly like in Brave New World where they are five from alpha to epsilon. That's a come-back which is maybe slightly schematic but that's the TV genre of the series that requires that schematic texture. No time to play too much on the psychology of the characters and of the masses.<br /><br />I will have to wait for the next season till October or so. Too bad. But Il will have plenty of time to suspend my pleasure.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUg and trying to come back.

B009K45Y62|1.0|I gave this one star, because there are over 300 people that have reviewed the Limited Edition Bat Cowl set that is not even on the market for retail sale and distribution yet.<br /><br />How can anyone review this item? Amazon wants you to review the item AFTER you buy it.<br /><br />They are not looking for pithy comments about a version of the movie you have already seen or purchased in another format or promotion.
B007ZZ3RI0|2.0|I don't have a deluxe version, so my cd only has 12 songs on it. The first 9 are a complete waste. I want to say c***, but I am not sure amazon would allow it.<br />I do love the last three songs: 10. Underneath, 11. Chokehold and 12. Outlaws Of Love, and that's why I generously give this CD 2 stars.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|It was a HELL of a great book. I recommend  it for bond fans. It's full of action and adventure, Fleming Has out done himself
B007L3BMGA|2.0|very badly written - no story-line, and the idea of &#34;dominant&#34; and &#34;submissive&#34; really repels me.  The book has put the women's movement back 40 years. No man would treat me like that - millionaire or not - he would get the flick!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love love love it - My life is so much enriched - Why didn't I think of that first lol
B0086449YA|5.0|This man only gets better with time - each of the albums have an amazing theme and this one with it nautical theme (privateers!) was beautifully done. Disc 2 is more bluesy but so very nicely done.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Thare are many favorite tracks, but I would have to give this track on the first CD as my favorite.<br /><br />I have been thinking of writing a review and what I would write ever since I listened to the CD the first time about 2 to 3 months ago.  I have listened to the CD many times over.<br /><br />My impression now is different than when I first finished listening to the CD, but before going on, let me explain the 4-stars and why not 5-stars.  I will expand a bit on a comment that Madam Giri made.  Andrew Lyold Webber put too much &#34;cheap vaudeville trash&#34; on the CD.  I liked that part too, but one cannot compare, IMHO, the melodies when Christine and Eric are together and the characters interact with the filler stuff.  Also, I missed an overture at the opening.  Phantom had a nice overture, which itself could have expanded, but Love Never Dies, nothing.  It is definitely missing, maybe for the movie version or a subsequent Broadway production, if this sequel catches on.<br /><br />The other problem that I had initially (not now) was that I was expecting grandios organ music, but Mr. Webber changed and enhanced things.  After I got over the fact that there was no grand organ music, then I enjoyed the music and the lyrics.<br /><br />Much of my time was debating with myself the ending and if it was fair and what I would have done. I guess my comment now is that I would welcome a third sequel this time combining the opera and the melodies introduced here with some new ones.<br /><br />This album is for anyone who really loves Phantom of the Opera and took the time to truly understand the story.  In many ways, this sequel surpasses the first.  It is different, and I understand Mr. Webber in that he had to set things up for Eric, after all in that day and time there were not too many places he could have gone.  This album is great for new people too.  You can go backwards and then enjoy the first.<br /><br />I should add that there is a ten year gap between the two parts and that threw me a few times, as like life, things happened during this period.<br /><br />I got very emotional with the first one and the second one is no exception.  I find myself listening to Love Never Dies more now than Phantom, which says something, just the title track, which plays at the end, unlike Phaton where that plays near the onset, is not THE best track.e two parts and that threw me a few times, as like life, things happened during this period.<br /><br />I got very emotional with the first one and the second one is no exception.

B009VSW15Y|1.0|Very disappointed that I had to purchase this item when I thought it was included in the price.  Very misleading!!!  I was almost ready to return my Kindle Fire HD because of that.  Now I am leary of purchasing other items from Amazon.  A terrible marketing tool for the company.  Also, the camera is almost useless without a rear facing camera.  Very unhappy
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game and there are some good and bad. The good parts are that it's faster and very fun on kindle.<br />The bad parts are that there are certain blocks that can't be mined. But is very fun.
B009LUCPWQ|3.0|You know the type.  The kind that politicizes everything.  You can't have fun, rock out, kick back, and just enjoy like the good old days.  No matter how you try to change the subject, he has to drag it back to something where he can preach his little political messages.  Even when you happen to agree with them, you find it annoying.  In recent years unfortunately more and more of Parker's songs have gone from &#34;personal&#34; themes or even generalized comments on society to outright political jingles.  Colonialism, wars of choice, people who want victims of incest to not be able to get abortions, crooked politicians (but only the ones he disagrees with, of course) are bad.  WE GET IT.  The playing also meanders and lacks the sharpness of when the Rumour were young men.   A disappointing way to end their careers and a waste of GP's considerable song writing talents.  The best constructed and played song, Coathangers, tries to imply that women will be back   with coathangers self-aborting   if the other party wins.   Well, they have since this album was made, controlled congress for 5 years and not a peep from them about restricting abortion on the house floor, other than saying &#34;hey, maybe we shouldn't be paying for the abortions of people in other countries&#34;.   I happen to agree with Graham on this issue to a large degree,, but he has become the  &#34;protest singer, singing a protest song&#34; that  Dire Straits mocked over 30 years ago in &#34;Industrial Disease&#34;.    He caricatures his political opponents then attacks the caricature in song.    Boring.   Unfair.    I doubt the rest of the band relished playing this kind of song.      It's a shame.  His meandering vocals were always an aquired taste, but he has chosen to fill the first GP and the Rumour album in 33 years with songs it seems he penciled out while angrily watching a 24 hour news channel or listening to Rush Limbaugh.  Most are a bad match for the band's talents and energetic style.  What's worse is with the upcoming release of &#34;This is 40&#34; where Parker makes an appearance and the band will surely get some buzz, people new to his music whose interest is piqued by the movie are not going to get much classic Graham Parker and the Rumour.  They are going to listen to a few bars of the preview and click off.  Because this is not the kind of music that made them (almost) famous.  Instead, they are going to get some reggae, some country tinged meanderings, pseudo-jazz mixups, several slow/mid tempo songs, and only a handful of hot tracks.  The most rocking song on the album, &#34;coathangers&#34;, is catchy, but alas, shows him in full &#34;that guy&#34; mode as he apparently attempts to link all varying degrees of opposition to abortion, a very complex issue, to the tiny minority of people who think any abortion for any reason is wrong, thus sending women back to coathangers.  Wow, what a cliche'.  The same man who wrote in &#34;too much time to think&#34; 30 years ago the lines  &#34;The whites won't let you live, the blacks won't let you forget,The spaniards at the checkout counter just want to make you sweat&#34; or is now apparently the epitome of political correctness.  &#34;White men&#34; are the new PC punching bag (&#34;making a lot of white men happy&#34;).  Way to stick your neck out, Graham.  This is a real bummer, because what American might really dig is a rocking Graham Parker and the Rumour album.  A lot of what they are getting is a Pete Seger protest album.  I was really excited to hear of the reunion and own all but 1-2 of his previous albums.  But this was a missed opportunity for wider appeal I fear.  I know artists hate to repeat themselves, but hey, if you weren't heard the first time, the polite thing to do is repeat yourself anyway, even if it's a little annoying.
1439152802|5.0|I must admit, I had a really hard time getting into this latest book by Kate Morton, but once the story got going, it never stopped until the very last page.  I feel that \\"The Secret Keeper\\" was on par with [[ASIN:1469226448 The House at Riverton]] which was my favorite Morton novel.<br /><br />And now I will sit patiently and wait for Kate's next novel.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1936891026|4.0|This book has a simple message. The war referred to in the title is between Resistance and Creativity. The author, Steven Pressfield lays out a simple premise. Resistance (the capitalization is deliberate) is an impersonal, implacable foe that fights our creative drive or urges. It's impersonal in that it inflicts itself on everyone, and in direct relation our personal need to create. Creativity doesn't just mean painting or writing, but can be any activity that we are compelled to undertake, like dieting or developing a deep relationship. The stronger the personal need to do something the stronger resistance will be. In other words, the greater the fear the greater our personal need to do something.<br /><br />When I say do something, this book is all about taking action. That action may be sitting down in front of keyboard for so many hours or pages (daily-we never beat Resistance). It may be practicing an instrument. It may be counting calories eaten or miles run. Resistance moves to stop us in either direct or indirect ways. Avoidance, procrastination, rationalization, letting the creative time slip, just this once. You get the idea.<br /><br />The opposite urge is the one to create. Call it your muse or angel, or Creativity, it, also, is impersonal, rewarding us in direct relation to the amount of effort we give towards our personal creative urges. Outcomes aren't what creativity is about, nor are fame or fortune. The creative act is its own reward.  Pros face Resistance directly and do the work. When they do, Creativity steps in and allows the creative urge or muse to work through us. It works individually without the need for therapy, support or process, at least according to Mr. Pressfield, who has obviously practice what he preaches.<br /><br />That's pretty much the whole book. It reads like a Seth Godin manifesto. Things are laid out in black and white. You're either giving in to Resistance or worshiping at the alter of Creativity. If you respond well to this kind of book, it's great. If you want a more nuanced exploration there are other works like: [[ASIN:0393311066 The Courage to Create]] by Rollo May or [[ASIN:0609803700 Callings: Finding and Following an Authentic Life]] by Greg Levoy. Another wise work is [[ASIN:B002WGPM3K Art & Fear]]  by Bayles & Orland. I found The War of Art a good kick in the pants, which makes it well worth the cost.this kind of book, it's great.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is a well written book. I like that everything fell into place. Dislike that this is the last book. I already have influenced others to buy the series and read it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|We saw this movie three times in the theater and have watched it twice at home. We will likely wear it out!
B00A0R08KA|4.0|I haven't seen the theatrical release, so this review is strictly for the unrated version. I really enjoyed this film, even though I kept thinking about the Arnold version I grew up with. The 1990 Total Recall is superior in many ways, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this one. There are enough differences between the two to enjoy both. I'm not against remakes in general, but I think they work better when they take a good idea from a movie or tv show that didn't quite work, rather than remake a largely successful film. That said, this one does pretty well.<br /><br />Colin Farrell replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, and his wife is now played by Kate Beckinsale. Colin is much more of the everyman than Arnold was in the role. The movie follows the same basic plot, with some small and large differences. There's no more mars, no more mutants vs. humans. The movie is almost exclusively shown from Farrell's perspective, which helps the dream vs. reality debate.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was well worth my time. I enjoyed watching it. While it may not quite measure up to the original, it was still an enjoyable ride.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read this many years ago (in French) and it was hard.  I've never read the translated version, so it will be refreshing.  Loved the play and the music and although they are not the same, I have always loved this story and glad to get a chance to read it on Kindle!
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I think I could listen to Bella's Lullaby all day!  I love the whole soundtrack, especially Full Moon and Flightless Bird.
B008MEM24S|2.0|I bought this app because of the high ratings but as a game it really just sucked.  there are better free games out there and since I git this about 2 months ago never played it again after spending 20 or so minutes with it.  don't listen to me if ya don't wanta but yeah there's better games out there.
098357670X|5.0|This is the most complete and entertaining book on caricature I've ever encountered. And it's written and illustrated by one of the top caricaturists/cartoonists in the country. Tom has done a thorough job of explaining his process and providing plenty of great examples of his work. I don't know how he found time to do this book, considering how busy and sought-after he is, but it's a winner and a necessity for any cartoonist's collection.
B004LROMWU|5.0|This came brand new in it's original packaging.  I couldn't wait to watch it.  It came protectively packaged and on time.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I didn't understand too much the trailer, but the movie is amazing, i though that i wasn't like that movie because was a little bit slow but after 20 minutes i saw that I was wrong, it's a really good movie and I am sure that everything was for real, if you like the drama and action you should watch this movie, 10/10. I had a while without watch a movie like that, it's so nice, i love it.

0205313426|4.0|This book contains many helpful tips to improve your writing.  It is useful to anyone that is looking to strengthen any aspect of their writing.  I have used this book in high school for AP English courses and in college for an advanced composition course.  It has proved useful in both cases.  It works great as a quick reference to clear up any questions from how to use certain words or phrases properly to when or when not to use a comma and much much more.  With each rule explained there are multiple examples to help the reader better understand how to implement that rule into their own writing.

B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I'm a very, very picky TV viewer. I really am. And I find it difficult to bond with characters, or even come back to a show again and again, and with enthusiasm, but not with Grey's Anatomy.<br />Every season is excellent. You'll find the most well rounded, lovable, and interesting characters on television. And you'll laugh out-loud as much as you'll cry. This series has been made so superbly, and it's one of the only shows that my husband and I both agree on, and that we both look forward to. There's not a person alive who cannot identify with at least one of these characters, and I love that the writers aren't afraid to encroach on an interesting array of subject matter.<br /><br />One of TV's finest and most entertaining.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This item is proven and doesn't really need a review..it's identical to the standard case with slots to allow airflow, more sound, and plugging in external accessories. The camera stays cooler and will not fog with this cover compared to the original cover.

1439102732|3.0|I read this for my book club or probably would not have chosen it.  The plot exposes emotions and issues related to infertility, lesbianism, and legal issues around IVF embryos, but I never really engaged with the characters.  While I disliked a couple of characters (as the writer intended), I did not strongly like any of the other characters.  This left the story in &#34;neutral&#34; for me.
B007SGM084|1.0|this book has no plot, the characters have no depth, they just have wonderful sex all the time.  How lame is that?
B007HACDLK|4.0|After Vince's first bad book ever, he came back with a solid Mitch Rapp story in &#34;The Last Man&#34; . Wished they could adapt these books to the big screen. Mitch Rapp's charachter has a lot more depth then the Jack Reacher books do.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|AGAIN, just like everyone one is saying, Where are the extended editions on blu-ray? Will it eventually be released? Any one know?
1439102813|5.0|What an amazing story. Very powerful. If you work wit individuals dealing with Alzheimers, this book gives great perspective! Must read
0547884591|5.0|If you are someone who liked Tim Ferriss' books \\"4-hour workweek\\" or \\"4 hour body\\" then I think this book will be right up your alley. The focus is certainly on cooking, but I find all of the other discussions in the book to be the real reason to buy it. I think if you have the time and a small amount of money this book can show you how to go from being a \\"cook\\" that just repeats his recipes (which is fine! I plan on staying in this territory myself for quite a while!) to a \\"chef\\" where you are someone who suddenly \\"gets\\" food and cooking.<br /><br />Honestly, my only complaint is not feeling like I had access to more of the conversation around all of these topics. I know Tim has released some stuff as special offers and I hope he releases it again in some kind e-book style (completely unformatted would be fine by me!) that is available for purchase or donation. Since the books weighs in at over 600 pages, I understand but I guess that just speaks to how much I enjoy the writing!
B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators is typical Grisham - young lawyer gets caught up in something he never dreamed, many characters driven by greed and dreams of what might be, and the neophyte turns out to be the wisest of all.  While the plot is familiar, the narrative and style still pulls the reader in and maintains interest to the end.
1569242739|5.0|This is a gold mine for the vegan that bakes, even if that vegan has never baked before. The ingredients aren't strange and use things out of your vegan pantry (I spent $75 purchasing crazy ingredients at Whole Foods for one recipe in Babycakes that was mediocre at best), the instructions are easy to follow, and, best of all, these cook up into amazing cupcakes - and I am freaking FUSSY about my cupcakes (and other baked goods).<br /><br />My two favorite recipes are for the chocolate cupcakes (Your Basic Chocolate Cupcake), with a little extra vanilla extract, and some coconut extract for good measure, with the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (ditto with the vanilla and coconut here too), and the Carrot Cake Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting. So. Amazing.<br /><br />I made both of these recipes in mini form for my daughter's first birthday party, and they were a hit with all of my non-vegan friends (I kept hearing, \\"And can you believe they're vegan?!\\" around the room).<br /><br />The only thing I've made so far that I haven't cared for was the batch of Thick Chocolate Fudgey Frostin'. I suspect this has more to do with my lack of good-quality soy milk powder that the actual recipe.

B008133MDK|5.0|There are so many pros to this show: Moffat, Cumberbatch, everything ever and always about it.<br /><br />Cons: Why must it only be three episodes a season? You've driving me crazy, Moffat! I can't wait until August for more! Do you have any idea how crazy I'll be going by then?<br /><br />Watch this show if you: Enjoy masochism by Moffat. (This show is perfect for Whovians.)
0061474355|5.0|I think one of the reasons this series and Sabriel in particular has such a draw is the almost Tolkienian sense of loss that the reader feels early on--the Old Kingdom has fallen into quasi-anarchy without the royal family to lead it or mend what's been broken (trying not to spoil here), and on a more personal level Sabriel's own memories of the Old Kingdom have lost since faded away. As to Sabriel's character, I enjoy that she is not just another hyper-reactive heroine: throughout the book she tends to approach situations almost academically--which keeps with her bookish, proper character--rather than simply *feeling* things all the time, which is a common pitfall with female characters. I've seen this criticized a few times, but I think it allows the reader to superimpose their own feelings onto hers--I enjoy being able to put myself in her shoes. This is less the case with Lirael, which the bulk of the series deals with: by this point, Nix has hit his stride and has much more room to work in with the duology--gut feelings and emotional involvement have a much larger impact on the story itself, whereas in Sabriel there is simply a job to be done.<br /><br />Possibly the best thing in Nix's writing, however, is that there is very little 'fluff' to it, despite the fact that in Lirael the meat of the plot takes a while to become obvious. Almost every dialogue means something to the plot, lends itself greatly to character development, and moves the story along, which might have been difficult given how much more emotion is present in this part of the series. The emotional draw of character development is much stronger with Lirael, as well, as the story starts when she is younger and shows her progress over the next few years. By contrast, Sabriel is almost grown and presumably set in her ways. I enjoy the interplay of similarities and differences between Lirael and Sabriel, which eventually leads the reader to Lirael's inheritance as the Abhorsen-in-waiting.<br /><br />Overall, I've re-read this series a few times now and I recommend it to anyone with ears and an inclination toward fantasy. The plot and the world are tightly written, and the pacing is excellent all the way through. I'll keep reading these books every year for a long while. :)/>Overall, I've re-read this series a few times now and I recommend it to anyone with ears and an inclination toward fantasy.

The stars are wonderful; Richard Armitage is to die for!

Watching Richard Armitage silently begging her to look back is truly priceless!  Beautiful!
B006PTL1QM|4.0|... ultimately not as profound an investigation into the characters of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung as it ought to have been, and indeed as it seemed it would be for 90% of the film. It's scarcely a film about Freud at all; Jung is the central character throughout. It's the ethical, emotional and intellectual turmoil of his life that shapes the drama; his divergence from Freud is presented as largely the result of sexual and professional jealousy on both sides, with just the merest hint of the impending catastrophe of anti-semitism and an even slimmer hint of the substantial incompatibility of Freud's and Jung's psychological models. Nevertheless, the very capable acting of Viggo Mortensen as Freud and Michael Fassbender as Jung keeps the film engrossing.<br /><br />The insurmountable problem is the acting of Keira Knightley in the role of the historical person Sabina Spielrein, first shown on screen as a flailing hysteric, then as a challenging patient significantly \\"helped\\" by Jung's psychoanalysis, then as the masochistic lover and manipulator of Jung, thus becoming the \\"wedge\\" between Jung and Freud. The characterological triangle is not entirely implausible. In fact, it might approach \\"fact\\" or at least insight. But Knightley so freakishly overacts throughout that the triangle loses its hypotenuse. Knightley's grimaces and writhings are hard enough to watch, but her spoken dialogue is horrible. She seems to be attempting a \\"Russian\\" accent in this English-language script that rightly should be in German. Alas, her Russo-English slips often - sometimes in mid sentence - into a twangy LA Valley Girl accent. And how's that for weird, since she is actually British by birth? Even if her accent were better managed, her speaking technique is amateurish; \\"stars\\" who are paid celestial salaries surely can be expected to have basic skills of dramatic elocution.<br /><br />I'm stymied about a proper rating for this film. As I said, I found it engrossing; ergo four stars, though Knightly is so awful that I'm tempted to slam the film with a three. There's also, to my mind, a failure of resolve in the abrupt ending of the film. Bang, it's over, and we are informed by crawling script that Jung survived his WW1 breakdown and lived until 1961! Sabina Spielrein and her two children were killed by a Nazi German SS Death Squad, Einsatzgruppe D in August 1942 in Zmievskaya Balka, together with 27,000 other victims.hough Knightly is so awful that I'm tempted to slam the film with a three.

B008RYN44U|2.0|Among many, I was very excited for this album. Among many, I was very disappointed with this album. I understand the concept of an artist's sound maturing and/or evolving over time, but this album is not that. This album is far departed from their signature sound outside of Settle Down. This song simply sounds like an album of songs from my 90's junior prom, very boring. I tried to give this albums legitimate chance and listened to it several times through, but still was disappointed. If you want No Doubt, go listen to their other albums.

Both Jared and Jensen are superior actors.  Jensen is natural in his part, and seems not to even try to &#34;act&#34;.  He just is Dean.  It does not hurt that they are so good looking.  They also did a spot on casting of Bobby and Cass.  The stories are usually fresh and new.  I can't always tell how they are going to get out of thier dilemma, and the story keeps my attention.

A very rich history to the world and a new approach to magic - at least from my reading experience.

However, this forth one of the series was a giant disappoint.  (Feast for Crows) It was so bad that I left the last three jackets each containing six CD's at my family house. When I went online to re-order the book I read the reviews and did not even bother ordering the book. Seriously,it is not the authors finest hour..I felt like the book was filler for the next book
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game reminds me of Azada which requires a lot of thinking. It is not your average hidden object game.<br />I loved it and would suggest it to anyone who has a lot of patience.
B009SQRC9E|4.0|The story and characters are very entertaining.  It's not something that you have to watch year after year, but kids between 2 and 12 will thoroughly enjoy it and parents won't mind watching it with their children because it does have some humor and it's not a super annoying movie full of annoying characters like some of the younger children stuff.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this series was wonderful, I can't wait for the next one to come out. Its a great read. I have read the 50 shades series like 5 times and didn't think I could find one I loved just as much but I have. The only complaint that I have is they are not long enough.  I have already recommend the series to friends and hope that they enjoy as much as me which I sure they will
B0002F6AH0|4.0|I like history, and am especially interested in the history of WW 2, and how the results have shaped our current political world.<br />I remember watching the World at War series as a young teenager, in the 1970's.
B001V7YJMG|2.0|I meant to catch this movie when it was released to somewhat more mixed reviews.  Now it's 98% at RT and 4-stars here, and it's available on Netflix, where I saw it...<br /><br />Did not like it.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the name \\"Let the Right One In\\".  I was expecting a climactic choice between opposing entities, based on the need to give permission for a vampire to cross a threshold.  Instead, after a slow Swedish build-up, which I don't have any problems with, the movie ended.<br /><br />There are three subplots with surprising little interaction between, or drama within them.  Eli the vampire needs a new keeper.  She disposes of the old one and acquires a new one with little fanfare.<br /><br />The neighbors disappear like 5 little indians, with only a limp attempt to fulfill one of the great slasher film cliches, \\"take on the monster alone and die\\".  Both plots are greatly facilitated by the utter lack of police presence in the face of a series of macabre murders.<br /><br />And a revenge fantasy where poor little Oskar finally stands up to the school bullies armed only with a sheath knife and a homicidal vampire bff.  Again, driven by a complete lack of authority figures and some grossly overdrawn delinquents.<br /><br />Since the whole movie centers around Oskar I was sucked into cheering for him and his romance with Eli, then felt completely manipulated when he evolved into the most sociopathic turd of the pile.  It's not clear whether the director intends to condemn vengeance (\\"capital punishment is completely unacceptable in a society of laws\\") in stereotypical Swedish \\"neutrality\\" fashion, or if it's a parody of that, or if he simply wanted to gussy up his vampire trash with some Euro deep thought.  My money's on the latter.<br /><br />Based on reviews by those who read the book, I get the feeling some of the themes got lost in translation.  The neighbors were apparently drunks and perhaps less sympathetic victims than in the film. And the father's drinking problem is so low key that US audiences read the subtext as homosexuality.  Of course, with Jocke and Lacke's mooning about and the nature of Eli's 12 year old immortality, I'm surprised no one has decided this is an extended metaphor about AIDS...<br /><br />To sum up, nothing much of consequence happens, there is no one to cheer for, but it takes two hours for this dismal parade to conclude.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Everyone has favorite books, but this one was absolutely terrific.  Words cannot describe how I felt at the end of it.  I always had such respect for our military, but this book will make you think for many months to come about it.  Adam Brown is my hero - alongside my own father.  It captures your heart in every sense of the word.  I wish his family only the best in life.  How he started like alot of our young people (drugs, alcohol, jail, etc.) and made himself into this loving, caring, and extraordinary person/navy seal is well worth reading.  I plan to buy this book for Christmas for some young people who need to read it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great download for free one too! you can play with other too, i have lost to ever one i have played too great job making this program guys!

B007MU85D0|5.0|Love this album.  The sound is coherent throughout and the lyrics are strong.  The songs are ethereal and pretty to listen to, but once you start listening to the words and the types of intruments chosen you realize that individually each fits and adds to the overarching themes of the album as well.  Really well done all round.  One of my top 5 of the year.
1558908382|5.0|Seriously she is hot! but probably the soundtrack is one of the several things that makes this a good movie. Simple story line but a very entertaining love comedy.
B0031RSA24|5.0|This must be read by all and sundry, whether young or old, religious or otherwise. The arguments are great and show the hollowness of the religion and connected dogmas. Though, I was rather bored with the pedantic narration. At times, I had to skim through the paragraphs, to get to the next point.<br /><br />I would definitely read more works of the author.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I must admit that this is one of my all time favorite movies. It's a feel good movie and whether or not you are a like me and find it hard to find trust in a relationship, you will still love this movie. It gives you hope hahah
1400049628|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sons birthday when he turned 17. Of course, he loves it! He still has it!
B009A9EYUO|5.0|Just got it in the mail after waiting for release date. Absolutely fantastic! What a great album and now to be able to blast it through my turntable, I will be rocking for a long time to come with this! Two listens through now and I badly want to fill in my Rage vinyl collection, hope they release more 20yr anniversary vinyls over the next decade.
1401224792|4.0|WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND is the second standalone trade in Bill Willingham's Fables series.  I preferred the first (1001 NIGHTS OF SNOWFALL), but that may be because I loved its structure so much.<br /><br />WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND finds Bigby Wolf (the Big Bad Wolf to those who haven't read a Fables book before), arriving in Story City, Iowa.  He's searching for a new location for Fabletown and did not expect to find a community of werewolves - especially not one containing a few familiar faces.<br /><br />Vertigo promises that WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND is a good place to start Fables as well as entertaining adventure for old fans of the mythos.  As someone who has read several Fables books but not even close to half of what is available, I'll endorse that statement.  There's nothing going on in the novel that requires knowledge of the main story arc, and plenty of hints about what has gone on to intrigue new readers.  (At least, it will intrigue new readers who want to see Prince Charming duel Bluebeard.)<br /><br />Art is, of course, a big part of any successful graphic novel.  For the most part I like the art in WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND.  The colors are soft, the lines are clean, and there are plenty of backgrounds but the panels aren't cluttered.  The shading feels rather old school to me, which I liked.  It fits a tale involving a long flashback to WWII.  But some panels just didn't work for me.  Some of the close ups just have such dead eyes that it is both creepy and distracting.<br /><br />The story is pretty simple.  I wish Oda, the girl passed out on the cover, had more to do.  She might be precognitive and she certainly gets a portentous last line, but she disappears during the climax . . . passed out.  (Before that she gets the cliche woman trying to seduce a guy to her purposes scene.)  Bigby Wolf, meanwhile, gets to show off his sense of law and justice on the frontier.  Unsurprisingly, it's swift and brutal.  It's nice to see a bit of Bigby's past, but it's a bit boring to see him put up against a group of werewolves who are so outclassed.  (And I don't think the whole \\"Bigby-as-the-werewolf-God\\" thing was every fully explained.)<br /><br />WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND is an entertaining adventure and will definitely appeal to those looking to read a standalone graphic novel in addition to fans of the Fables series.  Fairytale fans might pursue an entry in the series more based in folklore, however.  And yes, this book is rated for mature readers including violence and full-frontal nudity of both genders, mostly nonsexual.  Probably nothing an older teen can't handle, but not the best choice of reading for your morning commute depending on how nosy your fellow passengers are.by's past, but it's a bit boring to see him put up against a group of werewolves who are so outclassed.

B000F6IINK|5.0|Every recording artist (group) has its defining moment of greatness. This is Mario's moment!! A truly great album from start to finish. Although often criticised in his native Italy for not singing in Italian,  he has stuck to his guns and followed his &#34;path less travelled&#34;. The international success of this album is a slap in the face to all of  those who doubted him and his unique talents. He deserves all the accolades and the spotlight. This album is a masterpiece!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of the very best Reacher books - on edge of seat kind of book.  Awesome! This is a must read for Reacher fans.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Amazing book! I have been reading this series over and over since I was 12, I am now 22, and it gets better every time I read it. The world that Nix creates is very original and draws you in. The magic in this world is unique and brilliantly thought out, you don't wave around a wand and *poof!* something happens, you have to mentally reach into the a vast well of magic called the 'Charter' and pull out certain marks, link them together in your mind to create the spell you want and then say or draw them to cast a spell. The bells that the Abhorsen wields each have their own purposes and the reader can easily see them in action in their mind's eye. The characters all have interesting stories and you want to learn more about them and see how they are going to survive and defeat all the free magic and dead creatures that are thrown their way. I absolutely recommend this book and the rest of the series if you are looking for a new book to read and want something original, well written, and full of fascinating characters and magic. Highly recommended.
1451627289|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle and ended up buying the hard cover for my sister as a gift.  I would like to say this is classic Stephen King, but I can't.  Don't get me wrong, I read almost of his work and he really did a great job on this.  Allot of fact finding went into this novel.  I would recommend this book even to those who don't read Stephen King.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|YEP.<br />This one is a good one. Get control of your files and see where all your stuff is on the Kindle (at least the Gen2 Fire).  Good app.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Sense  I was a kid i have loved this book. It will always be one of my favorite books. Now i pass it on.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Does not work on my Fire 2nd Gen.  Very disappointing. IDK if there is a problem with my device or if the app just doesn't like Gen2 Fire.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Its almost worth watching just to see how amazing the rendering of her red hair is.  Worth watching but not at the awesome level - maybe because it repeats a variety of earlier tropes.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Very disappointing.  It loads on my Gen 2 Fire but refuses to play anything.  I've D/L it 3 times just in case it was corrupted in transit but no joy.  Your mileage may vary.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|very very FEW commercials and thousands of stations to choose from and you can record hours of hours of. Music that is in mp3 format and you can skip around to any song in the time that you have recorded them also the music is in 128k format ,but it's compressed somehow and 8 hours of. Music take only a 100 megs Of space compared to what normally would be a. Meg for each minute , so it's well worth a dollar anytime ,I will of paid more by I'm glad they are not asking for more,it gives me the option to but similar products and take chances of getting the same results.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Nice app.  Plays fairly fast and it seems to be a lot smarter than I am when it comes to music but I can play &#34;Heart And Soul&#34; on it.  Lots of fun.
B004GYY714|5.0|the quality is perfect and the selection makes regular radio seem more than old and boring,no matter what type of music you like they have dozens if channels per genre which is great,they even some channels that are. Just tone articulated artist,and he music is looped, so in most case it's several hours of unrepeatable songs .
B007VUA7VO|5.0|As nice as the FREE app is I wonder just how much more the pay version can give me.  If I were not so cheap, I would buy it and find out.  I recommend the free one anyway.

B008BO61BE|5.0|The CD is better than the original due to extras... but the DVD is fantastic!  The 1983 US festival footage has been in legal limbo for nearly 30 years... and finally Priest and Quiet Riot footage has been openly released.  Since my brother and I were 2 of the estimated 400,000+/- people in attendance, I look forward to more releases of the other preformances the magnificent day!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This is a very good movie.  My girlfriend and I rented and watched and enjoyed it very very much so watch it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a truly amazing and inspirational book. To see what Mr. Brown overcame in his life was a true testimony of God's grace and mercy.
1451695195|4.0|Books on near-death experiences (NDEs) can be both wonderful--in the fullest sense of the term--and frustrating. This is particularly true in the case of Alexander's book.<br /><br />On the one hand the book is very suggestive of the \\"more things in heaven and earth\\" than most people dream of in their philosophies. The plot in a nutshell is this: Dr. Alexander is an experienced and well-published neurosurgeon who had a uniquely horrible encounter with meningitis, from which his chances of survival, let along full recovery, were absurdly low. His neo-cortex was completely \\"shut down\\" for a week, restricting him to reptilian-brain functioning. Yet he survived, and returned inexplicably to full mental functioning. The extreme character of the medical story alone makes this book truly fascinating. But of course it is not simply about this recovery. Alexander awoke with the immediate memory of an excessively realistic, highly complex experience with spiritual-conscious realities he arbitrarily labels the \\"Earthworm's Eye-View,\\" the \\"Gateway,\\" the \\"Core,\\" \\"Om,\\" and so forth. This experience shocked him out of his cozy relationship with materialist reductionism (as a neurosurgeon it is a natural methodological position), and taught him that the universe has a vast invisible dimension of consciousness, in which there is a single truth: love.<br /><br />With that last point, one of the frustrating elements emerges: a sense of hokiness. At various points one hears echoes of this or that religious tradition as Alexander represents his experience, but only insofar as they help him convey a one-tone message of cosmic love. As the \\"Girl on the Butterfly Wing\\" tells him: \\"You are loved and cherished. You have nothing to fear. You can do no wrong\\" (71). The problem of suffering turns out not to be one, since it is a necessary condition for spiritual growth (a potentially substantive argument) and the amount of good in the universe vastly overwhelms the amount of evil (a possible but dissatisfying argument classically articulated by Leibniz) (48, 83). One can't help but feeling a bit leery about such a God. How do we bring it down to earth? Is it too immaterial, too unperturbed, too personal, its message too simple? Not for Alexander, for whom all this has an immediacy--which I can respect--that holds up under reflective nitpicking. But for the rest of us?<br /><br />On the whole I find this and other exceptional NDEs fairly convincing when it comes to challenging the boundaries of reality, even if they create more questions than they answer. Yes, the whole brain was not inactive in Alexander's case, but the possibility of his particular experience stemming from the most archaic parts of the brain is probably just as incredible as the interpretation Alexander gives to it. (His brief appendix of possible neurological explanations and their shortcomings is useful here.)<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting thing to reflect on here is the place of NDEs and other \\"paranormal\\" events in relation to \\"religion\\" and \\"science,\\" both of which occasionally dislike the paranormal. The reason for this dislike is, of course, that the paranormal challenges set ways of thinking about the world, which we may with good reason hold dearly. Anomalous events are uncomfortable, and we frequently deal with uncomfortable things through ridicule. Humor often masks genuine discomfiture. But at the same time, anomalous events play a central role in both scientific and religious mythology; anomalies can be the portal through which our knowledge of reality can be greatly altered or expanded. Religious and scientific revolutions can be precipitated by one strange fact duly regarded. Religion and science are thus invested in keeping one foot in the world of (radical) empiricism, even though this world threatens to unsettle master narratives. The paranormal is a stubborn reminder of this continuing authority of experience over dogma of every kind. William James is probably still our guide here.<br /><br />The paranormal can also help us break down the rigid divide between the subjective and objective viewpoints, about which Thomas Nagel ([[ASIN:0195056442 The View From Nowhere]]) has written helpfully. One of the real sticking points between \\"religion\\" people and \\"science\\" people (to the extent these artificial tribes exist outside of internet forums) is the validity of the subjective. Is the way things seem to me real in some fundamental sense? Is consciousness important in itself? Does it have its own reality, perhaps indivisible from material reality? Is mind all-pervasive? If so, does it culminate in something like God? Is that culminating reality personal in some way? Are there conscious events that are not merely epiphenomenal shadows of physical ones? Does mind--does my mind--have a destiny that transcends death? These are questions that \\"science\\" people answer more or less in the negative. \\"Religion\\" people generally do not. Now the paranormal suggests, in its weird ways, that the subjective is not just an illusion, a sad little side-effect, an outlier to the \\"really real.\\" If this is true, the values, representations, and goals of consciousness can no longer be dismissed a priori when it comes to addressing the really real. Indeed, certain paranormal experiences grant subjectivity so much reality that their objective content is almost never the same. Jeffrey Kripal ([[ASIN:0226453871 Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred]]) gives us a good sense of this. Because of the free-form of the subjective, the paranormal by no means provides a blanket confirmation to any particular form of religious representation. On the contrary! Alexander's own experience of the afterlife seems to have disappointed him in certain respects (see pp. 162-64), or at least would have done so had the affective quality of his experience not been so overwhelmingly positive. Those who look on it from without, however, can still feel some consternation. (I did.)<br /><br />In any case, I respect Alexander for writing the book, which is certainly an important one, however it \\"rubs\\" you. Its generic oddness may not help the cause: it is a family drama, a medical record, a paranormal eye-witness account, and a scientific commentary all at woven tightly, but artificially together. In such a small space, it can hardly fulfill all its tasks to everyone's satisfaction, but it does make its principle message clear. I think that more important than any frustration caused by this or that particular should be our wonder at the overall fact of Alexander's experience. It really does make you think, and maybe even hope.

B0053O89Z6|3.0|I dont know didn't like this season all that much.  They seem to be a lot of filler episodes where the comedy is OK i guess.  Somehow I have the feeling they been overstretching this series a little bit, I have been watching season 8 and have the exact same feeling if not worse.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|A bit long, but was entertaining enough to waste a couple of hours. Some decent action scenes and Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron are always nice to look at. Not a movie I would watch again, but if nothing else is on, its entertaining enough.

B00877R85I|4.0|I ignored the hype that was the Hunger games for quite a while and even turned down an invitation from a friend to go and see the movie but like most things, I eventually got sucked into it one night when my husband and I were looking for a movie to watch.  It was a good movie.  I was worried that it would be a poor version of the classic movie Battle Royale or the love triangle of Twilight but it stood on it's own two feet.<br /><br />I was then inspired to read the book on the back of the movie as I wanted just a bit more background and details on the characters and overall story.  The book gave me this.  It was well written and flowed very well.<br /><br />Part I allowed us to meet \\"The Tributes\\" giving us a good background of the main characters and the reasoning behind the Hunger games.  This part was not covered in as much detail in the movie so it was interesting for me to get a better feel for Katniss and Peeta, the two main characters.<br /><br />Part II was the actual games and made up the majority of the movie.  It was suitably graphic without being too much so - I guess it is aimed at Young Adults so was less graphic than it could have been.  I was disappointed at some of the detail that had been left out the movie but glad I read the book to pick it up.<br /><br />Part III the story of the Victors and, I guess, the lead up to the second book in the trilogy.  A bit predictable but I am hoping that it is just setting a certain scene that will be developed latter on.<br /><br />I am not sure what the justification behind writing this as three books rather than one large book - was it to split it up or just to make more money.  You can't say that the book would have been too long otherwise or you just have to look at each of the Game of Throne books to know that they work at over 1000 pages each.  I would have preferred to just have one book to keep on reading as I now have to re-motivate myself to read the next two.  Although on the plus side, I can put it down and read something else and then go back to it, something I would not do if it were one whole book.  Slightly torn on that one.<br /><br />An interesting read and I am really looking forward to finding out more about how Panem came about, I just hope the author covers that.  My fear is that she doesn't and it ends up just another predictable love triangle story similar to Twilight. 4 out of 5.down and read something else and then go back to it, something I would not do if it were one whole book.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|As a college health professor, I was excited to share this film with all of my students.  The film doesn't ask you to choose this product or that... it aims to educate on the origins of todays foods.  It's an eye opener for young adults who don't think twice about what they are putting into their bodies and how food is processed.  I'm continually pleased with the feedback from students on this film.  They are starting to ask the right questions and understand that their purchases at the grocery are indeed a &#34;vote&#34; for what consumers want.

087033039X|5.0|This book, is yet another of Bruce Grants, instructional items, that I re-purchased.. I have two other<br />of his books, and this is an intricate continuation... First was his &#34;Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather<br />Braiding&#34;, and the second was, &#34;How to Make Cowboy Horse Gear&#34; ... This one deals with a great deal of<br />work, that isn't &#34;all&#34; in the first ones... There are some overlaps, but in general, it covers things I wanted..<br />The three, including this one, are re-buys, because I lost my three in a fire... :(  Obviously I was, or am<br />content with them, or I wouldn't have pursued replacements... Initially one was out of print for a while..<br /> Any of these instructional books require paying attention, and moving through the steps, slowly...<br />It is difficult to make drawings, that are completely able to make you a master, in a short time.. some<br />trial and error, and some re-dos... But this WILL, get you where you want to go....I know there are others<br />that are, probably as capable, but I like these...  I would recommend this, and the others &#34;Bruce Grant&#34;<br />has in print, if you are interested in learning some really neat things.. And, NO, I am not being compensated,<br />I just like the way he, and his illustrator, are able to make this work understood...I have looked into some of<br />the other books, but, I found these more to my liking... I guess that is why I replaced the three, of his, that I lost......... I hope I have helped someone....
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet. These movies are extraordinary in every sense of the word. Each move has a perfect cast with two main antagonists and (obviously) one main protagonist, Batman. In this trilogy we see batman as a young man beginning a legend, we see batman face the chaos of organized crime, and we witness an end to the dark knight legend. These movies are easily in my top 20 of greatest movies maybe even top 10. This collector's edition is not the ultimate collector's edition which will be released in the spring, but this is an amazing collection nevertheless. For just 25$ i would've been jubilant with just the movies but they even throw in the ultraviolet copies of the movies (which i know have been panned though i have not tried it yet), a discount for when the ultimate edition is released in the spring, and an abridged version of the book \\"the art of making the dark knight trilogy\\". It is a terrific bundle with great value and endless replay value. I recommend this product highly.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|I was actually surprised by how good this book was. Not bad at all considering it being based on a game and all. If you enjoy the games and like reading sci-fi novels go ahead. Reading about the background of Chief and Cortana is pretty amusing.
0547884591|5.0|When I read his books, I learn something new, that is simple, practical and effective.  Mix in some funny side stories, like The Vermonster and you are entertained as well. Well done as always Tim.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Heard some of the reviews on talk radio so decided to take a chance and get this book.  It is great reading.  I took an overseas trip and finished the book on the flight on my iPad.  Read it, you won't regret it.  Great first personal account of one of the most important historical event of our generation.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I can't use the rotate setting because it makes a loud, continuous clicking noise. The reason I bought it was because it moved so I regret this purchase. It happened the 2nd time I used it, so it's not like it worked for a while & then broke.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Season one was good, season two was slow, this season picks up the pace. If you like Zeds this season is for you.
B0096BIENY|5.0|This is a truly a great collection of Il Divo and what they have worked on for over eight years. Song after Song these wonderful passioned singers perform great songs in the way only IL Divo can. If this is your first CD of theres you will be amazed, if your a long time fan like me you will still love it and want this collection. There are four new songs on this greatest hits collection too all done with voices that are truly wonderful. If you ever get a chance to see these guys live it will be a concert that will stay with you forever they are the best live performing group ever I saw. Truly amazing voices and a great CD for everyone to enjoy! A must have gift for yourself or for others!

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have four busy kids, two part time jobs, volunteer work and a traveling hubby. My calendar is nearly impossible to manage...then I bought CalenGoo. It is the best thing on my Kindle Fire. Using it to set up events is far easier than google calendar which I have on--and access from--my cell phone and my laptop. It's quick, easy and easily accessed no matter where I am. It also syncs with my other digital calendars as well as my husband's phone, so even when he's traveling, he's connected to life at home.<br /><br />I love it and highly recommend it for anyone with a busy, on-the-go life.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This drum stands alone so a child can sit and play. It has nice pleasing tones. It is very well made and I'm very happy with my choice. I ordered several different musical items which arrived promptly and in good shape. I would definitely order items from this company again.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy to play and intuitive with my Fire's touch screen. I play it often to kill those spare moments between appointments or before bed. I love the difficulty levels, as the challenge is a blast. Much more fun than tradition solitaire.
0062082353|5.0|I'm giving this as a Christmas gift. Therefore, I have not read this personally. I'm sure the recipient of my gift will enjoy it, however.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|enjoyed the read- simple and yet so meaningful. a book you will read over and over again. Heartwarming, motivating and just makes you think about your goals in life.
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Mariah, the cutest songbird ever lights up the season with her original work and some Christmas classics. I play this over and over and never get tired of it. This is a mandatory add to your Christmas collection.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|This has a  clever plot though it is not always easy to follow.  Good for reading on Kindle on a trip!
1781163243|5.0|A lot of times people show me art books from their favorite movies and as a concept artist I'm get underwhelmed by the work BUT this compilation of 343's work comes out beautiful and translate wonderfully into the game.

B007HACDLK|4.0|this book holds up to all previous books in this series. another one of those read until the end as quickly as possible.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|This game is great to play while watching or should I say listening to tv. Good for multi taskers. Just started playing little over an hour not bored yet.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the birds and the graphics.  Also the music.  My husband and I compete against each other and keep high scores.  Wonderful fun!
B008OHV5QO|4.0|I love Neil Young, so this was a no brainer.  Pretty cool stuff - if you're a Neil fan, then this goes in your collection.  Wish the song list was a bit better, but I'm not complaining!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Better than the first 2.  Didn't think it could get better.  Everything explained in detail and very satisfying finish.  I was angry at the end of book 1 and didn't know if I wanted to keep reading but went on line and read the first chapter and decided to continue.  Glad I did.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|What a great app. I returned 2 Fires, thinking they \\"wouldn't\\" charge, when it was actually a battery meter issue.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More development of the characters and more explained.  Liked book 2 and 3 better than 1 although 1 was good also.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I liked this game.  Hidden objects is one of my favorite game to play.  I had a lot of fun with Azada.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked the book but was angry at the end.  Wasn't sure I wanted to read the next two but I previewed the first chapter of book 2 and decided I would try.  Very glad I did.  Book 2 and 3 explain a lot of things and very satisfying ending.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I chose this book on a whim and the preview was engrossing. I found myself grabbed from page 1. While the story itself is a tried and true tale of a people who have survived some horrible cataclysm but dont know where they came from or even that there was ever anything except the current state of affairs it is presented with a very fresh feel. The characters make this story. Every character becomes a 3 dimensional person in your mind. I'm off to download all the rest of this series.<br />Keep up the good writing. I look forward to reading more by this author.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My husband and I play against each other and keep score of our totals.  Lots of fun and great entertainment

B005VPRG10|4.0|Built this with my daughter as a puzzle. Great build quality. Not very complex and repetitive but still good Lego quality.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|Elizabeth Strout's descriptive style makes one feel like you're right in the midst of the story.  I love the way she leaves certain things unsaid for a time, creating a feeling of mystery, making the reader feel compelled to keep reading to find the answers.  She lets us see deep inside the characters so we understand what makes them tick.  She does this without getting &#34;heavy&#34; or bogged down with details - she's somehow able to incorporate everything together to make the story even more fascinating.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I know McCartney recently married Nancy, but I believe that this is a love letter to Linda McCartney, his true love. Linda was everything to Paul. The musicianship is great on this.  Great jazz guitar, along Diana Krall. A beautiful album.

1439192812|3.0|I'd consider this book to be Richard Dawkins first coffee table book. The artwork is vivid, constant, and immersive. They also do a good job of aiding the text in explaining the various aspects of modern scientific knowledge that are discussed.<br /><br />In terms of content, you'll meet a number of indigenous gods, and the cultures and stories they developed from. Along side the mythology you'll learn about everything from how eyes work to life on other planets, how rainbows work, and a wealth of other fairly complex yet seemingly simple questions an average individual will find fascinating.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Firstly i would like to say I LOVED Legend of the Seeker. I heard about when I was surfing Youtube and it came up, i knew the show was aired a few years back because of some research on the show, but before then I didn't even know it existed. The show is based on The Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.<br /><br />I personally thought Legend of the Seeker was a well developed show filled with Action, Romance and great morals and ideas. Season One slowly introduced us to the characters which provided the viewers with the chemistry. Richard and Kahlan(Craig Horner & Bridget Regan) the two main characters had such a delicate and beautiful chemistry; the forbidden love.<br />This season the show follows three main characters: Richard Cypher the Seeker, Kahlan Amnell a Confessor and Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander a wizard, the first season  focused on defeating a Dark/Evil Ruler called Darken Rahl; the trio go from one obstacle to another to protect each other and to fight for right and justice. The show is set in a mid-evil theme environment.<br /><br />It was saddening to hear that it was cancelled after its Second season, not many of my friends knew about the show until i introduced it to them; i believe that Legend of the Seeker was not advertised well because i never heard of it and not anyone else i knew. this may be because i'm from New Zealand but the show was filmed in New Zealand i'm sure the advertisement  here would have been okay or at least some people i knew heard about it.<br />If you love the show and want it to continue, go to saveourseeker.com to see how you can help, and also purchase season one and two from Amazon US to help with the campaign.<br /><br />I brought the DVD because I loved the show and I hope you do too, share the love and buy the DVD!!!! :) :D
1416594795|4.0|What Dawkins decided to do with this book is to rewrite &#34;On the Origin of Species&#34;. He even begins with the exact same thing Charles Darwin did- Artificial Selection.<br /><br />This book covers the entire wealth of knowledge on natural selection, how it works, and why we know what we know.<br /><br />I can't stress enough that this is literally &#34;On the Origin of Species&#34;, but with 150 years of additional scientific knowledge laid bare.

1449410243|5.0|Yeah, the headline contains a typo but it seems appropriate! This is a fun collection of The Oatmeal's cat-centric panels, most or all seen online. Still, it's fun to look at these in book form and easy to share the laughs with friends either by passing around or by gifting. Judging by the observational humor, the author lives with cats and every cat owner will recognize their feline &#34;friend&#34; in some manner. Now, if you'll excuse me I must go ... my cat is looking at me strangely.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|I love the acting. When I buy a movie, it's got to be good acting. This was a great choice. I recommend it as very good.
0547884591|1.0|The book is titled incorrectly.  I pre-ordered the book a year ago when I saw a few cooking demo videos by Tim Ferriss.  It turns out the book is a poorly written, ill-conceived attempt at something that should have been titled \\"4 Hour Life\\".<br /><br />It would be fine as a compendium of assorted and strange facts and bits of useless information that could be fun at a dinner party.<br /><br />As an instructional guide for cooking, it seems to be written for people who have never entered a kitchen before.  Which is fine, but dumbs down the approach to cooking to become nearly unbearable to read.<br /><br />I usually enjoy Tim Ferriss' work, this is a total disappointment, complicated by the fact that reading it on a kindle made the diagrams impossible to decifer.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|What a find! I never believed it could be Christmas this soon... I love it. I have it both black and white and colorized. The colorization is excellent.
B004LROMSO|4.0|Very interestilng special effects, story line held my interest for the whole series. Can't believe they stopped after one season, would have loved to find out how the sister's plan worked out.
B004M8AL6E|5.0|The best movie ever put out on television, in my opinion. I never get tired of watching it. I still cry every time I see it, even though I could practically recite every line in the movie.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|I was recommended to check out Grimes after my friend saw her in concert in Chicago. I really like the music. Her beautiful voice in contrast to the electronic voice and real-life sounds really amazing. I relax and study to this music. Its also nice to have in the background for a party or while doing yoga.
0786958731|5.0|Not only is this exactly what my son wanted, but when it came in, it was in perfect condition.  In fact, when showing it to a friend, I believe he'll order one for himself.  Great all around
B00AH8VU0Y|4.0|This was one of the best episodes since the 1st and 2nd season. I found myself cheering for the group - AND - I was very excited to see a new group enter the prison. Thank you, writers, to going back to what this is all about...action and adventure...instead of a soap opera (even though I still miss \\"All My Children\\")!<br />Best ep yet from this season - thx!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great all with multiple games within. it takes a while to unlock a lot of games so of you think you got all the games right away think again.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have found this program to be extremely helpful and useful in finding radio stations that I enjoy.

I am extemely happy with the quality of this program.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Film is okay. Has decent acting from all actors except Guy Pierce who gives a very good performance. As good as I expected.

0785814531|2.0|The book was in great shape but, after many orders with Amazon that always arrived in just a few days,a week at most. This item took forever to get here. If I have to wait almost a month to get it it just kinda makes the whole deal a bummer. Not the companies fault just slow mail.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved the characters and plot.  My wife says it's the best she's seen in years.  Rent this one and love it too.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. I love Batman. Great for Batman fans. Enjoy it with a bowl of popcorn.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|If you're a Rod Stewart fan, you definitely will enjoy this CD! Most of the songs are traditional Christmas tunes beautifully sung by Rod in his unmistakable voice. Nice duets with Cee Lo Green and Ella Fitzgerald. I only thought my Christmas CD collection was complete until I saw this. So glad I bought it!

B00A7ZXDLQ|3.0|I think the bad girl thing is fading for me.. There comes a time when no matter how young or old you are, acting like a lady is never out of style. Rihanna's profanity is strong in one particular song (phresh off the runway maybe?) that I can't listen to it fully. I my grandmother always says &#34;excessive profanity is sign of poor vocabulary&#34;. I think the album is &#34;okay&#34; but the large amount of profanity and chain smoking weed is too merch!!!! yes I said MERCH

1451695195|1.0|This book is more about the author's family response to his serious illness with minimal passages regarding his NDE experiences.  In no sense is there any &#34;proof&#34; of heaven.  I've read widely in the NDE literature; this book is a genuine lightweight!
B004LWZW24|5.0|Awesome movie. One of the few movies I was a bit scared. I love scary movies but this is easily my favorite. Incredibly fast shipping!
B0012Q732O|3.0|It's &#34;pretty&#34; to look at and not the worst way to waste a rainy afternoon, but not much of a movie either. As others have noted in their own ways the story is a mishmash of bits from all over the world and various points (maybe) in history. I took it to be some Cro Magnon's woman is kidnapped and taken away to some far off land (with the Pyramids it looks like Egypt). He tracks her down and stages a revolt against her captors (it isn't ever made clear bit I guessed they were Atlanteans), rescues his lady and they go back to their cold, dark land.<br /><br />10,000 BC won't go down in history as a great film.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Fabulous book that kept me in its thrall for days. I would highly recommend this one. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Season one of this interesting series covered Spring 1912 ( the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Downton's presumed heir) to the start of the Second World War in 1914, this second season runs through a few more years 1916(?)-1920 and continues on with the stories of the family and staff.<br />The look and attention to detail is just as great as ever, if you liked Season 1 you'll want Season 2 even if you haven't seen it on PBS.<br /> The &#34;Original UK edition&#34; DVD set plainly states, I don't think Amazon does, &#34;Includes the Downton Abbey Christmas Special!&#34;, the Blu -ray set doesn't indicate whether or not it does and it certainly should have it (packaging on both reads the same except for DVD / Blu -ray markings).<br />I noticed on Season 1 that the commercial break spots were a bit abrupt, you could tell where they were, here it's much smoother. My only complaint this time is that the behind the scenes material doesn't quite match what I saw on PBS- during the original broadcast I saw on TV last January (?) Sophie McSheara, &#34;Daisy&#34;, took the viewer on a behind the scenes tour of the kitchen set. That isn't on either set 1 or 2.<br />There are two accompanying books to the series out now, &#34;The World of Downton Abbey&#34; and &#34;The Chronicles of Downton Abbey&#34; you'll want them both. Interest in the series is so high that tours of the house. Highclere Castle, the house, even  proudly mentions it on their website highclerecastle.co.uk.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Story concept very '1984ish'. Having grown up in southwestern Kansas, where silos are routine, then reading Wool and imagining life in an underground silo just blew me away. I look forward to future installments to Wool, and other Hugh Howard books.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|This is an incredible CD. He sure knows how to write music, sing, play guitar, etc. I read on his website that he likes to write music that reaches people on a gut level, and this definitely does it.  A wonderful buy!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Wowza I didn't now calculators could be this advanced and wonderful. I really love this app because it makes math even easier.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This sick movie depicts 12 year old children engaging in sexual interaction.  How far the interaction goes I cannot say because I stopped watching it as soon as the 12 year old girl french kissed the 12 year old boy (they were both in their underwear) then commented on him becoming sexually aroused at which point he proceeds to start feeling up her breasts.  That is the point at which I stopped watching it so I don't know if it proceeded to depict them taking off their underwear and having intercourse or not, but it would not be surprising given that the director and producers of this movie are clearly very disturbed and perverted individuals who enjoy watching children interact sexually.  I intend to contact the U.S. Attorney's office to ask that they investigate the makers of this film to determine if they violated any laws.  Having two child actors essentially sexually molest each other should be illegal but I am guessing that Hollywood may have an exemption under the guise of creating &#34;art&#34; so that they can legally do it.<br /><br />This move is repulsive and anyone who is not a sexual deviant will not be able to enjoy it.  The preview made it seem like a quirky comedy about dysfunctional families and the presence of very talented and well known actors gives the impression that it will be a very enjoyable movie.  Nothing about the movie was enjoyable.  The characters are not engaging, watching it was uncomfortable even before it devolved into child sexual interaction, and the thematic content is also disturbing on other levels with child-on-child violence and brutality as well.  In short, there is nothing whatsoever about this movie to recommend, and the fact that the making of the movie caused children to molest each other should motivate any normal person to avoid it.  I would NEVER have rented this movie if I had known that it was so perverse and I call on Amazon and every other distribution vehicle to place a warning on this movie so that children are not exposed to its perverse content.  This movie is proof positive that the rating system has become utterly worthless because if this movie does not contain content that no child should be exposed to (meaning at least an R rating), then I don't know what would.<br /><br />Avoid this film and protect your children from being exposed to it at a friend or neighbor's house by letting other parents know how perverse and disturbing it is.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I've had this on multiple devices, mostly phones,  and I would say having it on the Kindle Fire is best.
1451626657|5.0|The novel \\"Catch-22\\" was written by Joseph Heller to show how crazy the Air Force made people during World War Two.  The characters are trapped in the Air Force by the catch known as Catch 22, it was meant to stop crazy people from compromising missions by preventing them from flying.  What the catch really did was prevent anybody from being grounded (sent home).  The catch works where if someone was crazy all they had to do was ask somebody to ground them, the only problem was that when they asked to be grounded the catch said that the person was no longer crazy and could not be grounded.  This along with the number of required missions constantly being raised prevents anybody from leaving the Air Force.  Being forced to stay takes its toll on the soldiers as they slowly lose morale and drift into madness.  The main character, Yossarian, realizes that there is no escape other than death, which he, more than anyone, wants to avoid. This prompts him to plot how to avoid going on missions.<br /> Heller writes this story not in any particular chronological order, and instead connects the chapters at random in order to portray the insanity that the characters experience.  The story is analogous to a jig-saw that is given ten pieces at a time.  The reader must remember was has already been said and connect it to what has just been said.  Heller's writing style of using a plethora of ironies and hyperboles adds to the satire of the book, which isn't so much satirizing WW2, but war in general.  His way of writing the character's dialogue also contributed to the insanity that he was trying to portray.  The characters speak in what feels like circles, where the character says what the last character said in a slightly different way.  After a while of this, the conversation loses its original meaning and makes even the reader question his sanity.  The novel effectively satirizes World War Two and possibly all other wars, and conveys themes of power in bureaucracy, the inevitability of death, and a loss of religion.bility of death, and a loss of religion.

B006BXTOFC|5.0|Really like their style of music this has to be one of their best albums by far.  Planning on sharing

0525958002|5.0|I just finished reading Andy Taylor's autobio when I saw that John's book had just been published, so I was able to read them back to back.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, it's hard not to compare/contrast the two.<br /><br />I enjoyed both books, especially because in the nature of being autobios they were conversational.  I prefer autobios over bios because it can feel like the author is speaking to you, which for any fan is a bit of a rush (even though you know it's nothing personal!).<br /><br />JT had a little bit more of a fragmented writing style as far as sentences, mood, and energy go, but in this case it is not at all a bad thing and overall it was very readable and enjoyable.  The chapters are small and numerous, and it generally is a quick but interesting read.<br /><br />He tells us about his seemingly pleasant childhood, and it was kindof fun to learn (by photos and descriptions) that he was a bit on the nerdy side growing up :) Of course, you fairly quickly get to his career with Duran Duran.  You do get some insight to the interplay between the guys, including all the disagreements and such, but he focuses his story mostly on how he himself was dealing with it all...including, of course, his many encounters with the ubiquitous sex and drugs of rock'n'roll.  He is honest, and it is clear that during his heyday he was definitely embodying the idea of being hot, on many levels, and absolutely knowing it.<br /><br />As you make your way through his story, you see the arc of arrogance combined with easy access to anything and everything that culminated in his going to rehab.  You can tell he's still got his ego now, and rightly so as he is still a great musician (and still hot as far as looks goes, in my opinion anyway) but that it has come to a very balanced place.  That of course was helped by going to rehab...a hard decision for someone very skeptical of the rehab process, but bravo that he seems to have stayed sober.  I loved the couple ofchapters describing his rehab experience.<br /><br />As I saw with reviews of Andy's book as well, there are people that may be disappointed that there wasn't more about the infighting between the guys, etc.  John says it himself, late in the book: \\"I'm sorry if I'm being a tease, but it's not my place to go into all the issues and problems we had.  My friendships with all of my bandmates, future and past, are my highest priority.\\"  I admire this, and I think he balances letting the reader in on the ins and outs of the band's relationships without burning bridges or being bitter.  I personally don't need a bunch of dirt on people to find a band's story interesting...but that's just me.  It also seems, though, that he had a little bit better relations with the other guys than Andy did overall anyway...so maybe not as much to dish on from his standpoint. Not that I'm saying that Andy was exceedingly bitter or burned bridges either, but there seemed to be a few more specific interpersonal issues related in detail in his book vs John's.<br /><br />My only disappointment, being that this book was published very recently, is that there wasn't more about the 2000's.  He describes his dad's sad decline and passing, talks a little bit about his marriage to wife Gela, and does go into some detail about the \\"Astronaut\\" album and reunion tour, but it is not very much.  There is nothing about the creative process behind \\"All You Need Is Now,\\" which I really would've liked to read more about because that is SUCH an awesome album. I was hoping for a bit more there. As others have said, the last part of the book seems slightly rushed.<br /><br />With that said, what is lacking in the last decade of the story is made up for in the plethora of photos throughout the book...not just in the expected glossy section (which is awesome!) but at the beginning of each chapter...and there are 74 chapters! John's one of those people that looks really different from photo to photo, even from the same time period, so it's an interesting collection.<br /><br />Overall, loved learning more about John and more about Duran Duran.  I do, however, think it was even better reading BOTH John's and Andy's autobios because what one lacks the other seems to flesh out a bit for the most part.  The two books give more perspective than either one on its own.

1609611543|1.0|When an author gets the basic facts wrong, it puts the author's ideas into the trash. Davis is not an agronomist nor a biochemist, and apparenbtly didn't feel the need to research either before writing his book.<br /><br />Example: In a CBS promo/interview for his book, Davis says: \\"It's an 18-inch tall plant created by genetic research in the '60s and '70s\\"  That was true, and the research was done by Norman Borlaug at CIMMYT, crossing strains of wheat the old-fashioned way to get shorter more productive wheat. Some extremely short varieties were crossed with the taller ones and the descendents with short stems were kept for further crossing. It's the same process that produced the wheat varieties of the 19th, 18th, 17th and earlier centuries.<br /><br />He continues on to say ... \\"This thing has many new features nobody told you about, such as there's a new protein in this thing called gliadin.\\"  ... OMG! A new protein? It's called GLIADIN! We're all going to die.<br /><br />Except that gliadin shows up in scientific literature well before the 1960s. Would you believe the 1830s?<br />In the \\"Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge\\" edited by C. Knight, 1837 one can discover this - \\"Under ordinary circumstances, about a fourth part of what is termed gluten consists of a principle called gliadin.\\"  So that new protein was discovered 175 years ago.

1423165691|5.0|This collection of truly inspirational work, is a must-have for any artist who wants to tell a story or deliver an emotion with a single pose. This book is like getting your hands on someone's old sketchbook that'd been passed from artist to artist who filled it with production work, conceptual art, and final characters. Construction lines and all, this is a wonderfully crafted book that I never wanted to end. I can't wait until the next Disney Sketchbook comes out!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|The book was my favorite...and I had hoped the movie would be too. But since the movie wasn't like the book- it wasn't. The movie gives the impression (I felt) that Bella was trying to decide whom to choose. In the book you know that Bella choose Edward from page 1 and that did not waiver.<br /><br />For that alone I should hate the movie. But I won't.

B003L20IHE|4.0|I love this movie, let me start my getting that out of the way.  This film adaptation is pretty different from the book that was written, but it's still a light hearted movie.  They kept the basic underlying of the story the same.  Charlie is mourning the loss of this younger brother by adapting how he sees fits, and if that means not breaking a promise, then he won't.  Of course there is a love story tie-in, but the twist is really fun.  I have to admit, I was surprised with that twist.  This is currently one of my favorite movies, and not because Zac Efron is in it. (Though he helps..)  I also think this movie helped to break him from the \\"High School Musical\\" mold.<br /><br />The fun plus was when I purchased the DVD it came with a free instant video version as well.  I must admit I really enjoyed that little perk.

1432794426|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and sincerely appreciated the honest and unbiased perspective that Dr. Moriarty presented in this literary work.  For those of us who have followed the career of MJJ from as far back as our memories will travel, the (then) \\"breaking news\\" that he was being accused of a heinous and unthinkable act never rang true to our minds.  The fact that he was indeed too kind and trusting for his own good facilitated a group of calculating and heartless individuals to shove him through the door of undeserved guilt yet again. My suspicions of blackmail and character assassination were reaffirmed as I read through this book and I have to extend my thanks to Dr. Moriarty for outlining all of the facts and circumstances that led MJJ to endure a horrific period in his life which I know in my heart killed a large part of his essence.  True and pure love for all.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who is on the fence of buying this book to move forward and make the purchase.  If you are as spiritually connected to God and loved MJJ (as I do to the core of my being!), you will allow its contents to carry you on an emotional rollercoaster (sadness, disbelief, shock, awe, anger and rage) and ultimately return to the gate of innocence that was delivered thankfully due to the innate work of Attorney Mesereau and the judge/jury who recognized and discontinued the persecution of an innocent man.  God bless!

030758836X|2.0|I don't often write book reviews as books are much more subjective than a product for reviewing purposes.  However, I felt like an exception needed to be made regarding this book. Gone Girl started out really well.  The plot was interesting and kept my attention. Toward the middle I found myself liking neither character.  Toward the end, the story starts to fall apart. Echoing what others have said, it's like the author ran out of ideas and couldn't come up with a reasonable conclusion.  The ending was one of the worst conclusions to any book I have read, and I read a lot.  I have read that they may make this book into a movie.  It will be interesting to see if Hollywood changes the ending.  Otherwise it will not do well, I predict.  No one wants to pay money and get a crappy ending.  I wish I had saved my money instead of wasting it on what good have been a good read.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This album is just as great as Sigh No More, if not better! Same mumford sound that we all know, but it does not get redundant as a result of great lyrics, melody, and just plain old GREAT MUSIC!

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|With so many musicians and albums out there these days, this one is worth the listen. Rarely do I listen to an album over and over again, but this is one of them. There is no doubt Phillip is talented, he has everything as a performer. But most importantly, he writes great and original songs. The first song off the album 'Man on the Moon' really sums up his talent. The comparison to Dave Matthews is obvious but it is valid. This is one album you won't regret buying.
0547884591|5.0|An excellent book, yes it says it is about cooking, but it is more than that, it is worth it's weight in gold for the first chapter alone, how to learn anything.  I have been putting off learning Catalan because it is so difficult, not after reading Tim.<br /><br />The cooking part is great, I have always cooked, but reading this I have learnt new techniques, sharpened up some old ones and made some delicious meals simply, and that is really what sums up this book.  How to simplify anything, yet retain the essential essence and information, whether it be learning a language, learning a sport or learning to cook.<br /><br />Tim story tells this in his own unique mad style, a great read, I have already order copies for several people for Christmas.<br /><br />Thanks TIm.

0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is the most practical of Tim's books.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone looking for improvements and life hacks of any sort, not just cooking. In his third book, Tim breaks down his meta-learning processes, including several examples of activities that can be mastered within few months/weeks/days.<br /><br />Tim's humor is still sharp as always and reading him is always a pleasure!<br /><br />For those like me, residing outside the US (I'm from Recife, Brazil, the city with sharks on the beach), it's important to notice that all the measurements in the recipes are also converted to the metric system.<br /><br />I purchased the book in the extremely beautiful and practical Kindle version, and currently use it on my iPad and iPod touch. As much as I believe the printed version must be gorgeous, I highly recommend the digital, for the support of links, dictionary and internet access.

1612191290|1.0|While the author is clearly a very smart person who has a ton of knowledge in their own academic field (anthropology), this book is ruined by the author's overarching bias. This bias turns what could have been a wonderful, thoughtful, careful look at the history of debt into an polemic about the dangers of capitalism.<br /><br />It does not bother me that the author has this world view about capitalism, but his bias has turned what should have been a careful collection of facts about the history of debt into a way to score points against capitalism. This effect was so strong that I ended up looking with suspicion at every point the author is trying to make, which is too bad because it is clear that the author does have a ton of expertise in this area from which I wish I could have learned

B003498SDA|5.0|I had never heard of this movie & read some reviews on Amazon & decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. This I thought was a really good movie & I got it for less than $10.00. Not bad. I am glad they did this in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio. I don't think it would have come across as well in anything but this ratio. This movie had some Drama, Mystery & enough action to keep you interested all the way through it.  Tom & Jamie did really nice jobs of acting in this. Good to see Tom in a bad guy role. He really pulled it off. I thought the film had a lot of grain in it but the overall Blu-Ray was pretty good. I can't comment on the Digital Audio as I listen with external speakers hooked up to my old fashioned stereo system. Sounded good to me. There are also quite a few extras on this disc too. Overall I think you will be happy when you see it.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|This might sound typical,but those who consider this a gem beyond words(Some say its the best ever done by the Beatles..even counting hits packages),are absolutely right and I will march right along with those enthused fans.&#34;Back in the U.S.SR&#34; is a hard driven classic that paves the way for &#34;Sexy Sadie&#34; and other well crafted works.&#34;Revolution #9&#34; is a wonderful mix of music and worded situations.&#34;Savoy Truffle&#34;is a knockout,with George singing of his departure and &#34;withdrawal&#34; from sugar! The lyrics are kinda nonsensical- He did that but didn't quit smoking.But the tune is perhaps his best ever that isn't a long one.If any Beatles fans(should I say future fans?)haven't purchased this yet,well,WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

B001NSAJ3G|4.0|First I must say some listeners may need extra patience,as well as a wide scope of liked music to listen to this bands debut album.It includes the classic &#34;Nights in White Satin&#34; along with its ending poem &#34;Last Lament&#34;.If you like classical music done by an orchestra,well,the band sure doesn't miss that.The album is done with the London symphony orchestra.The intro is enjoyable as it moves into the other music here and is pretty well matched everywhere.Problem is,with only 7 total songs,that orchestra takes over a little too much of what the band is capable of in their own right.
B009IKPOUO|3.0|It probably is unfair to compare this to stong albums of her past, a whole lot of time and water has passed under the bridge. Her voice lacks the spark and emotional conviction I enjoy the most, only one track 'How are things in Glocca Morra?' even brought a smile to my face. I enjoy hearing something new from Barbra, but overall this fell a bit flat for me. Perhaps others will see otherwise and again, it is a nice piece to listen to occastionally, but money would be better spent on her two Braodway Albums. Enjoy. JB
B000V674E8|5.0|Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson are 2 of the most clever and talented musicians ever,and it is clearly shown here.The background of &#34;Downstream' takes your mind to a dreamy nature setting.&#34;Fools overture&#34; is a one of a kind song -the title says it all,except theres nothing foolish about the results.One of the few &#34;M.O.R&#34; albums that doesn't get very electric,and still has a way of bringing the musical quality through with the keyboards.vocals and orchestra.I can listen to this when I want to relax several times over.
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|I like Ellie alot and had high hopes for this album, most of them unrealized. Her Beautiful voice has been mostly covered up with slick techno production. It has a thin theme and some nice beats but since it is her voice that is the most attractive to me, it has been mostly covered up and distorted which is a shame. I am sure there will be plenty that see otherwise and love the ambition of this project, but for me I am left without &#34;The Lights&#34; of albums past. Enjoy. JB

B009YP9L7U|3.0|Over all the story was good, but it really could have been so much better. The concept was really good, but it was lacking in details. We were never told what either of them did for a living, for one. I know that Conner owned his own company and he has loads of money, but what kind of company? And I know Megan works and that part of her work entails using a computer, but doing what? And at least for me....the whole back and forth doubts about their relationship, started to get a little bit boring and stale. The angst just seemed to go on and on to the point that by the end...I didn't much care if they got back together anymore.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...this book is still worth reading, but I do think that if the author would have taken a little bit more time to fill in the details, and leave out a little bit of the angst in the middle, it would have been so much better. But that's just me, and I tend to be pickier than most.. I see many other reviews here gave it a much higher rating, so maybe you will like it a lot better than I did, too.

0385343248|4.0|I recently finished this tome and just wanted to share a few thoughts with anyone who's considering tackling this monster for the first time.<br /><br />1.  Yes it's an epic read-between 1,000-1,250 pages depending on which edition you have.  And Clavell creates an amazing world populated with interesting characters, history, and intrigue, BUT...this is not literature, in the traditional sense.  This is more of a popular entertainment barnburner predicated on myth, legend, and many popular stereotypes about Japan during that time in history.<br /><br />2.  Think soap opera drama in 15th Century feudal Japan. This is the strength and weakness of the novel.  The weakness being Clavell will have two characters have a long conversation.  Then one character will go in and eat and you have his thoughts about the meal, and then he'll bathe, and you'll get his thoughts about that, and then he'll prepare for sleep, and you'll get his thoughts about that, but not before said character has another conversation with a servant, or other character.  This passage I described can literally stretch between 20-30 pages.  The strength of this style is the characters have depth, but not enough to get in the way of the story, Clavell knows how to tell a good yarn, and you can literally skp or skim entire sections of the novel and miss nothing of any significance.<br /><br />3.  This book has achieved cult status and rightly so-love it or hate it, Clavell created a vivid world with memorable scenes that will stay with you long after you've finished reading it.  I tried to keep in mind as I read the book that it was written 35 years ago before the internet etc...and these types of books were the hottest show in town.  You have to respect Clavell and the work he poured into creating this epic novel.

B0091THDOM|4.0|UPDATED REVIEW: This company receives kudos for their persistence in trying to make a customer happy by redesigning their product and getting it right. It has taken several months and TWO replacement SNUGG iPhone 5 cases, but they persisted until I eventually received a redesigned, slightly larger case that is usable for the iPhone 5. This new, redesigned case still has the pull tab, and it is still necessary to use the tab in order to get the phone out of the pouch. But the case is not as tight as it was originally and is now a usable product. The great strengths of this pouch are that it is a beautiful case, sturdy in construction and not gaudy or bulky. It fits skin tight and is a good protection for the iPhone 5. I would do business with this company again. Customer comments are listened to and heeded by this company, which is more than a lot of companies can say. Thank you to Matt for seeing this through and getting the problem resolved!<br /><br />MY OLD REVIEW from December 4, 2012: I cannot recommend this case. It took me 20 minutes to get my iPhone out of it, and I was concerned that the effort would cause damage to the phone. When I finally did get it out, I vowed never to put it in that thing again. The tab that is supposed to lift the iPhone out does not work well. TooSnugg should be the name because it is not practical to use. If you want quick access to your phone, don't get this case. It will take some time to get it out. A waste of money. But it does look nice.<br /><br />UPDATE: I do now recommend this case. Thank you to the Snugg team!
B004P7CNUY|5.0|I purchased this for a Christmas present.  The Movie pack showed up quickly and was packaged really well.  This is going to be a great gift.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use for a 7 year old. big screen for young and old eyes! best calc ive used on a device or old school hand held calc
B00009TB5G|5.0|Such a great movie!  I love the extended version- it adds to the movie!  I wish I had more time to watch them all together!
B000NV55RY|3.0|I'll confess. I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Sharon Tate. I have been ever since I saw photos of her in Muscular Development magazine back in the mid 60s. I mourned when her life was cut short by vicious killers who showed not an ounce of compassion for her nor her unborn child. So I was looking forward to seeing her in The Fearless Vampire Killers. After watching it, I'll say this. Sharon Tate must like have liked to stay clean. By my count, she took 3 baths in the movie. There are some funny moments in the movie, as there should be. It's a comedy. I've seen better. I've seen worse, too. It's worth watching, but there are better comedies. There are better vampire movies. There is at least one better Sharon Tate movie. (This is only the second movie with her I've seen.) So my summary of this movie is, it's average.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love!! this show.  Great actors!! Every episode has a new twist and has you sitting on the edge of your seat
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book for book club. It was definitely a great pick. I loved the fact that he was willing to give up so much for her.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Another of RD Jr's fabulous roles after his days in a coma.  Both of these movies were entertaining...Audio in the this one was tough to follow...not sure if it was the technical aspect of the audio or the heavy accents portrayed....  Captioning helped us all to get Bob's quips and follow all the fun lines....<br /><br />Good times for all, watching this one...
0547884591|5.0|I consider myself a moderately experienced home cook (much of the initial advice is unneeded), but still learned a great deal from this book. Tim isn't just a social media marvel - he really does a great job of helping you to expand the way you think.
B0096HID5M|4.0|Perfect depiction of the iconic Rock God by Tommy C...  You'll have to be a fan of musicals to appreciate this one though.<br /><br />I happen to love them!<br /><br />Nicely done, fun, funny and great music (all cover tunes from yesteryear)...<br /><br />Check it out...  It's worth the price of admission...
B009329Y30|5.0|I have no problems with this movie at all. It is a nice story, beautifully acted, and it is filled with all of the elements that a romance is supposed to have. Thank God I am not too cynical to appreciate that.
B001IF252M|5.0|I was skeptical on Ordering this because I had read that it would not work with Thunderbolt laptops. Let me tell you with 100% certainty that it works! It also works on Windows XP, 7, and 8 on boot camp and parallels. It does not however work with a smart board through Boot Camp.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great character-driven tale of survival. I'm engrossed. What would everyday people become when faced with constant danger and the end of the world as we know it?
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This office suite is perfect, it has everything that you need on the go. Obviously it doesn't have everything, but lets be realistic, if you are trying to go crazy with spreadsheets you should probably grab your trusty laptop.
B006BAEQB2|2.0|I have read almost all of Philippa Gregory's books and I was very disappointed in this one.  The character did not truly come out until the middle of the book.  I felt like she just took bits and pieces of other books and through them into this one.  It was not very original and not up to her quality of writing. Hopefully the next one will be better.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I recently upgraded from the late 2010 to the mid 2012 model MacBook air and to my surprise they changed the charger! I hate the need &#34;T&#34; connector. It doesn't come off like the old one used to, it sticks out too far and the cable is constantly crimped because there is no normal up and down anymore. With this adapter I am able to use my old charger. I am also able to avoid all of these annoyances!
0062073486|4.0|I hadn't read any of A. Christie before, but will seek out more now, especially Murder on the Orient Express!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app allows you to view all of your local files and folders, all of the servers on your network, any FTP sites you want, and ANY cloud storage folders. That in itself is amazing, but wait there is more!<br /><br />You can also move files between ANY of the locations that I mentioned above. I never plug my tablet in to move files anymore. I just open dropbox from this app and move the files over. I had the native drop box app but deleted it after I got ES. In my opinion, this is the best feature of an Android Tablet. You cannot do these things on any iOS device.<br /><br />I was recently at a relative's house who wanted pictures that I had put on their Kindle Fire. We searched for an hour trying to find a cable and then I thought, &#34;Why don't I just download ES and login to DropBox on there?&#34; Less than ten minutes later the files were on the Fire! Amazing!
B008518MOW|3.0|This movie is solid entertainment for youngsters from 7/12 years of age.<br /><br />The 3D is good.<br /><br />Am a senior. Found the flick amusing. Bought because of addiction to 3D film making.<br /><br />It was not boring.<br /><br />The disc is well engineered.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a fantastic, fun movie. Respectful to the original 60s series source material and expands on character development, in subtle strokes in mere moments, better than the more heavy-handed treatments in all of the Star Trek movies of the 1980s. Excellent choice of leads (Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Zoe Soldana) who evoke their original counterparts, as more youthful, more fully-fleshed versions. Simon Pegg was hugely entertaining, but has very little physical resemblance to James Doohan's &#34;Scotty.&#34;<br /><br />Best of all, the plot, especially the ending, of the movie helps to reconcile all the movies that came before with a future franchise universe of endless possibilities.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Let me begin by stating that I think Ke$ha is the best singer of our times. Heck, we all think that. That's why she is played on the radio every hour on the hour. Her song \\"Die Young\\" may very well be the best pop song since Willa Ford belted out \\"I Wanna Be Bad\\" many moons ago. It's just a good catchy pop song that I have done the hokey pokey to many times. I so hope that \\"Warrior\\" is nominated for a Grammy for best album. If it isn't I will stand out in my front yard and picket. That's how much I love Ke$ha's music. What a voice that woman has. She would have had to sing in her church choir to get a voice like that. It's no accident, having a soulful big voice like hers. Christmas is right around the corner kids, so buy \\"Warrior\\" by Ke$ha. It's more fun than dying your hair pink!
B0025KW29U|4.0|This musical innovation was first distributed on the Internet, where fans had some influence on its creation and production. The Blu-Ray does include some FANTASTIC extras, including - for the first time - a musical video commentary! High quality writing and a personable story make you feel like you're watching a hugely talented group of friends make a great home movie.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Good flick with some good action in it too, would recommend it to anyone looking for a movie with drama and action.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|First off, Play Store INCORRECTLY will not allow a download and install on a Note 2.  It works great, considering the 5.5&quot; screen.  Perfect for the stylus, just what I was hoping I'd be able to do with my phone/&quot;phablet&quot;.<br /><br />Having been a professional user of digital photo editing software since 1997 and the original Leaf professional digital back, it is astonishing what you can do with a phone and $10.  Get this and get a stylus and you'll be amazed.
0307474259|5.0|As a very healthy 26yo male who trains for triathlons, running twice a week (at least 20k a week), biking at least 50 plus miles a week and swimming a min of 1 mile at a time I was already in good shape, but could never shake the extra lbs (mainly the spare tire). I had already minimized beer, soda and junk food thus dropping a few lbs, but could never take it to the next level. I read this book and within 3 weeks of modifying my diet I can already see a noticeable difference. 8 pack here I come. In addition to this book I would also recommend Wheat Belly by MD William Davis. He dives deeper into complex carbs and how dangerous they are for our health.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I choose this rating because this movie is hilarious from start to finish, and I love Chevy Chase!! Lots of laughs!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love the assemble, marvel did great puting all the stars for the previous 5 movies ( well without Ed Norton).
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss has transformed or validated many things in my life. This latest book is a must have if you want to learn how to \\"learn\\" anything! I havenot been able to put it down and my Spanish is improving exponentially . Thanks Tim!
B008WCP2KG|2.0|I thought the movie will be better, also the dance performances were not that great, but I guess that's the risk of buy a movie that has not been premiered
B004LL1HM4|5.0|i didn't expect them to give it to me in such great condition! JUST like new! plus this was supposed to come with a poster and i thought for sure it would be missing, but no! everything was included, everything was new! I love these guys now! good prices and very good conditions :)
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I remembered this movie from when I was a child and watching it over and over on VHS to the point that you could not even make out the movie. I now get to share it with my kids!!!!!!!!
0345529057|5.0|After falling in love with the hit HBO series Game of Thrones, I just HAD to read the original story. Sure enough, it hasn't disappointed at all, giving the in-depth and page-turning story I longed for. Can't wait to get the 5th book!
0316098329|3.0|this is a good book, but a little slow. i dont like not finishing a book, so i continued to the end. good follow through, and doesn't make your stomach turn with gory details.
0142000663|5.0|John Steinbeck is a mastermind. I had to read this book for a class and was reluctant. it became quickly an enjoyable read I recommended to many friends.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|how can robert downey jr pull it off? cocky and totally obnoxious in his portrayal of ironman. i totally dig this
B001TW69J4|5.0|I ran into this band by accident, and I must say, easily in my top 5 bands of all time. A perfect mix of Meshuggah and Dream Theater without the vocalist (Which in my opinion only improves the experience). A must buy...
B004EPYZQM|5.0|this completes the set of 5, i am an addict to fast modified cars, this show brings it out to the max.
B004OZZ624|4.0|This movie kept my attention. It did start off a little slow, but it improved as the story went on and the ending was just as it should be.
B007NESBK2|5.0|always loved her and she sounded damn good in this performance. no regrets with this purchase to capture her soulful voice
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm always out shopping and when I need help with all my discounts I just pop my kindle fire out of my bag and and this app is perfect.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Really Fun game. Great for wasting a few random blocks of free time here and there. But not a game for prolonged play.
B00684J49U|5.0|I enjoyed this season especially since I was not able to watch the last episode for the season. I wish that it ended differently than it did.
B000001FSP|5.0|I love Marianne Faithful and have always been a fan of hers.  THIS CD BROKEN ENGLISH IS A BREAKTHROUGH FOR HER; ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT; THICK HUSKY CIGARETTE LADEN SEXY SENSUAL VOICE MIXED WITH PROVOCATIVE OFTEN NASTY LYRICS..WHY'D YA DO IT? IS X RATED AND HOT!  A Working Class Hero is an incredible interpretation of John Lennon's amazing original; Marianne makes it her own which is hard to even surpass Lennon!  I HUGELY RECOMMEND THIS CD AND IF YOU EVER WANT TO HEAR THE DARK AND DANGEROUS SIDE OF MARIANNE FAITHFUL THIS IS THE CD TO OWN.  You will find it hard to believe this is the same woman who sang so sweetly As Tears Go By.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Whether a beginner or even if you know a little bit this is a great app.  This is a fun little gadget!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I bought this for my son who is an avid gamer.  He loves the processor. He can set  all his programs to optimal settings and they \\"flow like water\\".  It should also be noted that he has a very good gaming board , video card, and memory to go along with the processor. (I know I bought them)<br />This processor reports to run a little hot but with his \\"radiator\\" cooling system he has no problem.<br /> This is an excellent processor.
B007R12TNQ|4.0|Grandsons aged 4 and 6 loved the video.  Grandma not so much!  Good for a rainy summer day, but would not advise using on road trip.  The chipmunks singing will drive YOU over the edge.  Ha, ha.
0547884591|5.0|This purchase was well worth the money. Great, no nonsense info on cooking and tons of extra info to digest!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie. My family loves it and only one cuss word and nothing crazy. Great action and even light funny moments.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I sit there smiling and giggling while I visualize the scenes. Highly suggest seeing the movie, but great cd either way
B0099114WO|4.0|There were some slow times, but over all, I really enjoyed it.  Touching to see two people able to fall in love all over again after 32 years of marriage. :)
