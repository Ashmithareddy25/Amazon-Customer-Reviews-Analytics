B004LWZW42|4.0|This is a good movie that I know I will watch again and again in the future. I just wish they put more emphasis on Raven since she was way cooler and more exciting than many of the X-Men characters.<br /><br />This movie focuses on the relationship between Professor X and Magneto. If you don't like either one of them, you probably won't enjoy this movie.

0316010669|5.0|This was my first Gladwell book, and it will cause me to read the rest of his works.<br /><br />I found myself thinking about situations mentioned in Blink throughout my day, and it must've added ten books to my reading queue.<br /><br />The book opens with an anecdote of a faked piece of art, and how some experts were able to declare it fake without knowing what specifically gave them the bad impression.<br /><br />The book is full of fast-paced summaries of studies and research - and this is the best part: they're all fully referenced. You can go read them. This added so much value to the book for me, I have hours and hours of reading to do in followup to this wonderful gem.<br /><br />Without this book I don't know when I would've heard the fascinating story of the Millennium WarGames and General Van Riper. Or the study where gamblers' palms began to sweat when faced with a stacked deck - before they knew what was actually going on.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone with an empty spot in their queue.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I've been a follower since they were called \\"Hybrid Theory\\". Yes, that was the bands name prior to \\"Linkin Park\\". Legal issues followed the original name. Anyways I'm so sick of people complaining they have changed. Do me a favor, look at yourself 12 years ago. Are you the same person (probably angry teenager) as you are today? Chances are no, since you have matured. I apply this analogy to Linkin Park's music. They sound fantastic with an upgraded sound our young audience has adapted to love. Please give this album a chance. Just think of those bands in the early 2000's (Limp Bizkit, Korn, Papa Roach). They didn't really evolve their music and look where they stand today.. They're not making a Billboard 200 #1 album. PLEASE PEOPLE THINK FOR YOURSELF AS OF NOW AND NOT 10+ YEARS AGO.

It was a pleasure doing business with my seller Packofbooks,  her correspondence was so comforting it made the entire process of a first time amazon purchase like I have done it for years. This experience was fantastic. I wouldn't want to spoil the story but it was nice to be brought back to the days of innocence and lust. When just biting ones lip can seem pure and disgusting at the same moment. I love the story ... I suggest everyone give it a shot. And when your done pass it on to Grandma.

B00005K3OT|4.0|A drifting single mother comes to inject a healthy does of laicism and joie de vivre in a sleepy French village soaked up in bigotry. The two are at first ostracized but then, slowly, people in the village, and eventually even the strict, hypocritical and controlling mayor, are moved to see the brighter, sweeter side of life that chocolate represents. You don't have to be a chocoholic to get the point!<br /><br />Binoche is simply superb throughout.<br /><br />This well paced film is an invitation to free ourselves from stereotypes, and enjoy what life has to offer. I don't know if Steve Jobs ever saw this movie, but he might have said it is an exhortation to \\"be hungry, be foolish\\". Don't sit back and watch life flow past you, but look at what is new, unusual, apparently useless or even frivolous, and go for it: much good could come out for you!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Pretty good! I expected to have problems but was so surprised at how much it can handle. if you need to type basic documents and spreadsheets then you cant go wrong for 99 cents. I like how it connects to google docs and box.net accounts. works great. you can insert images into docs and do most basic formatting. It can also read PDF docs but I had trouble opening an image-heavy 15 MB PDF past the 5th page. like anything it takes some getting used to, but overall, I'm impressed.

B007ZBWJXI|5.0|It is a rare accomplishment when guys in their 60s can sound as good as they did in their 30s and in some instances better.  Asia's new album is one of those rarities.  All the elements are there - great vocals, sweeping melodies, catchy choruses and extraordinary musicianship.<br /><br />The Wetton/Downes writing team is as prolific as ever and they have composed 10 consistently good songs without one clunker in the bunch.<br /><br />It must be said that John Wetton is the only singer in the rock genre who has not only managed to maintain his voice but improve it.  It has as much strength and range now, as it did in 1982, only it now carries with it more resonance.  His gifts as a vocalist are evidenced not only on the leads, but on the trademark Asia harmonies, which are of course, layers upon layers of his own voice.<br /><br />Standout tracks include \\"Tomorrow The World,\\" \\"Faithful,\\" \\"Face On The Bridge\\" \\"I Know How You Feel\\" and \\"Ghost Of A Chance\\".<br /><br />XXX has the impossible task of following Omega, which in my opinion was flawless and perhaps bit stronger melodically.  The only fault I find with this record is that I don't feel Carl Palmer is loud enough in the mix.  On the early 80s albums his drums were so prominent in the mix, but I find that at times he is much too far back and it hinders the power of some of the songs.  He was more up front on Omega but there was a similar problem on Phoenix.  Nevertheless, this is a very small gripe as the production values are very high.<br /><br />While most 80s bands are busy rehashing the oldies and cranking out regurgitated melodies, Asia are composing and performing new and exciting musical adventures.  Perhaps most impressive is that it is the original 4 - the legends that started it all.  And they continue to be masters of their craft and sonic geniuses.  You can't go wrong with XXX.  It's a must-have not only for Asia fans, but for fans of melodic rock in general.<br /><br />John, Geoff, Steve and Carl -I salute you gentlemen.  You've done it again and I thank you for all the blood sweat and tears that have resulted in a phenomenal listening experience.<br /><br />- Ryan Mayer
B004JN1D2I|5.0|First off this rating wasn't for the \\"books\\" they deserve a 5/5. Amazingly well written and I read through all 4 as fast as I could.  I gave this a 4/5 because I don't think they put enough work into it. Navigating through books was not as good as I had hoped. I would of liked it to be 4 separate books as opposed to its 1 book 4 book long design. I want to go back and read book 3, but I will have to press the page back button 2000 times to get there. Great books, a must read in my eyes but design needs to be perfected the set feels rushed.

1400069181|5.0|I devoured the book on a flight across the Atlantic (of course!  what else would a travel blogger do?), tearing into it not only for GettingStatus, but for my background in Management & Leadership.  It's a quick read, designed to be a book to take action on, not just \\"another business tome\\" made to gather dust on a bookshelf.  In three words my summary would be find your passion.  When you are working because you want to, you're more dedicated to what you're doing - and dedication leads to accomplishment.  That probably seems hokey for the summary of an entire book, but all the other tidbits of business creativity serve to enable you to get out of the business of doing business and into the endeavor of spreading your passion to others who will share it.
B004K583KA|5.0|While the cantatas are not the most performed or most well known works of J.S. Bach, they are extraordinary and Rilling provides the most exquisite versions of these works.<br />The sound on Hanssler (along with all of the releases on their Complete Bach Edition) is second to none!

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Shades- all three books- are delightful, delicious fantasy romps on the dark side.  The prose is kind of purple in places and frequently redundant.  That said it is also sexy as hell and a book of romance and redemption for a \\"bird with a broken wing\\".  In reality most of those are not fixable.

B0080YGZ20|5.0|I will admit I only found out about Kimbra through Goyte.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the album didn't sound like Katy Perry.  I love her voice here.  I agree with other reviewers that the production could take more risks.  The versions from Sing Sing sessions on Youtube sound great.  9 tracks on the album are great.  The others are ok, but I really don't like \\"Warrior\\".  The synthersizer sounds like something from the 80's.  I still give it 5 stars, because there are not that many albums with 9 great tracks.

B007Y6OZE0|3.0|Long time Offspring listener.  I have pretty much ever album they have released.<br /><br />If you like offspring albums like Conspiracy of One.  This one won't quite do it for you.  If your more a fan of Rage and Grace, this one is comparable.  Slower, yet has it's moments.<br /><br />Is it worth listening too?  Yes.<br />Is it worth buying?  While I would say yes, I would refer to the above as to why you might not buy this. There are definitely songs worth getting like Dividing By Zero, Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides The Bomb To Hell, and Secrets From The Underground.  But the album as a whole, probably not for everyone.
B0083F5J7S|3.0|When Maroon 5's \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" was released after 2011's [[ASIN:B003MZ0I84 Hands All Over]] bowed upon the Billboard 200 Albums chart, the listener could discern that Maroon 5's follow-up to the slick, underrated set would be even more poppy. Sure enough, 2012's [[ASIN:B0083F5J7S Overexposed]] is a full-blown pop album in the vein of modern-pop.  Commercially, that is  probably a smart move for Maroon 5. Critically, this move to more commercial pop as opposed to path tread by [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]] or the more The Police influenced [[ASIN:B000P2A256 It Won't Be Soon Before Long]], does open the band to be labeled as `sellouts.' Sellouts they may be, the move is understandable given the underwhelming initial response to Hands All Over and the current climate of pop music. The results are mixed and not nearly as strong as the band's best work.<br /><br />\\"One More Night\\" opens the effort with a reggae-influence groove.  A bit off-putting from a cursory listen, \\"One More Night\\" grows on you with successive iterations. It does not eclipse the bands previous openers (\\"Harder to Breathe,\\" \\"If I Never See Your Face Again,\\" or \\"Misery\\"), but it does prove to be one of the better, more memorable cuts from this affair. For purists, hearing Maroon 5 using hip-hop/pop drum programming may be a shock in itself.  \\"Payphone,\\" featuring Wiz Khalifa continues on the modern pop trek.  An extension of \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" by all means, intact with the obligatory profanity characterizing modern music, \\"Payphone\\" immerses its hand into the `grab bag of pop tricks.' Levine sells the cut well, though his vocals are particularly thin on the verse, only to be beefed up on the ultra-addictive refrain: \\"I'm at a pay phone, trying to go home/ all of my change I spent on you...\\" As for Wiz, the effect of his collaboration feels like Maroon 5 just wanted to be formulaic; his rap is completely unnecessary.<br /><br />\\"Daylight\\" finds Levine sounding a bit unlike himself vocally at first.  In fact, the whole cut seems a bit off-putting.  As the listener keeps listening though, the cut unveils some magic, regardless of the sheen that characterizes the production.  The refrain proves catchy, much like all of them do here, and the anthemic treatment of the cut as whole at the end is a highlight.  \\"Lucky Strike\\" doesn't fare nearly as well, despite opening with distorted guitar.  Produced/co-written by ubiquitous tag-team Ryan Tedder and Noel Zanacanella, the song isn't as impressive as many others are.  Even the driving groove and dubstep influenced sound doesn't quite add up to a hit. Follow up cut \\"The Man Who Never Lied\\" is better, though still a couple of shades short of Maroon 5's strongest songs.  The vocal production allows for Levine's voice to shine and the refrain definitely atones for any laxness with the verses: \\"I was the man who never lied/never lied until today/But I just couldn't break your heart/like you did mine yesterday...\\"<br /><br />\\"Love Somebody\\" finally gives the band a much needed breakthrough.  The driving groove, highly referencing 80's New wave works well surprisingly.  The vocal production definitely amps up Levine's voice here and he delivers yet another crafty hook: \\"I really want to love somebody/I really want to dance the night away/I know we're only half way there/but you can take me all the way...\\" Well it is schmaltzy, but at least it's fun.  \\"Ladykiller\\" has some promise, but never quite ascends to the `next step.' Levine's falsetto is superb as always and as a whole, the sound is pleasant.  The quibble is there is a missing piece; there's a lack of magic.  \\"Fortune Teller\\" is average at best, as it feels empty.  The main rub with \\"Fortune Teller\\" is it lacks `connection'; Stack it against Maroon 5's best and it's blatantly obvious.<br />\\"Sad\\" is a smart change of pace, stripping the electronic production in favor of rhythmic piano as the accompanying instrument.  Vocally, Levine shines more here because not only are the effects of the production stripped, but also is Levine's vocal gimmicks.  That soul that longtime fans have come to hail shines more here. \\"Sad\\" is not perfect, as it could have been further developed, but it is a standout among a sea of commercial pop numbers. \\"Tickets\\" is as gimmicky as \\"Sad\\" is stripped, but it works relatively well given the tone and sound of the album.  \\"Doin' Dirt\\" possesses a nice neo-disco/new-wave sound, though it is rather predictable.  Closing cut \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" opts for more acoustic sound than electronic, which makes it a pleasant surprise. Even so, \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" feels like a good closing cut, not a particularly great one.<br /><br />Overall,  [[ASIN:B0083F5J7S Overexposed]] may live true to its title.  With Levine's heightened profile given The Voice, the band seems to be embracing the `fame' as well, compromising their style in favor of modern pop.  It makes sense, but Overexposed is hopefully just a `phase' and not Maroon 5's `new sound.' Where Songs About Jane sounds classic, Overexposed is much more generic and forgettable.ot only are the effects of the production stripped, but also is Levine's vocal gimmicks.

B007FZ7QZA|2.0|Chris Brown's evolution as an R&B superstar has certainly been bumpy as of late.  Following the disastrous flop [[ASIN:B002R55IE4 Graffiti]], Brown was looking to become a casualty of controversy and a `has been.' 2011's [[ASIN:B004LFO0EW F.A.M.E. (Deluxe Edition)]] managed to garner the embattled artist his first number one album as well as his first Grammy award.  The album was certified gold and managed to yield some popular singles including the hip-hop savvy \\"Look At Me Now\\" featuring Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne.  After renewed success, it is no surprise that Brown would like to continue on the same road as F.A.M.E. The problem is that rather than expand his empire and evolve as an artist, [[ASIN:B007FZ7QZA Fortune]] finds Brown becoming a victim of his own cockiness and ultimately `backsliding.' Maybe Fortune has good intentions, but there are so many clumsy lyrics and ill-conceived songs that it is hard to feel  much empathy for Brown, once again.<br /><br />\\"Turn Up The Music\\" features a typical dance-pop/techno-infused sound.  It's a `safe', though smart enough way to open the effort.  The problem is, there is a lack of passion and connection, not only to the listener but from Brown.  The theme is generic and the swagger Brown easily yielded on \\"Deuces\\" has dissipated. No harm no foul until the shameful \\"Bassline.\\" The quirky production with dub-step synths are the best part of a rather disastrous cut.  Brown's lyrics are over-confident and utterly silly, all topped off by the hook: \\"Girls like my (Bass line)... Girl you know you like my (bass line)...\\" So sensual and tasteless in tone, \\"Bassline\\" is in bad taste.<br /><br />\\"Till I Die\\" isn't particularly original, mostly because it is styled after \\"Look At Me Now.\\" That said, it works, even if only marginally.  The production is solid if nothing else, notable for the percussive drum programming.  Chris Brown begins the rap fest, much like \\"Look At Me Now.\\" Similarly, Big Sean and Wiz out-rap him, which they should.  If asked the reason why this was not a big hit it is obvious - it is not \\"Look At Me Now.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mirage\\" is dreadful.  Chris Brown's vocals are dabbled in effects and the lyrics which he is singing aren't clear in the least.  If the production weren't half-way enjoyable, all would be lost.  Nas easily overshadows Brown, but then again, it wouldn't take much.  After listening, its likely Brown didn't even know what he was performing.  \\"Don't Judge Me\\" is not much of a lift,with Brown delivering one of his weakest ballads to date.  Vocally, at least Brown sound decipherable this go around, but even co-writing from popular pop songwriting/production team The Messengers does little for Brown.  \\"2012\\" makes the logistical mistake of following one ballad after another, though \\"2012\\" is somewhat better and more of a `grower' than its predecessor. Still, the restraint seems almost too much of a contrast to the brash tone Brown presents at the onset of the album.  To it's credit, \\"2012\\" does have some nice moments... a few.<br /><br />\\"Biggest Fan\\" might be lower than Graffiti.  The tempo is quicker, but the salaciousness of the cut makes even the least chivalrous person want to chastise Brown.  Lyrics like \\"I'm gonna make you scream\\" and even the way he sings it are just, clumsy and illy thought out.  Again, given Brown high self-efficacy and esteem, there is a lack of connection for any of Brown's `biggest fans.' \\"Sweet Love\\" is a step partially in the right direction, but Brown had no where to go but up.  The fusion of old- and new-school production is quite effective here. Vocally, Brown's vocals shine more than many other cuts, though Brown tries to ruin the compliments with more reference to the bedroom.  \\"Strip,\\" of all cuts is one of the stronger ones of Fortune. Sure, it's `freaky' too, but at least it is well produced and somewhat fun.  Kevin McCall's verse takes away, but at this point, the small victories help to try to atone for the large improprieties presented by Fortune.<br /><br />\\"Stuck on Stupid\\" manages to arouse some emotion on this cut, but it is by no means `the second coming.' \\"4 Years Old\\" undoes it, making anyone question why a twenty-something like Brown would sing a song as silly referencing a random age like four.  \\"Party Hard/Cadillac Interlude\\" is just what it says it is, thought the \\"Cadillac Interlude\\" portion is more enjoyable than the party-themed number. Why? Chris Brown sings with soul on the \\"Cadillac Interlude.\\" \\"Don't Wake Me Up\\" is much like \\"Turn Up The Music,\\" only worse because of the drawn out, repetitive refrain.  Closer \\"Trumpet Lights,\\" featuring Sabrina Antoinette is plumb bizarre.  A mix of latin and dubstep it just doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Essentially, [[ASIN:B007FZ7QZA Fortune]] makes Brown look badly. It's clumsy, over-confident in tone, and ultimately generic.  Even when Brown goes `personal,' it doesn't resonate. It is a shame because Brown truly has a superb voice and has triumphed with some solid material in the past.  Unfortunately, Fortune is one of Brown's weakest moments.rieties presented by Fortune.<br /><br />\\"Stuck on Stupid\\" manages to arouse some emotion on this cut, but it is by no means `the second coming.' \\"4 Years Old\\" undoes it, making anyone question why a twenty-something like Brown would sing a song as silly referencing a random age like four.  \\"Party Hard/Cadillac Interlude\\" is just what it says it is, thought the \\"Cadillac Interlude\\" portion is more enjoyable than the party-themed number.

A mix of latin and dubstep it just doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Essentially, [[ASIN:B007FZ7QZA Fortune]] makes Brown look badly. It's clumsy, over-confident in tone, and ultimately generic.  Even when Brown goes `personal,' it doesn't resonate. It is a shame because Brown truly has a superb voice and has triumphed with some solid material in the past.  Unfortunately, Fortune is one of Brown's weakest moments.
B000002MU3|4.0|This album is full of simple musical motifs that are especially catchy and hooky even as they are filtered through sometimes heavy distortion effects.  Stipe's vocals are his typically intriguing caterwauling and punctuated enunciational style and continue to evocate a myriad of emotional stresses.  The lyrics are topical and make one ask questions (who does \\"Kenneth\\" refer to?).  When they're good R.E.M. are very good and that is on evidence here.  But, there's the flip side: when they're bad it's cat-on-a-fence warbling in the midnight hours bad.  You want to throw a shoe at the speaker!<br /><br />Great songs here are several including the fun, boppy leadoff track \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\", the slow reverb roll of \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\", the purposeful musicbox plus country woods strains of \\"Strange Currencies\\", the quintessential perfect R.E.M. song \\"Bang & Blame\\", and the creeping, stalker getting closer vibe of \\"You\\" ending the album in what sounds to be a warped love song.  The bad songs really seem to be a case of some element of the song not working such as the off timing of the music on the track \\"Let Me In\\", the singing is catfight annoying on \\"Tongue\\", and the elements of \\"Star 69\\" and \\"Circus Envy\\" don't mesh.<br /><br />Elements of this album (on both songs I liked and disliked) reminded me of songs off of \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" (high praise indeed) and \\"Green\\" era R.E.M.  And, despite the presence of several songs that don't work, I come away feeling that \\"Monster\\" is a balanced effort...and I like it.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|the title states for Kindle fire; it is too large for the device. basically feel it is a money scam, but my fault for not reading reviews beforehand.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is great. I love it. I give it five stars. everyone should try it. so download it now.
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|The legacy of Asia is, and always will be, the first album.  What makes the first album so great is the aggressive guitar playing of Steve Howe. Heavy riffs and sharp soloing high in the mix, shoehorned into accessible pop. With Alpha (the strangely titled second album), Howe's brilliant playing is buried in the mix where it has stayed through all three 'kiss & make up' reunion albums. John Wetton's vision for this band is smarmy pop and it is clear he doesn't like Howe's quirky playing style marring his pap vision. The unfortunately titled Asia XXX (don't let your kids Google it)follows the same format which is no surprise.  The songs are stronger this time around but this is fairly indistinguishable from any of the three Wetton/Downes ICON albums. The subjugation of Howe is akin to having Billy The Kid in your gang but never letting him draw his gun. It's reminiscent of the Eagles criminal misuse of Joe Walsh. I can't believe I'm writing this but I actually miss fake Asia with John Payne.  That band rocked hard and Aura is better than all three reunion albums put together.  Sigh.
B007TKBE40|5.0|I heartily recommend buying this album on vinyl, mine also came with a free mp3 download so you will have it digital as well. Jimmy Sutton and Alex Hall recorded this in an old-school, all analog studio and there is no modern equivalent to this sound. Hearing it on vinyl will give you the fullest reproduction of sound possible, and trust me you do not want to miss a nuance of this music. Every has energy and is able to convey emotion to the listener. I generally don't buy music, especially not vinyl LP's (satellite radio and internet streaming work for me) but these songs deserved to be heard and listened to as they were intended.

B006H8BIIM|4.0|The single in game purchase is not required at all unless you are lazy. I beat the game in less then 10 hrs. I gave 4 stars for how short the campaign was. For those struggling, the mining is where I seemed to make the most; 800 every 20 min.
B000002OX7|1.0|Yeah swell...I finally got my new CD by The Who, \\"Who's Next\\". Too bad when I put the CD into my player it labeled some of the songs in Spanish and others in English. Unfortunately the names of the songs were incorrect, no matter what language it was in. This sucks! My favorite album and I finally replaced it and it turns out to be not what I ordered. Thanks.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I can not even start the game to see if it is any good cause get the missing files message every time I try.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Known for its ripoffs if halo, assassins creed, call of duty, and final fantasy, gameloft has created a game based on an intellectual property that truly shines.  It is a great feeling swinging around an open world New York.  Fights are fun, and misssions do get a bit repetitive.  But I commend gameloft on this effort. A safe buy for those of you on the fences, and a must huh for Spidey fans.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first book in this trilogy was by far the strongest and unfortunately, for such a strong platform, cracks readily appeared in the 2nd installment. Mockingjay, the last book, faired worse. Finishing on a weak note, the book ws definitely not as good as the first...unfortunately can't give this one a strong review - nevertheless, those on the path will have to finish it somehow, so enjoy it for what it is and don't be too disappointed.
1400052181|5.0|I learned about this book from an article in my local paper.  I told my husband that it sounded interesting and he bought it for me.  It did not disappoint.  The story was compelling, the writing was excellent and I was very impressed with the author's ability to take biology and a true story about one woman and write a readable, interesting novel about it.  The information is written with viewpoints from all sides of the story and the author does an incredible job of staying neutral at all times.  When I finished this book, I felt that I had read a story with substance and learned a lot about the human body that I didn't know before.  The ethical issues raised were fascinating to ponder. What a wonderful reading experience.  When I finished it I immediately passed it on to a dear friend and told her to pass it on after she reads it.  I highly recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good game. it took a litter while to get the hang of it but once you get it its pretty fun.
0345803485|1.0|My husband got this book for me because he heard it was popular with women.  I had read positive comments about the series on facebook.  Having now read book one of the trilogy, I really don't understand its popularity.  I was angry most of the time while reading it.  The book was just well-written enough for me to really feel for the character of Ana.  Great sex is not worth what that poor girl had to put up with in terms of Christian Grey's stalking behavior and his ultra-possessiveness, not to mention his delight in \\"punishing\\" her.  Her constant worry that she had \\"said the wrong thing\\" or made him angry was disturbing and sad.  There was nothing healthy or joyful about the relationship between Ana and Christian.  Relationships where one or both parties have to dramatically change for either person to be happy are rarely successful.  I could live with that if the book was not such ugly drivel about a man trying to dominate a woman and her trying very hard to change herself to let him because he is so, you know, cute and rich.  I assume that Ana pulls Christian out of his dark shell eventually, but I won't ever know because there is no way I would read the next book.  I was very happy with the way the first book ended....finally.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This album far exceeded any expectation.  It is amazing and I am hooked! Every song on this album is fantastic, beautifully performed. 100 stars, excellent.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator app. Have tried several, but<br />this one is my favorite. The keys are easy to use &amp; very<br />easy to see.
B004LWZW88|4.0|You can read about the video/audio quality at any multiple of technical websites.  I will just say that the movie is somewhat forgettable, and has much more action sequences than humor scenes from I expected.  Certainly worth watching, but not something that needs to be added to your collection.  3 stars for the movie, 5 stars for the video/audio quality on BluRay.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have used this app for several months on my Kindle Fire. I would have rated it 5-stars, but there are several \\"features\\" that limit its usefulness. The ad banner that appears across the top obscures the location for the weather info. I have several locations programmed in and I am not able to determine which location is being displayed unless I go back to the location button and select a location from the list. There doesn't seem to be any way to minimize the banner. The second irksome feature is that the weather displayed is a snapshot that is taken the first time you turn-on the app and then there doesn't seem to be any way to make it refresh. The only thing you can do is go to the the hourly display to get an idea of what may be happening outside (I work in a windowless tomb) and forget about an acurate current temperature reading. Or go to the maps and wait for current rain-snow-cloud cover info to load.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush has shown just how great a band they truly are with the production of The Garden on this album.<br /><br />We are all familiar with all their classic hits but this song has shown another side of Rush that is equal to anything (and perhaps better) than anything they have done to date.<br /><br />This song could easily be the centerpeice of a Twilight movie soundtrack or some other movie of similar scope.  That might sound strange, and perhaps unimpressive, to many Rush fans who's children (or grand children) are more Twilight than 'Rush Fans' - but this song is truly beautiful and has a message that those that have their whole lives and hopes ahead of them could easily reach.<br /><br />If it were on such a soundtrack I have no doubt it would win a Grammy.  An apology is in order to Rush from whichever rock critic (at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) has until now not recognized their immense talent.  Stellar work!<br /><br />This song is an anthem.  And is the piece that has a message worthy of all the songs that built up to it.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the fast paced running game which enables players to escape the temple being chased by creatures who want their treasure back. This game is easiest to play on a kindle fire because you can see more clearly than on an ipod or iphone and you don't have to use two hands like on the ipad. In the game you try to dodge obstacles like trees and trenches by sliding jumping and switching directionsto avoid those obstacles. Also you try to collect coins by tilting your device so you can go to the store and unlock new characters power ups and special powers. This game is free and I strongly recomend that you give it a try and take the idol. . . if you dare!

B0076UXKDG|5.0|I bought the D800E and had to get a MB-D12 because I do a lot of portriat work.<br />If you're someone like me who insists of nothing but the best accessories (material and build quality) being slapped on arguably one of the best full frame DSLR in the market today, then seriously consider getting the MB-D12 because of the following points:<br />* Grip skeleton is made of the same magnesium alloy as the D800 body<br />  (tough & light weight). Possibly the reason for its price.<br />* Grip is solid and securely locks in place with no rattling noise or ply.<br />* Grip ergonomics and texture really make a world of difference when you<br />  shoot for hours with heavy or long lenses.<br />* Grip comes with 2 tray options:<br />  EN-EL15 rechargeble battery tray (allowing 1 battery on the grip, 1 on the body)<br />  8 AA batteries which are rated to last up to 1000 shots.<br />* If you could afford a 3 grand plus dslr, you should be able to afford this grip
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Honest and insightfull. Well written even though at times it is repetetive, that is when the reader is reminded about something that was said previously.
0393330435|4.0|I have been a fan of early Apple for 30+ years, since the first time I laid my eyes on an Apple II+.  Steve Wozniak has been something of a hero to me, a guy who made big money doing what he wanted to do and then lived the good life.  So I was very keen to hear the story of Woz from the man himself.<br /><br />In general, that story is well-told and interesting.  We are given insight into the thought process of Woz and how he designed many devices including, of course, the Apple I & II computers that revolutionized an industry.  Throughout the book, his affable, upbeat personality shines through and it's hard not to like him.  His stories are interesting and they're all here - HP, Atari, Apple, CL9, Steve Jobs, the US Festivals, and so on.  However...<br /><br />Woz likes to brag.  A lot.  Warranted or unwarranted - he really DID invent the personal computer as we know it - it does get a bit tiresome after awhile.  There are also a few places with repeated stories just a few pages apart or facts that contradict each other (a child born in '87 after divorce but then Woz & his wife are \\"considering\\" divorce in '88).  These detract from the book but not too severely.<br /><br />Overall, a fine, quick read and entertaining for anybody who enjoys the history of the personal computer.

B005PK1G76|4.0|This little organizer is very handy! I bought a lightweight stroller that had no type of drink carrier and so I bought this instead and it's great. It has a zipper where I can stick my keys, ID and money and the bigger space is great for keeping snacks. The cup holders fit snugly and I haven't had a drink spill. The only drawback is that I have to un-attach it every time I close the stroller or it gets bent. On the up side of that drawback is that when I forget the metal that shapes it is easily shaped back into the original shape. We love this little organizer, especially for the price!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The Oregon Trail: American Settlers (Kindle Fire Edition)  is one (1) of the best apps that I have ever downloaded, but I do have one (1) concern for this app. I do have a concern for the time it takes to recharge the energy. I think it is just downright stupid, sorry, but I think it is to take three (3) minutes to recharge one (1) energy. Please can Gameloft do something about this problem? Thank you.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|not bad at all. I like the ice age theme.  I hope that this does not turn into a game where you have to pay because I like this game.

B0034G4P80|5.0|Honestly, I went into this movie for Tom Hiddleston's Loki (long story involving social media and seeing 'The Avengers' first.)  And he did not disappoint! But the rest of the movie was fantastic as well.<br /><br />The cast was amazing.  The sets, the costumes, and the other visual effects were stunning.<br /><br />This is more than just a 'Oh look how fantastic and powerful these super beings are!' movie.  Yes, it does set the scene for 'The Avengers' but this movie is about family and trust and betrayal and...........<br /><br />.........okay honestly, there are a few scene where you get kicked upside the feels.<br /><br />You can watch this for fun, you can watch this to see a good movie. Heck, you can just watch it to drool over the multitude of ridiculously attractive people that were cast in it.<br /><br />Just watch it. You'll enjoy it.
1612680011|1.0|Hello. This book has way too many repeats. He tends to say the same thing over and over again page after page. He goes on about assets vs liabilities for about 15 pages in one part. After 50 pages I realized I was gaining nothing.<br />It seemed like when he was about to tell something big, he stopped and then re-winded to a previous point he made 10 pages back and then never went forward then the next chapter would start on a brand new topic.<br /><br />Worthless waste of time. He made his money selling these kind of books to people. Good thing for libraries.

B007FZ7R7W|4.0|I've only been able to listen to ONE of his albums without skipping a track and that was the first one. This one, I'm happy to say that I didn't skip one. He is a great artist. He's very talented. He's made some mistakes in the past, he isn't the only one however. I won't judge him musically for something that happened almost 4 years ago. I'm not perfect,  NO ONE is.  At the end of the day, we all make mistakes.

0553801473|2.0|The characters are interesting and engaging.  However, the ending of this book seemed like he was running out<br />of time and had  a pressing publishing date.  I would suggest that the author read a few books by Tolkien,<br />JK Rowling and try to deliver a more satisfying ending.  The end of this book was crap.
0525478817|5.0|Everything about this book for me was just amazingly, beautifully, h.e.a.r.t.b.r.e.a.k.i.n.g!! In The Fault in Our Stars you will not encounter any paranormal creatures, take a journey in a dangerous Dystpoian world, none of this will happen in The Fault in Our Stars. What will happen though, is you will meet Hazel & Augustus. The main character (Hazel) and her friend (Augusts) in this book who are in fact dying. Well, at least Hazel is. Augustus has been cancer free for a while now.<br />Hazel Grace is such a beautiful narrator. Ever since Hazel was 13 years old she has been trying to live. Or to stay alive. She has terminal cancer, she can hardly breathe, as her lungs hate her and seem to not want to do what normal lungs should do. She is very limited as to what she can do, and it frustrates Hazel. But, she continues to move on, even though sometimes she just doesn't want to. Death just seems like the easier thing to do for her, and her family.<br />Her mother has quit her job, so that she can be around Hazel at all times, but Hazel feels bad that. She does not want her parents to become so sad, and angry when Hazel dies that they fall apart. Even though Hazel will not be there, she wants them to live.<br />Augusts Waters makes his appearance in Hazels life & from that moment on, Hazel and Augusts are together, and the story just gets even more amazing.<br />Augusts has such a kind soul. The way he takes life, the metaphors he gives about life, love, death. All of that really made you as the reader think! How amazing is it to have this character, who has been through so much, been so close to death and have just this awesome way of thinking. Augusts really blew me away. He really touched my heart. Everything about Augusts was just so... inspirational. I thought that he was a great part of The Fault in Our Stars. And I thought that he was a great part of Hazel. The way that he felt about her. The things that he did for her, and in the end kept from her, because he loved her.<br />Hazel has this wish of one day knowing the ending of this book that she loves so much. A book that she has read many times over and over. One day Augusts fills one of Hazels wishes, and even thought it seems that they will never be able to go, they are both finally well enough to make the trip to Amsterdam, to finally get the answers that Hazel is looking for.<br />Their trip is a rather emotional one. Love is blossoming, a real connection between them. & then discoveries are made, and things change. Augusts has something that he needs to tell Hazel, that he hasn't been able to until now.<br />After this you will be on an emotional rollercoaster of happy moments, and moments where you can hardly breathe. I never thought a book would ever make me feel the way that The Fault in Our Stars did. This book did things to my emotions I have never experienced while reading.<br />John Green really wrote something beautiful, and no words I ever use in this review will amount to the love, and how much I will forever cherish this book, & the way it made me feel.<br />I recommend that you read this book. Yes, this is a book about cancer, but that is not just the point of the book. A mix of; Friendship, Love, Hope, Faith, Understanding, Heart breaking moments, Death, Life. The journey of finding yourself when you feel the only thing left for you is death even, when you know that in the end that is what will happen... but understanding that while you are alive, you can live and love.<br /><br /> \\"That's the thing about pain...it demands to be felt.\\"<br /><br />\\"Grief does not change you, Hazel.

B002ZG997C|4.0|If you weren't spoiled before you see this film, you will definitely watch it twice.  The second will be so you can look for clues.  They are there:  the way he interacts with Jennifer Beals' character, reliance on certain senses, etc.<br /><br />Denzel plays the part of warrior/monk bearing the last surviving King James Bible across the parched corpse of a sun bleached America.  If Eli had been a Buddhist or Shaolin or Islamist nobody would have a problem with it.  However America has been programmed so thoroughly by a secular celebrity-worshipping media and a liberal progressive academia they have a knee jerk reaction of revulsion to even a whiff of Christian spirituality.<br /><br />Just SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF for two hours and enjoy a beautifully shot movie with fantastic actors, excellent characters and quick brutal fight choreography by Jeff Imada.  What, it's okay to accept Matt Murdock and a barrel of radioactive muck but Eli's faith instantly ignites conspiracy theories?<br /><br />Please.<br /><br />Another great component of the film is its haunting soundtrack.  Electronic despair and desolation, like the wind keening over the arid bones of civilization; it fits this future world perfectly.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is as rotten a bastard as Carnegie as he is heroic as Jim Gordon.  Denzel is serene but believably lethal as a black Qui Chang Kane and Mila Kunis is great as the determined but intimidated Solara.<br /><br />Just get over the fact that the McGuffin device is a bible and not a glowing briefcase and you are in for a hell of a ride.

B0002NRQTI|5.0|I just recently really discovered Rush, having always appreciated their music, but not owning any of the bands CD's or albums.  I now have five of their recordings, and have listened to many more. The five I decided to buy were:<br /><br />1. Roll The Bones ( 1991 )<br />2. Counterparts ( 1993 )<br />3. Test For Echo ( 1996 )<br />4. Snakes & Arrows ( 2007 )<br />5. Clockwork Angels ( 2012 )<br /><br />Of these, I find Counterparts to be my favorite. I wont breakdown each song as that has been done here very well in many reviews, but will say I think every track on Counterparts is a keeper. No filler tracks in the bunch! Great, solid songs with excellent musicianship, meaningful lyrics, and well crafted music in general.  I also give 5 stars to Peter Collins top notch production and recording. I really like his approach and mixing on this and Test for Echos. I wish he had been the choice for the last two most recent Rush recordings, ie, Snakes & Arrows and Clockwork Angles, both of which I find too compressed and muddy sounding.  This recording shows off each of Rush's members outstanding approach to their respective instrument and lets you appreciate the way they compliment each other.  I am 59 and have been playing guitar for quite some time and I think this is some of the best guitar work by Alex I have heard.  If you like Rush and have not heard Counterparts, do yourself a favor and buy this superb recording!

B004UID2LC|4.0|for a free app for something like downloading videos/mp3s.. I seriously was expecting a laggy, unreliable app.<br />But I decided to try it out just because it was free and there were a few good reviews. So far, I've downloaded about 5 songs off YouTube as MP3's and they play through the amazon mp3 player on the Kindle Fire. Quality isn't perfect depending on which YT video you pick.. but it really isn't that bad.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for Kindle Fire users. If you're like me and want to download videos as mp3's, try to pick popular videos with good quality.<br /><br />4 stars because I downloaded a video as mp3 and the album artwork displayed in the fire's music player is the thumbnail of the YT video.. idk how to change it.. small inconvenience but it doesn't matter too much because I have it running in the background while I read or whatever.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|ive had trouble downloading it!Like what the heck is wrong with this app?they should put a warning label on this saying it barely works!DONT EVEN TRY IT!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good game,  wish it connected to feint though.  not as easy to find friends. energy recharges quick,  and there are a lot of quests.
0312370849|3.0|I am incredibly picky when it comes to books, and I don't typically like historical fiction, but this book was recommended to me by several people. I enjoyed it more than I expected to. My biggest issue with this book is that it is essentially a Lifetime movie, without as much hatred toward men. I really didn't like that the story was more focused on Julia than Sarah. And I feel like Julia was portrayed as way too emotional and sensitive about the issue. I know people whose grandparents or greatgrandparents are Holocaust survivors and aren't that emotional about it. Otherwise, it was a decent story and well written. I would and have suggested it to other people, but I probably won't be reading it again.

0307887448|3.0|I had high hopes for the book. The author did a fantastic job setting up the story and his writing style is very descriptive (which made me want to read more and more each night).<br /><br />The book took a turn about 2/3 of the way through.  For me, it became a little too juvenile.  The story line got cheesed up in a matter of a couple chapters and I found myself rolling my eyes through the last 3rd of the book (ever try reading and rolling eyes? not a good idea).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I loved the premise even though I'm not a big video game guy.  I also loved the Rush references and other pop culture shout-outs (although sometimes the author seemed to try a bit too hard to throw them in there).<br /><br />After I finished it, I said to myself 'I would have absolutely loved this book when I was 22!'.  Unfortunately I'm 36.
B00723NWJE|1.0|Hated it. Heard great things about it, producer, etc., but VERY dissapointed. Nothing like prevoius work. Boring, repetitive melodies & lyrics. I believe more than the heart was broken ......
B00782O7NE|1.0|I would of given this a higher score, but to have huge black bars on the right and left really pissed me off.  It is bad enough when you get them on top and bottom, but to make a modern day movie in 1:33 ratio is just retarded.  Also, no memory or bookmarks, so you have to start from the beginning every time you watch the movie.
B00004TJWE|2.0|I heard \\"SF Sorrow is Born\\" on satellite radio, found it catchy, and knowing what the album was, decided to order it.<br /><br />I've only listened to it once.  Sounds to me like an homage to The Beatles, mostly stuck on \\"Walrus\\".  Just doesn't do it for me.

B002RKSCA6|4.0|Point: A secret life can never be kept a secret.<br /><br />Path: Stevenson leads the reader through the strange case of a man who lives a double life. This fast past Victorian \\"thriller\\" explores the question, \\"What would a normally moral man look like if he had no inhibitions?\\"<br /><br />Sources: Written after a dream on a similar theme, Stevenson displayed to the 19th century English public the secret life so common among humanity. In an age when<br /><br />Agreement: This is an excellent read with an imaginative theme. The author's point is driven home as the \\"moral\\" Dr. Jekyll realizes that he is becoming more and more like what he has experimented with.<br /><br />Disagreement: At first I was disillusioned with the apparent acceptance of a duality of nature in man (man is both good and evil). But arriving at the end, especially the final writings of Dr. Jekyll, I believe that he is showing the hypocrisy of trying to live \\"morally\\" for the wrong reasons. No man is \\"good\\" in himself. Rather, as one indulges his flesh, any possibility of a \\"morality\\" quickly dissipates.<br /><br />Personal App: Someone once said, \\"Watch your thoughts - they become actions.\\"<br /><br />It would be worth another read and I would recommend it.

B004O86JZ4|2.0|This guy says recording on tape is going backwards, he also claims it's a gimmick.. Any idiot can tell you that analog has a wider frequency range than digital recordings. This is why vinyl records sound better than CDs, given that there are no scratches or surface dust. The analog recording assures that you receive the \\"true sound,\\" and are able to pick up the wide bass and treble you'd miss out on digitally. So yeah, do some research first buddy.<br /><br />As for the album itself, it deserves 3-4 stars (i gave it 2 so i would show up near \\"fastcarnobreaks\\"). I'm a big fan of FF's earlier work, and it seems as if Dave is trying to hard to make radio hits here. Some are good, Arlandria may be my favorite, but very run of the mill style we've heard a lot of from FF the past couple albums or so. Not disappointed, but not blown away. Still worth the money though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the classic!!! I love that you can re play a game (to try and beat it). I played one hand over 25 times!!
B0000A4GPB|5.0|I've always loved this album, really don't at all understand the negative reviews.. This album has quite possibly the best intro and ending EVER. Only downside is some of the songs have long periods in between (IE Cicatriz ESP) with no music, which makes it hard to listen to in the car. But for jamming at home this album is really meant to be played as a whole. I respect a lot of TMV's later work and am happy for their evolution as musicians (I hated ATDI), but this is their greatest effort to date. The vinyl edition sounds so amazing and the silver color is a wonderful keepsake that should retain its value for many years to come.
B007SSDS24|3.0|Movie was good, but not great. It was worth a rent but not a buy in my opinion. Story was ok.
B0086700CM|4.0|Don't get me wrong, the Android with a dash of Amazon Operating System available on the Kindle Fire is amazing, and all of you Kindle/Amazon-lovers don't stop reading now.<br /><br />  I'm all over the open source app store that Amazon offers, and I agree with the principle of open source, but think about it. I've noticed that Apple had faster updates on popular apps, and more of popular apps in general.<br /><br />  When I first got my Kindle Fire, I read somewhere that Apple's app store might be on the way. It's been seven months and all I see is the Amazon app store.<br /><br />  I don't know if Amazon reads these reviews, but if they do, I want them to know that this Amazon user (I am her son) has an Amazon Prime membership and we frequently if not always make our online buys off if Amazon and I often purchase new apps off of the Amazon app store.<br /><br />  I'm kind of going off on a rabbit trail; not really talking about this app but more Amazon applications in general. The app was just as the title says. Anyways, listen, Amazon, you need what the app store has! More apps and less lags!
0345803507|4.0|I started this book on my iphone as a free ibook & thought it was pretty interesting and then all the press it has received made me want to read the whole book. Two friends (one is 29 and the other is 37) read it and didn't like the first book.  Neither knows if they want to read the second one. Their concerns were with the way Anastasia allows herself to be demoralized.  Guess I'll just have to read it & decide for myself!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|enjoying it thus far. fast paced action..  good feedback with instructions.  really having fun with it so far and cannot wait Toronto more.  highly additive though. good free app.
0345803493|4.0|I haven't finished the first book yet so don't know what I will think of the second. I decided to go ahead and buy all three books at once as it was cheaper and I will probably read all 3 just because I would want to finish what I start (unless they are really really horrible which I doubt!)

0307394549|5.0|Let me start off by saying that, in general, I totally love Martha. But, that being said, this cookbook is fantastic in its own right. Tons of delicious recipes and a clever organizational system (but what else would we expect from Martha?) make this cookbook easy to peruse and hard to put down, and you very well may find it impossible to choose just one recipe to make. The book is divided into sections based on the type and consistency of the cookie - Chunky & Nutty or Light & Delicate, for example - and the best part is the index at the front, which has a beautiful little picture of each and every cookie in the book.<br /><br />I've probably made about 30+ recipes from this book and have yet to be disappointed. Some of my favorites are the malted chocolate cookie sandwiches and the milk chocolate cookies - YUM. In typical Martha fashion, there's also a cookie tips & techniques guide at the end of the book, along with some adorable packaging and gift-giving ideas. Whether you're looking for something super simple (coconut macaroons) or something more complicated (chocolate-dipped cigarette russes), \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\" has a perfect, and perfectly delicious, recipe for you!
B00008S2VH|5.0|I got some money for my birthday, and so, I decided to buy this product.  This is the BEST album of 2003, and one of my favorites.  I like all of the songs, especially I'm So Stupid, but in my head now is American Life.  Also, since there is no product description for this particular product, I would like to specify.  The tracks on this album are the same as in the regular version.  The customer picture for this was taken with the shrinkwrap on.  The sticker comes off and the picture is exactly like the official one.  Also, there are approx. 50 stamps with this pic. and a double sided poster.
0345803493|3.0|I'm glad I didn't run out and buy all three books.  I could barely finish this one. It's more of the same, with Ana being one of the worst characters ever created, and Christian, still the freak, but with a troubled past.  Whatever!  The \\"racy\\" scenes just left me rolling my eyes.  It wasn't even laugh out loud funny like the first one.  Ethan and Mia seem more interesting, and would Elena really put up with Ana throwing a drink in her face?  What is it about Christian that drives women to madness?  \\"I love him so...\\"  Sorry, but yuck.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This was my first full fantasy novel. I loved it! Fantasy writing is so tricky. You have to create a whole new world but make it believeable. I believed in The Final Empire. I was sucked into their world. The main character Keilser was rough and charming. Your best friend or you worst nightmare. Lots of people didn't care for Vin but I liked her. I wanted to protect her but also cheer her on as she slaughtered her enemy. Was glad there wasn't any cheesy love scenes. Although I love romance fantasy novels, I think it would have killed this story. Read it!!!!

B006H8BIIM|5.0|These 1-star-tards are annoying. I scored this gem as the FAotD and I solidly give this game 5 stars.<br /><br />I've banked maybe 4 or 5 play hours now and it is quite addicting and adequately challenging/frustrating.<br />The in-game purchase people are complaining about is an option to fully deck out your ship for 99 cents, which I don't recommend doing. It's the kind of thing that would break the game experience and take all the fun out of it.<br />Working for your upgrades forces you to strategize and plan ahead.<br />When I unlocked the \\"mining\\" mode, I was able to last 20-30 minutes on my first time and mine over 50k giving me over 500 credits.<br /><br />Graphics are good with a 2nd built-in mode for tablets. Nice, if you have both a phone and tablet (like me), so you don't have to buy two different versions.<br /><br />Difficulties seem to have a sharp curve over time, but this adds to the enjoyment forcing a different strategy on the replay.<br /><br />All in all, definitely worth a buck and a quarter.
0307730697|5.0|This is probably the best book I have read in the past 20 years.  No, not probably, DEFINITELY THE BEST.  Great story about an average American that looses himself, but through the Grace of God, finds himself and performs great things for his family and his Country.  Extremely well written.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought this book knowing nothing about the background, only that it was flying off the shelves. My question now is \\"Why?\\" It's poorly written and, quite frankly, makes me sick to my stomach. Has our society come to the point that this type of sexual perversion is the norm? What is \\"Mommy Porn\\" anyway? At least, in the future, I'll know better to a)research before I buy and b) never buy a book listed as \\"Mommy Porn\\". You couldn't pay me enough to buy the remainder of the books.
B007ZBWJXS|4.0|The English rock supergroup Asia is back with a new CD release titled 'XXX', hailed by their own record label executives as being their best CD offering since their self-titled debut & most successful release (in sales), 'Asia' in 1982. It featured the melodical & catchy chart topping hits \\"Heat Of The Moment\\" & \\"Only Time Will Tell\\". The current line-up of Asia is Geoff Downes (keyboards), John Wetton (bass & lead vocals), Steve Howe (guitar) & Carl Palmer (drums). The new CD (11 tracks, note that there is track listing mistake on Amazon : tracks \\"Al Gatto Nero\\" & \\"Judas\\" being taken as one, track 7 by mistake) sees Asia delivering quite enjoyable rock music. John Wetton did release his sixth rock solo CD titled 'Raised In Captivity' in 2011, a well received rock music CD by his loyal fans. The CD release 'XXX' should probably be more appealing/more accessable to more fans than 'Raised In Captivity' as it's relatively more main stream rock in sound like Asia has done in the past. Stand-out tracks/gems/solid tracks include \\"Bury Me In Willow\\" (wonderful pop/rock track with a great melody & vocals), \\"Al Gatto Nero\\", \\"Judas\\" (great rock track, sound of the track reminiscent of band The Presidents Of The United States Of America's \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\") & my favourite track of the bunch \\"Ghost Of A Chance\\" (beautiful melody & vocals. Great keyboard playing by Geoff Downes). Great track include \\"No Religion\\" (alternative rock sound), \\"I Know How You Feel\\" (great keyboards playing), \\"Face On The Bridge\\", \\"Reno(Silver And Gold)\\" (Bonus track) & \\"I Know How You Feel\\" (bonus track, a 'midnight remix'). Okay tracks include \\"Tomorrow The World\\" (opening up-tempo orchestral pop track) & \\"Faithful\\".<br /><br />On overall, Asia is back with a great rock album : has potential melodical hits/memorable tracks in this CD release 'XXX', a recommended CD listening.

I was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that I will love ebook reader. What I love about Nook that I can change size of letters on ANY e books. For exemple. I download e book PD format I made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints SO small its impossible to read.  On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store. But not e book you made by yourself. I could not find Russian e book on Kindle store i would love to read . So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.<br />Just love this Nook!

B005F3XV62|3.0|This was one of those, 'let's waste a hour or so watching a dumb movie' days. I knew going into this that is would be a predictable plot, forced dialogue, bad jokes for the quick laugh and the usual romantic twist.<br /><br />It met all of those expectations. However, overall, it was a really silly movie (expected) with the character animation moderately good. But the oddest things was that the animal voices didn't really seem to fit the animals. I know that they were voiced by some pretty big names (Maya Rudolph, Cher, Sylvester Stallone, etc.) but they were forced accents and somewhat out of character with the kind of animal being portrayed.<br /><br />If you can rent this cheap (like we did) and you don't care about an hour and a half of your day, then it's okay entertainment. Otherwise, this is worth skipping.
1401937519|5.0|Dying To Be Me:  My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death , to True Healing by Anita Moorjani is a life-altering read.  I had read and viewed many accounts of near death experiences, marveling at the commonalities, including the NDE's feelings of being encapsulated in unconditional, nonjudgmental love.  However, Anita Moorjani presents the first truly philosophical--and accessible--explanation for the most salient commonalities in the afterlife accounts that I have yet to encounter.  Her attempt to explain such an inexplicable phenomenon are so grounded that, for the first time, I have some identity with why people are so shaken upon their return to the earthly realm--and why they are no longer able to relate with the metaphysical underpinnings here within this realm.<br /><br />Some of the most striking analogies she makes include viewing the unconditional love she experienced in the afterlife as pure white light before it is refracted within a prism.  The refraction of light, she explains, can be seen as the colors of different emotions, none of which are inherently bad, but all of which, together, necessarily comprise the pure white light of unconditional love.  With this said, she further outlines how there is no judgment in the afterlife realm--that her very existence was the only factor needed for her to experience  pure unconditional love.  While her lack of discernment between good and bad is fascinating, it leaves unexplained why some NDE's experience the hell realm in the afterlife (although she might respond that it's the culmination of being removed from, or untrue to, oneself).<br /><br />Regardless, her book is the fullest, most explanatory, account I've yet to encounter on NDE's experiences.  For instance, she indicates that being true to our core essence--by following our natural passions in life and being the magnificent \\"pure love\\" that is within each and every one of us--brings us closer to our divine purpose. She highlights how we don't need to search for our purpose per say; rather, we just need to be true to ourselves and, with that, our purpose will reveal itself.  For instance, if practicing Buddhism, Christianity, or any other religion truly makes us feel happy, then we can be assured we are on the right path; however, if such practice feels obligatory and laborious, we are likely not being fully true to our innermost being.<br /><br />Coincidentally, a book by Pin Van Lommel demonstrates statistically that most NDEs reject conventional religion, and instead identify with being more \\"spiritual.\\" Anita too describes how trying to fit her afterlife experience in the mold of conventional religions seems to undermine the intrinsic magnificence of it all.<br /><br />In sum, I will need to spend some time negotiating my worldview after reading Anita's book as her philosophy is both defiant to conventional wisdom and enlightening.  Anita's literature should be read by any NDE attempting to come to terms with the afterlife experience; furthermore, it should be read by those wanting to broaden their understanding of core metaphysical questions, such as Why do we exist? and What is the meaning of life?

B003O86FMW|5.0|I was very surprised by this book.  As a sequel, I expected it to be less entertaining than the first, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was quite the opposite.  I think I enjoyed \\"Catching Fire\\" more than \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  I was invested in the characters and really flew through the pages to find out what happened to them.  The book itself is easy to read, but the descriptions are vivid.  Although, be prepared that \\"Catching Fire\\" is your typical second installment of a trilogy and will leave you hanging.  Thankfully, I could download \\"Mockingjay\\" on my Kindle immediately, without having book-withdrawal!

It has all the great \\"Matrix\\" elements - a kool sci-fi concept, excellent FX, fine casting - but goes it one better w/a deeply romantic storyline that not only underscores and utilizes all the sound and fury but is haunting, sad and effective on its own terms.<br /><br />Whoops... reviewing the movie again, and not the disc!

0345803493|1.0|First book was interesting, but about page 100 in the second book I was skipping so much, looking for some content.It's the same sex scenes over and over, run into the ground.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|A fun little movie. Plot-wise it's nothing new but has nice set pieces in Morocco, Spain, Germany - like the weird dino park. If yer a Euro-flick fan you'll note some of the best scenes are 'borrowed' - the girls whispering at night from \\"Spirit of the Beehive\\" for example - but that doesn't bother me and I don't think U.S. audiences will even notice. Hanna's just about the only developed character but Saoirse Ronan is very good, with an interesting screen presence that might make her a \\"cult favorite\\"... half weird, half beautiful, reminds me of Summer Glau in that way.

B00006G8K0|5.0|The best of the Hammer horror movies! This Dracula brings out the sexual underpinnings of the Bram Stoker tale far more than the Lugosi version - Christopher Lee's Count is as much sexual predator as supernatural menace, his dark power forcing his helpless, even compliant victims to lie down obediently before him as he cuts a swath through just about every female in the movie. Tho less overtly erotic than later vampire flicks - including later Hammer productions - to me it's extremely effective to treat the erotic theme as \\"subtext\\". You'd have to be blind to miss it, yet it's done w/a certain subtlety and power. A darkly sparkling gem!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found htis book quite interesting and delivered erotica very well.  I don't understnad the other reviews and the malicious people that put up tags that have no application to the book ought to have their Amazon accounts suspended.  An author should feel free to price their work at whatever the market can bear without Kindle activists maligning them.
B004WCTLNY|2.0|A real disappointment if you're expecting something along the lines of \\"Inception\\" or \\"The Matrix\\". The contorted plot line tries to copy the big boys and starts off pretty well, but - like the very worst big-budget fiascos of recent years - it ends up as yet ANOTHER religious-istic, quasi-Xian theme sticking out like a biggole hacked-off sore thumb. I really like Matt Damon and Emily Blunt but they're wasted here. When sci-fi film makers can't gin up a new angle they always resort to good old tired Bible mythology.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found this book to be an interesting twist to storybook romances.  It really redefines the word \\"tortured\\" especially when used to describe the romance in this book.  I also found the character Christian more beguiling than most characters but this is a good thing.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker was even better than the first book. This series is so addicting, I could not put it down. It even carried over into my dream world, where the story replayed over and over. Not a bad way to spend your nights ;) I can't wait to start the next one.<br /><br />The story of Christan and Ana continue in Fifty Shades Darker. Secrets are revealed and a deep bond is formed. In this book we learn more about why Christan is the way he is; his need for control, his insecurities, and his hate of touch.<br /><br />*Destiny*

B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading The Hunger Games book. I checked it out of my school's library and I was done with it with in three days. They didn't have Catching Fire because someone else had the book checked out and I couldn't wait any longer so I bought the book for the amazon kindle on my iPhone. The book was awwwwsome. I finished reading all three books, but I loved them so much that I think I may read them again.

0307595862|3.0|I think the translation was awful.  No criticism of the skill of the translator, there were some paragraphs I had to read several times, and I could see how hard the translator had tried to make it work in English.  Harry Hole is an interesting loveable character, but I think I'd like him better in Norweigian.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Review - Persona<br /><br />After pouring through what can only be described as some of the best films of all time - Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, and many more - I couldn't help but think \\"is this it? Is this the best that almost a hundred years of cinema can offer?\\" Not that there's anything wrong with the films I just listed - they're legitimate classics - but still, I couldn't shake the feeling that the art of film had the potential to be deeper and much more meaningful than the famous Hollywood offers that are constantly quoted and referenced.<br /><br />With that need ever present in my head, I decided to explore the films of Ingmar Bergman. It's with a great deal of embarrassment that I admit that Persona is as of yet my first, and only, exposure to Bergman's work, but I feel it couldn't be a better introduction to the subtle brilliance of his filmmaking and philosophy.<br /><br />Persona starts strangely - with random uncomfortable images flashing at rapid pace across the screen before we're shown a scene involving a dead woman and a half-nude prepubescent boy. It's almost as if Bergman designed this introduction to ward off those who lack the courage or the intelligence to see past the strange and the shocking to the real wisdom that lies beneath it. That, in fact, is what Persona as a whole becomes; a strange and sometimes disturbing voyage into the mind of two women, and how profoundly lost even the most normal among us can become when we delve too deeply into our own psyche.<br /><br />This is when we meet our two players. Elizabet Vogler, an actress rendered mute by a psychosis, and her caregiver, Alma, a nurse who begins the film on the universal and  prototypical path to a mundane life; a uneventful career path, an unassuming fiancé, and the promise of a future with equally unassuming children. After a short introduction, the two women find themselves in a seaside villa - Alma's superior feeling it would be for the benefit of Vogler's health. One at the villa, Alma begins to open up to the consistently mute Vogler and as she does so, we see her deteriorate into profound identity confusion and illusion.<br /><br />I won't go into any more of the story, as there isn't much more to tell. And if I tried, it would merely sound confusing and bizarre to someone who has yet to experience the film. Suffice it to say, we're taken on a journey into Alma's psychology that becomes as frightening and as curiously warped as the images that first greeted us upon starting the film.<br /><br />Bergman achieves this level of depth and sophisticated storytelling through mild yet subtly lewd exposition paired with an extremely well crafted visual presentation that heightens the overall tension and metaphorical nature of the film. Bergman seems to have a meaning behind every aspect of the film's visual landscape. From his shot selection, to framing, to choice of scenery and even clothing of our protagonists, everything is to give us further insight into the story that lies in front of us.<br /><br />It takes true literary skill to achieve the level of execution that Bergman achieves in presenting his story, and more often than not, when a writer attempts to weave such a complex tale, they fall flat with shaky logic or an unfulfilling conclusion. Delightfully, Bergman manages to deftly avoid all of these pitfalls and conclude his narrative in a way that's both satisfying yet as compellingly vague and aloof as the rest of the film.<br /><br />By the time the movie was over, I found that the question I had posed to myself at the beginning of this article had been answered; no, cinema doesn't end with Clasblanca or The Godfather. The Silence of the Lambs isn't the deepest we can delve into the madness of the mind. No, while it may not be as epic or as flashy (or even as technically good) as other, more well known movies, it does achieve something that sparingly few American movies have; it makes the most of its craft, it transcends mere entertainment, and meshes fiction and photography and acting into the singular art that we call film.<br /><br />There's been a lot of movies made recently that are little more than love letters to cinema - Hugo, and The Artist to name a few - but if you really want to see a film that plays true tribute to its artform, Persona is the film for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool tell the story of a group of people living in an underground bunker with over 100 floors. Just talking about what's on the outside, or a desire for any change in their situation is considered treason, and may cause them to be sent for Cleaning. Cleaning is when the condemned person cleans the windows so the people can get a clearer view of the world outside. This series has Twilight Zone written all over it, and I'd be surprised if it doesn't end in a Twllight Zone-type fashion.<br /><br />Wool One, 4.5 stars<br />A man who is still grieving for his wife who was sent out for Cleaning three years ago, decides to go for Cleaning himself. Through flaskbacks, we learn what led to this decision. This left me full of questions, but not in a bad way!<br /><br />Wool Two, 4 stars<br /><br />The elderly Mayor is interviewing for a job position that's opened up, and travels down 100 levels to interview a person who wants nothing to do with the job. We get to see what goes on and how they're able to survive living underground for so long.<br /><br />Wool Three, 5 stars<br />A young woman searches for answers.<br /><br />Wool Four, 5 stars<br /><br />Wool Five, 4.5 stars<br />Don't forget to read the epilogue after the Q&A. I almost missed it. I don't know what I can say about Wool 5 that wouldn't be a spoiler of the previous books, so I won't say anything, except that I loved it!<br /><br />Great worldbuilding, Hugh! Thank you!

B00386EZJU|5.0|Description:<br />This soundtrack contains 25 tracks, 24 of which are scores composed by John Powell. The other track is Sticks & Stones and is performed by Jonsi (an Icelandic singer). These scores have a distinct Scandinavian and Celtic sound to them. They can range anywhere from powerful and loud, to soft and romantic. They also come in a variety of lengths (anywhere in between 0:43 to 6:19).<br /><br />Review:<br />Now for the review of the soundtrack. As a bit of an obsessive soundtrack hound, I must admit that this is one of the finest soundtracks I've heard in my life. The score is breathtaking.  The only thing I did not like about this soundtrack was the song Sticks & Stones. It's not so much that Jonsi did a bad job performing it; it's just that its style was not to my taste. In closing, I would definitely recommend this soundtrack to fans of the movie, fans of Scandinavian music, fans of Celtic music (particularly Scottish but also Irish), and fans of movie soundtracks in general. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is both disturbing and very interesting. The plot is original and the charters are believable in an unusual story. The book is the first of three. After reading the first, you will order the second and third from Amazon.

B007FZ7R7W|3.0|'Mirage,' 'Don't Judge Me' and 'Bassline' are definitely the stand out tracks. All very memorable!<br /><br />Some of the latter ones, particularly those featuring Se7en, are a bit lacking for me.<br /><br />I'm not one to criticize him for the diversity aspect, i.e. dance/pop/house tracks, because I actually like these, but 'Turn Up The Music' does have a piercing air of being VERY generic, as opposed to 'Don't Wake Me Up,' even though the chorus voice distortion takes away from this song.<br /><br />It's definitely better than F.A.M.E. (which isn't saying much, because THAT album was all over the place--pop music, hip-hop, very abstract and few R&B tracks), but something is lacking for me and I've listened to this several times. Perhaps its the element of 'evolution.' The album is definitely a grower, for me. Should my opinion change, I'll edit my feedback.<br /><br />I am a Chris Brown fan, but I haven't been 'Team Breezy' since my teenage years. I guess you could call me a 'stan' back then. Regardless, this is an honest review.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I have been a Fiona Apple fan since 1996, owning and loving every album she has released. \\"Idler\\" is just the evolution of Fiona and I love what I hear. I didn't think it could get better than \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" and I am not writing to compare the two albums, but if you really love her lyrics, amazing melodies and overall tone, voice and story that comes out in each and every song- you WILL enjoy this album.<br />I think what I like about this album the most is the variation of mood and tone from each song, just like her previous albums, and it has become a signature style of hers to have these playful, catchy songs (Anything We Want), to something a little more reminiscent of her past (Jonathan) and then to dark (Regret). I encourage any fan or anyone who wants a taste of a decade and half's musical journey to purchase this album and really listen to the songs for what each is worth. Happy listening and cheers. - FRE

B000001EUP|5.0|this was the third monster metal hit for the band. They had great releases back to 1972 though , but this period was one of the greatest for metal. Metal was melodic and popular. It's barely got a audience these days. But this was great stuff with songs like 'blackout' , 'noone like you' being big fm radio hits the band could do no wrong. The singing is excellent and the playing is excellent but then this is the scorpions after all. The only problem with these remasters is that they wouldn't add a extra track or two which is stingy. But not the scorpions fault. In fact I have around 30 cd singles with rare tracks on them so it's not that the songs are not out there. Still this is why metal was once at the top, instead of the bottom like today. It had melody and great hooks and the scorps were at their peak here.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|As much as I LOVED the first book, this one fell a little flat for me. It became rather predictable and I just felt the \\"new\\" was gone for me. It's still a good read, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who know how to just enjoy a book rather than over analyze it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of the best games I have on my kindle! I'm addicted to it!! its frustrating at times.:(
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I seriously read all 3 books in less than a week's time. I couldn't put them down! I love the third book the best and loved the closure in Christian and Ana's lives. It didn't end too abruptly nor did it drag on and on with boring details. I was seriously at a loss of what to read next when I completed this trilogy because I was so hooked.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|On first listen, fans will be drawn to Emeli Sande' for her emotional voice that sounds strong even in her highest vocal register.  Her vocal timbre is most closely aligned to that of Melanie Fiona, even though critics jumped to compare her to Lauryn Hill.  It's true that Emeli sings with conviction and purpose, but the disconnect from Ms. Hill is most evident in the songwriting and album sound, which moves erratically across the quality spectrum.<br /><br />Perhaps the strongest song on the record is the opener and lead single \\"Heaven\\" - which juxtaposes a powerful club instrumental with gospel-like vocals, creating a truly inspiring and unique song.  The album remains solid for the next few tracks but slowly and surely beings to lose focus.  \\"Clown\\" is repetitive, melodramatic and almost sounds like a Linda Perry throw-away composition.  The remaining tracks are mediocre, with the exception of \\"Next to Me\\" and \\"Maybe\\" - the latter of which sounds like it could be a single (though it has yet to be released as one).  \\"Maybe\\" is Sande's best ballad attempt, and is a standout track of 'Our Version of Events'.<br /><br />Unfortunately, songs late in the album like \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"River\\" and \\"Hope\\" seem exaggerated and sensationalized - or to put it plainly - inauthentic.  No, Sande' is not Lauryn Hill and her songs don't carry the credibility of gems like \\"Ex-Factor\\" or \\"When it Hurts so Bad\\".<br /><br />Still, there is talent here.  I think if she hones her craft to better blend her voice with the underlying music, she could produce impressive art, and I think \\"Heaven\\" is proof that it's possible.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this book well before all the hype, which I think once a book gets all hyped up people have unrealistic expectations of it. I loved the book. I've never been into romance novels and certainly not the BDSM types of books but I was hooked from chapter one. I've seen so many people complain about the writing and story line but I was so hooked on the fascination that I really didn't care if it wasn't Pulitzer prize winning writing. It was ENTERTAINING, which I'm sure was the author's intentions. It's a great read for anyone who knows how to just lighten up and enjoy a fictional story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't know what everyone is complaining about. yes there are a lot of adds but you get a lot of fun games for free. I love it.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|What can I say? I have loved the Muppets since I was a little kid. Jim Henson had this amazing gift of intertwining absurdity and tear-jerking sentimentality. Because of this, I was enthusiastic but a bit nervous when I walked into the theater to see this modern exploration of Henson's style. Sure, others have had varying levels of success at channeling ol' Jim since Brian Henson first undertook the huge task of filling his dad's shoes and directing \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" back in '92. However, since a bit of time had passed since the heyday of the Muppets, I knew that the director, writers, actors and Muppeteers would have to plan carefully in order to craft something that reaches modern audiences without abandoning Jim Henson's vision. \\"If they succeed at selling the Muppets today,\\" I thought, \\"My future kids will get a chance to see new Muppet productions in their own lifetime rather than knowing the Muppets as an old classic.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't have imagined a better outcome.<br /><br />I had high hopes for Amy Adams after I saw her embodiment of a displaced princess in \\"Enchanted,\\" and she certainly didn't disappoint in \\"The Muppets,\\" either. However, I didn't know much about Jason Segel, so I wasn't sure what to expect from his acting or writing. Much to my pleasure, though, he played fantastically alongside the Muppets, never overshadowing them in a way that turned them into mere puppets. (His \\"Man or Muppet\\" duet with Walter/Sheldon from \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" deservedly won an Oscar!) I was also thrilled to see that, true to Henson form, \\"The Muppets\\" included both kid-friendly humor for the little ones and subtle grown-up humor for adults who just took their kids to see the movie. And, as a lifelong Muppets enthusiast, I was pleased with the sprinkling of throwbacks like \\"Mah-na Mah-na\\" and \\"The Rainbow Connection.\\" Knowing that these old favorites are going to be a normal part of modern kids' \\"Jersey Shore\\"-filled lives fills me with profound gratitude for the Jim Henson Company and for everyone else who was motivated to shine the spotlight back upon Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Statler, Waldorf, Beaker, Bunsen, and the rest of the gang.
0786956291|4.0|The D&D red box starter kit is a decent guide for any new player just starting out on D&D.  It gives a basic introduction to some Races, Classes, and game play.  I had been away from D&D for over 20 years, and felt like so much has changed since I played 2nd Ed. and felt I needed to start over from scratch.  The Starter kit contained a somewhat simple walkthrough in creating your character with their \\"choose your own adventure\\" type of Player handbook.  It could have been designed a little bit better for a more consistent Character creation process.  I do think that they tried to oversimplify the process a little too much as you don't get an understanding of the racial benefits and class benefits.  Additionally, the Char sheet used is not the best and actually doesn't have a slot for couple of things listed in the handbook. (Easily fixed by searching online for a different char sheet)<br /><br />However, I have a 14 and a 15 year old who were able to use the handbook and roll their new characters (with some guidance) as well as my wife, who ALL had never played D&D or a tabletop RPG before.  It was a good jumping off point for us to create and play some new characters with the adventures included.  It took a number of starts and stops to grasp the aspects of combat and everything involved in a turn and getting through the encounter.  It left me and my wife wanting to know and understand more of the rules than was explained with the info provided.  The online community, in various forms, is a good source to figuring out questions.<br /><br />We did had enough fun for everyone to be interested in making another go at it and continuing on in the adventure.  And, with anything, the more you play, the better you'll become and the rules will become more second nature.<br /><br />The included DM guide explains more in terms of combat and the rules, that I think all players need to know, and is probably good for the DM to review some of the procedures before you set out onyour adventure rather than muddle through it all during the encounter.<br /><br />I think current/recent experienced players will not find this useful at all, as there are far more options available with one of the other published Player Handbooks from the Essentials line or from the other 4e publications.  But like I mentioned before, it was a good jumping off point to help you determine if D&D is right for you and something you'll continue on and invest more of your time and money on.<br /><br />Overall, a good experience and worth the price I paid--which is more than worth the amount of family time spent and the future fun with them and other friends.

B0000AOV85|5.0|The famed British TV series called Classic Albums has been around for many years. In August of 2003, Classic Albums and Eagle Rock Entertainment released their episode spotlighting Pink Floyd's 1973 classic The Dark Side of the Moon.<br />Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon had a well deserved celebration in 2003 for its 30th anniversary. First came the Hybrid SACD issue remixed by James Guthrie and what a great job he did on it. Then the album was re-released on 180 Gram Audiophile vinyl which sounded superb. Then finally, came this DVD documentary which looks at how the album was made.<br />All four members of the band's classic lineup being co-founder/singer/bass player/songwriter/lyricist Roger Waters, singer/guitarist/songwriter David Gilmour, co-founder/drummer Nick Mason and the late co-founder/keyboard player/songwriter/occasional singer Richard Wright are all featured in new and exclusive interviews in this 2003 documentary. Roger, David and Richard play songs and demonstrate themes from the album. Rick demonstrated on \\"Breathe\\" how he came up with that weird chord sequence to go to E minor after hearing Miles Davis' A Kind of Blue. David's hilarious demonstration of the \\"On the Run\\" synth loop and Roger's funny country twang version of \\"Money\\". Original recording engineer Alan Parsons sifts through the original multi-track tapes isolating some parts of songs to hear some parts isolated either on their own or not ever heard before. Also, there was some rare concert footage from the band's performance at The Brighton Dome in Brighton, Sussex, England in June of 1972 plus some rare seen pictures and additional interviews with Chris Thomas (mixer), David Fricke (from Rolling Stone Magazine and a self-confessed life long Floyd fan), album cover designer Storm Thorgerson, British journalist Robert Sandall and another British journalist Nigel Williamson to flesh out this great documentary.<br />There are also some extra features with more demonstrations from David on guitar parts (this time for \\"Money\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"The Great Gig In the Sky\\" and \\"Us and Them\\"), Rick demonstrating the music for \\"Us and Them\\", Alan Parsons and David Gilmour with some input from Roger Waters and Chris Thomas talking about the recording of \\"Money\\" plus some great unplugged versions of \\"Brain Damage\\" from Roger and \\"Breathe\\" from David plus more interviews with the band, Alan Parsons and Chris Thomas.<br />I got this DVD the day it came out and had to buy another as my first copy cracked after awhile and I still have eight years on.<br />Highly recommended!avid on guitar parts (this time for \\"Money\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"The Great Gig In the Sky\\" and \\"Us and Them\\"), Rick demonstrating the music for \\"Us and Them\\", Alan Parsons and David Gilmour with some input from Roger Waters and Chris Thomas talking about the recording of \\"Money\\" plus some great unplugged versions of \\"Brain Damage\\" from Roger and \\"Breathe\\" from David plus more interviews with the band, Alan Parsons and Chris Thomas.<br />I got this DVD the day it came out and had to buy another as my first copy cracked after awhile and I still have eight years on.<br />Highly recommended!
B0081KTI0E|5.0|This movie is constantly building tension and is relatively unpredictable.  Because of the minimal dialogue the actor has to build the tension in his essence, his being and he does that superbly.  I wondered if I could forget Radcliff's previous roles and if that would taint my viewing enjoyment.  But not at all, he is the character he plays in this movie and I don't think I thought of Potter even once while watching.  Outstanding acting and the writing for this movie was supurb.

B006LSZECO|5.0|My only complaint about purchasing this book was the publisher price for the Kindle edition. It pained me when I clicked the order button. However, now that I've finished the book I can say that I don't regret spending the $13 TOO much. Gillian Flynn's characters are unlikeable, but I think that's why I had a hard time putting this book down. The end left me frustrated, shocked, and angry but satisfied.
006197806X|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations! *Spoiler Alert* I was so disappointed with the ending of the first book and thought Alex's death was unnecessary. Then as I read the sequel, I found myself hoping against the odds that he somehow managed to survive... until I met Julian. I really liked him and even almost prefer him to Alex. I was even annoyed with Lena for treating him so coldly when they were together. Overall, I did not expect to enjoy the book as much as I did, but the twists and turns were surprising and I can't wait to see what happens in the third one!<br /><br />Lauren Oliver uses some amazing similes and I enjoy her writing.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I almost never write reviews, though I do rate books when I like them. This one, however, merits at least a little more effort on my part because I want this author to keep publishing, but also to get more for his efforts than the a few cents per volume sold. These books should cost full price or more. I will now be getting my hands on everything he's published, and spreading the word about this book and its author. Do yourself a favor and buy this. Seriously, how many books on Amazon do you find with over 1,000 reviews that have a rating close to 5, and none lower than 4? Stop reading reviews of this now and just click on Buy It Now!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|in short, Intel stock heatsink is crap especially for the ivy bridge CPUs, forget about expensive cooling systems and water cooling solutions.<br /><br />cheap doesnt always mean bad, this heatsink is awesome, 20 degrees dropped out of the box. even if you dont want to OC your CPU, still 25$ is nothing compared to 250$+ cpu.<br /><br />I OCed i7 3770k to 4.6 with max temp 60 (full load - Fan 100% power) - 30 (Idle - Fan 40% power), and i can still push it to 4.8 with safe temps (max 70 on full load).<br /><br />my advice, get it while it lasts.<br /><br />However, as many said, watch Youtube vid and forget the instructions on how to install as it would be much more easier.<br /><br />Things to note:<br /><br />1. The fan that comes with this cooler should blow the air in not out (pull), while the extra fan -you buy separately- should blow the air out (push). pay a good attention on the direction of the fan when installing -in youtube vid-.<br /><br />2. Size of the cooler is somehow big but most probably it would fit in mid-tower case, however, take measurements into consideration before buying it and see if it fits or not.<br /><br />3. This cooler supports LGA 1155 socket although its not mentioned, so dont worry. it fit perfectly on LGA 1155 Ivy bridge 3370K cpu.<br /><br />4. The fan on the cooler might cover the first RAM slot, for sure you need to remove the mainboard and RAM for easier installation.

030758836X|5.0|I originally heard the author interview for this book on NPR and mentally added it to my summer reading list.  A few weeks went by before I got around to checking out the reviews and many of them convinced me this could be a fun summer read.  Last Saturday  I found myself with some time on my hands and went ahead and downloaded it, next thing I knew it was 2:00 in the morning and I had to force myself to go to bed and finish it the next day!  Gone Girl is a totally fun read, lots of plot twists and deliciously evil traps for several of the characters.  This is the first book I have read by Gillian Flynn and I will definitely be getting the other two.

B004GJXQ20|1.0|This novel tries to provides too much structure and a ridiculous number of characters. On three attempts I could not get past chapter three. Save your cash.
B005LAIH3G|3.0|The first book in this series was originally published in 1912 as six-part magazine serial in \\"All-Story Magazine\\", each part of which ended in a \\"cliff-hanger\\", an exciting element not included in this movie.  While \\"Under the Moon of Mars\\", later re-titled \\"A Princess of Mars\\" the basis of \\"John Carter\\", was largely a narrative of the adventures, trials, tribulations, and survival of the principal characters in very imaginative world with fantastic creatures and cultures, the underlying driver of the stories was a Victorian morals love story where John Carter met and saved the haughty princess, Deja Thoris of Helium, lost the princess, found and saved the princess, fell in love and won the princess, then lost the princess, etc., etc. always under mortal threat.  This element was entirely missed in \\"John Carter\\" and, I felt, significantly diminished this presentation.  Although the book is only about 150 easy reading pages, many of the details of the Barsoomian culture and society that made the books so popular were skipped in the movie.  The movie script was pretty weak. I also felt that the casting of John Carter and Deja Thoris, both missed the mark and neither did the visual presentation of the Barsoomian landscape present the beauty of Helium which looked more like a factory setting.  All in all, \\"John Carter\\" felt mostly like a cousin of the most recent \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" rather than adequately representing the fascinating yarn(s) by E.R. Burroughs.<br /><br />This being said, the movie has high production values and, for those who are not long-time fans of the E.R. Burroughs Barsoom books, would likely be thought to be entertaining and reasonably well-done. The 3D effects are OK, but I did not feel that they added greatly to the movie.  If you enjoy the movie at all, I would strongly recommend that you read the books and let your imagination fly.  I hope some day a movie that really captures the true nature of E.R. Burroughs' Barsoom stories will be made.

0545265355|4.0|Having just recently finished the trilogy, I am can say that, while I am glad I finished it, the last book did leave something to be desire.<br /><br />  I suffer from PTSD, and have horrible nightmares and flashbacks much like Katniss and other characters such as Peeta or Johanna or Haymitch.  Sometimes, you want to drown all the pain in alcohol, I really don't blame Haymitch, but in the long run, its better to take the high road and confront it like Katniss does, ultimately, day by day, trying to combat her depression after seeing so many grisly things.  Mine is not from war, but abuse from my childhood, but I can say, more than anything else in the books, Collins captures what it is like to suffer from PTSD  AKA Post-traumatic stress disorder.  Some people may not enjoy that, but to see this in a book geared towards younger people, is, in a way, very comforting.<br /><br />  These are books about war, and subjugation, and what happens when tyranny reigns supreme, no matter who is in charge.  In the end the books are not very hopeful, and people looking for happy endings should look elsewhere, these are books that shows how war can destroy people individually, and destroy them it does.  Sadly, the last book drops considerably in quality, and many of the passages are confusing, and while \\"Catching Fire\\" wasn't as good as the first book, it was less confusing to read than \\"Mockingjay\\", where when main characters died, sometimes, I didn't even notice they died because of the confusion of the passage.  This could have been deliberate, as in a way, it makes sense, because Katniss herself would have been confused, but it felt more like lazy writing than anything.<br /><br />  The way Katniss changed over the course of the books felt real, the losing sight of herself, and who she was, and in a way, did she ever know who she was because of the suppression of the Capitol? She does towards the end of the book begin to treat some people, in a way that seems out of character, but it makes sense in light of her pain and in the context of PTSD.  There are many times I am confused as to who I am, and treat people ways I don't want to because I just can't sort things out in my mind because of all the pain, and in that same way, Katniss seems to be acting in book 3, she is displaced and confused and disturbed.<br /><br />  On another note, I felt while in some ways this mirrored another book[[ASIN:156931778X Battle Royale]] , ultimately, it's a whole different animal, and is a lot more hopeful, and less depressing than Battle Royale, but if you enjoyed \\"Hunger Games\\", I do highly recommend \\"Battle Royale\\" as well.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amybut it makes sense in light of her pain and in the context of PTSD.

B00866H7SS|4.0|I defiantly have to say this book is very much like 50 shades of grey, but the female character is much less annoying in Bared To You and everything seems to flow a lot better. Bared To You is the kind of book you cannot put down once you start reading, so plan nothing for the rest of your day! I also liked how it is a story of two people who have gone through something painful in their pasts and how Eva is able to understand him because of this, as she has dealt with her past and he hasn't. It gives his need and desire for her a little more meaning.<br />The one thing i found a little unbelievable is the time frame they seemed to fall for each other, two or three weeks? And there were probably a few sex scenes which we could have done without, bit excessive.<br />Overall good fun to read, still alot of questions left unanswered in the first book so I can't wait till the next!

038533348X|2.0|\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is my first Vonnegut read. Considering his Nobel prize for literature, I was disappointed. Cat's Cradle creates a handful of new words; bokonon, boko-maru, wampeter, and etc. The apparent purpose of this tome is to poke fun at religion in general, in a very gentle and inconsequential way.<br />  Generally, I was bored through the bulk of the story, with only the slightest uptick in the way Vonnegut tied up loose ends together at the conclusion.<br />  My next Vonnegut read will be \\"Slaughter House Five\\". If what little I've read about that story prove to be even half accurate, it should prove to be a better reading investment.<br />Paul

0375850864|5.0|Set in the 1970's in New York, Miranda is a young soon to be teenager whose favorite book is \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\". Her best friend is Sal, who lives in her building. She lives with her single mom, who works as a paralegal and is dating a lawyer in the firm. Her mom dreams of being on the 25,000 Pyramid. Told partially in flashbacks, Miranda recounts a series of mysterious letters that seem to tell her that her friend is in danger. When Sal is shoved by a strange boy, he becomes distant, and Miranda seeks out others for friendship. Life in the city has its challenges, with rivalries, the strange man on the street corner who sometimes sleeps under the mailbox, When one note accurately predicts 3 future events, Miranda must come to grips with the strange events and make a decision on her response, not only to the notes, but to some of the challenges in her life. She develops a tentative friendship with the boy who pushed Sal, trying to understand why such a bright kid would do such a thing. With a bittersweet ending, this is a wonderful tale of transition between childhood and adulthood for a young girl.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|If you've been anywhere near a television this week, you have probably been inundated with previews for the newest Broadway-show-turned-flick Rock of Ages. You were probably either convinced or put off by the lead billing of Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx, so let's tackle that first. Cruise portrayed Jaxx as if he were the son of Lestat from Interview with the Vampire and Guns 'n' Roses lead singer, Axl Rose with twice the libido of both.<br /><br />Cruise was unconvincing as Jaxx, and I wondered if real-life wife Katie Holmes had any qualms with the number of tongues that touched her husband's body during this film. Jaxx's costumes are outlandish and silly, particularly a certain codpiece, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from his tattoos. He is a typical rock star in that he is never fully conscious, and he enjoys wrecking things that don't belong to him. Also, he tends to drink...a lot. That being said, Jaxx does not carry the entire film, as the trailers might have you believe. If you are not a fan of Cruise's, there are plenty of other characters to entertain you. If you are a fan of his, then you will probably enjoy laughing at Jaxx's expense, which is what he also seems wont to do.<br /><br />Now that we've got that out of the way, if you were a fan of hair bands, Pat Benetar and arena rock, then this is the musical for you. Rock of Ages is jam-packed with '80s music, and does mash-ups and mini-montages equally well. You'll hear tunes from such bands as Bon Jovi, Guns 'n' Roses, Def Leppard, Foreigner, Journey, Poison, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Twisted Sister and REO Speedwagon, amongst others.<br /><br />Rock of Ages tells the same story we've seen in Coyote Ugly and numerous other films in which the main character is a woman from a small town who flees to a bigger town with dreams of making it big, yadda, yadda, yadda. Along the way, she meets a guy and falls in love. Cue montage of happy moments. Then, some kind of misunderstanding breaks them up and they are both lost without each other, only to reunite at the end of the film. There is nothing in this plot that we haven't seen before. But then, in a film like this, plot is just the glue that holds the music together.<br /><br />The appropriately named Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is a blonde bombshell from Oklahoma who looks like a groupie but acts like a good girl. She, of course, dreams of making it big in Hollywood. She gets mugged on her first night in California, and the sexier-with-longer-hair Drew (Diego Boneta) is conveniently there to witness it. He attempts to help her to no avail, but feels equally bad for and attracted to her, so he offers her a job at \\"The Bourbon Room\\", the nightclub where he works. She eagerly accepts as a waitress, although she dreams of being a singer.<br /><br />Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) runs \\"The Bourbon Room\\" with Lonny (Russell Brand), and their presence reminded me of Empire Records if we had checked in on Joe and Lucas in ten years. One scene in particular between Baldwin and Brand was rather humorous and harkened back to the \\"Hello\\" scene in Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay. When all else fails, homosexual humor tends to deliver.<br /><br />What follows is a typical love story that would occur in a film of this type, or even in an '80s film (maybe that was the point?). The wholly uninteresting subplot involves Catherine Zeta Jones as the tacky antagonist Patricia Whitmore, wife to Mayor Mike Whitmore (Bryan Cranston), who has a predictable agenda against Stacee Jaxx and his \\"devil music\\". She gathers some of the conservative women in town and they band together to picket \\"The Bourbon Room\\" and Jaxx.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti as Paul Gill, Stacee's manager, turned in the best performance of the film. He was the most convincing and enjoyable in a sea of cheesiness, weak acting and mediocrity. And we certainly saw enough close-ups of Malin Ackerman's (Constance Sack) clothed naughty bits to last us a while. Mary J. Blige has a throwaway part as the manager of a strip club, which could have shaved off some of the two hour and three minute runtime.<br /><br />All in, the performances were weak and cheesy, the dubbing did not quite match the lip syncing and the plot was nothing to write home to your mother about. But the love story drew me in, the music was entertaining and enjoyable and I wouldn't think twice about seeing this film again. When we think back on the '80s, we often squirm at memories of big hair, loud clothes and quirky music. If Rock of Ages wasn't cheesy, it wouldn't be doing its job..

B005LAII12|3.0|On an opening weekend that was filled with \\"what you see is what you get...and nothing more\\" films, Seth MacFarlane's Ted was no exception. That is not to say that it was a bad film. It was more like a 106 minute-long commercial for Boston with the feel of a live-action episode of \\"Family Guy\\".<br /><br />I found it surprising and slightly disappointing that MacFarlane chose to voice Ted with a Peter Griffin-esque style, as opposed to just being his natural Brian-like self. Mark Wahlberg is fine as the straight man to Ted's obnoxiousness, and Mila Kunis (Lori) is equally fine as Wahlberg's flame, but their performances neither shined nor faltered. They just...were. Joel McHale was a nice surprise as Kunis' sleazy boss who persists as her unwanted suitor, and Patrick Stewart is always a welcome narrator, no matter the genre.<br /><br />The plot, as you may have heard, consists of a boy named John who wishes for his teddy bear to be real so that he can finally have a friend when no one else will grant him that privilege. Naturally, in the style of Big, the teddy bear comes to life because John just happened to make his wish on a night wherein a shooting star occurs. Apparently, shooting stars possess magical powers.<br /><br />The bear shocks everyone (including father Ralph Garman in a bit role) when he walks and talks, prompting the \\"honey, go get my gun\\" line that naturally follows. Child-like teddy bear, or \\"Ted\\", then asks if it is a \\"hugging gun\\". He then proceeds to mature with John throughout the opening credits. Fast-forward to twenty years later and the twosome pass much of their time smoking pot and watching Flash Gordon while commenting on pop culture and modern society. These carefree buds love each other with that irresponsible, frat-boy-brotherhood mentality that has become so prominent in today's culture.<br /><br />The predictable conflict arises when John realizes that he cannot lead a normal adult life until he can hold Lori, the love of his life, in a higher regard than his \\"bromance\\". He knows that he must separate himself from Ted, but that's difficult to do when they've experienced most of their lives together. Plus, the fun-loving, hooker-acquiring, trash-talking Ted is just too much fun to tell no. After all, he keeps getting bigger and better promotions for acting increasingly worse on the job.<br /><br />The film worked just fine on that conflict alone. It did not need the last-minute subplot in which villain Giovanni Ribisi attempts to kidnap Ted for his spoiled brat son (Aedin Mincks). This seemed like a tacked-on idea and, like many other recent movies, could have shaved off some of its unnecessarily lengthy run-time. However, this sets up the ending of the movie rather well, so it's not entirely for naught.<br /><br />There are enough pop culture references in this film to sink a ship and plenty of pot-shots at celebrities we all love to hate, including Justin Bieber, Taylor Lautner and the widely despised Superman Returns film and its star, Brandon Routh. Ted definitely caters to fans of \\"Family Guy\\" with its brand of humor, although there were one too many anti-Semitic jokes for my taste. Particularly tired and offensive to some, I'm sure, was an Asian cliche that spiraled down rather rapidly into ridiculousness.<br /><br />One scene near the end was particularly hysterical, though, which led me to believe that they saved their best joke for last. Familiar cameos are sprinkled throughout the movie, so you never know who will turn up and when. Ted is a good one-time watch, but if you're looking to save a few bucks, pick it up as a rental.

B006H8BIIM|5.0|This app was the faotd.  Its free.  Why is everyone hatin on it?  Its a solid game, that allows...not requires, in app purchases.  I got stuck, and spent 10 min. &quot;grinding&quot;.  Thats all it took to proceed.  I conclude that most of these reviews were written by whiners who feel entitled to something.  I advise checking the review of this app on the Google Play store, if you want an accurate one.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|Amazon, you can do better. I like my album art. I want to see it while listening, not a dull gray UI. The app title and controls take away too much screen real estate. Even the store sucks and uses too much real estate for the app. Take a lesson from Google's music player.<br /><br />Phone: Samsung Galaxy Note
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.  One of the best I've played. Maybe they will do a light version so propped don't have to risk five bucks.

B007RX32TY|4.0|Post Punk Italo House is a term i've heard banded about by critics in reference to Chromatics on more than one occasion and i'm unusally happy to go along with the cogniscenti this time round, as i think it's a rather apt descripter. Arpeggiated synths, clean/brittle guitars, tonnes of reverb and the delightful vocals of Ruth Radelet are all blended together for 90 minutes on their fourth album Kill For Love. This is all nice and well i here you say, \\"but does it sound good?\\" my answer would be find a stream and give it a listen, but to give you my humble opinion \\"yes it certainly does\\".<br /><br />With such a colossal playing time you might assume that the record might succumb to the perils of being overly ambitious or aimlessly sporadic, however it's actually incredibly consistent alternating between glacial soundscapes and dazzlingly impressive yet sublimely restrained pop songs. I had thought about mentioning individual tracks but there's just too many to sithe through on Kill for Love for it not to feel arbitrary, i will confirm that the cover of Neil Young's \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\" is a brilliantly understated rendition though (not unlike Saint Ettienne's now classic cover of Youngs \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" ).<br /><br />Even though this album feels far too expansive for this to come across as anybodies solo project, Johnny Jewel is reportedly the groups creative Nucleus so it's only right that i mention his name here. He's said to have drawn on a wide variety of different musicial influences for the conception of Kill For love ranging from the seductive Pop of Madonna to the challenging electronic compositions of Stockhausen, i'm not entirely sure if this immediately comes over through the way the album actual sounds (sonically speaking) but the ostenible dichotomy of brooding yet melodic pop songs and lengthly ambient experiments is consumately reconciled here.
B00466HM28|5.0|really nice i like everything about this lil keyboard.nice feel to the pads and they light up so its a great feature.it shipped fast and works like a charm.the keys are mini the pads feel great its got assignable knobs and an arpeggiator which is cool to have on somethin so small.u can change your octaves up or down so u pretty much have a full range of keys and its all really sturdy and works really well.i owuld recomend it to anyone! i gove it 5 stars!!! its cheap and small and im on the go all the time so its nice to have somethin to carry with the laptop and u pretty much have all u need to bang out a hot track.its all i used for like 4-5 months and ill never get rid of it!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I picked the book because Amazon kept recommending it to me. I started reading it and after about 10 pages I kept feeling like telling the author that OK, I have heard it that he is good looking. Does the author have to keep telling us that? The scenes are also unrealistic and sound like something out of someone who still believes in Santa and unicorns. I dont think am going to spend any money on the subsequent books. I also wonder why the book is a best seller!<br /><br />I picked the book because Amazon kept recommending it to me.

0345803493|3.0|Ok. I just finished Fifty Shades darker and the rabbit sex aside it's actually quite a good follow up. I don't love it...I just like it. Not a fan of romance novels.<br /><br />What I like is the non-fairytale aspect of this story-he's wealthy, handsome etc but, unlike some other romance books, he isn't perfect and it's good to see him portrayed in this light. They're both 'new' to love and the dynamics of the relationship between them made for interesting reading for me.<br /><br /> Now on to book three.
B007SGM084|5.0|yes this book is a little intense but it is so addicting and good.It is a must read! The plot will make you fall in love with the characters.

0061251305|5.0|I read a lot of business books and a lot of books on leadership - most of them have at least a few good ideas in them, but this is the first leadership book I've read that's driven me to look at organizations and the art of leadership in a completely different way.  Another reviewer mentioned that it was liking having someone giving you glasses and suddenly being able to see in a completely different way - I felt that way as well.  Even better, this isn't a book that just shares some opinions or ideas, with over 10 years of research across 24,000 people it's pretty clear the authors did a lot of hard research to figure out Tribal Leadership.<br /><br />What is Tribal Leadership - in a nutshell it's a completely new framework for how to look at leadership and creating high performing organizations.  It's not about strategy and it's all about the culture and the evolution of the organization.  It turns out there are 5 distinct stages of organizational culture that all build on one another.<br /><br />Stage 1 - Life Sucks...equivalent of a street gang mentality, not really a factor in most professional settings<br />Stage 2 - My Life Sucks...Dilbert, the employees at Dunder Mifflin (The Office) or the employees at Initech Software (Office Space) are great, if a little over done examples of Stage 2 cultures.<br />Stage 3 - I'm Great! (and you're not) - the lone warrior who is very competent and effective by themselves, but doesn't share well with others.  Office politics, bad management practices and Stage 2 Cultures all come from Stage 3 managers.<br /><br />Stage 4 - We're Great - the language changes from I, Me to We and Us.  It's all about the success of the team vs. individual accomplishments.  The only way to really get to Stage 4 is to really 'own' stage 3.  Stage 4 organizations will significantly out perform Stage 3 and lower organizations in terms of financial results and ability to get things done.<br /><br />Stage 5 - Life is Great...this stage occurs sporadically when Stage 4 organizations rise to a significant challenge and do something borderline miraculous (Think the 1980 Miracle on Ice US Hockey victory).<br /><br />In order to get an organization to Stage 4, the majority of people within an organization need to be at Stage 4...they need to have reached an epiphany in Stage 3 that doing everything yourself isn't productive in the long run - you've got to have a team that you can count on if you really want to make things happen.<br /><br />A couple of key ideas that are critical for Stage 4 include:<br />Triadic relationships - basically the idea that a group of 3 people can form a very effective and stable relationship when they all 3 share the burden of making the relationship successful.<br />Core Values - In order to reach a stage 4 culture, a group must have clearly stated alignment on core values...the types of values that make getting up in the morning important!<br />Noble Cause - Finally, Stage 4 cultures revolve around ideas that are bigger than any 1 person...you must have a Noble Cause that everyone understands and gets behind.<br /><br />It's tough to summarize these really big ideas - but hopefully that gives you a taste.  The book has a lot of interesting stories and examples and the authors do a nice job of stepping you through the ideas in a logical flow that makes a lot of sense.  If you're looking for a set of ideas that will really shake up how you think and how you create a team that will do more...a lot more than you need to check out Tribal Leadership!

B0049U4INC|5.0|I happen to be a fan of Guy Kawasaki-s writing and advice but wasn't sure when I bought this book if I was getting more of the same or something new. There is a little repeat from previous books but most of us probably need it because we aren't doing what he advised in previous books. However, over the course of the book I find that the Author developed his idea of enchantment and the more I read the more he made sense. He is a guy who has been there done that (I know its over used but ... )and he has the T-shirt. His advice is right on and things that while not hard, and many will say 'I already knew that' ... when you try and do these things consistently it is very difficult to execute consistently. A pleasant, thought provoking book, well worth the read if you want to improve your performance.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't picked up a book since my Dad died in 1997, I used to be an avid reader. I wasn't too happy when I started this series, I was aggravated from all the people saying it was so wonderful, that every woman should have it on her bedside stand, and then the men in their lives should read it. I almost didn't get the second book but I'm so happy I did, It only took me three hours to decide to buy the second and third book I loved them, the story turned around. I love strong women, not wimpy, this series made me happy, then sad when it ended. I didn't like Bared to you, the reviews said it was better, but it wasn't, 50 shades was the best. I can't wait until E.L James writes another book. I actually would love to read a story about the housekeeper & Taylor, how their story started and what they did in that house when Christian was gone.<br />Sandy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is quite a challenge but that is what makes this game absolutely awesome you should definitely get this game
B007IE4DSG|3.0|This wasn't exactly what I expected but in looking back I suppose it was my misunderstanding.  I sort of expected it to be more \\"finished\\" rather than the very basic and early (almost too early in some instances)version of tunes I know and love.  Perhaps it was me having a bad day when I played it and I should listen again.  I was just expecting to hear takes of songs in ways I had not ever heard before but of the same quality as appeared on the Beatles Anthology CDs.  This is not like that.  But, as I say, my mistake.  I can't blame the product really.
B007MG360G|5.0|Super fun strategy game. Must have so cool. Awe some! I love it. It is amazingly awesome. Hard and frustrating aat some points but otherwise...AWESOME!!!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|When I finally saw this film I was not expecting much. The reviews were lackluster and the hatred from the reviewing media was incredibly intense. Apparently the big budget outraged people?  Somehow?  I know for a fact the marketing campaign was one of the worst ever launched by a major studio.  They didn't even feature Carter's sidekick \\"dog\\"-creature, who was one of the best parts of the film. But oh well, that's water under the bridge.<br /><br />Be that as it may, my expectations were completely BLOWN AWAY.  I loved this film and I think if you like old-fashioned adventure/fantasy/SF then you will too. It's worth seeing for the visual design alone!  And the incredible world, the engaging characters, the cool action scenes, even the acting, all top notch.<br /><br />Could it have been edited better, or cost less somehow?  Probably.  Is Taylor Kitsch the best actor of his generation?  Of course not.  But despite a few shortcomings (I think one or two of the action scenes could have been trimmed substantially) this has gone towards the top of my list of favorite action films.  When it was over I felt sad that I'd probably never see a sequel, but at least I got to see this one.  I think you should too.
B000EXZI14|5.0|I previously owned this CD, but it got scratched. I reordered it.  It is a wonderful album!  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the BeeGees.

1451673442|3.0|I was disappointed with this book. I picked it up along with Wishes Fulfilled by Wayne Dyer. I've read plenty of LOA material but the Magic just didn't tie it all together for me.<br />I liked the fact that it focuses on gratitude; there's a lot to work with there, but I couldn't get through the halfway point. Something about the way the material was presented didn't work for me.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I agree that the instructions for the update should have been a little more detailed, but please!!!! check your app version and compare to the version on the market.... or else you are to stupid to own a tablet of any kind. people make mistakes, and this technology is new. GIEVE THEM A BREAK!!!!! the fix is simple...... uninstall the old version and install the new version. Don't be stupid....
B001R3YRG2|4.0|This is not a movie with a very happy ending, but I find the plot rather fascinating.  I think we can all identify with the main character, whose life seems to be falling apart.  But unlike most of us who can deal with the low spots in our lives, Bill Foster decides he's just not going to take it any more and goes postal with anyone who gets in his way.<br /><br />Excellent price for an intriguing movie.
0425263908|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved Fifty Shades of Grey and found that there were many similarities in this book but not too many. Great book that will make you want to get hot in the sack.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|So far my son throws his legos in and keeps it zipped up mostly- Its pretty durable and easy for kids to figure out.  I like it so far and haven't had any issues.<br /><br />Edited to say we've had it at least a year now.  Its durable.  We now have it filled to the top with legos and it takes a little effort to keep the top on because the sides do bulge, however we have packed it full and can force the top on.  We use it primarily to open up the mat and hunt for pieces, keep all on the mat then clean up is a cinch to just zip it right up.  But due to its smaller size it fits perfect under the futon in the playroom.  If we went with a taller bin, we'd have to find a different storage spot.  If there were a wider bin that opened up, well that would be great for our growing # of legos :)
B000B8QEYC|1.0|I like Enya now and then and was hoping this would be a good album.  A Day Without Rain is her best and every track is exceptional, but this is boring with no good melodies at all.  Title track (Amarantine) starts our OK but the middle chorus is awful and ruins the song.  Where did that come from?  Shame.  Nothing else even stands out here - you can skip this one - don't waste your money.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Got this app for my kindle fire and I love it. Big, clear and easy to use! Highly recommend it....
B000050XEI|5.0|Wow this album is a real treasure - every track is exceptional - by far her best overall CD (in addition to Paint The Sky With Stars and Very Best of CDs).  When I am in the mood for Enya, this is where I go.  Highly recommended!
B007Z9QWVK|2.0|This is not a film about Wallis and Edward but what little does cover the famous couple was lifted from historian Anne Sebba's book and the biopic film Edward and Mrs. Simpson. She lifted so much from those sources it was a little embarrassing to watch.  Then to top it all off she uses the formula from the film \\"The Hours\\", where the viewer was forced to jump back and forth between the life of Virginia Wolf and other women without rhyme or reason.  Madonna has some fascination with filming domestic violence since she insinuates that Wallis was somehow bashed around by her husband and so couldn't have children when all accounts of her first two marriages were that she was treated very very well...but social climbers will do as they do. This film is beautifully filmed but unfortunately doesn't have anything poignant to say about anything in particular, the story line is trite, she adds no new insight nor even a new vision or perspective on Wallis and Edward.  She rudely portrays the Queens mother and father in the worst light when they were known to be very low key family whom had the thrown pushed on them.  As with all things Madonna this film is self-indulgent with very little focus spent on the integrity of the storyline, its all beauty over substance with a dash of faux feminism.<br /><br />If Madonna had focused on the story of Wallis and Edward I'm sure it would have been very good if she could have kept her ego out of it, unfortunately I'm not sure why she made this film.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|I don't remeber myself reading so fundamental, capturing and so useful book ever. Every chapter contains great results. I tried to put down the main and the most interesting thoughts, but I must admit that the whole book is an outstarnding compilation of great quotes. No matter what you do, you must read it. This book broke some my paradigms.<br />Enjoy it!
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah Jones' new album, Little Broken Hearts demonstrates that sometimes matching the right producer with an established talent can challenge that talent in a way that makes for significant artistic improvement. The combination of Danger Mouse and Norah Jones was, for me, a no brainer. I have thought for years now that it would be a perfect combination. I had said it many times to friends - especially after hearing his efforts as part of Gnarls Barkley. The result emphasized Jones' many varied vocal and musical talents. It is now my favorite Norah Jones album and would love to see more of this team in the future (or maybe some Jones and Gnarls Barkley joint recordings...hint, hint.) Jones' might also want to seek out other producers to bring out other sides of her enormous talent.
B007V508CC|3.0|Fans were prepared. The lead single \\"Payphone\\" clearly displayed what Maroon 5 would be after on their new record and the band couldn't have sent out a better warning.<br />While the songs on their previous effort showcased a perfect balance between their rock roots and dance rhythms, on \\"Overexposed\\" they just aren't as captivating. They sound plain and, at times, unexciting. The compulsive usage of electronic beats and synthesizers results in what can be considered, as frontman Adam Levine himself admitted, \\"the band's poppiest album\\". And although these songs come off as failed attempts at riding the same wave as \\"Moves Like Jagger\\", they do posess that \\"get on the dance floor\\" feeling (\\"Tickets\\", \\"Lucky Strike\\") that sometimes is intensly and admirably contagious...but then again, the songs don't have anything else.<br />The word to use may as well be \\"comic\\", but \\"Overexposed\\" does save itself from being labeled as a conventional pop record, by a fine line of two songs. The nostalgic lyrics on the ballads \\"Sad\\" and \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" remind us of how they can still reflect on love with their usual dose of simplicity and sensibility, taking us back to melancholic veterans like \\"Secret\\" and \\"Better that we Break\\".<br />Though now it's hard to imagine what to expect from a band that, in a time range of ten years, has drastically changed their music style from old school rock to modern, upbeat power-pop, it can only be hoped that this so-called \\"detour\\" can stagger the band into making a commendable comeback. Even if means releasing just one more album, as it has been stated that it won't be long before a disbanding happens.
B0062LU85S|5.0|Oftentimes, soundtracks are hit-or-miss, but I have really enjoyed all the Twilight Saga soundtracks. I listen to this one ALL the time! Every single song is great - even the ones that appeared on previous soundtracks. I just really, really dig this soundtrack. Another, really great soundtrack IMO?

B006C3Q6GG|5.0|After having watched the film a few years ago, it was easy to visualize Lucky Jack (Russell Crowe) in my mind as he fights the French, the Spanish and the Royal Navy bureaucrats.  I read the novel on my Kindle so that could carry it along to read during my time in waiting rooms and so forth.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was a must read if you've read books one and two.  Very surprising how much 50 changes.  Just goes to show what the love of a good women will accomplish.
B000002WMH|5.0|There's really not much need to review this Elvis collection, because it is his entire 1950s output. That makes it the single most influential compilation in the history of rock. Everybody who followed took as at least part of their inspiration these recordings, including Buddy Holly, The Beatles, Cliff Richard... the list is endless.<br /><br />It's amazing to listen to how rock evolved from its country roots to the most popular music in the world in such a short time and such a limited number of recordings. Elvis is so familiar to us today that it's almost impossible to grasp how different and original his sound was from all that came before it. It's also tempting to ascribe his success to others- such as writers Lieber and Stoller- but although others were of course involved (Elvis never wrote anything, although at Col. Parker's insistence he was given writing credits on some songs), the interpretation and presentation were all Elvis's own. The song 'Hound Dog', for example, was written as a blues number for Big Mama Thornton by Lieber and Stoller, and they were flabbergasted to hear Elvis's rock treatment of it, so different from what they'd envisaged.<br /><br />Sit back and go on the musical equivalent of a time machine as you hear Elvis take old styles and turn them into modern music. Or just listen because it's so darned good. Either way, this is music everyone who is serious about rock should have in their collection.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I honestly wasn't expecting District 9 to be very good, I expected it to be decent at best. But, I was wrong. It exceeded my expectations in every area. I thought the story was very interesting, and the way it was put together was unique and great. The documentary style in which the story is told isn't something I'm used to, so at first I wasn't sure what to think of it, but as the movie went on I was finding I really liked it for this particular movie. The action was pretty great, and I liked the characters. Overall this is a pretty great movie that you should definitely check out. But be wary, if you don't like a lot of swear words, then you should probably avoid this movie.
B007H9B8FS|3.0|Garbage's first two albums were/still are phenomenal.  As the band's sound started to veer into pop-ier/club-ier/more eclectic styles ('Beautiful Garbage,' 'Bleed Like Me'), many of the reviewers on Amazon found the newer sounds & albums compelling, although I started to lose interest.<br /><br />After reading about Garbage's efforts to get back together and return to the basics, I couldn't have been more anxious to hear 'Not Your Kind Of People.'  And I ordered it, based on the early 5 star reviews.  While a few songs are good/interesting, overall I didn't find the album as strong as the first two albums.  The highlight of the album is \\"Control,\\" which other reviewers have also noted.  Several other songs start off with potential, but seem to stall.  If you're a fan of the older albums and curious about this one, listen to a few of the tunes before making a decision.  The album does have moments, but just not as many compared to the brilliance of Garbage or Version 2.0.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I really liked the first Transformers movie, but the second one was only so-so. So, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this third one. I suppose I thought it would be better than the second, but worse than the first. Man, I am so glad I was wrong. This is an awesome movie, definitely on-par with the first one. I honestly don't know which one I like more, my mind always wrestles with that. The action is beyond great, and while some people say the story wasn't great, I would disagree. I thought the story was quite good. If you liked the first Transformers movie, then you'll like this one. A huge step-up from the second and rivaling the first.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game.  I'm really enjoying the pace and the uniqueness.  I'm still earl in the game but so far so good.
B003U00EBC|4.0|We have seen Brendan Fraser movies at only maintained the title and not the meat of the true story, such as \\"The Mummy\\", who does not look a thing like Peter Cushing (1959). Now we are presented with \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\"  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.<br /><br />Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.<br /><br />I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.<br /><br />Now it was time to watch the 3-D version. , I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat.  Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ok so if you scroll down and read other reviews like &quot;I hate it!&quot; or other things like that you can choose which ones you are going to go with (know ones forcing you ) but if your going by majority rules than get this, I mean it's a free app with beautiful graphics, sure there's a glitch or two but people say it ducks  (not putting the real word) and people are putting other things up to, if you get it and like it keep it, but if you get it and don't like it just delete it. You can write a review but don't whine about it.
B007URCTOG|3.0|The pace of more films is slowing down, and that gives us and the characters time to develop a construct between the story and our own lives.  This film does that, and it makes the plot easier to believe and get involved.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a haunting book for anyone who has been through the teen years with sons.<br />I saw the first ending of the trial coming--I deducted that conclusion as I read--but then the author took me down a dark corridor and BAM! I got slammed at the very end--never,never did I see it coming!<br /><br />I will search for more of this author's books--I simply could not put it down and I thought about the characters all day long--a sign of a very good book to me!
B007MJSQSK|3.0|Graphics OK, but did seemed a bit 'stiff'.  I could not get into the film.  Not bad, just not as engaging as you'd like for a movie.

0062197258|3.0|I am really surprised by all the positive reviews INTO THE DARKEST CORNER has generated. This story of domestic abuse has been told many times before though this time the author does provide the twist of the heroine developing obsessive compulsive disorder after being terrorized by a sadistic boyfriend. INTO THE DARKNESS is the fourth book published in 2012 I have read featuring a protagonist with OCD though connecting the disorder with post traumatic stress makes it more unique.<br /><br />The book was a bit difficult for me to connect with at first. It begins with a trial transcript then takes the reader to a murder scene in 2001 and from there the book is told by victim Cathy alternately from the years 2003 and 2007. Reading a novel using this technique was quite confusing at first but author Haynes is still able to maintain a coherent storyline. INTO THE DARKEST CORNER is a longer book than the typical psychological suspense novel and is so frustratingly slow at several points it seems even longer. The book is unnecessarily (in my opinion) raunchy in many spots and the promiscuous, hard drinking life Cathy led before she met her abuser made it hard for me to relate to her. It sometimes strained credulity that the villain Lee was holding down a responsible job and still had time to not only physically abuse Cathy in a variety of ways but also devise and carry out elaborate mind games to further torture her. Cathy's later love interest is conveniently perfect and a psychologist to boot.  Whatever he saw in the obviously very troubled needy Cathy (after her attack) to romantically interest him made no sense to me.<br /><br />INTO THE DARKEST CORNER is not a terrible book but is nothing out of the ordinary either. It is a decent read for those fascinated with domestic abuse or plotlines where a lover turns out to be evil.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read them all in a month. I loved it, very refreshing, kind of erotic and a learning experience. Well done! Desperate to read Grey's side of the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is the best and its free even better! it is kid friendly and a addicting game. BUY NOW!
0143119680|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not stop thinking about the characters for a long time after reading it.  Much different than I thought based on the title.  A must read for anyone who liked the Hunger Games or Twilight series.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Really like the bold numbers....easy to see and use. Like how it keeps the info as you work. Like how you can work with larger numbers than a lot of calc apps. Like that there aren't a lot of useless buttons that are not needed for most everyday type of calculations.
0061801313|3.0|With the intention of a quick read, I started this book.  I will admit that it is a page turner.  I am very curious as to what happens next.  With that being said it is full of a lot of topics that I find inapropriate for kids of any age. Lots of sexual content, drugs, under age drinking,profanity,same sex experimentation, shoplifting.  You name it,this book has it. Please be aware before blindly giving this book to your children.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book, In fact the characters are so likable I find myself missing their story. I wish there was a sequel!!
0345803485|5.0|okay for all you people who dislike this book you must have no taste.. who cares about the background of the characters about someone who thought they could never love actually falling in love.. my sister mother and grandmother in law akk read this book and loved it. i just dont get it.. i guess it takes someone with real taste to actually like this book thank god i have some cause i would have missed out. and since i finished these books im trying to find something tht even comes close to it. e l james you keep on writing and i will keep on buying your books amazing
B00782O7IY|2.0|I wasn't even aware of this film as I don't pay attention to the Oscars, but someone rented it and I watched wondering, 'where's the good part? when do they speak?' It seemed pretty obvious they would speak but I have to wonder why they waited until the end. And then it hit me, though the answer isn't as obvious as it first seems.<br /><br />We're to believe the end is the icing on the cake. The main character has managed to somehow find a life in the new world. It's so exciting to hear him speak, right? But step back and look at the bigger picture. How might the film be different if he started speaking half-way through? Would the film be more interesting or less? Would sound, early on, have ruined the 'effect' this movie leans on throughout the entire length? I say it would but, that being the case, an homage to silent film using silence as a plot is a cheap effect. There are countless ways to express the same ideas in this movie using sound but I don't think the writer could pull it off. What's sadder is the idea that the silent era NEEDS homage. I could almost hear the director telling me, 'Gee, aren't silent movies quaint?' As though one can't pic a silent film up and enjoy it regardless of the lack of sound. Ever watch an old silent film? I've seen plenty and they can be moving. Perhaps what troubled me most is 'The Artist' hit the cheesy, cheeky and off-beat character of silent film but completely missed the real depth they were capable of. Good, moving stories were told in the silent era but not so here. The plot is so predictable it doesn't act as a true story so much as a conduit to play silent era 'dress up' and the 'acting' is so exaggerated it never allows an actor a chance to show any kind of range or sincere human emotion. We are given crude caricatures of silent film 'types' but never any of the substance that makes silent films and their stars still interesting today.<br /><br />Others have mentioned the lighting was a poor afterthought or mistake and I agree. Everything looks so crisp, clear, clean and processed that the film feels as related to old black and white movies as much as a rocket ship is related to a mule. We are continually reminded 'this was made using the most high tech equipment possible. People making those silly old films couldn't even dream of the techniques we applied.', which makes it impossible to slip into the past. In some cases, props are completely wrong for the era they portray. At one point their clothing made me think the film had transitioned to the 1940's but they were still in the early 30's. It's as though historical relevance, accuracy and research weren't considered at all. Not that they must slavishly adhere to history but why not? Is the director convinced the actors could have worn Nike's and still conveyed the same message? Even the lead actress is too 'fit'. Silent movie actresses were never THAT slim. I often wonder why no attempt to make the film look, feel or seem 'old' was taken. If we're going for 'homage' why not try to add a little authenticity? Couldn't they make the music 'scratchy'? Ever watch the opening to 'Moulin Rouge'? It was in black and white and does what this project couldn't. An homage should pay tribute and good homages do, but this is more of a mockery.<br /><br />On the plus, the story is cute, the actors look good, and John Goodman and the dog were exceptional with what they had to work with. That this won an Oscar just confirms my belief that Oscars are completely irrelevant.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, more than I thought I would.  It kept my interest enough for me to look forward to reading it.  Given my short attention span, that says a lot.  I am looking forward to reading more of his stories.
0307956350|3.0|A spy novel set in Luxembourg, the book is written in a \\"Then & Know\\" style by changing fonts. We have a married couple, who really don't know each other's pasts, relocated from the US to Luxembourg. There they meet other relocated Americans & befriend each other.<br />The entire story is spy genre filled with lies and deceit among most all characters. During the first third of the book I came close to putting it down. I thought it jumped around awkwardly and found it a bit wearisome. There was always a bit of something to catch my attention, so I kept going.<br /><br />Once close to, then reaching the end of the novel, I was satisfied I stuck with it. I felt Mr. Pavone created and executed a well thought out conclusion to this book. It is, as others mentioned, a fast read. The ending is worth your time once you get there.. But, getting there, I felt, was somewhat of a chore.
0345803485|5.0|This is one of those books, that I just had to read after all the negative publicity. I had to see what all the hype was about. I loved it! It's not all about the sex like everyone made it out to be, there is also a story there in the background. Don't get me wrong, there is LOTS of sex, but also a story about Ana finding herself. There are some great snarky lines, and I loved the way she incorporates the emails into the book. I am completely captivated by Christian! I laughed and experienced heart ache right along with them. I had to start the second book immediately. Can't wait to see what happens in the next one!
B004I2K4DY|2.0|It didn't play the whole way through. It got about half way then it began to skip scenes. Might want to double check your disc before playing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is the best V.C. game out yet. The only thing is I wish other people could play on your map too.
B000BYCAJE|4.0|Good mix of songs, remastered pretty well!  Pleasantly surprised on the remastering quality.  Made for a good addition to my library.
1452101248|5.0|This book has some very lovely, creative recipes that have inspired me to cook with an emphasis on fresh, seasonal vegetables.  The polenta and eggplant recipe is absolutely delicious.  I have cooked many recipes and have found them all to be delicious, though somewhat labor intensive.  If you enjoy spending some time and energy compiling ingredients and tending to food in the kitchen, and are looking for innovative ways to cook with fresh produce, this is a fantastic book.
B007HJ8RTI|5.0|I enjoyed every bit, every character.  The first season definitely leaves you wanting more.  This is great for people who want to see it by season and not wait week by week.
030758836X|5.0|What a ride! I haven't been this engrossed by--this compelled by--characters in ages. This is truly among the most entertaining literary novels I've read. And I've been reading for over 50 years. A great choice for book clubs, mystery fans, romantic suspense readers, and readers who appreciate literary fiction.

1606995359|5.0|Disney comics have always been my favorite comics, especially those drawn by Carl Barks. I have been a huge fan since about 1952 (6 years old). I will probably collect all volumns in this hard cover series.  The color and paper are of excellent quality. I was totally pleased with the first volumn of this series.  A MUST FOR CARL BARKS FANS!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a game that you can play to take up your time when you're on the road or something but I wouldn't play it in my free time.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Finally a book that could hold my interest. It was very well researched and lots of fun. No overt sex just a love story with interesting characters that held my interest. Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game I love it I hope they come out with more levels! fun and addicting and I cant stop playing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addictive....always wanting to go farther and completing tasks makes this game very difficult to put down!
B000FC10WU|5.0|I can't believe I didn't review this when I read it. So many of the books I've read don't show reviews by me that I am starting to wonder if this is because the exact edition I have was removed and with it my review.  I absolutely love this series and recommend it highly, especially if you love this genre. I wish I had reviewed it when I read it so that I could give it a more thorough and enthusiastic review. Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B0062HS03O|2.0|the cd version is much more interesting, creative, innovative. As for her presence on stage, looks like an old movie, not entertaining at all. She tries to convince, but just can't. Only recommended to those really big fans, concert goers, etc.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Can't figure out (on Kindle Fire) how to delete games that I've invited friends to but they either don't have the game or don't want to play.  Only have 3 like this but it's driving me CRAZY!  Other than that, pretty good game.
B0000029AL|4.0|AEROSMITH-AEROSMITH: AEROSMITH freaks who know the band only through their streamlined late 80s renaissance might be taken aback by this wonderfully rough-hewn, auspicious debut disc, best known for spawning the passion-soaked, definitive early power ballad DREAM ON. But hold onto yer hats friends and neighbors, 'cuz the rest of this gritty platter, to quote another legendary Boston band, ain't nothin' but a house party. Hard rockin' pot-shot MAMA KIN, loose-as-a-goose seven minute jam ONE WAY STREET, and a swaggering cover of RUFUS THOMAS' crusty STAX classic WALKIN' THE DOG showcase a primitive soundscape that's sleazy, greasy, and never too easy. STEVEN TYLER's cocky, strangled caterwauling and smutty harp work is matched note for note by the interlocking rock bottom axe work of JOE PERRY and BRAD WHITFORD; the 'SMITH wouldn't grind out a groove this slinky till 30 years later on their (admittedly slicker) RNB covers disc HONKIN' ON BOBO. This is the blooziest, ballsiest, and bitchin'-est that Boston's bad boys ever sounded...so low down 'n dirty, you'll probably wanna shower afterwards.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR WAILS
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|HALLOWEEN 5 has never looked and sounded so incredible. Packed with bonus features, a new HD transfer, and stunning audio.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />- Audio Commentary with Actor Don Shanks and Author Justin Beahm (NEW)<br />- Audio Commentary with Director Dominique Othenin-Girard and actors Danielle Harris and Jeffrey Landman<br />- HALLOWEEN 5: Orginal Promo (NEW)<br />- HALLOWEEN 5: On Set Footage (NEW - 17 mins. of raw footage)
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Good story and can't wait to see where they take it. Good acting and the flying is exactly how I dream it.
1572814136|1.0|I suppose that I expected this deck to be an even brighter, more \\"radiant\\" Universal Waite deck. The Universal Waite deck, of course, still used Pamela Colman Smith's art from the Rider-Waite, only with better coloring than the original RW. The Radiant Rider-Waite Tarot is NOT Colman's pictures. They are far uglier, simpler, garish, and the whole thing feels like a bad dream in comparison to the real thing. As a professional tarot card reader, I'll see how my clients like it, but I won't be buying another one of these decks.
B007SGM084|5.0|You would think that this series contains a lot of sexual content but it is such a perfect love story that it isn't sleezy at all. I have read many, many authors and I have to commend E L James for giving us the best. I really need a book 4!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't stop playing it! This game is awesome. I highly reccomend this game. It's a little challenging,  but totally worth it.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|terrible movie. It made no sense whatsoever. I hated that I paid $3.00 to rent it. Boo on amazon. There was no plot and nothing contiguous about the story line. In a word: Terrible.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Beautiful Disaster it was! Read this book in 24 hours..couldn't put it down for anything! Looking forward to my next great read!
B000007UTN|3.0|I don't understand the quality control in vinyl these days.  They cost way above what they need to and don't deliver according to the high cost.  To be fair, the sound, production, and mixing are all amazing.  Very low surface noise, very dynamic sound... this album has never sounded more amazing!  The issue is that side B and side D both are printed off center enough to create horrible pitch shifting even on the outer tracks!  This of course renders the music on these sides completely unenjoyable.  5 stars for the music, 2 for the vinyl.  It's easily a 5 stars for the vinyl if you get one printed correctly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|many games so it stays fresh. most are fun. wish games had instructions but you can figure the object out after a few tries usually.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is awesome reading. Living life vicariously. The imagination can be soooooo much better than reality. The story line keeps you hooked.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great! There are many different translations of the Bible instantly available, and their reading/devotional plans are exceptional, with a great variety to choose from.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is my absolute favorite book. I have read it 3 times now. I love the characters and I love the story.  It makes it seem like witches, vampires and daemons could exsist in real life.  I have had the 2nd book preordered since the day I could order it. I was so surprised to see the bad reviews. The only thing I can think of the people wouldn't like is all the history in the book.  I loved it!!
B007URCTOG|1.0|I rented this movie twice and downloaded it to my kindle to watch while I travel. Both times the movie would not open so although I have paid for it twice I still haven't seen it.
1435122968|4.0|If you like horror and/or supernatural, get this.  While some of the stories may seem out of date or simple, keep in mind it is from nearly 100 years ago.  I don't recommend reading it straight through - read one or two at a time, or you risk burning out.  Having a usable table of contents in the Kindle version allows picking and choosing what to read.  Take advantage of it.  Pick the good ones or those that sound interesting.  All of the stories are definitely not winners.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it has everything the real version has but in different types of translations as well as languages. throw in that it can get you reading plans and highlighting options,  this makes for one awesome app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the coolest! its my favoritest game that I have ever even played,  that's how cool this game is!!!!!this game I rate it a *****(5 star)!!!!
0553801473|2.0|SPOILERS I found myself skipping large portions of the book, it rambled at places, too many added characters, it was often just not gripping like the first four books.  Nothing much gets resolved... I can see a 7 book epic, but at this point, it's just going on and on, maybe five books is enough for anybody to tell their story.  Everything seems to be converging on Daenerys, but it takes VERY long for things to even converge on her, and THEY still don't by the end of the book.  Tyrion travels to get to her.  Does he reach her?  NOPE.  Aegon travels to reach her, does he get to her?  NOPE.  Victarion travels to get to reach her as well, does he get to her...?  Any guess.... NOPE!  I did enjoy reading about Selmy, Daenerys and seeing Cersi however and maybe I'll give it a second try, but it didn't hold my attention like the first four books did.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|It's pretty good and it kills time when your traveling, if you got a good phone this game will entertain you.
1401937519|5.0|I've read a lot of spiritual books over the years and this one is easily in my top five now. Anita shares so honestly and lovingly about her experience that she gave me a few epiphanies, helping me move forward on my own spiritual path. There are definitely more than just a few golden nuggets in this book and I highly recommend it if you're interested in finding out what happens after we die, why we're here, and what our collective purpose is.  And why we need never be afraid of death. This is one book I'll be re-reading...for sure. Thank you, Anita!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|easy games. if you are looking for a time burner then this is it. fun for first twenty minutes though
B000059QYB|5.0|All the well known Billy Idol hits are here and a lot of them are the longer versions compared to 11 Of The Best.<br /><br />Retro classics include Dancing With Myself, Hot In The City, Eyes Without A Face, Cradle Of Love, Mony Mony and the sarcastic anthem White Wedding, sung in true snarling growling Idol fashion.<br /><br />There is a live version of Rebel Yell and a great cover of Simple Minds' Don't You (Forget About Me). Apparently, Idol turned it down in the 80s. The song then became a hit for Simple Minds.<br /><br />The remastering is top notch. Billy Idol's Greatest Hits will knock you off your feet!
B0086700CM|2.0|its the same as the one on the apple products it a good game to have and is good to do when bored
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started off a little bit slow and tame, oh, but then so different and unexpected.  This book had me totally hooked.  My first Flynn novel and won't be my last.

B007HO392S|5.0|I have loved all of Carrie's CDs, but I think she outshone herself with this one. Hopefully, with this CD she can be popular world-wide.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Hi,<br />I've had this interface for a few weeks now, and my final rating is basically what everyone else has said:<br />Drivers: Horrible<br />Hardware: Fantastic<br /><br />I'm am running Pro Tools 10 on a new(ish) HP Pavilion Core i5, with Windows 7 64 bit. Add the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, and if you Google around, you'll find this is a perfect recipe for disaster. Maybe you have a pretty similar set up, and that's why you're reading this. Well I'm here to tell you that although Pro Tools 10 is somewhat buggy on the PC, and although Focusrite's drivers are horrendous, I got everything to run pretty smoothly after 3 or 4 days of errors, intense googling, and even contacting Focusrite. I'm going to give you the steps that I took, and maybe, if you're having the same problems I was, you can make it work, because honestly, we all would love to give this interface a five star rating.<br /><br />So the drivers installed great, no errors or anything. Plugged everything in, and opened up Pro Tools. Pro Tools found the interface, and I was like \\"YES!!!\\". It appeared everything would be ok. But when I started up a new session at 24 bit and 44.1 kHz, but got an error saying that the ASIO properties for my interface had been changed, and Pro Tools needed to restart. After posting on Avid's Pro Tools forums and seeing what they had to say, I came to the conclusion that I needed to set the 2i2's sampling rate BEFORE I opened Pro Tools. Unfortunately, the Focusrite drivers don't give you that option. The only way I knew to change the sampling rate was from inside of the DAW. I Googled like mad, and after many hours of being frustrated, and being THIS close to sending the 2i2 back and getting something made by Avid or M-Audio, I finally got everything to work. Here is what did it:<br /><br />Step 1<br />Download the MOST recent drivers at beta.focusrite.com, not the ones off the public Focusrite website. Instal them.<br /><br />Step 2<br />On your PC, go to the Start Menu>ControlPanel>Hardware and Sound> Under Sound click \\"Manage Audio Devices\\". Click the recording tab, and set the Scarlett 2i2 as the default device. Click \\"properties\\" and then \\"advanced\\", from here you can set default format to \\"2 channel, 16 bit 48000 Hz\\".<br /><br />Step 3<br />Go to the Star Menu, and type \\"Focusrite\\" in the search, and then bring up the Focusrite USB 2.0 Audio Control Panel. Set the buffer length to 6 ms.<br /><br />Step 4<br />Open up Pro Tools (or your DAW of choice). Start a new session at 24 bit 48 kHz. If it says (like it did for me) that the ASIO properties had been changed, and that it needs to restart, click ok, but than click cancel when it asks you if you want to save. Then go to \\"Setup\\" and then \\"Hardware\\". From here set the sample rate to 48 kHz, and set the buffer length to 6 ms.<br /><br />Step 5<br />Close Pro Tools, open up the Focusrite Audio Control Panel on more time and double check that the buffer length is set to 6 ms.<br /><br />Step 6<br />Open Pro Tools, start a new session at 24 bit 48 kHz, and pray no errors will show up when you press record!<br /><br />And there you have it. This took me about 4 days to figure out. Hope it works for you! And if it doesn't, or if you have any questions, leave comment below and I'll see what I can do!<br /><br />As for the 2i2, yeah, its a fantastic little interface. Super quiet pres, awesome halo clip indicators, phantom power. Some people are complaining the headphone gain doesn't get very loud, but I found it sufficient. The little line/instrument switches are plastic, by the way, the pictures make them look like metal, but its plastic ;) Altogether, its a sturdy little box, great for the price, I just wish Focusrite would put a bit more effort into their drivers.<br /><br />Cheers!
B000I9WW3G|5.0|I thought the product was being shipped to me.  WRONG.  Only could watch on Computer which was ODD. Nothing arrived in the mail.  Outstanding Movie but I have to log IN on A COMPUTER to watch the item and cannot have it for my own.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|After finishing up Game of Thrones, I torn through this one.<br /><br />The same detailed adventure you grew to love in the first novel continues here, even though some of your favorite characters aren't...<br /><br />This title was great with the slight exception to plot. I felt that there was much more focus on fewer characters. For Example, Dany is hardly mentioned throughout the book. Her journey is very far and few between, this is the same for Jon as well, but not nearly as extreme.<br /><br />New characters are introduce and more story is unveiled revolving around characters we've only heard of before, which is nice!<br /><br />The meteor from the VERY end of GoT is still present throughout this novel also and it's facinating how this event is preceived by each persons perspective!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BUT STILL FOR THE MATURE ONLY
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love this game! I enjoy both the color version as well as the original version of this game. Well executed. I like how game play is slightly different in the color version, and seeing the results of the completed color images is fun.<br /><br />It did take me awhile to figure out (while playing the original game) that if you hold down on a square and slide one direction it will fill in all the squares in a line for how far you slide. The price is a bit steep but I enjoyed the first game so much I went ahead and bought this version. Great game! -Rachel (LoveMyFire)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it...especially the end when we got 50's point of view.  Would love a series from his perspective!!  Can't wait for the movie!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun no problems so far I would recommend to anyone who enjoy the Story series Mindanao like those just more...rural
B00196YNWU|5.0|I must have to say this movie is a smash hit like the musical in 1977. Annie is a heartwarming musical turned into a movie it is a wonderful movie. It did leave out songs. I'm ok with that its the actors that are superb. Some scaring review would say It's great, they have no other words to describe it. Aileen Quinn was also in the Broadway production In 1977 as a standin, she deserved the role!!! GET THIS MOVIE NOT THE 1999 MOVIE.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|Madonna is one of the greatest female artist of the story and she is pure sensuality and controversy.<br />All her videos are great and this DVD collection try to sell it but the image quality is poor and Justify My Love is censored?<br />are you kidding me? Justify my Love is a 1991 video uncensored and now 2012 you put a black stripe ruin the video.<br />Please don't buy this, at least, they remove the censorship. is stupid and hypocrite ruin this piece of art

B0076NAWWA|1.0|below Roger Waters's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.  A complete waste of time.  I only hope Morse got all of the estrogen out with this effort before going into the studio with Deep Purple.  And I like his Purple work.<br />This effort is best described as puss music, nothing but puss music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was hooked on the first book after the first few chapters. I read all three books within a week, I couldn't put them down! I highly recommend these books to any romance lover! I look forward to the next books in Christians' point of view!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|great app. allows you to add the hipster filters, without having to crop your image. also does PLENTY of other stuff. Very useful on mobile.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My sister bought me the trilogy for my Kindle. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about, so I read the first few chapters of Fifty Shades of Grey and I was HOOKED! What a great love story, I don't usually read erotic romance and was shocked by chapter 7, but I fell in love with the characters. I cannot wait until the author comes out with Christian's side of the story and the movie too!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  And this is a great price for the dvd set!!  If you like the story of Pride and Prejudice, you will not be dissappointed!  The version with Keira Knightly now feels like it's too fast!  BBC did a great job giving more details from the book and the relationships within the story.
0345803507|5.0|I was not able to put the books down. The book was heart throbbing, stimulating, and sad. I had withdrawals and wanted more.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy was an excellent read. I could not put the book down. I thought I would never read an erotic romance,but the story is so good and keeps you interested, there's mystery,murder and suspense. This trilogy has everything. I would recommend it to any Mature reader, but it is defintitely not for everyone.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|Absolute trash! I don't care much for Cage in the first place but I am happy to admit that he does do some good films. Like the Next film. Loved it. Even the first GR, Cage's acting was okay to good.<br /><br />The acting in this thing? Horrible. The situations are so contrived. The tension is ZERO. The continuity with the first story is zero also - this is actually a reboot. heh. Rebooted after one film??<br /><br />It has all the elements of a sequel though - over the top stupidity trying to outdo the previous film.<br /><br />I doubt any cast could have saved this travesty from its writers, producer(s) and director(s).<br /><br />One lone ray of sunshine - the twinkie joke was funny.
0307887448|5.0|What if Willy Wonka, The Matrix, and Ender's Game had a one night stand all at once??  This masterpiece would be the lovespawn.  such a fantastic read,  matter of fact it's the best book i've ever read!  PERIOD!<br /><br />growing up in the 80's even makes this book that much more enjoyable<br /><br />go.. buy it.  read it!  now!
0345803485|2.0|I understand that the book is erotica. I didn't realize that it would be so poorly written. It has been a struggle to read for this reason. I have not finished the book, nor do I believe I will. I love a good book, and  I am always reading two or three books at at a time. I put this one down after the first couple of hundred pages, and haven't picked it back up.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I read the book in one seating, I loved it. My only complaint is the amount of fighting seemd to out weigh the happy times sometimes, also at times there relationship seemed a lot like an abusive relationship. I mean he never hit her or anything but he could be scary at times. But I still loved the story and can't wait to read another book from this authour.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|GOT THE DVD AND WATCHED IT. GREAT PICTURE MUCH SHARPER THEN REGULAR DVD, AND CRISPER SOUND.  WELL WORTH IT IN BLU-RAY!
B00278U1WA|5.0|This is an amazing album, Regina has a beautiful voice and her songs are great. Folding Chair, Eet, and Two Birds are my favorites. I definitely recommend this!
0307592731|4.0|This well written book brought back a lot of memories for me. Cheryl Strayed was 26 when she embarked on the PCT, and I was 22 when I did my own cross country hike. Like Ms Strayed, I felt empty and was searching for something more, I went solo, and I came back a changed person. Unlike her, I hiked east from Northwest Oregon and went across the Cascades and Oregon to the Rocky Mountains, the spine of the earth. I then followed the Continental Divide from Central Idaho all the way to Central Colorado.<br />What rang truest in this book was the emotional memories that were brought back for me. The overwhelming feeling of shouldering a heavy back on the first uphill climb out of a supply point, when you're loaded down with food and need to budget your time and miles so you reach the next town before the food runs out. The adrenaline rush that hits when your exhausted and hiking on autopilot and suddenly become aware of the unique rattle-buzz of a rattlesnake coiled in the trail in front of you. The sense of awe that happens when the beauty of a mountain or a primordial grove or a river canyon hits you. These are memories that become a part of who you are for the rest of your life.<br />The book really only scrapes the surface of the most profound part of the experience, which is the transformation of character that occurs when the combination of perseverance and solitude and the humbling impact of being a tiny speck traveling through vast wilderness does it's work on the soul. To be fair, this is an extremely difficult thing to capture even when one experiences it first hand. Ms Strayed seems to recognize this difficulty and gives us only bits and pieces to consider, leaving the big picture pretty much a mystery.<br />Read this book. And if it sparks a thought or a dream in you and you have the chance to go, then go. Write your own story, even if like me you only write it in your memory.
B004132HZS|5.0|This show is brilliant! It's very cleverly written and I'm glad I decided to purchase all of the episodes in the first season. Each episode is an hour and a half long and I enjoyed this BBC mini-series immensely. I have also purchased the second season. Which picks up shortly after the end of the first. In order to completely enjoy this show, consider purchasing the second season. The series is full of suspense, mystery, long coats, and high cheekbones.

B005LAIH9K|5.0|I have been a fan of this series since it first started and this movie does not disappoint (as I did not think it would). This movie brings back all of the characters that you came to know and love from the original which was amazing, as there had been a number of movies in the series that failed to live up to the comedic tone and value of the original (in my opinion). Be aware that this movie does have its crude humor in it so it is not appropriate for young audiences due to the humor and the overall content and message that it is sharing. That being said though, the movie was funny and the cast did a great job together again! I also loved all of the amazing extras that the Blu-Ray provides you as a viewer. There were so many fun games and interactive aspects of the disc that allow you to better know the characters and the actors playing them as well as what goes into the writing and directing if a movie such as this. This was a great movie within the series of American Pie movies and one that I would recommend that all see!
B0045HCJRG|5.0|The dvd came brand new in plastic wrap with a big old sticker on it with my name and info on it, also came in a nicely bubble wrapped package so it was in great shape when I got it.  Awesome price for the product, thanks!

B007KOYEOC|2.0|I was only a few chapters into the first book when I had an overwhelming feeling of deja vu (of a sort). Then it hit me - this is 'Twilight' with BDSM replacing vampirism. How this trilogy ever got to publication is beyond my understanding. I got an answer, of sorts, at the end of the second book - E L James had originally written this story with the 'Twilight' characters for fan fiction. Don't get me wrong, I've been reading fan fiction since the 'Star Trek' days, and the BDSM theme is nothing new. In fact, there's some outstanding stuff out there - this trilogy isn't amongst them. It isn't even original. James has simply renamed the characters, reworked the plot and presented it as an original work. It's almost plagarism by default.<br /><br />Oh Fifty, how you annoyed me. Let me count the ways.<br /><br />Did a proofreader even look at the manuscripts? There are so many punctuation and grammar mistakes, it's distracting. One mistake is (almost) forgivable, but on nearly every page? That's atrocious.<br /><br />How about an editor? This travesty should never have been printed in the first place, but if it had to be, it should have been trimmed to one book. The dialogue is puerile and the sex scenes are repetative - and used on most occassions as a replacement for a plot.<br /><br />Plot? What plot? It's in there somewhere, but rather than developing it, the author just throws bits of it in on an ad hoc basis. The main problem is that it is written from a first person perspective. Done well, this style can be highly enjoyable, but done badly, you get books like this. Christian is a far more interesting character than Ana, but due to the first person perspective, we are limited to whatever insights he begrudgingly gives us. There was a small taste of his point of view at the end of the third book, entitled 'Shades of Christian', and it makes for far more interesting reading. But this begs the question - what was the point of this addendum? Is it a taste of things tocome? Will the author write another three books from Christian's point of view? Just the thought makes me turn fifty shades of green.<br /><br />I am sorely tempted to ask Amazon for a refund - this travesty is an embarrassment to fiction, and an insult to readers.<br />At the end of the third book, the author thanks her readers 3 times and writes 'That's all ... for now'. The 'thank yous' sound as if they come from Ana, and the 'That's all ... for now' sounds like a threat from Christian!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One stars and two stars KNOCK IT OFF NNNNOOOOWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!! this is fabulous, great and nice. I want to give it 5.5star! Well done printing and story! Can not easily put down the sample. So worth the money.
1475143389|3.0|NOTE:    So after having followed Mike's program for about 4 months I have gained a better perspective on what it does for you. Let me say first that I gained no weight whatsoever following Mike's BASELINE recommendations for macro nutrients (carbs, fat, protein). In fact, I became more chiseled, however I was making strength gains so I figured I was doing something right. Therein lies the key to the gains that the style of lifting Mike advocates can make for you. YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY LIFTING FOR STRENGTH, NOT HYPERTROPHY. Even though I was gaining no weight I was gaining strength because I was taking the muscle I had built thus far and pushing it to the max. You will see some increases but once you have maxed out your muscle size's potential you will hit a wall---- That may seem counter-intuitive but just go to youtube and type in Ian McCarthy, he explains everything about the different muscle fibers you are hitting when doing strength training as opposed to hypertrophy training.--- here's his link, and keep in mind that I'm not trying to plug anything for anyone, it's just that I have struggled for so long to put on weight and I would have been so grateful if somebody had shared this info with me sooner    [...]    Strength training is good, but if building bigger muscles is your goal it should be something done less than hypertrophy training. Also, Mike's recommendations for carbs and fats were far to low for me to make any gains. He says that if you don't make any gains then to up your daily caloric intake, which will eventually get you there, but why do guesswork when you can get a more exact calculation. That's why I went back to my previous calculations which I got from Power Eating before I starting gaining any weight on Mike's strength program. Here's the link to Power Eating: it tells you EXACTLY how to calculate how many grams of protein, fat, and carbs you need a day. (Even though I had these numbers before Mike's book I wasn't eating enough everyday, which was why I made no gains)    [[ASIN:0736066985 Power Eating, Third Edition]]    Even so I am really glad I purchased and read this book because it sent me down a path to a better understanding about building muscle. Also, I now keep a FOOD JOURNAL, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU ARE SERIOUS AT ALL ABOUT MAKING GAINS. Once I started writing things down I was surprised at how low my calorie count was.    Also, Mike DOES NOT discuss the biological values of different sources of protein, something that can seriously trip you up in meeting your daily protein mark. Essentially not all proteins are utilized by your body to the same degree so do yourself a favor and read up on it. Here's a link, but feel free to cross reference it  [...]

0345803485|1.0|Terrible writing + one-dimensional characters +  re-used plot + comical sex scenes = Fifty Shades of Grey.<br /><br />I finally gave in and purchased this book yesterday. I had to see what all the hype is about. What a waste of money. I have learned I hate the word \\"clamber\\", and seeing someone with \\"a ghost of a smile\\" on their face just might drive me over the edge.<br /><br />If you want some romantic raunch, try almost any title out of Ellora's Cave, and skip this garbage.

B007IXGUG0|1.0|I like some rap, especially those artists who tell it like it is, people that write about the real world, hard times, the streets, etc.  That said, this noise was a waste of time, sadly.  'Drake,' another narcissistic, misogynist, loose with the 'N' word, rapper exists to carry a twisted message to you about his millions, self-import, warped ideas about sex or the number of females he's bred with or that he hasn't written lyrics for anyone who isn't as 'in demand' as thinks he is.  Yes, a legend in his own mind.  If you like this sort of thing, you'll really love this recording.  ::click:: >>DELETE>>

B003UYV08E|5.0|This is one of those rare times when the second movie is as good as (if not better) than the first. Definitely a must-own for anyone who likes \\"superhero\\" movies. (Bought it used/good condition and have no complaints!)
0525478817|5.0|This is my first John Green book that I've read, and to be honest I'd never even heard of John Green before my archaeology professor suggested watching his Crash Course: World History videos (by the way I've learned more watching his 12 minutes videos than a whole semester in class). In his videos, he was hilarious, engaging and informative, so I figured I'd give him a try. The verdict: John Green is amazing!!!<br /><br />Now, I don't usually read that much contemporary - I like to relish in a fictional world because reality is a harsh mistress. So I was a bit surprised to find myself thoroughly engrossed with young lives and how cancer can put a deadline on your life and making you want to live it all that more fiercely.<br /><br />The cover is so unassuming and you'd never guess what the story was behind such a simple cover - so it's definitely a \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" kind of book. But I love the bright colors and the more personal hand written like font on the cover.<br /><br />Green was fairly successful in creating a female character that was believable (she laments at her looks), but also a character that is distinct in who she is due to her experiences. When we first meet Hazel, we're given a run down of her cancer history, and how a miracle drug has extended her life for the moment. Given all that she's been through, it's difficult to lead a stereotypical 16 year old life - if anything she's accelerated her life to maximize the time she has left by finishing highschool early, and even attending college. As a result she's a very mature young woman, with an extensive vocabulary that might end up throwing off some readers - but I found it extremely refreshing to have such a developed voice narrating. Now that's not to say she doesn't show some younger more teenage qualities, she still gushes with friends, watches frivolous tv shows and longs for love. But it all balances out to make her an amazing character with depth, witty sarcasm and the ability to take all things in stride.<br /><br />Augustus Waters is a cancer survivor, and joins the group in support for Hazel and his' mutual friend Isaac. He's healthy and shows no signs of former sickness, and like Hazel I was unsure as to his motives at first. But when he opens his mouth he proves that he's insanely intelligent and full of philosophical meanderings that can definitely keep up with Hazel. The dialogue, banter and conversations between Augustus and Hazel are at times the funniest and most beautiful moments in the book.<br /><br />Although Hazel is hesitant at first, for good reason, they eventually come to a mutual understanding and as their relationship evolves they end up forever bound together by the shared love for a certain book written by a surly author. So begins an epic quest to answer their questions about the book, that takes them down a road that will completely change both of their lives.<br /><br />The cast of secondary characters were perfect in their supplement to the story. I especially loved Isaac, and how his friendship with both Hazel and Augustus ended up playing such a monumental role. Hazel's parents were also incredible characters to watch because they have had to deal with all the near misses she's gone through and how they live in the now, and what the possibilities are in the future. The story doesn't just focus on Hazel, but also all the people that she's affected in her life by being this amazing person.<br /><br />Green's writing style perfectly blends the seriousness of the situation with some meaning of life pondering, and banter to balance the morbidity, along with really sweet romance and friendship. Now, a fair warning - before you start this book get a box of Kleenex, you'll likely need it. That's not to say that this book is strictly sad (I mean it is a cancer subjected book, and Hazel is terminally ill), but I cried because I laughed so hard, and then I cried because moments between Hazel and Augustus were just so exquisitely beautiful that I had no words. So I probably looked insane reading this book because one moment I was laughing hysterically, and then the next I was streaming tears, but in the end it was all worth it because where this book took me as I followed their journey, and the relationship between Augustus and Hazel is awe inspiring and gives the brightest glimmer of hope just when you think there is none.<br /><br />This definitely isn't a book to be restricted to just young adults. I bought copies for lots of people I knew because it just needed to be shared, and I didn't want to part with my own personal copy and they ended up giving their copies to relatives to read because it has such a profound effect on them after they read it. That's how I feel about this book - that it's so awesome I had to share it with everyone! So everyone go read it if you haven't already!uisitely beautiful that I had no words.

0385534639|5.0|is a tale of romance and magic and not at all the sort of thing I usually read (or listen to, as this was/is an audiobook), but I enjoyed it so thoroughly that I felt compelled to finish it, and am very glad I did.  The Night Circus has all the flaws inherent in tales of magic, notably the sheer impossibility of magic, but has lovely melodic description of the magics and the people and their reactions to magic that make the whole quite charming in spite of magic tales' impossibility.<br />The voice characterizations by the reader really make the tale come alive.  In the most compelling passage, the two main characters (magicians, naturally) find themselves growing romantically involved and the moment when their hands touch is charged with magic in such a way as to be erotic without being in the least graphic.  It is a wonderful trick, and writers of real smut should take notice.<br />The plot concerns the circus as a venue for a kind of duel of two schools of magic, one learned and one inherent.  But really, who cares about that?  The writing is leisurely and poetic, but moves the plot points along quickly enough that the reader doesn't even notice s/he is hearing poetry instead of a story.
0385344228|5.0|reads like a first rate murder-psycho-family drama until you uncover all the secrets. couldn't put it down.LOVED it. bought \\"Mission Flats\\" by the same author, but an earlier work . slower, but intriguing so far.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow,  like everyone that I know that has a smartphone has this app. well it those have problems controlling depending on what devise you use . but its not totally free the only thing that involes real pay is if you need &quot;coins &quot;  right away you need to actually pay.<br />But its all worth it! Enjoy :D
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I won't repeat the plot summary; that's been done by better reviewers than I. I will, however, beg to differ with those who state that the second book is the weakest of the three. As in  most trilogies, the euphoria at the conclusion of the first almost demands that the second be darker with a less positive ending, so that the third and final episode leads to justification and success (for good examples, look at the original \\"Star Wars\\" film, the second episode, and then the finale).<br /><br />Ms. James has written a lengthy story of what it means to love unconditionally. It's not easy to love unconditionally. As humans, we have expectations, and when those expectations are not met, we too often reject the individual, or at least react negatively to him/her.<br /><br />The journey Christian and Anastasia have taken is one of discovery, lust turned to love, rejection turned to acceptance, and sadness turned to joy. I found myself in tears at times, aching for Christian in his agony and Ana in her distress. I found myself almost sitting on the edge of my seat as the plot thickened around the danger. I found myself laughing out loud over their exchange of emails. I found myself grinning like a fool at the conclusion of this excellent trilogy.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the epilogue and then the beginning from Christian's POV. Very satisfying, very fulfilling, very enjoyable. Yes, hyperbole, but for a cause ... the cause of unconditional love. Long may it reign!
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|The product was shipped within a reasonable time, and this group is my FAVORITE, so that was key to my satisfaction.
037582913X|5.0|Right now, this is more a 5 star entertainment for mom rating. We checked this out from the library and have read it to my almost 4 year old about 3 times. She couldnt sit and read though the book the whole time when grandma first read it - she kept backing away further and further until she was out of the room. She eventually got through to the end and knows that it's Grover, and has even flipped through it on her own, but she is still scared by it. I read it one time and she was all the way across the kitchen listening from behind the counters. Very cute!  Well keep trying and I expect I will buy it for our permanent collection. maybe if I start my second kid on it sooner, he will never be scared by it (then again, it might be fun to introduce it to him at the right time).

B002ZCDR88|5.0|This is the first time I have ever submitted a review but feel I owe it to this wonderful product.  Thank you to Natalie Merchant for having both the vision and the talent to put this fusion of poetry & enchanting music together in such an exceptionally creative way.  I bought this for myself but it would also make a delightful gift.  The beautiful little book which houses the two CD's contains all the poems plus the life story of each poet.  It is an absolute treasure. I read that 100 musicians were involved in putting it together and this is apparent in the musical diversity and faultless presentation.  Food for the soul.  Highly recommended.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love the CD.  It is a wonderful collection of Barbra Streisand Duets that were song with many other brilliant vocalists.
B004ZELSLM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the new Doctor Who series. David Tennant is a wonderful doctor, but Matt Smith makes it hard to chose which of them is my favorite. Karen Gillan and Arthur Darville are also delightful and the dynamic between them as Amy and Rory is really fun to watch. The actress who plays River Song is also fantastic. I forget her name. Every Who fan knows that the series can be delightfully cheesy at times, but this season has a seriousness to it that works well. Even the filler episodes that aren't part of the main story arc are well-written. The main story arc episodes are amazing. I think the two-part \\"Almost People\\" and \\"The Rebel Flesh\\" are two of the best in the season. Also the twist at the end of \\"Demon's Run\\" is a great one. Even if you saw it coming you will still be pleased. All in all, this season of Doctor Who is more than worth a watch. It's even worth owning it to be able to watch your favorites over and over. Remember, the only water in the forest is the river...

B0071BY084|5.0|The one thing to understand about rock/fusion is that many of the songs out of this genre are written to be improvised on stage. That's really were the life of these songs becomes obvious. So its in this framework that guitar legend Joe Satriani delivers a first rate performance. Satriani has long been known to have the ability to fully fish out his own pieces of music and realize their potential and the show from Saturated is no different.<br /><br />Satriani adds extended solos to all the songs and really opens up the number \\"With Jupiter In Mind\\". The one negative for me was that he didn't use bassist and long time tour mate Stu Hamm on this tour, which would have given some of the numbers an extra dimension. But all in all this was a great live show.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works just like my phone version.  Nothing is as good as the Kindle itself...however, I like the ability to read on whatever piece of electronics I have with me.  Thx - Amazon for the versatility!!  Would suggest to anyone to download this app.  Especially if you are an avid reader, like myself.
B0055S348W|4.0|I got this app as a FAOTD but it is worth paying for the full version.  I can print web pages if I save it as a favorite.  No problems printing emails including the attachments.  I don't have a wifi printer so I use my printer as a remote printer.  My only problem is my printer showing as not online sometimes.  Otherwise, I like it and I am truly mobile now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has so many different styles of games for everyone. The only downside that made me give it 4 stars is that it's hard to unlock new games. Cost too many points. But other than that, fun game for being free. &lt;3
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Works great on my Acer Iconia A500.  Documents keep their original formatting so you're not limited to generic editing.  I've created documents and spreadsheets on my tablet as easily as I do on my desktop.  Thanks to Printershare I can print them too.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons are quite possibly the best band to come out in the last ten years. I was extremely pleased with this album. Besides the singles \\"Little Lion Man\\" and \\"The Cave\\" all the other songs are spectacular. \\"Winter Winds\\", \\"White Blank Page\\", and \\"Dustbowl Dance\\" stand out as favorites, but this is an album that you won't really want to skip across the songs to get to your favorites.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is very handy when I'm out. Much better than using my cellphone calculator with it's small screen and more convenient than bringing an actual calculator.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Even though certain events from the book were different in the movie, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film. I really enjoyed Mr. Armistead's portrayal of John Thornton. Comparisons to Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy are inevitable and well deserved.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|A movie from the 1940s in a moderne format.  Our family loves the movie and it looks great in Blu-ray.  What more can I say, it is a classic Disney Movie.

1439177783|4.0|This book is told from the perspective of the sick person- this is what makes it so painful and claustrophobic. We are inside the room of the anorexic mind- the obsessiveness, the repetitiveness, the utterly terrifying narrowing of viewpoint, in which all that matters is endless, endless calculations of calories, a totally barren world of numbers. What is most awful about what is revealed here is the following: the complete joylessness of Portia's life while in the grip of this; the utter absence of pleasure, sex, and fun; the utter absence of any interest in the world beyond calories and body weight; the complete lack of any interest in acting as a craft (despite her career), with the endlessly repeated mantra that to be successful as an actor means simply to be as thin as possible. All Portia does is look in and at her starving self (and with such loathing)- there is no outside.<br /><br />The indictment here is on everyone who approves of her progressively starving body- the looks of envy from makeup artists and others- the twistedness of a world (our world) in which a severely starving woman is a sign of success, of beauty. The indictment too is on the culture of the Ally McBeal set (where no fewer than three of the female 'stars' were anorexic- ie, mentally ill)- and yet endorsed as role models.<br /><br />I felt depressed while reading this book, and under a cloud. I felt trapped, anxious and bored at points, as page after page of micro-obsessive behaviour was enumerated. It shows so powerfully that anxorexia is a severe mental illness, that it has striking characteristics of obsessive compulsive disorder, that it causes unspeakable suffering, and that our society celebrates and rewards women who are victims of it, instead of recognising them as incredibly ill.<br /><br />I hardly know whether to recommend it- it is very well-written, and important, but an incredible ordeal to read, even with the ending of the story being such a happy one. It made me sick at heart about the world with the truths it reveals.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I like the slight departure from the comic books, the human element is much better IMO.  This is the best cable TV show today... can't wait for season 3.
B007N85ZXY|2.0|I am a huge Neil Young fan.  I have seen him in concert every decade since the 1970s.  I have almost all of his albums.  However, this album is marginal.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a fun game but there are a lot of pop ups and the controlls suck bad other than that its fun addictive and not too easy there's a challenge.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game with an easy and quick download. I love the ability to play offline and all the playing options. I've been playing on the random play mode where it's nice to be able to just go back to setup and start again with a new strategy. When I'm tired, I love the winning game choice.
B005OP71GC|5.0|Great show! Sooo much going on all the time - (but not so it's hard to follow) - and plenty of excitement through each episode!<br /><br />Have to say, the BEST way to watch this is back to back episodes because waiting a week between installments is tough to do.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|The movie is ok. However, the reason to write this review, is the problem i've had lately with DVD products from amazon.<br />Yet another time, i've got a brand new DVD, scratched, unplayable. Just because the blu ray was covered with some ads, i went and put the DVD disc. About 30 minutes in, the movie starts skipping and it was impossible to continue.<br />I went to check, and the DVD is heavily scratched. I check out the case, and i saw the Bluray disc. It worked just fine.<br /><br />Lately, almost 30% of the DVDs i get from amazon, are scratched. This is really weird, because the packaging seems like new, so i cannot understand how this happened.<br /><br />BTW: This is the only disc i checked after problems. The other discs i complain about, are checked before putting in the player.(Yes, i checked, its not the player scratching discs).
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This album is right at the top along with the others. I love the album but the song \\"That's why God made the radio\\" really stays with me. All the songs stay inside you after you listen to it.  LOVE IT!!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was a GREAT book. I loved that it dealt with hard topics and how people deal with loss, growing up, being a parent, etc. I love a good romance story but this has SO MUCH more. Good series, looking forward to number three!
B0086700CM|5.0|omg this game is soo addictive. I played it on my friends ipod and love it.I'm shocked its better on my kindel fire
B0086700CM|5.0|it is really good but has some glitches sometimes. and should work on the detail. other then that it is a good app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but some of the games are impossible to do and you have to collect so many points to get a new game but its still really fun to play r
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this is the best app ever it is funny it is stoopid. but in the good way I love this app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it!!! ;) its very fun and I could play it all day long.. like seriously I probably could play it that long lol;)
145162445X|4.0|Easy  to understand story of the creation of the universe and Quantum Theory and its part in this amazing story.  Wonderful look into the far distant future and why this time in history is so unique in being able to observe so much about our universe and why people in the future may not have that opportunity.  Even the thought of multi universes is addressed very intelligently and understandable.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God gives you the power to create. All from the four basic elements (fire water earth air) , you can create animals, technology,  and civilizations.
B000001FO4|5.0|This CD was really.  Bad Seamstress Blues was awesome. This was a rare collection of songs that throughout the entire collection really didn't have anything that wasn't great.  Only notable exception might be track 8.  But for the rest of the work it was truly great.  I really enjoyed it.
030758836X|5.0|I was very excited to start reading Gone Girl on vacation, and after page one I couldn't put it down! Gillian Flynn does an excellent job of switching points of view between Nick (the husband) and Amy (his wife). With every change in POV, you learn more about the characters and their intense relationship. Flynn adds many twists and turns to keep the reader interested and the last page leaves you begging for more. A great read! Can't wait for more from Flynn.
B001EN1R2M|3.0|For the first attempt I was really good.  I didn't purchase this CD until I was much older.  After having all their other CD's up to Dr. Feelgood I purchased this one and it was good but you could tell by the way the music sounded they were going to be a really different band, and they were.  Recommended.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|I hate that dvd version doesnt have subtitles in any language, so I has dissopointed that only came in English-
B00297FEUS|4.0|This was one of their earliest CD's they recorded.  As I speak of bands that have starter CD's this is what I'm referring to.  Burn in Hell is an awesome song that surprisingly talks about salvation and giving your heart to Jesus, if you listen to the entire track.  Mostly filled with a misses, there are a few really good songs on here.  Burn in Hell, The Beast are among the ones I personally preferred.  As they collection of their music grew, it seems they progressed somewhat normally.  The songwriting got better.  To me it appeared that after their final CD, Love is for Suckers, that they would go on forever as that CD didn't really have a bad track on it, but it just stopped.  Underrated band.  Loved Love is for Suckers, even though the song itself was written mostly by Marky Carter.  This CD made me fall in love with Metal music.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love the game when traveling to unwind. it is nice to enjoy time alone after a hectic and stressful day.
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|Poison did it again.  Love listening to C.C. Deville on guitar.  I remember the Fallen Angel video as well as Nothing but a Good Time.  It was a fun CD.  It's kind of a classic CD.  On CD's girl's release they sing and boys and on CD's boys release they sing about girls.  Much more fun & lighter than Guns & Roses.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the game.  it is fun and entertaining, and wish I had more like it.....thanks so much.  from Jan Daniel
B0012GMUPO|5.0|Alice cooper has done it again.  When you've been around forever, as he has, you pick up a few things.  The track listing on here runs the whole gambit.  From Poison, to House of Fire to Trash, everything on here is excellent.  Tracks 5 & 9 seem to have a flavor of a ballad, but that's okay.  Most bands I grew up listening to had one ballad on their album, but Alice has been around for eons so he knows what he's doing.  A must have.
B001AQO400|4.0|What a great Bill Murray's performance. I have to confirm that it's a multiregion blu-ray (it works without any problem in Europe).
B000000OQY|3.0|It was an okay CD. Still G 'N' R is a bit more intense than what I usually go for, but not bad. This CD was typical because I found a few songs were good but as a whole it seemed unbalanced.  But as would later be revealed, Axl is a bit more out there than most other \\"artists\\".
0345536886|1.0|I have read so many Grisham books. This was one of the most boring books by Grisham I have read, I was barely able to get to the end. Boring Boring Characters. He wrote The King of Torts and it was so much more interesting and informative than this book about Torts and that book was not highly rated. If you are a new Grisham fan go read the early books. From the reviews here I expected so much more. I doubt if I will ever read any new books by Grisham again and never trust reviews on this site which is why I bought this book in the first place.
B001AUKUS6|2.0|I saw the You're in Love video and loved everything about that video, the songs that followed this track on the CD however seemed a bit less.  As I would soon discover, it appears that Ratt used a lot of the same songs on CD from CD which made the collection as a whole somewhat not as good as others I've seen.  Great look, but as for me and my taste this CD just wasn't on target.  Try again.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I have had a copy of this film on my DVR and was always annoyed by the commercials and the fact that it was edited for time, hence I ordered it. The DVD had so many seizing freezing and at times whole sections skipped that I just fast forwarded past all the jittery nonsense. What a waste, I ended up watching the DVR copy anyway! To make it worse I had it for quite awhile and decided to watch it because nothing worthwile was on TV only to discover such poor viewing quality.
B000002H6Q|5.0|This is the final Motley CD I obtained.  After the release of this CD and when Tommy left the band, it just didn't fit right so I this was like the golden CD.  Kick start My Heart had awesome guitar riffs.  The CD seems to cover a broad range of songs, most of which I enjoyed.  Very worth while getting.
B0080R7P8A|5.0|By the third or fourth play of this collection, I was blown away. The sound throughout is fantastic; the material stellar; and the story behind the preparation fantastic - just think of those tapes in that closet and the way they were originally recorded and then cared for 40+ years later! (There's lots of info about that in the booklet) Just about everything positive you could say about this release is in reality a success, with just a few things you have to take in context to be in full appreciation.<br /><br />The editing and track sequencing are utterly superb. I've heard a lot of the unreleased Can film music on a bootleg called Soundtracks 2, and it sounded like senseless garbage (complete with dialog from the German movies). Virtually all of the good bits however found their way into the longer 'suite' tracks released here, and gel together as seamless compositions ready for proper release. Well done Jono Podmore!<br /><br />I have to oppose a few things mentioned about The Lost Tapes in professional reviews: A) the live tracks don't make for a strong conclusion to the set. B) the live tracks were unreleased before this set.<br /><br />Not true. \\"Mushroom\\" from 1972, at the end of disc 3, is one of Can's finest live moments. (This is my opinion after listening to some 37 Can concert recordings) I think the track, along with \\"One More Night\\", is a great way to end of career-spanning set. At the same time, \\"Mushroom\\" is a redundant release here. It can be found on disc 2 of Tago Mago re-release from 2011. \\"Networks of Foam\\" is also a repeat. It can be found on Live 1971-1977 in shorter form (as \\"Kata Kong\\").<br /><br />Switching back and forth from studio to live tracks and hearing the same pieces crop again with different titles can be awkward. Trust me, in this case however, it works! That it does has just about everything to do with Irmin Schmidt's track sequencing, which fleshes out Can's narrative so intelligently. It's easy for a lot of the studio tracks to seem like remixes of familiar tracks from Soundtracks, Ege Bamyasi, and Landed. It's not such a problem though, because of their high quality and (in not all, but most cases) considerable difference. I would actually take \\"Desert\\" over \\"Soul Desert\\" if I had to choose. It's quieter, and as much or even more spine-tingling.<br /><br />I think The Lost Tapes is closest in feel to Unlimited Edition. The pieces are of a scattered chronology, yet uniform strength. What's unprecedented with The Lost Tapes is that it pays homage to the Mooney-era that's relatively large. Five tracks on the set have Damo's voice, yet there are seven with Mooney. The ones with Malcolm are not only that good, they cover all facets of Can's intricate outlook in the late nineteen-sixties. It makes the music collected on Delay 1968 seem very one-sided by comparison.to seem like remixes of familiar tracks from Soundtracks, Ege Bamyasi, and Landed.

B000002H97|5.0|After a powerful opening with Enter Sandman the rest of the songs on the CD seemed a bit weaker, but the opening was very powerful and very good.  Loved the guitar riffs on Enter Sandman.  It was a great work for introducing someone to Metallica.  Enter Sandman was the reason I bought the CD.  Overall the CD was excellent.  It's the only CD of theirs that I actually have as they appear to be a bit harder than I'm used to, but still the work is excellent.
0345803485|5.0|AmaZing Book to read! Loved this book, can't wait until book 2 is delivered, very exciting to say in the very least. Made me what more
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game!! I recommend it as a time killer in the car or just for fun. It's great on kindle fire and other aneroid devices. Run from monkeys!!!! yayyy
B007L96SI6|5.0|I bought this as a Father's Day present because both of my parents watch American Idol and my dad likes Haley.  He was thrilled when he opened the package I put it in and listened to the whole thing start to finish on the first day. My father described \\"Listen Up!\\" as very listenable; this is stuff that you could listen while you were doing...well, anything. If you're a fan of Haley Reinhart and would like some background music while you work, this is probably the album you want.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This collection is great and you cannot beat and ultra upgraded starwars. I would recommend this series to anyone especially cause it is on blu ray.
0345803485|4.0|So far, very intriguing.  I have not completed this book because of time restraint.  However, I find it to be a very easy read and hard to put down. I am<br />looking forward to reading more this evening and will most likely placed an order<br />for the next one!<br /><br />Dee
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I absolutely loved the story line, I wanted to know more about Christian grey. The only negative to me was all the explicit content ended up too much and almost repetitive other than that I read all three books and am sad to say goodbye :)
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|Just got this today, and I'm listening for the first time.  I am loving it!  The music is great on all the tracks, and Bonnie's voice is outstanding.  Why have I not bought any Bonnie Raitt albums before?<br /><br />I will be listening to this again and again.
B005CRQ2Y4|4.0|This is probably Pynchon's best and most accessible novel. It's a masterpiece of 60s paranoia, dragging the reader into a plot that seems improbably but becomes terrifyingly true as the book goes on. It's also really funny. Some of the jokes are specific to the time it was published (1966) but it contains enough oddball characters and situations to keep readers entertained. it's a short book, a novella, that's a good introduction to the reclusive writer. If you liked this book, I'd suggest moving on to V.
B003UESJ9W|5.0|I absolutely loved this DVD, play it all the time, the music is great, Garrett Hedlund steals the show with his great acting and amazing singing.  Would recommend this to anyone who loves country music.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|It's functional, but to me only supporting 360p tops on my Kindle is totally unacceptable. I get the limitations on features and all that, but if I can't watch with higher quality I'll just use a laptop.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book! I didn't want to put it down-read it in 2 days. Just when I thought I had figured<br />it out, another mind blowing twist came. Read the 50 Shades books, but this is my favorite book of the summer by far! I have recommended it to all of my friends. It makes you think of your own marriage also.
B007MAETA8|4.0|John Mayer seems to have shifted his music genre. I found this disc bordering on folk music or country at times which isn't my cup of tea, however he pulls it off with his musicianship and decent lyrics.<br /><br />I found it very moody and sometimes a little too personal. Mayer may be controversial at times in his life to the point of being a bit of an a-hole but there's no doubt that Mayer is one of the most gifted musicians on the music scene today. The guy has to clean up his act personally as many other gifted artists in the past had to do, focus and be taken seriously for his contribution.<br /><br />I enjoy the old John Mayer Trio style with other great musicians like Pino Palladino on bass and Steve Jordan on drums. Now that's music!!<br /><br />John, leave the ego at home and lose the hat and the Johnny Depp look.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Haven't had any problems with this app, no more pop ups then with any other game. Highly recommended, has the same look and feel as it does on your PC.
B0018RWD6I|5.0|Great service! Your product was the least expensive.  It arrived within three days of ordering. Thanks so much. I've told family and friends of your website.  Keep up the outstanding job your website is doing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't speak for everyone and people have different opinion's but I can't say anything bad about this trilogy. I could not stop reading!! Its exciting in all the right way's. One of the best! Oh..my..Mr.Grey!!
0345803485|5.0|This is definitely a MATURE adult reading.  If you don't finish to the last sentence, you miss the whole point of the reason for the book.  Wow!  Finally a book about the raw animal instincts we all have but try so very hard to hide.  And finally, FINALLY, a book about a woman who isn't stupid.  She was written as a woman who wanted to explore, but never accepted half truths from him or herself....Would that I had read this a long time ago and I could have saved myself from a ton of heartbreak....
B005FISBV2|5.0|This is my favorite TV series of all.  It's funny, yet exciting, and all the actors are fantastic.  Watching each episode seems like only 10 minutes, it goes by so quickly.
0345803507|3.0|Not sure what all the hushed conversations and blushing cheeks are around the office when this book is brought up????  For those who have read erotic fiction before, this book is nothing new.  With regards to the story line - I personally found the main characters tedious.  Their continual fighting, along with her constant questioning of their relationhip and whether she's what he needs, became boring after reading about it over and over and over and over and over.  I was honestly glad to come to the end and don't really care if there is another book on the way as some people are speculating.  As to the reason why readers pick up an erotic novel - I thought the sex scenes were on par with any other erotic story.  The content was spicy and even though I found myself reading with an Internet connection nearby (Come on! I'm not the only one who had to look up what some of those toys were!!) I enjoyed this aspect of the book.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I thought his was a really good book in general, whether meant for a YA or adult audience. I enjoyed the world building and character development, as well as the concept of the shadowhunters, which added something different to the often overdone aspects of vampires, shifters, and demons. I did think there was a certain amount of predictability, but overall, the characters' journey was enjoyable. I look forward to reading the rest of the Mortal Instruments series and the companion series, Infernal Devices.
0425263908|5.0|I had gotten Bared to You because the reviews on the writing for Fifty Shades was not very good, and this was offered as an alternative. And wow, what a great alternative. This was a page turner, so much so that I read it in one sitting. The scenes fold right into each other, and the portrayal of the relationship dynamic itself (regardless of whether the relationship is right, wrong, indifferent, whatever) is simply beautiful. I found myself almost crying for Gideon and Eva at some points in the story. I also enjoyed how Sylvia explored the Dominant / submissive relationship begin, and how she did it without whips, chains, or putting out a list of sex toys and sexual things that the submissive would or would not do. This was Dominant / submissive with a touch of class. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy! With all the hype over the movie, I was determined to read these books before watching it. I am so very glad that I did. There's just no comparison between a movie and a good book, no matter how well-done the movie may be. I've read quite a bit of YA fiction, but I've not been a huge fan of dystopian fiction. I did like the first Maze Runner book, but I didn't intend to delve any deeper into the dystopian foray than that. This one experience has caused me to read some other selections, like Enclave & Divergent, and to even consider giving The Forest of Hands and Teeth another try. Very highly recommended!
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|Barbarella is one-third of the Holy Trinity of Good Bad films, the other two being \\"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\\" and \\"Valley of the Dolls\\". I saw Barbarella for the first time on a Navy base back when I was a tadpole just starting out in the cesspond of life. The Navy base had censored Babarella somewhat but it was still a marvel for its cheesy sets, bad dialogue, sappy satire and its audacious bad taste. However, no matter what was censored, Jane Fonda was a luscious, lascivious delight! Another standout was Anita Pallenberg (Keith Richards former companion). Ms. Pallenberg simply chewed up the sets, the dialogue and just about everything else in reach whenever she was on-screen (but she could not devour our intrepid, brave Barbarella). I finally saw a \\"complete, uncut\\" version many years later at a midnight showing in a now-closed cinema in Greenwich Village. I and my group of friends and the rest of the audience enjoyed ourselves wildly. This was at a time when the group Duran Duran was just starting its ascendancy into superstardom so the film added a bit of contemporaneous reality to its otherwise dated and quasi-surreal plot. Although it is considered a \\"camp classic\\" (a subjective term if there ever was one), it is very much a spot of fun and an enjoyable waste of time for anyone who needs an enjoyable waste of time. I am sure BluRay will do Barbarella just fine. I can hardly wait.
B004RE29WW|5.0|Ok, the movie is awesome. Love the first three. If a sequel was unnecessary it was Ressurection (part 4). The Blu-ray picture is really nice. Sound is ok. The theatrical version which runs at a brisk 114 minutes is awesome. The extended cut which runs at 144 minutes is not worth the time. It adds unnecessary scenes which bog down the movie and in one scene makes the warden look like a sympathetic dude instead of a scoundrel. It makes that crazy guy who went into the doctor's room with blood splattered all over his face look like a stupid crazy person instead of just a crazy person. Not good at all. Don't agree with some of the reviewers on here who say the Director's cut is better. It's worse but worth a viewing just to see the comparison. Anyway, I like having the first three instead of the Alien Quadrilogy which has many foldouts for 9 discs and the Alien Anthology which has the discs in slots. Although the uk import of the Alien Anthoogy has holders for the discs that look nice. I like owning the first three individually and that is how I will continue to own them. Just wish I didn't have to turn the sound way up to hear people talking on the Blu-ray.
B00068TJM6|3.0|Let me start with the basics:<br /><br />1.  The price and the quality of the watch are great.  I feel like it was a great value for the quality.<br />2.  The company shipped the watch SUPER fast.  I had it sooner than they promised which was great!<br /><br />Overall I would have given this company and this product 5 stars.<br /><br />The downside.  Unfortunately there was an issue with the alarm button.  It was stuck and wouldn't move, so we returned it.  The response from the company was swift and no questions asked.  The issue I had, was communication became non-existent.  I had to call and write to find out where my watch was.<br /><br />I asked for a replacement - and what they did wass ship it out to Seiko to check,instead of sending me a REPLACEMENT.  This was a birthday gift that I had to wait over a month to get back.<br /><br />In the end, the watch is fine and the birthday boy is happy.  That glitch in communication and deciding to send it for repairs lowers my rating.  It would have been faster for me to get a refund and reorder the watch.
B000089RVR|5.0|I don't have this cd yet.  I just ordered it because I like White Flag. I have Here With Me on a compilation cd. Thank You is a nice song to. In time Dido will release a complete hits cd and I'll have that one.

034580404X|5.0|After hearing from several friends (and their friends too) about how \\"great\\" this series is, I had to break down and read them.  It's a train wreck of a series, poorly written and it feels like the sex was thrown in to sensationalize the book (which, of course it did).  To me it read like a teenager wrote the books, with a lot of \\"holy *****\\" and some omg type inflections. That all being said, I couldn't put it down. It took me several chapters of the first book to even get into reading it, but by the time I was, I'd read all 26 chapters and wanted more. It kept me up til the early morning hours just reading because I just had to know what happened next. I have the ebooks, which were purchased all seperately (I didn't know that I would get so caught up in them or I would have just bought the trilogy at one click) and I fully intend to purchase the trilogy in paperback (yes excessive i know, but sometimes you just need the physical book as kindles and such are not allowed in some places, like where I work). Now I would have to agree with some of the reviewers that the kindle cost for the entire trilogy may be a little high, you're paying basically the same price for all three just as if you purchased them individually. Give the readers a discounted cost on purchasing an entire series that makes it worth buying them all at once, rather than individually (and this could go for any series).
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was a cool read from start to finish, I wouldnt say its Oscar award winning but it was entertaining. I recently seen coming soon Fifty Shades of Love The real Anastasia Steele, also i cant wait to read Fifty Shades Darker which i still havent read yet

B00116FT6M|3.0|For the most part, the film is pretty enjoyable. A story about a big girl who becomes the queen of teen society is endearing to all misfits, and I was surprised to find myself enjoying Zac Efron, after being over-exposed to the guy from his HSM fame.<br /><br />This film does have a couple things that I found irksome, however:<br /><br />1)John Travolta's casting. Enda has always been played to be very hefty and not at all attractive, which makes her transformation all the more shocking. But with Travolta...well, he's a very beautiful man already, so when Edna goes to clean herself up, it's like...\\"Eh,\\" was my reaction.<br /><br />2)Speaking of him, it seems like TPTB changed the plot to give him (and Christopher Walken by extension) more screen time, to the detriment of the story. The whole subplot of Mrs. Van Tussle trying to seduce Mr. Turnblad just felt so...forced.<br /><br />3)The Ending: I thought the original ending of Mrs. Van Tussle being offered to be the spokeswoman for AfroGlo in the musical (thus having to choose to show her bigotry if she were to decline) was funnier than her just being fired from the studio when she gets caught switching votes. And I say this as a black woman who loves seeing irony more than political correctness.<br /><br />Also, how the hell did they get rid of the \\"Cooties\\" song. The roach scene in the original movie was one of the most memorable scenes!<br /><br />On the plus, I liked Nikki Blonski and Amanda Brynes, and the musical numbers that were added into the movie added to the story they were going for (particularly, \\"The New Girl in Town,\\" as a nod to how many songs writing by Black artists were given to white singers to sell more records). And Queen LAtifah rocked it.<br /><br />Overall, if one hasn't seen the Broadway version, you'll not likely to be bothered by the changes they made. But even so, it's still worth watching.
B003L1ZXCU|3.0|I consider 3 stars to be a good score. This is a pretty fast read--one weekend should suffice. It started a bit slow for me. I wasn't really into it but after a few chapters I really began to like it. I especially enjoyed the elements of transhumanism scattered throughout the book. We really are evolving our minds and culture through technology. I'm looking for the leap forward. Are there more people dissatisfied than satisfied with our current economic and politic systems? Perhaps, but what would replace them? Communism was a terrible failure in every single test country. This novel will be liked by gamers, hackers, anarchists, transhumanists....or gaming hacking anarchist transhumanists. I'm looking forward to the next book that will hopefully answer the questions raised in the first book.<br /><br />I read that the film rights were purchased. I can definitely seeing this being made into a tv-movie, or even being turned into a tv show. The first book could cover 2 seasons.
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder is to screen writing what Robert Kiyosaki is to financial management; the information he gives isn't especially new, but it's constructed in new ways to give people the ability to connect the dots a bit better.<br /><br />One of the things he emphasizes is the importance of being able to sell yourself with a logline. The most important part of getting your film read is the one that many writers overlook until after they've written their story. It's an afterthough, really.<br /><br />Emphasizing structure is another one. Pointing out that the audience needs a relatable character to get into the story (even if the story isn't necessary about said character) is, again, something that some writers forget as well. Look at The Phantom Menace, for example. Whose story are we following there? That is the kind of incoherent mess that Synder wishes people to avoid when he offers up his beat sheet and the idea of using a board before writing a single word of your script.<br /><br />However, one of his better ideas is to reference movies that we're more familiar with...ones that we've probably seen in passing or at least heard of. Yeah, some movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca are artistic masterpieces, but...there's just movies! Using more modern examples helps to get people more connected and engaged.<br /><br />This, along with his other books (the third one, in particular) are great tools to have at the side of your desk.<br /><br />And as a final note to the skeptics out there who sneer at the fact that Snyder has two movies to his credit on screen,both of which ere not especially critic faves, think about this: a good many writers of other screenwriting books have sold...nothing. At all. Just...putting that out there.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The family has loved re-visiting all of the great Star Wars movie.  I would definitely recommend this set for your Star War's fan.
B002XZOZQA|2.0|I watched this in theater class years ago, and even without knowing how completely botched this film was from its original source, it grated on my nerves. Actually, the Cassie/Zach stuff grated. It should have been kept in the background like it was in the original production.<br /><br />The other numbers were okay, which is why I gave it two stars, but making this a romantic love story, as opposed to one about the love of art, really cheapens the film. Such a shame, really.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Real nice movie.  It was funny and at times a tear jerker.  I will recommend it.  Does anyone know what bird was flying before the man died?

B005LAIGRS|5.0|Hey, what can I say, its Denzel and no one can do action/suspense better than my brother.  Denzel played this part to the T and should be nominated for his role but I doubt it or maybe he will since his character is not clean cut and legal.  Highly recommend you had this one to your collection, especially if you enjoy watching him act as I do.

B0081KTI0E|1.0|I hated this movie, way too weird.  This may suit some of the deep thinkers but did nothing for me.  They kept jumping from scene to scene and nothing really tied in or brought out the plot.  Oh wait, there was no plot, that may explain why it was boring as hell.  A waste of good money, can I exchange it? lol

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The fact that this \\"trilogy\\" is sweeping the world in popularity says far more about the current state of the world that I care to know.

B0082JYAZ2|2.0|Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, \\"wow! she is really unique and awesome!\\"... then came her next record and I thought.... \\"hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it....\\" She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records... I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, \\"yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect...\\"
B005S9EJ14|4.0|There are plenty of detailed reviews here, so I will just be brief. This is a feel-good movie with a stellar cast set among the cacophony that is India. I smiled, and laughed through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again. I urged all my FB friends and more to make the time to see it. As I said in my title- Charming film!
B0083GOPSG|2.0|The whole movie was \\"shot\\" from one of the characters video camera, like the Blair Witch Project, and the video was very shaky. It made me feel dizzy at times. It was entertaining but I wouldn't pay for it.

B007N85ZXY|1.0|This is just plain bad. I've got no problem with Neil rockin' out with the technically challenged but spirited Crazy Horse, but this takes a possibly good idea, that is, covering some (mostly) iconic tunes from the American mythology and, with no insight, illumination or any sense of care or concern, just flogs them. Why bother? Maybe Neil had an inspiration to pull together these particular songs and give 'em a go, but Crazy Horse brings nothing to the proceedings except lunk-headed indifference. I'm not saying that this should have been a PBS precious, reverential museum piece, but Crazy horse were not the vehicle for this job. Hey, \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" is in my top 5 Neil albums, but for this project Neil bet on the wrong Horse.

B0000AUHOH|1.0|This was supposed to be the last Trek movie, thank God it wasn't. Rightfully so it has become known as Shatner's turn, since Leonard Nemoy had directed III, IV, they let Shatner direct V. Having researched alot of the behind the scenes politics of this movie, Shatner kind of got the shaft. I do like his original idea for the movie, of looking for God and finding the Devil instead. But alas, they trimmed his ideas down. I do agree that this movies is bad, I thought the running joke of the ship not working got old really really fast. The laughing Vulcan villain had possibilities, but like a previous reviewer said, he never really became scary. The only good part of the movie for me, was right after they run the shuttle into the ship, to escape the Klingons. Kirk and Sybock have alittle fight, with sybock grabbing Kirk by the throat, but stops when Spock points his gun at him. Kirk orders him to kill sybock, but he can't because Sybock is Spock's half brother. I also agree, that the crew doesn't act like themselves, except for Dr. Mccoy. We get a romance between Scotty and Uhura, Spock just kind of wanders a bit. Sybock is able to get the crew to follow him, by getting them to face their fears. Also a rouge Klingon is out there, again he is poorly used in the story. All I can say is this movie is a convoluted mess.
B003D513TQ|3.0|Having seen \\"Victoria and Albert\\" and loved it, and read a number of biographies of both the young queen and her husband -- and, importantly, a very good one of Melborne -- I was panting to see this film.  I was expecting a beautifully acted historically accurate costume drama.<br /><br />I got the costume drama.  They were stunning, and there is no question that it was lavishly filmed.  But this one doesn't deserve shelf space beside \\"Victoria and Albert\\" on any level.<br /><br />My first clue that this wasn't going to be a stellar experience came when I realized that the gorgeous eye candy who looked about 22 -- at most -- was actually supposed to be Lord Melborne.  I take nothing away from the young man's acting, because he certainly did one of the best jobs of any of the cast.  But I thought the person who selected him should be clapped into the Tower of London.  Melborne was old enough to be Victoria's father...almost, by not much of a stretch, her grandfather.  In no way ever was he a rival either for her hand or her heart.  She loved him dearly and he taught her to be a Queen but any suggestion of another relationship is ludicrous.  The reason for this peculiar piece of casting came later, when the twisted historical facts betan emerging.  If Melborne was actually an evil manipulator who created the Bedchamber Crisis (it was Victoria) and was a rival for Victoria's hand, then Mussolini is Santa Claus.<br /><br />Emily Blunt's job was, in my view, passable, and nothing more, but the guy who played Prince Albert went around throughout the film wearing a fixed expression that (when not in bed with his wife) suggested he'd fallen into a compost pile and stepped on a skunk while climbing out.  I'm afraid I found both of the key players wanting.  Conroy, on the other hand, was superbly cast...about the only actor I can say that for.<br /><br />If you want a gorgeous film with a virtually nonexistant plot that deals with historical fact as seriously as a guppy dealswith a bicycle, this is your film.  Otherwise, watch \\"Victoria and Albert.\\"  It was far better done on every level, and accurate.
B000083C49|1.0|I too am surprised at the glowing reviews of this movie, while the time travel theory isn't bad. The reason is, To save the whales. Really?!, Really?!, this is the only even numbered star trek Movie that isn't good. It opens up with an alien probe traveling through space, cutting the power of every ship and space station it passes. When it stops by earth, obviously it causes trouble. bringing storms, all the while giving off a sound, that no one can interpret. But, on Vulcan, Kirk and his merry band have decided to turn themselves in to the federation. Oh, i didn't mention the trial at the begining, where the Klingons want the federation to hold Kirk accountable for the death of the Klingons in the previous movie, despite the fact that those Klingons were violating there own rules. But I digress, on the way home, with Spock on board. They pick up the signal from earth, warning all ships to stay away. And they hear the probe, and Ding ding ding, spock figures out with a computer that it's a whale song, and now the movie reaches it's message, that because in the 80's we killed off all the whales. It becomes a saving the whales and the planet message, so much that cathrine hick's character while giving a tour, goes off on a tagent about whaling, and what whalers have done. And how bad those companies are, I understand what this movie was trying to do, but the execution of that story was bad. For example, after they rescue the whales from the villains of the story, the whalers. They go back to their time, crash the ship in the ocean set the whales loose. And they are able to communicate with the probe, and voila the probe is satisfied, and leaves. just like that, now at the end Kirk is reduced to captain. I do own this movie, and I have tried to like this movie. But, it badly misses the mark. Again, I know what they wanted to do. Buuuut, the execution left alot to be desired.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Reminds me of megaman and mirrors edge put together. Definitely worth playing and its free which makes it even better!
B00006G8HX|2.0|While I do own this movie, I do agree with a previous reviewer. That this movie shows why the odd numbered Movies are bad, now Nemoy can say what he wants. But he has been on record saying that he didn't want to come back and play Spock after \\"Wrath Of Kahn\\", but after seeing the success of Star Trek II. He decided to come back, and direct it. Problem is, Spock died at the end of II. But wait, he downloaded his \\"Cotra\\" into Mcoy's mind. That's not really the bad part of the movie, He had to put Klingons into the movie. Now having recently watched this movie, one thing I noticed. They weren't necessary to the story, they could've had Kirk after escaping space dock. Encounter the other ship at Genesis, instead of having the Klingons. Kirk could actually take on the federation, to get Spock's body back. But then you wouldn't have the death of his son, but honestly that character didn't really do anything in the movie, same with Saavick. This movie is sloooooooow, and even when you get to the end. The scene of Mccoy, and Spock on two different slabs, so they can transfere spock's mind back into his body to bring him back to life, is incredibley long. It's full of different angle shots of the priestess, raising and lowereing her head. Final word on the movie, not the worst. But it's not that good either, it's slow and tries to put too much into it.

0374203032|5.0|Since the publication of Justice in Japanese, Michael J. Sandel has great popularity in Japan. Applicants beyond expectation rushed to drawing lots wishing for 5,000 free tickets for his lecture at Tokyo International Forum in this May, which I could not cut in the queue. The contents he delivered on that day was featured in the article of the weekly magazine, Nikkei Business. Prof. Sandel repeatedly insisted to us that we need somehow to reconnect morals to market oriented societies. Even though overwhelmed by the encroachment power of markets, Prof. Sandel believes in the strength of public debates. He says our only hope of keeping markets in their place is to deliberate openly and publicly about the meaning of the goods and social practice we prize and deepen our discussion about the society in which we wish to live.<br />I, similarly with Prof. Sandel, worry about our current condition where market values govern our lives as never before and the facts we arrived here without any deliberate considerations. In the world where market norms push out non market norms, human relations will be thin and sharing a sense of place and civic pride will become no more than pipe dream. Until recently cultures and traditions have played some kind of role to put the brake on the growing power of market. However, economic globalization blurred those impact. Few years ago Japanese wouldn't understand some examples of corruption and unfairness Prof. Sandel pointed out in this book. We wouldn't take these things as our problems. We could attribute the reason to the difference of culture and nationality. Regret the reality of becoming similar situation in Japan.<br />Costs and benefits even took out of a feeling of nationality from us. London Olympic game begins in July. Japanese nationwide newspaper, Asahi, recently issued feature article of the Olympic game. They reported a Greek who had to sell his grandfather's medal for his family's making a living. A Japanese comedian recently changed his nationality to Cambodia only for the qualification as a marathon runner. They wrote about a Judo representative player of Principata e Shqipnis, who complained about her situation she couldn't participate in the game under her original Kosovo nationality. Meanwhile a Chinese female tennis player was reported as she said she didn't play for the nation. These episodes explain the meaning and original spirits of the Olympic game has been changed already. When the invasion of globalism advanced further, what would become our world? Our deep consideration is inevitable. This book would be a good chance to broach discussion among us.changed his nationality to Cambodia only for the qualification as a marathon runner.

1416583432|2.0|This book does contain some fascinating information about a dog's mind...but as many other readers have said, the book reads like a textbook.

It's unfortunate, because I really wanted to like this book.

0307887448|5.0|I can't really figure out exactly why this book grabbed me so hard - it just did. I no sooner finished reading it than I started all over and enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was just plain fun. I read several of the various negative reviews with puzzlement. Too bad for them is all I can say.<br /><br />As I try to analyze I see it has a likable, smart, sufficiently imperfect underdog trying to outsmart the bad guys, win the prize, and get the girl. Along the way there are some well thought out future world elements, genuine surprises, and decent character development. (Here I differ with some: I thought character development was well done - I cared about them) Lots of SF, movie, and computer references, most of which I recognized giving me an \\"insider\\" feel that probably put a bit of glow on the book. Sure there were plot holes but so well paved over with smoke and mirrors that I didn't care. Finally, the puzzles and solutions were believably difficult and were a major factor in my immediately re-reading the book. I think the level of intelligence in the puzzles and the whole Oasis concept were a big part of the book's fascination. Kudos to the author.<br /><br />A good story, well written, with enjoyable twists and a unique setting.<br /><br />FWIW:<br />I rarely re-read books at all. A few I have that spring to mind: Cryptonomicon, The Vorkosigan series by Bujold, Islandia by Wright (6 times). Also overwhelmed by James Joyce's Portrait... before I had any idea who he was - and spent a summer reading various classics - so I claim a fair degree of literacy.<br /><br />I'm  well into getting social security but grew up using and programming computers and being fascinated by them and their sometimes scary potential.

159448385X|5.0|I recently read Kite Runner and I must say that I had my doubts that Husseini could ever top it. I think he did with this one!<br />This one is a little more raw and painful, but I loved the timeline leading up to modern Afghanistan. It's terrifying what happens to citizens of countries while their governments sort things out. The citizens were forced to choose lesser evils in the name of simply staying alive. What a resilient group of people!<br />I've always found it odd how so many cultures throughout history have treated women so horribly when the are truly the givers of life. War and the Taliban are hard to swallow in this book, but the constant mistreatment of the women was almost unbearable.<br />This is a great book and I would recommend it to everyone.

B00785P2QC|3.0|The fundamental problem with these in app purchase games is that they usually say purchases aren't necessary yet the games are designed to be SO slow and boring without purchases as to become unplayable.  Why not offer a choice?  An all inclusive,  traditonal &quot;pay once&quot; app at a premium (like the Sims app) for those who choose not to play in app purchase games- and then the &quot;free&quot; game option,  for those who do.  As it stands,  I will be deleting this game soon.  Great potential but tedious unless you pony up.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't pay money for this \\"book\\". It's just Twilight fan-fiction that you can read for free on the internet. (I have nothing against fan fiction, I have read several that I really like.) Anyway I really tried to read the whole thing but I only made it about 40% of the way through. The characters are horrible and the book is soooo boring. Whenever I see a display full of these books at a retail store I just laugh. This is what women like to read? Books with no plot and utterly stupid main characters? I don't understand how anyone could say they love the romance in this book. There isn't any!
B007YQAYDG|5.0|Most blogs I've read are describing Michael Kiwanuka's sound and voice as a combination of soul and rootsy folk, and I concur.  The opening song on the album didn't really grab me at first. I thought it was going to be another Motown modern wannabe, but hang in there ~ the 2nd song, \\"I'm Getting Ready\\" is wonderful and then the 3rd song, \\"I'll Get Along\\" sold me on the entire project.  I spent the rest of the evening playing acoustic guitar along with Michael Kiwanuka.  This album is now on my top 5 \\"Best of 2012\\" list. I recommend you take time-out from some of the pop drivel out there and give Michael's \\"real art\\" sooth your brain cells.  Now back to the guitar.  Enjoy the '.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy read and very addictive! There has been a lot of critism about this series but I really don't understand why.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|i have installed this app two different ways and yet i still can not get it to open!? little help?
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Gilmore Girls are the perfect companion while I workout!  Funny, uplifting, and in general good story lines. Nice way to start the day.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|I've never seen Ryan Reynolds in this type of role before and I must say...he did very well with it.  The movie has lots of action packed sequences plus a story concept that holds your interest...all making for a great movie.  Denzel, as always, does a great job of working a character who is complex and intense.  Take the time to watch Safe House, you will not be disappointed.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved it. The show follows the book so well.  The characters are so well portrayed. My favorite is the Imp, I love his sarcasism and attitude.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great 3 book series but the quality fell off a little with each book.  I would rate the first book as Great, the second one as  Very Very Good and the last book as Very Good. I thought the last book was a little slow in comparison to the first two.  BUT - I would recommend this series without reservation.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Katy Perry songs remind me of silly 80s pop and I LOVE IT!  Her songs make me smile when I listen to them.  Fun to listen to at the gym.  Also like to check out her music videos because they are usually fun and she is pretty hot!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|In the words of Simon Cowell this is \\"bloody awful!\\" Like many other reviewers I cannot believe this is written by someone over the age of 16, let alone someone close to my own age. The plots of all 3 books in this trilogy could fit on an index card (an observance of a friend of mine). The frustrating part - why didn't I think of this? Why didn't I just throw together all the sexual fantasis I could conjur up in my mind and pour it into a badly written book and earn millions?? The hype for these books is rediculous. I can only assume the women I know who gush about the love story between the two characters have never read anything better than a harlequin romance. This author's 15 minute of fame are turning out to be extremely lucrative. I gave it two stars solely for the use of handcuffs and scarves. Don't waste your time or money.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|just as good as a console game. I own the ps3 version and this is a great companion. I recommend this to anyone who is a spiderman fan.

B008CLI3TE|1.0|On 2nd set of BD and they just won't play.  Amazon was great with sending a replacement but the new set is just like the 1st, it doesn't work.  My Blu Ray player works fine with all of my other movies, but I can't get past 25 min. on the 1st disk of this series without it freezing, jeking and then totally stopping.  I've updated my player, reconnected it all and now I think it's just the coding in the Game of Thrones.
0740797719|5.0|I'm primarily a sculptor but I've always enjoyed painting.  I bought Color and Light because both are areas of painting I've had a lot of trouble with, especially since I have no formal art education beyond a couple highschool classes. I've never been quite able to grasp color theory and paint mixing in a way that I was able to apply to my work until I picked up this book. The amount of information packed into Color and Light is amazing, I'm still trying to absorb all of it.<br /><br />The book is written primarily for oil painters, though Gurney also touches on watercolor, however if you work on other color mediums don't think that this book won't help you. The paint mixing information can quite easily be translated to acrylics, and the information on color theory and light is universal so it doesn't matter if you work in digital, color pencil, or pastels.
B0085776BG|4.0|Shipping was efficient and fast.  Movie was pretty good with lots of action.  It followed the story line of the Tuskegee Airman.  Not sure the German ACE that went up against them could have qualified for the 109s and 262s though.

B0086700CM|5.0|this app is the bomb I have it on my ipod and my iphone and on my kindle I like it when it starts to go really fast and there's nothing wrong with it
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|I had to stop watching and walk away. I was very disappointed, I was expecting so much more. SInce the Oscar was won. Sorry, it was a very undeserving win. I am upset with the voters for making me think the movie was worth watching. It was disjointed, slow and hard to follow. It was a waste of an opportunity to show why she was the Iron Lady, all I saw was a sad confused alone woman, who talked to her dead husband, whom we had a hard time following was not there. Do not waste your time or money watching this bomb. Shame on the academy for giving this movie any Oscars, I wil not believe them any longer. It was for the actress, not the role or movie
044024630X|5.0|I picked this book up at a church book sale and I could not put it down.  It is the first Jack Reacher novel that I have read but it will not be my last.  I enjoyed the characters very much and that is what it takes to keep me involved.  On a personal level, I can not see 5'7\\" Tom Cruise as the 6'5\\" 250 lb. Jack Racher,  that will be quite a reach for him.  It is facinating to see how he assesses each situation and how he gets out of tight places.  I am going to start reading #1 through 16.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best book I have read in at least 3 years. Amazing deal for $6. I can't believe its so cheap. Its worth $20 at least. Highly recommend to any sci-fi or post apocalyptic fan. I loved it. I hope Hugh keeps writing. More! I want more!<br />5 stars all the way!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|When I first heard this album, it took a few listens to before I really liked it. I think the song \\"Bully\\" soured me on it, because to me that song sounds like made for radio crap.But you keep listening and there are a couple tracks on this that just get completely stuck in your head. For the last two weeks I constantly catch myself humming tunes from this album without even really realizing it.<br /><br />The second song - \\"bully\\" - does  sound like generic-made-for-radio crap-rock. But, honestly - thats the only one. that leaves 11 other tracks that really kick ass. And kick ass they do, from pumped up tunes like \\"Adrenaline\\" or \\"enemies\\" - then you come across this song \\"I'm not alright\\" - which musically doesnt really sound like anything I've ever heard from Shinedown. I cant tell for sure whats going on with this song - but theres a strong hint of what sounds like trumpets going on in the background that work absolutely amazing with some loud guitars and Brents trademark vocals. Combine that with what sounds like an electrified mandolin, some piano , great lyrics - all in all = Really cool - definitely my favorite song on the album. That song leads into \\"Nowhere kids\\" - solid.  Miracle and \\"i'll follow you\\" are slower songs , the latter really emphasizing Brents vocal talents - this guy can sing. I would put his voice up there against any tenor in rock - seriously! Song # 10 is another one of those songs where it grows on you, it took a few listens but before you know it, you're humming it under your breath without even realizing it. More killer vocals from Brent on this song as well.<br /><br />if you're a shinedown fan - you will probably like this album. Its definitely not their worst, and some of the songs are amazing - \\"i'm not alright\\" could be on repeat for an hour!
B00846REIS|5.0|I read fifty shades and I was thoroughly disgusted.  I was completely let down.  I loved the idea behind the writing.  a guy with dark secrets that leaves him damaged and skillful in the bedroom?  what is not to love.  But i was just let down by the way everything was laid out and handed to me in a cute little bow.  enough of that though, this is about bared to you.  i'm not here to bash.  i'm here to say that i was happy with this purchase! so happy in fact, i bought the paperback for my mother-in-law the next day because she is a big fan of fifty.  the discription was great.  the wording was perfect, and made me feel like i could be Eva.  i felt the anger she felt, i felt the fear.  The way that this novel was executed was immaculant.  The first steamy scene left me tingling all because i got to know the main character.  The author didn't just say 'i loved him'.... you knew by her actions and it was a wild ride to say the least.  the ending left me begging for more.  i'll be in line for the next book.  i'm an instant fan of this series!
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|They have to make more games!  LOVE THIS and TOTALLY ADDICTIVE.  I have been late for work playing it in the car.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|The movie arrived on time and in a very safe package.  The movie plot was interesting and kept my attention.  This movie had wonderful action and adventure.  And some comedy to keep me looking for more.<br />The actors where very good. I am glad I purchased the movie and would reccomend it to others.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is wonderful !!!  You just can't put it down, it keeps you on your toes from beginning to end.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is very fun, it can be hard sometimes but it is fun to hang out with friends in all.this game should be five stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Ever since it became a Free App of the Day, I haven't stopped playing it ever since. But my main concern is the Open Feint. It bothers me everytime I go into this game. But, nevertheless, this game is as good as gold. No regrets.
1401937268|5.0|I gave this deck five stars due to the beautiful imagery.  Yes, as others have said, the cards are quite large making shuffling a bit difficult; but over all this deck resonates well with me.  The only issue I had was that there was one missing card, the Five of Water.  I have returned the deck for a replacement.  So it might be wise to go through the deck one card at a time to check for missing cards.
0307278255|2.0|I could not drag myself past page 50. Every page seemed so leaden, with the convenience of plot the main drive, rather than anything real or interesting.<br /><br />I believe that this sort of storyline of hidden family secrets and immigrant experience has been drained of all originality. These stories aren't bad, they're just not new. And that doesn't keep me reading.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Frankly&hellip;I was skeptical at first. But it turned out to be perfect. There were so many features I wasn't expecting&hellip;like all the different texts to choose from and the excellent audio.  Five stars!<br /><br />***UPDATE*** It is WAY to difficult to get this bible to work offline. I now recommend the bibles by Tecarta.

0812550757|4.0|While \\"Ender's Game\\" was good (see my other review if you're bored), this sequel is outstanding.<br /><br />This novel is the rare occasion when a revisit outshines the original. The characters have much more depth. The story seems emotionally charged. The complexity of the plot is wondrous at times. Yet what really raised the book to a new level was the thought and detail put into alien culture clash.<br /><br />The only drawback was the science part ... meh. A bit too convenient, I thought. But the fiction part is well written indeed.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|OMG THIS IS SO FREAKIN DUMB!!! I DONT WANT TO INSTAL AN UPDATE BECAUSE I DONT WANT MORE DAMAGE TO MY DEVICE. PLEASE DONT GET THIS AND PLEASE FIX I HAD IT BEFORE AND IT WAS FINE NOW......
0547572298|2.0|I ran into the same problem with this sci-fi novel as I do with all of PKD's works...the idea is great, the actual process of reading his writing is torture.<br /><br />I find his sentence structure, word choice, point-of-view, and actually every else to be so clunky. His style is like being hit over the head with a sopping wet blanket.<br /><br />Yes, his ideas are great. But in the end, his novels are not worth my time.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|All plastic, but pretty durable.  I have put this thing through some hell and it is still holding up!  Eats batteries though, but other than that you cannot beat $30 for this when the next cheapest tuner pedal is $100.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|I rented this movie since it went on .99 special and I had heard so many good things about it. It has a lot of potential but I felt like the pace was a little uneven. It was indeed interesting, however I found myself drifting at some parts, especially the first half of the movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game was super fun but I just think it would be cool if you could buy acorns with the points you earn. At the end I had over 4.000.000 points and couldn't do anything else unless I bought acorns with real money.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The video is an adaptation of the first of Edgar Rice Burroughs books on John Carter, and his adventures on Mars, or Barsoom as the natives call it.These natives include the humanoid red Martians, four armed Green Martians and the shape shifting Therns,an elder race whose default appearance resembles a more august version of Uncle Fester from the Addams family. It was interesting to try to keep track of the names of the people and places. Despite the complex settings, it is simply the story of a brave warrior (John Carter, played by Taylor Kitsch), rescuing a Princess (Dejah Thoris, played well by Lynette Collins) from an evil Warlord( Sab Than, played loutishly by Dominic West). As usual in this kind of movie, both heroes and villains have their entourages of sidekicks and henchmen, although in this case, it is Sab Than who is a pawn of the inscrutable Thern.<br /> Because so many others have drawn inspiration from these novels over the past century, from Flash Gordon through Star Wars, much of it seems familiar,like a book one read long ago. You might say that watching this movie gives one a sense of 'Dejah' vu.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Loved the season love the show! Can't wait for the next to come out on dvd! Can't get enough! Its a must see for anyone who likes television drama.
B004V9MU86|5.0|'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak is no doubt the best book that I have ever read. I would recommend it to any adult (as long as they are prepared to cry- a lot!). The concept of the book is so interesting, as it is set in Nazi Germany and is narrated by 'death'. Most people tend to have a mixture of confusion and intrigue on their face when I mention this fact, hence the interesting and original concept. It doesn't sound like the most appealing book when trying to describe it as you cannot say much without giving it away. The only thing to do is ask that person to trust you when you say it is one of the best books to read.<br />The style of the writing is what makes this book so wonderful. There is a huge amount of use of imagery, metaphors, similes and alliteration.<br />I urge every adult out there to read this book. It is one you will never forget!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing this game. Everyday Iplay it and it is so much fun. I think it is a good price.I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0029XFN8A|5.0|After all the bad press, The Girl Next Door (all the lead actors and story) exceeded my expectations. I began watching with lower expectations as I thought it was going to be a simple-minded teen-comedy and semi-exploitation flick. It turned out, however, to be a much better than average \\"accidental\\" love story about a girl escaping a bad choice and making a new start and a boy, that never strayed from his straight and narrow path in life, being smacked (like a car wreck) into rising to the occasion, well above what would have been his below average, nerdy life. Within minutes of when the new girl next door arrives and begins to move her stuff in the house, it starts a roller coaster ride for the boy next door that left me laughing and remembering days gone by and the choices we made. It is the story of a fallen angel redeemed pushing a very bright young man to levels way above and beyond what he would have ever known without her.<br /><br />Beside the great chemistry and acting between the leads of Emile Hirsch as Matthew Kidman and Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle, the film is also buoyed by the fantastic supporting roles of Timothy Olyphant as the quirky, charming and snakelike porn producer, Kelly (outstanding role, well done Tim!) as well as Matthew's nerdy, \\"tripod\\" team of friends played by Chris Marquette's Eli and Paul Dano's Klitz were all very good. I even loved James Remar in the role of porn king Hugo Posh --nicely done.<br /><br />There is some of the typical high school drama/tension between the popular jocks and the math club nerds. It is stereotyped but was realistic enough portrayal of that tumultuous, confused, disturbed, inclement, restless, riotous, roaring, rough, stormy, swirling, tempestuous, thunderous, time of life that I remember from my life. I also loved the standout buildup to the twisty climax in the end when Danielle's support team, her bubbly ex-coworkers, steps up and helps out D in her time of need. This movie gave me a new meaning for the term \\"moral fiber\\". Directing (Luke Greenfield) and editing (Mark Livolsi) are consistent and excellent as were the song choices and placement. The song placements were so well done it was like almost a music video at times which makes the eclectic soundtrack a standout.<br /><br />I think the film was unfairly slammed for the porn plot element that is demonized yet pervasive in our society.<br /><br />JCEthe term \\"moral fiber\\".

0307744434|5.0|The Night Circus has become my favorite book. I yearned to be there and fell in love with the characters. I pray that Baz Luhrmann directs the movie- he would do the whimsical, playful Night Circus justice, just as I saw it in my head.
B007V508CC|5.0|I am a music freak--I love all types of music; attended the National Music Camp (Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan) in the summers growing up (playing piano & violin) & have been friends with the Rolling Stones since the mid- 80's, especially Mick Jagger; so I speak with a great passion about music and understanding of music.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of Maroon 5 & Adam Levine and past albums of theirs have been very good....and some terrific singles along the way. This album is their best, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Most CD's one buys, there are a few songs on it that you'd just as soon not hear---and a few GREAT songs you want to play over and over again.<br /><br />THIS album is filled with winners---each & every song! The first time I can actually say that about a CD---it is that good. Not one loser---all winners, each & every tune. I am amazed. You will be too. Sure, Payphone is heard alot on the radio, but other songs on this CD are just as good--you'll hear.<br /><br />So, get it, kick back and enjoy one of the great albums to hit in a long, long time. Thanks Maroon 5----you really did it.<br />High 5 via email.
0525478817|5.0|I was given this book as a gift and read it within two days. I fell in love with the characters and felt the storyline provided a more honest portrayal of youth surviving cancer. Such a great read! I would recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining, heart warming story.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|I enjoyed the book but about 50% into in I couldn't believe that Abby actually wanted to still be with Travis. As her ex said he's a \\"psychopath.\\" It was not at all romantic or attractive that he beat the crap out of anyone who looked at her.  He was not defending her honor, he's just a hothead who can't control his temper. I'm not even finished with the book yet but I'm finding it so hard to finish because I'm so disappointed in her for wanting to be with him. Yes she loves him but he is way too intense and possessive. That kind of life is dangerous and no women should want that. I like reading books with bad boys but Travis doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. I think that writing a character like Travis sends the wrong message to women reading it. He needs anger management or something. They spent so much time together at the very beginning of their relationship by living together that I think it doomed them from the start. She's the only girl he's ever dated or loved so of course within 5 minutes he's saying he can't live without her and tattooing her name on his arm. This \\"love\\" story is just completely crazy and unhealthy.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|enjoyed game- nothing fancy just straight foreword and easy to use. I think this is appropriate for all ages. Pleased I got this for free.
1609611543|4.0|The first part of this book encouraged me to do \\"without bread\\", and the weight loss reported by patients was exciting and gave me incentive to give it a try. So I immediately tossed my supply of bread, crackers, macaroni, and (my beloved) brownies.  For years, I've had the habit of going through McDonald's drive-thru for a morning sausage biscuit, so it wasn't easy to pass it and go straight to the office. I started this on Friday and since I have a full-time job and I don't eat snack foods, workdays are not that hard to do. I think my biggest challenge was not having toast with my weekend breakfasts.<br /><br />Now for my revelation.  When I got to the last half of the book, I learned I was expected to not only eliminate bread, but all packaged, processed, canned, or frozen foods!  Whoa up here, I am not prepared to do all that, I'm in an office 8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week, and I have to have some convenience foods!! I don't have time to shop for fresh meats and produce every day, and living in the Texas heat, I only bake in the winter months!  While grocery shopping, I learned ALMOST everything you buy in the store HAS WHEAT! Even chicken rice soup! Why, I thought, would they put wheat in chicken rice soup??  A good friend hit it right on the head, when she said, \\"they use wheat as a filler\\".  Well, guess what I've determined?  BREAD IS A FILLER!!  Bread makes you feel full!!<br /><br />I am now resolved to the fact I cannot (will not) go totally wheat-free; first of all, I don't have to as I am not allergic to it, and I will not do without my packaged sliced turkey or Rice Chex cereal.  I fully intend to continue eating as wheat free as possible, within reason (I am on Day 6 of bread free).<br /><br />Now for the reason I rated the book with 4 stars. I felt deceived when I learned I was expected to go on an Atkins type diet instead of just eliminating bread. I see the reason he throws this at you so late in the book, because if I had read it early on, I wouldnot have considered doing anything at all.  Let me tell you that just eliminating bread is not only a huge change in habit, its a huge mental challenge as well.  You must plan what you're going to eat and prepare for it because there won't be a piece of bread to fall back on as your FILLER.  I will return to this review in 30 days and let you know what physical changes I've had as a result of simply eliminating bread (and obvious wheat-laden products).<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER 30 DAYS WHEAT-FREE:  Pounds Lost: 4.5;  Inches Lost: 2 in waist; 2 in abdomen and 1 in bust.  I honestly do not know if this loss was from going wheat-free or if it was from my workout regime at a new health club. But I've decided that if a person is not gluten-sensitive, then why do this?  I found myself turning to sodium-laden products in search for a wheat substitute and that's as bad or worse than eating wheat.  A co-worker tried it for 2 weeks and actually GAINED weight, because he was substituting the wheat/bread calories with other high caloric foods.  I'm glad I gave it a try, for I did manage to kick the morning biscuit habit along with cakes, donuts, cookies, brownies and pies. I've come to the conclusion that the old common tried and true is best:  eat all things in moderation, drink lots of water and exercise (sigh), darn it!

Netflix only has it on Blueray, and bestbuy/local movie rental doesn't have it at all. my friend lended his copy to me.<br /><br />I literally just gost finished watching it like 3 mins ago.<br />First of all, this movie is more of a Zombie movie then a vampire flick. but i love both genres so either way i was going to like this movie.<br />as you know, it follows the lives of a young man of about 15 years old, and a 30-40 something year old man who saves him when his family is attacked and killed; the boy's rescuer teaches him how to defend himself and kill vampires of which there are a few mutated versions (some have a thicker breast platelike rib cage and therefore are harder to kill, while others are the typical running around zombiesque like vampires that look like zombies but simply have fangs...) anyways they meet people and lose people (typical journey story line) come into contact with non vampire foes (if you  have READ the \\"Walking Dead\\" series (the T.V. show really hasn't touched base on that sort of stuff yet), then this movie closely resembles the actions and \\"civilization\\" of humans during the aftermath of a plague, especially reminding me of \\"The Govenor\\" in the middle to later books of \\"The Walking Dead\\".)<br /><br />ok, so with all that said here are the things i enjoyed about the movie (followed with a list of my gripes):<br />I liked how realistic the characters are, the writing moves along slowly but is believable. The characters are told more through their actions rather then dialogue; which i really appreciated. the sound was incredible and made me jump sometimes more than actually seeing the monsters. the boy comes in contact with some girls around his age, and though you can tell that both parties are interested they don't don't make it sappy/mushy... in fact it was actually quiet nice to see how innocent and youthful they were around each other (considering that nowadays you see teens acting way beyond their years in movies, books, and TV shows)<br /><br />it was nice to not have a twisted storyline, Hollywood tries too hard to wrap things up in a nice bow at the end, or toss in some plot twist, and though this one did have a tiny bit of that it really was more bearable. overall this was a great movie, which is good to wash the taste of the $10.00 i spent seeing that P.O.S movie \\"Lincoln the Vampire Killer\\"...<br /><br />but i digress...<br /><br />onto my gripes:<br />1. the vampires were borderline funny-looking.  think \\"sunken eye sockets with the use of dark face paint\\" lots of dark makeup and fake blood, and torn clothes to hide the human-like qualities of the actors/vampires. i'm sure they blew their budget on the fangs you get at Halloween Express during the holiday, but well, the vampires looked more like the kind of \\"Extras\\" zombies you would see on a studio set in California... not to rip on the topic too much, but it really was one of my ONLY major complaints, so i have to spend a little more time on it...<br />2. the barter of goods, in this movie you will see bartering of goods like antibiotics for services and merchandise. although i really liked that they showed that in this movie. i did not like the currency level of some of the things... (and now i really am just nit-picking but hear me out) in one scene the old man takes the young boy to a make-shift doctor in a ravished yet semi-civilized town, the boy receives a check up and as payment the old man gives the doctor two bottles of prescription meds (I'm assuming antibiotics) but in another scene the old man barters 1 bottle of antibiotics, a bag of weed, and a couple of trophy kills (fangs) that he plucked off some Zombies... opps i mean vampires.. for, get this.... a bottle of alcohol!<br /><br />really??? a bottle ofantibiotics and a bag of weed? those two things would be harder to come by to a closed off town like that, even my husband commented on how that would have been enough to barter for a car (I'm thinking more like a room for the night) but you know.. whatever<br /><br />3. The movie chugged along at a steady pace, and that was fine and all, but it someitmes left a lot of moments were the storyline just seemed to kind of falter and become dry.<br />4. (and finally) this won't be a surprise to you by now, but the zombie make-up... i mean -- \\"Vampire\\" -- Make-up, was lacking in creativity and seemed to bring the style of the movie down quite a bit..<br /><br />aside from my pet peeves, which really didn't sway my intrigue for the movie much, i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone searching for a plague/aftermath/zombie movie (I really can't say \\"vampire\\" movie because my conscious just can't lie to you guys like that...)antibiotics and a bag of weed? those two things would be harder to come by to a closed off town like that, even my husband commented on how that would have been enough to barter for a car (I'm thinking more like a room for the night) but you know.. whatever<br /><br />3.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|Bought this a while back for my wife to have something to lug her new laptop around in without having to have a messenger bag or briefcase style case. Fits everything she uses for her computer with plenty of room to spare. Laptop is a 17.3\\" HP and fits in the laptop pocket with no problem. The power supply and mouse fit neatly in two of the many smaller zippered pockets. Keeps everything organized and secure.<br /><br />I was wondering if the overengineered handle was a gimmick, but having hefted her bag when full of computer and other stuff (and my equivalent bag, that has to fit an 18\\"+ laptop with college books without the heavy-duty handle) that massive wire handle is reassuring. You just know that that's going to hold, no matter how heavy the bag seems. If I ever have to replace my bag I'm going to go looking for a larger version of this.<br /><br />The heavy-duty handle, the anti-shock padding, and the sturdy exterior have all already proven themselves under trying conditions. She managed to accidentally roll her bag off our front steps and behind a holly bush. I got the job of fishing it out. I had to reach in with the handles of a set of pruning shears because of the holly, and the heavy duty handle allowed me to drag the bag out more easily than I expected.<br /><br />I dreaded what might have happened to the laptop inside, but despite the bouncing around the bag got the exterior was completely unscathed and it protected the laptop inside beautifully. That isn't to say it's going to defeat a horde of angry gnomes with sledgehammers, but for every-day bumps and thumps it's great protection.<br /><br />And since the bag doesn't really look like a computer case, it's a bit of extra concealment for those times she has to leave it in her car.

B0088TG252|3.0|Lots of action here but it is relentless and very loud. Everyone is killing everyone else just about every minute. I was very disappointed. There are a few familiar faces along the way - Rueben Blades for one and the handsome detective from The Killing. I really don't recommend this one unless you just want to pass the time with relentless gun shots, car crashes and your neighbor asking you to turn down the volume.

1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a different sort of book, chiefly because it is narrated by a teenaged autistic boy. I thought Haddon did an excellent job of maintaining the voice. While the technique was effective, it also was limiting in how richly the characters could be fleshed out. Christopher seemed to be able to recognize happy, sad, mad and confusion, but subtler emotions were impossible for him to recognize much less write about. This book is supposedly the product of a school project. He recounts how a he finds a neighbor's dog killed, and after being accused himself of the killing, seeks to find the real culprit. While his investigation eventually does find the real killer, he also discovers a lot of other things he didn't know were hidden. This is a short book and worth the time. Just as Christopher was somewhat detached from the people and things around him, I often felt the same way. Interested, but a bit detached. Still, a departure from the norm made it a thumbs up from me.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This movie strikes me as being poignant when least expected.  The overlying story is predictably terrifying in many respects; yet the survival and perhaps redemption of the cast of characters is always slightly out of reach.  Nonetheless, they find solace, or so we hope, in their end-of life recollections of the ones whom they love.  The movie's finest scenes are found in its expression of how people can reach out to respect and honor others in their last moments.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|The cover has some problems with the artwork, but no buggy.<br />It's still a great product, it's a shame that the original soundtrack was not included on the dvd, but, once again, no complaint about that.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I'm somewhat of an indie rock snob.  By all accounts, I should hate this stuff; Del Rey has really taken a beating from critics and journalists everywhere.  She is an unfortunate case of a star who just got too big too quickly.  The indie-rock crowd was hoping for an \\"authentic\\" artist who would represent their interests in pop music.  The pop crowd was hoping for safe, radio-friendly music.  Del Rey's BORN TO DIE doesn't really reach either of those points, but instead, it falls somewhere in the middle.  I think Lana Del Rey has been the victim of bad marketing -- if she was initially marketed as a pop chanteuse, she wouldn't have received so much backlash.  This album is wonderful!  BORN TO DIE is a dash of jazzy cabaret, trip-hop electronic beats, indie-rock instrumentation, and pop songwriting.<br /><br />When you take away the moodiness, the attitude, the multi-layered vocals, it's obvious that there is fantastic songs here.  I think what has put some people off is that these songs (which are at their core, very melodic and catchy) are dressed up in multiple levels of production.  This production is what led to the infamous SNL performance; people were rooting for the singer to fail, and in some ways she did.  Her music is very much a product of a studio, and if you remove it from that context, you can't expect it to translate perfectly.  Speaking just for her album, though, I give credit to Del Rey, her songwriters and producers; the music here is multilayered and tasteful.  You can listen to songs over and over and still find new things.  The first four tracks of the album in particular (\\"Born to Die,\\" \\"Off to the Races,\\" \\"Blue Jeans,\\" and \\"Video Games\\") showcase a fantastic accessibility.  Sometimes the attitude gets in the way: in \\"Off to the Races,\\" Del Ray sings like she is a gangster.  \\"Dark Paradise\\" laments the passing of a lover, and even though the singer claims to wish to die, there is interesting, emotional stuff at work here.  The album ends with \\"This is What Makes Us Girls,\\" which feels like a strange way to end BORN TO DIE -- it doesn't quite match the theme of the album in my opinion.<br /><br />BORN TO DIE has been one of the surprise albums for me this year.  It is way better than it should be, but it's hard to know who to recommend this album to.  If you are at the least bit curious, I would suggest sampling the album.  Even if you've been turned off by the maligned SNL performance or the scathing reviews that critics gave her earlier in the year.  Highlights to sample/download: \\"Blue Jeans,\\" \\"Video Games,\\" \\"National Anthem,\\" or \\"Off to the Races.\\"<br /><br />Additional release information:  [[ASIN:B006ZS81GG Born To Die (Deluxe Version) [+Digital Booklet]]].  The deluxe edition of the album comes with three additional bonus tracks.  These songs \\"Without You,\\" \\"Lolita,\\" and \\"Lucky Ones,\\" are quite good, but not as good as those on the album.  I would sample these before buying either version.\\"This is What Makes Us Girls,\\" which feels like a strange way to end BORN TO DIE -- it doesn't quite match the theme of the album in my opinion.<br /><br />BORN TO DIE has been one of the surprise albums for me this year.

I wish I could get my my money back about 10 minutes into it, and then after watching the whole thing I wanted that amount of my life back.

0399159029|3.0|Bernie Gunther is a 'tough-talking' detective in the American novel mode but I do not get a sense of him as being what a German police officer of his time might be.  I get a strong sense of modern 'political correctness' in the way Kerr describes his dogged insistence on German War Guilt and I feel that while the historical characters recruited into this novel were every bit as bad as Bernie keeps saying they were, that the polemics slow the story.  Otherwise, this reads as a police procedural and more attention should be focused on the 'chase.'  I also don't find that the author is believable or consistent in the way the 'soiled Angel' dame meets Bernie.  There are long stretches of the narrative where she is kept waiting in a hotel room for the author to bring her back onstage.  The 'romance thing' doesn't work for me in this tale.<br /><br />What I do like is the 'weekend in the country' scene of NAZI officers celebrating General Heydrich's elevation to the rule of Bohemia and Moravia.  The internal workings of the house and staff seem believably realized and are brought into play well in contributing to Bernie's police investigation.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|When Catherine meets Lee, she feels like she hit the lottery.  He is everything a woman could want, smart, caring, sexy, and totally crazy about her.  Totally crazy.  But soon, totally crazy becomes completely obsessive and possessive, and eventually abusing.  Catherine is lucky to have escaped, and her experience pushes her deep into the world of obsessive compulsive disorder.  When she learns the Lee is being released from prison, her fears begin to take over her life and color her reality.  So what is true, what is real, and who is to be trusted?<br /><br />I have always contended that the scariest stories of all contain no supernatural monsters; instead, the scariest stories are those about the monstrous sides of mankind.  This book is a prime example.  This book was completely riveting in every single aspect.  First off, I loved the character of Catherine.  She is so  much stronger than she realizes, and I enjoyed seeing her grow through her journey.  It was also quite interesting to me to watch her open herself back up to others, learning once again how to relate to the world and people around her.  I found her thought processes fascinating, and have to admit at times I was unsure if her version of reality was the truth.<br /><br />Similarly, I loved the storytelling in this novel.  For a large portion of the book, we switch time frames from Catherine's past relationship with Lee to her present dealings with all the fallout.  I found this to be a very helpful storytelling technique, and it helped keep the timeline straight for me.  Often the improper use of this technique can confuse the story, but in this case it is very well done.  I found myself feeling terrorized at a few points in the book, the fear and the darkness was that beautifully conveyed.  Through all the terror, I was unable to stop reading.  In a word, I was hooked.<br /><br />Steadfast readers of thrillers will like it, though may find it a bit predictable.  As an occasional reader of thrillers, however, I simply loved it.  While not the most original storyline, it was well written and engaging.  I think it certainly will have mass appeal, and makes for a great summer read., however, I simply loved it.

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Many thanks to Amazon for the recommendation of The Lumineers self-titled album that I received in my email inbox a few months ago. Even though I realize the solicitation was nothing more than the product of an automated mathematical algorithm: \\"based on his past purchases, there is 95% probability that he will purchase The Lumineers\\". It's really OK because I like math too. If it wasn't for that email, I may still be fumbling around in the dark searching for something new to fulfill my musical appetite.<br /><br />Well, let me say I am acoustically satisfied. This album is like a smorgasbord of edible melodies, cooked up just right to be ingested by your ears, but digested by your soul. This stands in stark contrast to much of today's music; that which is manufactured for fleeting infatuations of money, ego, glamour, and PC issues. The true beauty is in the simplicity of the tunes - which offers a type of contentment - perfectly placed in the history of time for an insatiable culture overwhelmed by the plethora of information at its fingertips, and practically begging for a return to its traditional roots.<br /><br />From Jeremiah's choppy percussion which includes, but is not limited to, the legendary hand clap - to the haunting backdrop of Neyla's cello - to Wesley's unparalleled vocals; these three musicians (and more when playing live!) blend their talents together perfectly. Not to mention the random yet somehow synchronous background shouts which add to the flavor of the songs. Of course there will be stand-out tracks, one being \\"Stubborn Love\\" which was phenomenal played live, but I recommend the album as a collective whole. Some complain of the short track lengths; ironically, I think it intelligently deliberate, leaving the listener scratching their ears for more. I refuse to marginalize this music by attempting to unfairly categorize it into some specific musical genre. The music is timeless and pure.<br /><br />Finally, on the eve of this great nation'sbirthday, I'd like to close by saying God bless America, and God bless The Lumineers.
0345803485|1.0|I'm very tired with so many books, even runaway bestsellers, that rattle on and on with the sexual violence against women that is taken as 'passion.' It's isn't passion. It's abuse. And if you can't tell the difference there is a serious problem. This is supposed to be a ove story but it's just Twilight hard-core. I know it was written as fanfiction but the editing team couldn't even remove the Twilight-esque garbage from this meaningless drivel.<br /><br />I'm looking for some good books. Strong women who can tell a man to kick rocks. Women that can talk about more than a guy and their clothes. Do these books exist these days? This junk is being shoved down our throats like we're supposed to believe BDSM is the same thing as ultimate love and respect? This book represents neither. The writer wanted to write some hard core sex scenes and was too lazy to come up with her own characters.

Although I liked the long and drawn out description of the family, it was too much even for me. I loved the scenery, Sweden is a beautiful place and off the radar for most. The family is dull, which is clear, and the description of the family is just as dull.<br /><br />Then we move right long into the chasm between the men vs. women. The men are drool-worthy, and the author says so so it's must be so! The women are all victims of rape and molestation, yet can't keep their panties on around these irresistible men.

I like the characters and the dialogue. It does drop off a little bit towards the end, which makes me wonder if it was supposed to be one book and the editors thought they'd get a couple more out of it by turning it into a series. I gave it 4* because I haven't read the other ones yet and as a single book it was engaging and easy to read but it still felt like there was a cut-and-paste job of some parts that were surgicaly removed to appear in other books.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I have been listening to the Beatles for about 35 years.  Although I liked many of their songs when I was younger; I didn't really appreciate how wonderful their music was until I got older.  This collection is simply amazing!  First, it is great to have a complete record of all their studio recordings.  However, the amazing part is the sound quality.  Its like listening to the Beatles for the first time again.  The stereo mixing allows one to hear some separation in the instrumental tracks, bringing a whole new persepctive to many songs.<br />  I put off this purchase for a couple years due to the expense, but now I can say it was worth every penny.  In fact, after listening to these remasters, I would pay twice what I paid.  I have bought several Beatles albums and CD's over the years, but the quality was never quite right.  Now I can't stop listening to these CD's; it is that good.  If you like the Beatles music, you will LOVE it after you hear this collection.  It is quite possibly the most perfect collection of remasters I have ever heard.  A fitting tribute to the greatest Rock & Roll band ever.<br />  The packaging is nice too, but I am not one who is overly concerned with such trivial things.  Some have complained abot the packaging; all I can say is its a nice box and well organized.  For me, it is all about music quality and The Beatles Stereo Box Set is fantastic!

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games...what can I say? I'm somewhat hesitant to admit to enjoying this book...but honestly, I found it quite interesting and very intriguing. The subject matter is abominable when you think about it, yet for a generation that's been raised on reality shows where it's common-place to eliminate a player each week, The Hunger Games definitely has a familiar feel. The main difference here is that the players are reluctant children, and failure means death instead of simply being \\"voted out\\".<br /><br />Katniss is likeable and easy to sympathize with; she's been through tougher times than most of us will ever know, but she's a fighter and is full of determination. Family is extremely important to her, in fact she breaks the law nearly every day just to feed her mother and sister. (It's actually her love for her sister that brings Katniss into the Hunger Games, she basically sacrifices herself to take her sister's place.) Katniss doesn't believe the structure and actions of her government are correct, and she knows the whole ideal of the Hunger Games is warped.... however, the Capitol City has zero tolerance for rebellion or protests of any kind, so Katniss keeps her beliefs to herself, knowing she would be killed for speaking them out loud.<br /><br />Peeta, who is the other tribute (or player) in the Games from Katniss's district, is also very interesting to watch. There's much more to him than you might think at first glance. He has the ability to evoke such a wide range of emotions from me...a couple times his actions confused me, giving me pause to ponder his intentions, but other times I felt sadness and sympathy for him, and still other times he had me smiling in silent laughter. He's an excellent character, and I really enjoyed how he and Katniss played off each-other.<br /><br />For those wondering about the gore and violence factor, obviously just from reading the synopsis you can tell this is not a \\"warm and fuzzy\\" book...but in my opinion, considering the extreme subject matter, it's handled fairly well. There is violence and gore, but I wouldn't call it gratuitous or drawn-out; it was actually milder than I expected.

It's extremely intriguing and you just can't help but want/need to know what will happen next. I hesitate to associate the word \\"entertaining\\" with it, but honestly, it really is.

B0053O89WY|5.0|For the intellectual only - maybe Nickelodeon is more your speed if you are having trouble following this show, because many of their funniest moments are playful quips based upon science, mathematics or grammar.  The delightful sarcasm, the character interactions, and the hilarious situations make this show entertainment at its best!<br /><br />We own the first four seasons and anxiously await Season 5.  My friends and family know I will not answer the phone on Thursday nights, because I am getting my \\"Big Bang Therapy\\".  Of course, most of them are now watching along with me...except the ones who are 'too cool' - well, maybe Nickelodeon should air Sponge Bob during this time so everyone is equally entertained.  BAZINGA!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a great way to clear your thinking.  focusing on strategy and moves help release stress.  believe it or not it is also a sleep aid!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written, engaging and intriguing. I finished it in 3 days because I just couldn't put it down. It may be geared toward a younger audience, but I think there is something that resonates true for all ages.

B0076HN3T0|5.0|'Foo Fighters Back And Forth' is exactly what a documentary should be. It's witty and harsh and perfectly detailed about what happened, not from people who sat back and watched it happen, but from people who lived it. Rarely is the public afforded insight to such creative and legendary musicians. Can't wait for their next album.

030758836X|3.0|If you like happy endings where the psycho gets his or her comeuppance, this book is NOT for you!  I just felt sick and sad at the end of it and wished I hadn't read it.  Is it well written?  Yes.  Does it hold your interest? Yes.  This book is very clever and the writer has one sick twisted mind to come up with some of the plot twists that take place.  Essentially, this book is one long mind-f@@@k.  Read it if you like suspense and never knowing what is going to happen next, but skip it if you like endings that right the wrongs.
B007BVOF8E|4.0|This one was original because it shows a perspective of national security or spying that no other movie I've seen has depicted.  Basically one guy was in charge of the whole British dept along with a small team under him.  Everyone else was below that, figuratively and literally--on lower floors of the building.  Whereas moles and missions are more fun and exciting in other movies of the type, in this one they're more realistic and the details are thought out better.  But I was also not bored at any point.<br />And the guy who's relegated from the spy world to teaching kids was a great touch.  An untamed man who had known comradeship and sailed the wild seas, so to speak, thrown back in with kids and able to show them how Englishmen aught to be and to bring along one of the outcast kids a little bit.  That was a small part of the movie but, again, really a great touch.  Classic British culture.
0345803507|5.0|I was so glad to take the time to read this series of book! I wanted to now about the hipe and I found out! WOW! This one was a bit duller than the other 2 but it was still good! I hope this series contuines in the future or this author comes out with something just as good!!!
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The fourth movies in regards to the other Underworld saga.  Lots of visual eye candy in this movie.  I don`t think it is the best Underworld made, but certainly not bad either.  Story-line still consistent with the other three films, which makes it compelling to watch.
0345803485|5.0|I wanted to know what the hipe was about this book and I found out for sure! This is one book and I will remember for along time!!! I would recommend this book for sure!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the whole trilogy and loved it. When I first heard the negativity about the first book, I just had to see what it was all about. I think it tells a story that could possibly happen in reality. I loved every page of the books and was sad when I finished the third book. I am not into this way of life, but everyone has their own ways of satisfaction. As the old saying goes, to each their own.
0345803493|5.0|Loved how this book got more in Grey's life and why he is the way he is. How Steel was able to start to break him and how they love each other. It was so hard to put the book down! I would totally recommend the whole series to read!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This has been a great game some more challenging than others and though I get aggravated with not being able to conquer certain ones it is of no fault of the game. It is just the player!
B004LROUW2|5.0|This book is amazing.  The review I read where it stated that it wasn't one of his best novels is incorrect.  The characters are interesting, it's easy to follow, unlike some of his other work, and it's beautifully written.  I love this author and I always look forward to anything he produces.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Great set. Would have like to see some more music Videos that George made. It's about time something was done about George's post Beatles music.

B0082JYAZ2|5.0|RUN don't walk to your nearest computer (or store?) & get this album in your collection!! One of the things I find really awesome about Regina Spektor is I feel like I'm taking her hand & following her on a journey, down the yellow brick road or down the rabbit hole. Each song opens as a carefully wrapped package & I found myself waiting with anticipation & baited breath to see where she would go next.  The songs do sound different from each other but are uniquely Regina. At times playful & at other times deeply emotional it is a beautiful album. My favorite song is \\"How\\" followed closely by \\"Firewood\\", both songs so emotionally realized I fell completely under their spell.  I just like to know how she got access to my diary for those ;-)
034580404X|5.0|I loved every single book in this series... i couldnt put it down... it was very tantalizing.<br />You can just stop with book one and be satisfied or read the whole series and really enjoy the story.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After reading all 3 books, I am left feeling I wasted my time and money. I call this book  &#34;House Wife Porn&#34;  because any respectable woman can buy this book without having to go to the down town XXX store. The only reason this book is not considered porn is because the author used terms such as &#34;he touched my sex&#34; instead of the slang term for vagina. Really, where are the smut police when you need them.  And the story line....... Young virgin college grad mets screwed up, good looking, rich man and with her love is able to breakdown his walls and change him. Please! Frankly, I became bored of the sex sceens and skippy most of them in book 2 and 3. If you removed all the sex screens in all 3 books, the story line would only fill 150 pages at best and never had made it to print.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|Managed to slog through about 60 percent of this drudgery. There's almost no story, mostly philosophical page-fillers. No actual events occur, for chapters at a time. Couldn't finish this one-doesn't happen to me very often.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Many artists have a few amazing albums and then become their own tribute bands.  I was fully expecting this to lack the shine of her previous work, but d*mn this woman has got blues in her soul!  This album is fantastic and she still brings the slide guitar with fury.  Well done Ms.Raitt.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|I know I am going against the grain here but I like this album alot,much more than grace for drowning. which is way too \\"jazzy\\" for me. Like most people,I started with porcupine tree with their later albums,but as I tore through their catalog,I find their older stuff much better.The songs take me to a different place,which I feel is the whole reason to listen to music in the first place. At the pinnacle is Steven Wilson's first solo album Insurgentes. I just got a new Polk surround system and an Oppo 93,and the 5.1 DVD is incredible.Awesome album,just hit play, lean back amd take it in. Check it out, you won't be sorry.
B000OP1M6M|4.0|I have had this watch for about seven months.  I have enjoyed it greatly.  The watch is accurate (gains 3-4 seconds per day) and is comfortable and looks nice.  It's a great casual watch but, unlike my sub homage divers, can't really be worn in dressy situations.<br /><br />I will agree that the bracelet, which actually is quite comfortable, doesn't look as nice as I would like.  I haven't yet pulled the trigger on an oyster bracelet but I'm thinking about it.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I grew up watching \\"Star Blazers\\" every morning before school. Each and every episode was a sequence of events spanning dozens of episodes telling the tales of the Star Force and their journey to the planet of Iscandar. This film captured so many memorable moments and created some new ones. It is approx 2 hrs and 20 mins so obviously they couldn't fit everything in. Abbreviated or not it was amazing to finally see the Yamato (Argo) in a realistic environment. I am very pleased with this purchase. The film is in Japanese with choice of English subtittles. It may seem a little silly to some, but to true fans of the old series and the original Japanese Yammatoes, it will remind you how fun and exciting the show was. I hope that if the US gets the rights to \\"Star Blazers\\" we can do just as great a film as this. Audio and video qualities are superb. This may not be the official release of the film on DVD but it is the most reasonable for an import I was able to find. After reviewing details of different releases of this film, this was the one to get. It is available on Amazon in Blu-ray, but for the money I wasn't sure how I would like the movie. I will probably buy the Blu-ray now.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|I did not expect to like let unlone enjoy this movie. My kids wanted this movie. It was a lot better than the previews.
030758836X|4.0|Let me state upfront that I think the characters were pretty one-dimensional.  Amy is the career girl who couldn't quite have it all.  Nick is the relatively weak (lame) thirty-something.  Go is the mysterious somewhat down-to-earth girl.  And then there are the Ozark meth heads and the celebrity lawyer named Tanner.  There isn't much special about any of them.<br /><br />What makes the story special, however, is Flynn's expert ability to play these relatively cliched characters off each other while laying clues that lead evolve in a terrific plot.  The pacing is terrific, and the action slowly builds and then veers off -- several times -- in new and startling directions.  It is amazing to witness Flynn pull this off.<br /><br />I understand why some were angry about the ending.  However, I will state (without giving anything away) that this ending felt more believable than some of the more outlandish endings in many current crime/literary thrillers.  This is a book worth reading.
1401300529|5.0|I was a complete dummy about the Korean War prior to reading The Coldest Winter. I knew it happened in 1950-1953, knew the place (duh! Korea of course), and that was about it.<br /><br />I believe one of the main points Halberstam makes in his story of the war is that this long forgotten war deserves to be remembered as a war that was worth fighting for. In retrospect, acknowledging the fantastic economic development and democratization that South Korea went through in the last 50 years after being spared from a Communist take-over under Kim Il Sung, one can make a convincing case that the Americans and also other UN soldiers that died during the conflict were not killed for nothing. All South Koreans should be grateful for what they accomplished, as seeing the current incredible backwardness of the current North Korean state is probably sending a chill down their spine if the U.S. and the UN had led Kim Il Sung's drive into South Korea continued unchecked.<br /><br />All the main war stages and important operations and battles are covered in details, with supporting maps: the initial North Korean assault which almost conquered the whole peninsula, leaving the initially thin U.S. forces holding on scraps of territory near Pusan; the watershed American landing at Inchon which completely reverses the tide of the war and cut off most of the North Korean forces down south; the reckless drive up north to the Chinese border of the U.S./UN forces; the deceptive and spectacular Chinese counterattack which caused lots of pain and suffering at Kunuri and at the Chongchong river, and the ensuing 2-year stalemate until the July 1953 ceasefire.<br /><br />But the strength of Halberstam's story is about describing in rich details the perspective and personality of the most important protagonists: MacArthur, Ridgway, Rhee Syngman, President Truman, Mao, Kim Il Sung and some less well-known key players. His story writing fluidly merges these descriptions with the actual flow of events. Both sides are well portrayed in all their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />In conclusion, it must been said however that the successful stop of Communist invasion may have clouded the judgment of the national security apparatus of the U.S. ten years later regarding Vietnam. Although the situation was entirely different, some may have thought that Vietnam was like a Korean War no. 2, where a Communist-alleged takeover had to be stopped. Based on the Korean experience, they may have thought possible to do the same in Vietnam...The rest is history.nts.

0143119680|5.0|A Discovery of Witches was an absolute joy and pleasure to read.  This will be a book and series that I can easily say I will read multiple times over.<br /><br />The blend of history, science and magic was breathtaking.  I never once got bored and was riveted each time I picked up my Kindle to where I never wanted to put it down.  I love that it is a longer book, normally in a new series the first book is smaller with the end books being larger.  So much was able to take place and as mentioned previously, I was never bored.  There were moments when I got tears in my eyes, I laughed and one particular moment where I actually screamed out 'NO' and drew my hands up to my face unable to continue reading for a few minutes.  My heart was honestly pounding in my chest.<br /><br />Diana is such a smart, level headed woman.  I will be the first to say I loved Twilight but I can honestly say Bella at many times annoyed me.  Far too much the 'Damsel in Distress' in a lot of the earlier books.  Diana is strong. Yes there are moments of despair as there would be for anybody that faced some of the challenges she must face but she is brave and honest.<br /><br />Matthew is... simply wonderful.  Yes he is protective over Diana as it is his nature as a vampire but you see how he realizes she is a strong woman.  She is his 'lionne' and 'coeur', these meaning she is his lioness and his heart.<br /><br />The history and science in this book intrigued me. Matthew is Scientist and a very old vampire, who in his long life has known many fascinating people.  Diana is a Witch and an Historian. You learn much about Matthew's life and the people he knew and the science that he is currently working on when trying to determine how and why the creatures of their world were created and why they now seem to be dying out.  Those creatures being Witches, Deamons and Vampires, they share the world with humans who are oblivious to their existence. A world where creatures do not normally mix or even become friends, let alone fall in love.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006WEZ9TK Shadow of Night: A Novel]], the second book in this series is set to be released on July 10th and I am quite excited.  My head is filled with thoughts of how book two will play out and all of the wonderful people Diana and Matthew will come into contact with and the many mysteries they will start to unravel when Diana learns to harness and control her magic.  I will be eagerly awaiting it to be whispersynced to my Kindle so that I can start immediately when I am home from work.

0312641893|4.0|This is a retelling of Cinderella, but it is a science fiction book. In this book, Cinderella is Cinder, a cyborg, meaning she is half robot, half human. When her only human friend, her younger stepsister, is infected with the plague, an incurable disease, her stepmother angrily volunteers her for plague research. But then scientists discover that she is different from other cyborgs; she has a talent others would kill for: she is immune to the plague. Suddenly, what seemed like a death sentence: her stepmother sending her away, becomes a seeming blessing. Cinder is independent! She attracts the attention of Prince Kai as well. What follows is a suspenseful, amazing, story. I don't generally like science fiction all that much, but this book was so suspenseful, and original. I'd never heard of a fairy-tale retold as science fiction, and it was a novel concept. This is the first book in a series. And, the book has a stunning ending, leaving you waiting, breathless for the sequel. There is a really basic plot device in the book that I predicted 200 pages before it was revealed.<br /><br />*You can read all of my book reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*

0439813786|4.0|Hugo Cabret is an orphan, a clock keeper, and a thief. He lives in the walls of a Paris train station, and he has many secrets. But when his world interlocks with an eccentric girl and a bitter old toy-shop owner, his secret is about to be revealed. A cryptic drawing, a notebook, a stolen key, an automan, and a hidden message from Hugo's father make up much of the mystery.    This was the book before Wonderstruck, and I must say that I did like certain elements of Wonderstruck better. For example, the three main characters in The Invention of Hugo Cabret were really nasty to one another. The girl was mean to Hugo, Hugo was mean to her, and the toy-shop owner was horrible towards Hugo. Eventually, you came to understand why (sort of), but I had about zero sympathy with any of them throughout the story. Still, I loved the drawings and the references to old surrealist silent films. The Invention of Hugo Cabret also has a fairly satisfying ending, so I'm still going to give it 4 stars.    *You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]*

0312330855|4.0|This is the story of James Herriot, a country veterinarian. Actually, Herriot wrote many books about his experiences, but I think this is the first one. It had a lot of humor in it, from the hilarious (though I'm sure they weren't at the time) procedures that he goes through with different animals, to Siegfried Farnon, the quirky and odd vet who Herriot is assistant too. There were always great descriptions of the English countryside as well as the amusing people who live there. The repartee between Siegfried and his younger brother Tristan as well as between Siegfried and their secretary Miss Harbottle is really side-splitting. Herriot narrates throughout with a typical British humor, though he is fairly cheerful. He describes his various cases and what life is like in the countryside.<br /><br />*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, &lt;...>

0525478817|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel. At times it was really sad, and at other times it was humorous. It is about Hazel, a sixteen year old with cancer. She is resigned to dying sometime in the near future, despite a tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years. But then, at the Cancer Support group she meets Augustus Waters, and finds herself drawn to him. Suddenly she does not want to die at all! It was a very thought-provoking book, and like I said, it had funny and sad moments. There is this fictional book, An Imperial Affliction, that both Hazel and \\"Gus\\" really love. The Imperial Affliction sounds like it would be an interesting book to actually read. Maybe John Green should write it under the pen name Peter Van Houten (the supposed author of the book.) It would be cool. But anyway, I loved this book. Hazel doesn't really want to get involved with Augustus because she knows that they will have no future, as she is probably going to die-she'd rather hurt him now than later with her death. But they do sort of get involved. It is a bittersweet kind of romance. It is a sad novel, but not without hope too, and I liked it, if not LOVED it.    *You can read all of my book reviews at my blog,[...]*
0792164946|5.0|One of my all time Favorites. Mel Gibson gives a Stunning performance throughout in a compelling story of war, honor, and passion. The story grabs your attention immediately as there's never a dull moment in this historical film I can watch again-and-again. This is a Top Notch film in quality and in many ways is an epic as much as 'Gone With The Wind.' Fantastic story as it portrays the horror of war and what courage and victory means. Awesome in every aspect, and Highly Recommended!
1416550550|4.0|I always love books filled with mystery, intrigue, and magic, so it's no wonder that this one caught my eye. Plus, it has a great cover. From the back cover: \\"A tiny girl is abandoned on a ship headed for Australia in 1913. She arrives completely alone with nothing but a small suitcase containing a few clothes and a single book--a beautiful volume of fairy tales. She is taken in by the dockmaster and his wife and raised as their own. On her twenty-first birthday, they tell her the truth, and with her sense of self shattered and very little to go on, \\"Nell\\" sets out to trace her real identity. Her quest leads her to Blackhurst Manor on the Cornish coast and the secrets of the doomed Mountrachet family. But it is not until her granddaughter, Cassandra, takes up the search after Nell's death that all the pieces of the puzzle are assembled. A spellbinding tale of mystery and self-discovery, The Forgotten Garden will take hold of your imagination and never let go.\\" Well, it wasn't that great of a book, but I enjoyed it. I always love dark fairy tales.    One thing that was interesting about the book was the way that it skipped from time period to time period; it wasn't chronological at all. One chapter would be about Nell's childhood and the next after her death. But that was a good thing about it. The whole book was really engaging and I was eager throughout to see the mystery solved. And I loved the descriptions of the old manor and the garden beyond the maze. This was a bittersweet book, with some very sad parts, but I really liked it.    *You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]*
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Great game lots of fun and good graphics.  Wish they'd lose the ads It's very distracting and if you get killed and set back umteen stages it sends me to a web page which is dumb and very annoying.  For one, I think you have to clear too many stages before it won't send you way back so many stages.  Also the 10th stage was made too hard.  Makes me quit playing.
0156030306|4.0|Charlie Gordon is a mentally disabled man who undergoes an experimental operation to try and make him smarter. In diary entries, he records how his IQ increases and he gets smarter and smarter, until he eventually surpasses even the doctors who did the operation in intelligence. It seems to be a huge medical breakthrough-until Algernon, the super-smart mouse who has had the same operation, begins a sudden deterioration. Will the same thing happen to Charlie?    This a gripping, thrilling ride of a science fiction novel. The best part of it was the way that Charlie's entries progress. At the beginning, he can barely write and has not much understanding of anything. Then, he becomes like a regular person, if slightly below average. Then, he begins to write like the average person, before finally becoming a genius, knowing about ten languages. And then- well, I won't say what happens in the end. But it was a very suspenseful book. One thing, however, that didn't make sense was that the scientists went straight from testing the experiment on a mouse to a human. In real life, I don't think they would do that.    *You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]

1439148953|2.0|Eilis Lacey grew up in a small town in Ireland. A priest from Brooklyn offers to sponsor her in America, and she decides to go, leaving her mother and sister behind. Eilis works in a department store, and finds unexpected love in the form of Tony, who loves the Dodgers. He slowly wins her over, but a family tragedy back in Ireland threatens her future.    I mainly decided to read this book because of the title; I really love New York. This book, however, did not impress me. The characters felt flat and unreal; I barely cared about them. The narration was sort of passive and basically nothing happened. Even when something did, I didn't get too excited about it, because the way it was told was boring. I only finished it because it was fairly short and I thought I might as well to see if it ever picked up. But it didn't  [...]
B000F8O35U|5.0|Great classic Disney DVD. Best edition I have ever seen. The second Disc is awesome. I learned so much about a movie I have loved since I was a child. It's great to have this DVD for its quality as well, it's a good investment in classic Disney DVDs.
0375850864|5.0|This is another great book that I really should have read by now. It also won the Newbery Award. But I just never got around to it, until now. And I was not disappointed. In fact, I really liked this book. It's part realistic fiction, part science fiction. I know, right? They're not supposed to mix. Yet they do in this book. Sixth grader Miranda begins receiving strange notes about the future, as if someone has traveled to the future and seen what has happened to her later. Meanwhile, her friend Sal is growing ever more distant from her, shutting her out of his life. The first note says: I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. I ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter. The notes keep coming, and Miranda begins to believe that only she can prevent a very tragic death.    The whole book was super suspenseful; I read it in basically one sitting (admittedly it was only 197 pages.) I really wanted to find out who the notes were from. With such a lofty mystery, one might think that the ending would fall short, but it didn't. I loved the ending just as much as the rest of the book. It felt so right. No spoilers, though, so you have to read the book if you haven't already read it.    *You can read all of my reviews on my blog, [...]*

0061730335|4.0|William Kamkwamba grew up in Malawi, where magic still ruled and modern science was a mystery. But he dreamed of using a windmill to provide something that most people in Malawi didn't have- running water and electricity. This is the story of his childhood and adolescence spent in Malawi. One thing that I enjoyed about the book was the combining of magic and science. Kamkwamba describes the magical and cultural beliefs of the people, as well as the new scientific technology that was just arriving in Malawi. Also, he describes a terrible famine that occurred in 2001 with great, heartbreaking detail.    *You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]*
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Disney's John Carter is among the 5 worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />Terrible acting.<br /><br />Incomprehensible plot.<br /><br />Amateurish special effects.<br /><br />Clownish costumes.<br /><br />Just a total waste of time.<br /><br />Movies made by the SyFy channel are better.  Movies made by the Asylum are better.<br /><br />John Carter is rotten!<br /><br />EDIT to add more detail:<br /><br />I have no connection to the film company Asylum. I just did not care for John Carter at all.<br /><br />I rented John Carter, despite the many critics who gave it negative reviews. I have found critics to be wrong before, and I wanted to make my own assessment.<br /><br />Movies can be really subjective. John Carter just did not work for me. About the only part of John Carter I enjoyed was the interactive between Carter and the Union Colonel who comes to \\"draft\\" him. Those few scenes were okay.<br /><br />The fight scenes kept making me wonder why? Why if you have high tech weapons and machines do you need to fight with swords? And to me, the romance angle just did not work at all.<br /><br />The natives (tharks? spelling) portrayal seemed to me to be neither realistic, nor comical, and so they came off as too fakey. I kept thinking of JarJar Binks from Star Wars (I found that character annoying) and a cross with muppets.<br /><br />Most of the CGI effects I found seemed to be imitations of other, better done, movies.<br /><br />I think I may have enjoyed it more had there been better development of fewer characters.  It seems I was just getting to following who was what, and then it changed.  New people, or creatures, entered and it was all new again.<br /><br />At first I thought the lower gravity effects were going to be good, but then it seemed like it was inconsistent.  Sometimes he would \\"leap tall buildings with a single bound\\" and other moments he seemed to strain.  But maybe John Carter was mastering his environment better?<br /><br />Overall, I thoughtJohn Carter was a rotten movie.
0140282033|4.0|Beautiful, unmarried Vianne Rocher sweeps into the small French town of Lansquenet with her six year old daughter Anouk right after the carnival and opens a little chocolate shop. She begins to wreak havoc with the town's Lenten vows. She has an uncanny ability to know customers' troubles and know just what their favorite type of chocolate is and what will help them. She delights the villagers, but enrages Pere Reynaud, the priest. He is convinced that she is a witch, and he vows to stop her from staying.<br /><br />At first glance, this is just a light book about chocolate, but really it talks about sin vs. guilt. I loved the descriptions of not only the wonderful chocolate, but also the town and the various inhabitants of it. Actually, Vianne is a bit of a witch, I'd say, but the term \\"witch\\" always denotes a certain evilness. Vianne is not evil at all. She just wants to help people, and her way of helping people is different than Pere Reynaud's. This book is a perfect example of how chocolate always helps. Well, almost always.<br /><br />*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*

It has only gotten better in the past thirty some years!  His writing is so great, and his voice is at his best.  The songs are unforgettable, and phrases such as \\"like a corkscrew to my heart\\" just make me feel his music.  I love this CD!
0375757856|4.0|This a wonderful, engaging British mystery. It deals with the Moonstone, a valuable Indian diamond. The diamond is originally stolen from an Indian shrine by a British soldier, and later, it is stolen. The story is related by a great cast of characters, a hilarious house steward named Gabriel Betteredge, the detective, Sergeant Cuff, a lovesick housemaid, and a strange band of Indian jugglers. It was really great that the author included these different narrators; it gave different perspectives on the mystery. Published in the late 19th century, it does have some elements of that period of writing; in other words, unlike some mysteries, you won't speed through it. Once you get interested though, you will be eager to discover what happens. Also, just when you think the mystery is about to be solved, something unexpected happens. The only real criticism I have of The Moonstone is that at time it drags on a bit too much. Oh, and the edition that I was reading had the most boring cover ever. I would never have read it had it not been for a review on another blog. If you're a fan of mystery, you should definitely read this book- according to the back cover, it inspired the hugely popular genre of the detective mystery. I don't know if that claim is true, but it certainly was a great, exciting book to read.    *You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, [...]*
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Ok the picture is a lot better on Blu-ray, now we know that GL is going to put all these movies into 3D as he said he wanted it to be. The biggest let down was the fact that they could've put the cut scenes into the movies and they didn't, those idiots. The picture may be better but the cut scenes that weren't in the movies and were instead put on a different disc is total bs to me and waste of money when a lot, or most of us thought that the cut scenes would be put into the movies like they should've been, but we get ripped off again, and makeing me angry isn't a good thing.<br /><br />Maybe $30.00 should've been the price for what we got. We deserved better.
014241493X|4.0|Because I enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars, I was really looking forward to this book, also by John Green. It was just as good, if not a little better, than The Fault in Our Stars. Quentin Jacobson has spent his middle and high school years loving the adventurous, magnificent, Margo Roth Spiegelman from a distance. But then one night she climbs into his room and summons him to help her conduct a campaign of revenge, which takes the whole night. The next day, Q arrives at school and discovers that Margo has disappeared. But he discovers special clues-for him. They lead him to Margo, but he discovers that he hardly knows who she really is.    What can I say? This book had a great plot, quite interesting. Also, Q's narration was very funny at times; he definitely sounded like a teenager. And of course, Margo, a very appealing character: spunky, clever, funny, and adventurous. And the book had a nice feel in hand. Some of the ideas expressed in the book were very intriguing, too, and now I think I might tackle Leaves of Grass, which played an important part in Q's finding Margo. Paper Towns has some really hilarious moments, and the concept of the paper town was new to me. I won't give it away, but it was very cool.    *You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]*

1416583432|4.0|Similar to The Art of Racing in the Rain, this book has a close-up of a dog on the cover. Inside of a Dog is non-fiction, however. This book addresses what dogs know, how they think, and our misconceptions of their \\"feelings.\\" It talks about how we tend to use anthropomorphisms to describe them. That's not to say that dogs don't have feelings; they just express them in different ways. Horowitz had a nice writing style, and I enjoyed reading her explanations. Another author could have just as easily made this so boring, as I'm not that interested in dogs, but I was really hooked to this book. Horowitz made things simple enough that you could understand without being a scientist and had interesting facts, theories, and explanations. Also, unlike some science books I could mention, the print wasn't this small and I could read it well. I'm not saying that I have anything against books with tiny print; they just are kind of off-putting, if you know what I mean. For anyone, I would reccommend this book, but especially if you're a dog lover. Inside of a Dog will give you a new perspective on your canine friend (if you have one.) And even though I don't have a dog, I learned a lot about dogs. For example, do they really lick your face as a sign of affection? Do they really like those raincoats that you put on them? Something I enjoyed was that Horowitz used her own dog, \\"Pump\\" (Pumpernickel) as an example to illustrate her various points. It gave a concrete basis for what she was talking about rather than forcing you to imagine a dog doing something.<br /><br />*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*

B0044WUQ3G|4.0|If you can imagine a storyline revolving around 3 friends stuck on a ski lift, you'd be hard pressed to top this one. Not giving anything away! The director did a very good job of adding plot, story, depth, and action to what would seemingly be a run of the mill generic plotline. The characters feel real, the hopelessness seems, well, hopeless, and aside from a few annoyingly trivial points, Frozen is a movie I've rewatched just for its brilliant take on what would seem a horribly accidental but normally much less eventful \\"problem,\\" if such a word could be used. At the very least rent it - its a fun albeit disturbing ride.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just plain lame.  A cheezy romance novel with a twist of kink that for some reason caught the attention of the public.  If you really like BDSM, then there is better.  If you really like romance novels, then there is better.  I just don't get it.

1589795474|5.0|This book is about money, but it is MORE about HUMAN NATURE, LIFESTYLE and good old-fashioned COMMON SENSE.  This book should be required reading for every high school graduate and certainly required reading for every college graduate.  There are too many people that are pathetically financially ignorant and get themselves and others into big financial trouble with disastrous consequences on their lives.  If more people understood the principles of common financial sense explained in this book, they and the world would be in much better condition.  This is a must read book for everyone.

B0029LHWIQ|5.0|My daughter loves George.  She has several George books which are compilations of stories.  Such books are great for when she's sitting on my lap and I'm reading to her.  But they are harder for her to flip through on her own without tearing the pages.  And, they are larger so they are not that easy to carry around.  Also, since the compliation books contain many stories, they are a little overwhelming for her when she is trying to \\"read\\" to herself.  (My child is not yet two so she cannot actually read but she likes to try.).  So, this set is a nice alternative when my child wants to look at George books and \\"read\\" on her own.  Each book is a sturdy board book that contains only one story.  They are the perfect size for toddler hands.  The illustrations are nice.  The books come in a cardboard carrying case.  The case is nice for taking the set to Grandma's house or other trips. We are happy with the purchase.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|If there was ever a show to make me a TV enthusiast, Breaking Bad is it. I rarely set aside time for television shows, preferring the relatively concise artistic potential of film. But Breaking Bad has forced me to \\"break\\" this habit and surrender myself to its deep characters, nail-biting drama, and stunningly artistic presentation. I cannot recommend it highly enough. However, be warned: when watching this show you may at times exhibit what I like to call the \\"Breaking Bad Syndrome\\" -- awe-induced heart palpitations which may lead to sleep deprivation or temporary blindness (as you search the ground for your eyeballs, which just popped out of your head).<br /><br />Walter White is, in my opinion, one of the greatest fictional character portrayals of all time. The transformation he undergoes across all 4 (and soon to be 5) seasons is epic, moving, and at times very dark. Television has the privilege of being able to develop its characters across many seasons and the writers of Breaking Bad take full advantage, expertly constructing Walt and his companions with the precision of a surgeon. The sub-plots of each episode are individually engrossing, but Breaking Bad always keeps its primary focus on the long-term development of its story and characters, and rightfully so. While this makes for a \\"slow-burn\\" at times, the payoff is always worth it, and you'll be watching through your fingers as the plot-lines and characters converge in stirring climaxes. Breaking Bad refrains from desensitizing its audience with constant action, but slowly gets under your skin so that when it hits you, it hits you hard.<br /><br />What is most intriguing is the moral ambiguity shrouding the characters and their actions. The distinction between hero and villain becomes progressively blurred, making for a conflicted but engaging audience relationship with the characters. Despite this, the writers reserve a special ability to also make us sympathize with every character, even if we held hostile feelings just an episode ago. And the characters are as well acted as they are drawn. Obvious credit goes to Bryan Cranston, but he is matched at nearly every turn by his co-stars, especially Aaron Paul as his younger partner. Giancarlo Esposito also fashions a memorable and charismatic semi-villain in drug lord Gustavo Fring. The depth the actors give their characters causes the show to feel very real, despite the slight absurdity of some of the situations it presents. Breaking Bad's genius lies in this perfect balance of pop absurdity and chilling realism, which ends up leaving the viewer emotionally spent but hopelessly addicted. By tangling us up in the escalating internal conflicts of its characters, the show induces an emotional \\"high\\" that is irresistible. Somewhat inconceivably the show manages to form a very personal connection with the viewer, despite how far removed the story may be from our individual lives.<br /><br />So what of Season 4? Personally I did not find it quite as affecting as Seasons 2 & 3 -- it didn't have quite as many of those Breaking Bad \\"moments\\" -- but it is still, without a doubt, 5 stars. The episodes work together as one big build towards the climax, which does not fail to deliver. To be fair, the final twist of Season 4 stretched the plot's plausibility a little too much for my taste, but I forgive a show that consistently does so many other things exceptionally well. I could go on about how beautifully it is shot, the subtle metaphors, the tragic \\"American\\" themes, but I'll save you the time: pick up this show and experience the phenomenon that is... Breaking Bad.
1455508969|4.0|The Lucky One<br />  By Nicholas Sparks<br /><br />Light weight-stuff here. Author Nicholas Sparks is one of the major players in the romance genre and for good reason--he can churn this stuff out and fast. Here's another perfect summer read. Not a single surprise and I would imagine that's what people like about his writing.<br /><br /> The story is built around three characters and every other chapter is about each of them. Deputy Keith Clayton opens the tale and right from the get-go you smell a numero uno creep. As he hangs in the bushes snapping pictures of naked co-eds skinny dipping in the river, someone else is watching. Enter player two; Logan Thibault and his well-trained German shepherd, Zeus.<br /><br /> Thibault, a scruffy, long-haired ex-marine, is on a strange mission and he's doing it all on foot. He's hiked from Colorado with a simple pack on his back and a lucky charm in his pocket; a mysterious picture he found while stationed in Kuwait. And (you're not going to believe this) it's of our third character in this triangle of love; Beth Clayton, ex-wife of Keith and mother to their only child, Ben.<br /><br /> \\"He'd known she was attractive, but the faded photo didn't capture the warmth of her smile or the serious way she studied him, as if searching for hidden flaws.\\"<br /><br /> Early on, you figure he'll find his `Lucky One' but as with all good romance stories, things are never as easy as one-two-three. Conflicts are tossed into the tale faster than you can say Nicholas Sparks loves himself and then, (sorry, he brings out the snark in me) surprise, surprise, an enormous, record-breaking storm blasts into the little town of Hampton, North Carolina and stirs up all sorts of trouble for our cozy trio.<br /><br /> \\"Beth watched Keith and Logan struggle just before the remaining ropes attached to the central landing snapped. Across the creek, the tree house platform tumbled into the creek in a massive eruption of water, and Ben was whipsawed downstream. In horror, Beth saw that he was still clinging to the rope attached to the central landing, which spiraled into the current...\\"<br /><br /> Okay, let's be honest here, when you grab a romance novel don't you pretty much know how this thing is going to end? I mean, isn't that why you picked the majorly predictable tome in the first place? Thought so. Sure there was a few twists in this story that were a little, tiny bit surprising, but overall I had this one pegged after the first chapter and there is something fun about reading a well-written story even if you know the girl gets the dude with the long hair in the end.<br /><br /> And woe is me to question that not only can the stud-muffin sway the gal into a mad, passionate love of megawatt-sizzle-your-socks-off magnitude, but the guy can play the piano, is great with the kid and can work a decent game of chess. Oh and he can chop an onion too.<br /><br />\\"As Logan walked toward her, he smiled as if reading her mind and opened his arms.\\"m.

B007MDB71O|5.0|As someone who first read Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars novels in the Ballentine reprints of the 1960s, I have been waiting -- no exaggeration -- for over half a Jasoomian century to see a film version of A PRINCESS OF MARS.  It was worth the wait.  I only wish my dad had been here to see it with me, since he introduced me to Burroughs' works, and he would have absolutely loved this film.  Although as a screenwriter* I might have handled a few of the plot elements differently, ultimately, I found JOHN CARTER to be a thoroughly enjoyable, exciting, and satisfying film.  The casting was spot-on perfect, the realization of the Martians, both red and green and all of the Barsoomian fauna, was stunning.  Ironically, I had just come from viewing the film at the theater when I ran into a friend and former student in a bookstore, and the first question he asked me was \\"Have you seen JOHN CARTER?\\"  When I admitted I had just seen it, he immediately began to berate the critics who had panned it.  I couldn't have agreed more.  William Goldman's statement in THE PRINCESS BRIDE -- \\"Life isn't fair, Billy\\" -- is cold consolation for the financial and critical failure of an excellent film; however, it does remind us that failure is not always an indication of an inferior product:  Fox canceled FIREFLY after only eleven episodes, and it is patently one of the best science-fiction TV series ever.  Selah.<br /><br />*See the novelization of my screenplay, PAXTON AT BOSWORTH FIELD, available on Amazon.<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=paxton+at+bosworth+field
B007VLHP9K|5.0|I heard Celibidache conduct Bruckner 4 at Carnegie Hall around the time this audio-only recording was made.  That was one of the truly unforgettable experiences for me, and I did not think it was repeatable.  When I read that the recording of the 4th included here was audio-only, I was somewhat disappointed.  However, now I have heard it, and consider it the greatest single Bruckner performance of any symphony by any conductor.  The sound is excellent, and the performance magnificent.  To resonate to it, you have to be on its wavelength.  It is very slow, but incredibly detailed and powerful.  Unmissable.<br /><br />The 3 symphonies on video give a good sense of how Celibidache projected the world of Bruckner.  Technically these are not state-of-the-art.  However, they are quite acceptable, and the audio is very good. Technical limitations in no way limit the impact of these performances.<br /><br />It should be pointed out that Bruckner's 4th and 5th are also being released on video at this time.  The 7th with Berlin Philharmonic is being released on Blu Ray. I have only seen the 5th, and it is comparably excellent.  I do not know if the 4th will be a video version of what is presented in the audio-only format in the present set.<br /><br />I cannot imagine anyone with slightest interest in Bruckner, or in Celibidache, passing these up.  Get them before they disappear.

Anyway, these books are very easy to read compared with some other much longer novels which test your ability to comprehend what the author is trying to say. They are a good read for someone who doesn't read much as long as you can get your head around the content which is rather futuristic and very gruesome in places

B000V86OKG|5.0|If \\"Hollywoody\\" is boring you to death with it's campy writing, plots, car chases, silly dialog, and plastic characters, give \\"Dexter\\" a few spins on your DVD player.  I'm now viewing the 5th season and it hasn't worn out one bit.  By the third season of \\"Burn Notice\\" I was burned out on the tired format.  \\"Dexter\\" came close to viewing trouble with his wife, but that problem was solved and we're back on track.  Go Dex, Go!  Love it.<br /><br />Jack Gibbert<br />Texarkana, TX.

044024630X|5.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher novels and so far The Affair has been my favorite. As with the other books in the series, there are many twists and turns before the book ends. Take my word for it. once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down.
B007PLRM9Y|5.0|This is record is one of a kind and unique. i wish there was more music like this. The music is outstanding and blends very well with melody gardot's voice. She is becoming my favorite singer passing Diana Krall.
1451627289|5.0|I must admit, Stephen King has been a little touch and go with me lately. In other words, I enjoy all his earlier works and maybe half of his later novels. Put this book in the enjoyable category. Though it, in my humble opinion, could have been 100 pages or so shorter, the time-travel story was unique and ultimately satisfying. Stephen King, please stay in the groove, and crank out more fine books such as this one. You will continue to be one of my favorite writers.
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|Up to now, I've really enjoyed the Underworld series. This one, however, is disapponting, to say the least. I agree with other reviewers' comments that the Lycans are cartoon-like, there is no plot development or exposition, the characters are caricatures, and the movie is too short to develop any story line. I believe the goal of any sequel should be to improve on the story and continue to develop the characters, rather than to simply exploit the popularity of earlier installments to make a buck. The door has been left open for another sequel. Let's hope it's better than this. I feel like I wasted my money this time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it for simple calculations and large buttons make it very easy and functional for quick and easy use<br /> I would recommend for all ages.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|Terrific, suspenseful, unusual film!  Camera work brings 18th century France to vivid life.  Acting is top notch and I LOVED John Hurt's narration.  Music adds another dimension, especially the soulful soprano arias.  This movie satisfies on all counts...
0060723513|5.0|I just read this amazing book that a friend recommended.  After reading it, I of course read the reviews and see that many people consider the author a great fabricator.  Personally, I believe the story is true for many reasons.  I also think that when stories such as this with such deep meaning are told, they come with all sorts of people trying to discredit them for numerous reasons.  All of the life messages that the author tells about in the \\"walkabout\\" are the same messages that some of the most profound influential \\"spiritual\\" people around the world have tried to pass on to us.  And many of us are desperately trying to live our lives that way....with more kindness, compassion, humility, less materialism, less fear, and more love. There are few out there that really get it, but through books like this, I think slowly things are shifting and people are beginning to understand the true meaning of life.
0143039830|1.0|One of the other reviewers used a great phrase to describe Paul Auster: \\"He is obviously very pleased with himself.\\"  I really wanted to like this book.  Two friends had recommended Auster to me and this was the first book of his that I picked up.  However, when I started reading and found out that \\"Paul Auster\\" was a character in the first story, warning sirens went off.  Occasionally, a writer can pull off the whole insert-yourself-into-your-story thing.  This is not one of those times.  The story read like a pretentious effort by a first year MFA student who really wanted to tell a \\"deep\\" story that had \\"meaning.\\"  Aside from some interesting passages (mild spoiler) about religious history in the New World, I found it to be tiresome.
B00271DNP4|2.0|Loved the movie but it skipped at the same spot all the time.  The scene where the giant spider come out of the wardrobe would stop at mid-transformation.  I would manually skip to next three scenes to continue watching movie.  Other HP movies purchase through Amazon were fine, this was the only faulty one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have notes, plans, brainstorming info, work, helping my bff plan her wedding &amp; homework spanning 2 laptops, tablets &amp; my bff's fiance can offer his opinion on the part he has access to...lolol

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book two of this trilogy is by far the best one. it explains why Christian is the way he is. I could not put it down. I think I finished it in 48 hrs. while working full time. Great Book
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one of the best free apps out there! its really fun trying to complete and unlock more games. lots of variety!
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|Sean Penn is a big fat idiot. Even Hurt and Holbrook can't save this dog. I'd rather watch Julie Andrews singing \\"The Hills are alive with the Sound of Music\\", and folks you know that's painful.
B0001HLVSC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It will be enjoyed by a family and the price and shipping were excellent making it convention to order and enjoy with in two days.<br /><br />I am so glad to find this movie on amazon.
B004856SQ8|5.0|the movie is what every guy would want in his movie collection. There is no reason not to have it, unless you dont like action!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm normally not into reading hot best sellers, but I gave in on this one because I needed something to read. I didn't think I would like just because i mainly read paranormal romance and not BDSM stuff... Well, I loved it. I admit, Christian Grey is hard to believe, but to me that is what adds to the imgagination: I can picture him how I want to and in some weird way believe he is the ultimate dream guy( which he is ). The sex scenes are... well kinda intense in some and just plain sweet in others. Once I started reading however, I couldn' put it down. I wanted to know what happened between Christian and Ana, then they end up engaged and married all in less than 6 months with a baby on the way, plus all the drama with the stalkers and kidnappers....  just love it.
B007V508CC|5.0|I love this album! Being a hardcore fan of Maroon 5 since Songs About Jane,I could not wait for new music. Nothing ever again will sound like SAJ, so people really need to get over it and enjoy what Maroon 5 is putting out now. I LOVE Sad and I am really enjoying their different sound. Fortune Teller and Tickets are great songs. I do wish Adam would not use that auto tune sound he does not need it. But I know when those boys get out there and play these songs live they will be amazing!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was great! I don't usually read Ophrah's pick, but decided to try it. I couldn't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded the book due to all the hype. For the life of me, can't possibly finish. Every time I convince myself to go back to the book, another 'holy crap' shows up in the most poorly written book. How can this possibly be on top seller, for this long? I'm not a native English speaker, but I can think of more variations of expression of awe than the book has so far! I want my money back.
B004XWLHI0|4.0|PG-13 version of SWF. Had they gone for an R version and did a little editing and re-write it could have been a cult classic in spite of the predictability. Regardless of the negative reviews, I enjoyed the film because I enjoyed the characters.<br /><br />Minka Kelly plays Sara Matthews, a girl from Des Moines, Iowa. She is studying fashion at a liberal arts college in LA. Rebecca (Leighton Meester) is her roommate. She is a rich local girl, a clothes whore who does not party. Alyson Michalka plays the floozy friend. Like Daniel Radcliffe, Alyson has been able to go her entire career without changing her hair-do. Near the beginning we are teased as a drunk Alyson removes her top for the Frat boys. They cheer and all we get to see is her back.<br /><br />Early on we get the impression (odious music, glares) Rebecca is possessive of Sara's attention/friendship in an unhealthy way. Sara's sister Emily died when she was 9 years old. She carries the memory of her in the form a tattoo over her heart. Rebecca not only dislikes tattoos, but in an interesting scene, we find out she doesn't have pierced ears. Very unusual for a college girl. Sara had given Rebecca some earrings to wear, who then uses the earrings to pierce her ears so as not to disappoint her new BFF. Big time facial close-ups for Leighton Meester. Like most movie psychos, Rebecca is cold and calculating.<br /><br />My main criticism of the movie is that it shows too much of Rebecca doing bad things. Rather the movie should show us the result of what has happened and let the audience try to figure out if Rebecca is lying or not. For instance in one scene Rebecca beats herself up and blames someone else. They should have never have shown Rebecca beating herself up. There is a lot of action at the end of the film which should have been spread out. The movie is its own plot spoiler.<br /><br />No nudity, Underage drinking, PG-13 sex scene, and it gave my cat nightmares.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Very good app.!!!!  Love the graphics! !! Never tried driving a ball from a moving helicopter before, this is awesome!!!!
B004V4DD00|4.0|Ben Affleck has been downsized from his company. His division was shipbuilding which is one of the last industries to recover from a recession. Ben tells his wife who goes immediately into the downsize frugal mode. Affleck is in denial and doesn't want to do anything to change their life, i.e. maintain the $600 a month eating out and dry cleaning bill.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones plays Affleck's former boss. He was \\"out of the loop\\" when Affleck got laid off. He feels bad about it, but like everyone else at the company they fear more for their own job than give sympathy. The movie smartly shifts back and forth juxtaposing Tommy Lee's life drinking unblended scotch, and Affleck trying to get a job while telling no one he is unemployed. He breaks all the rules in the book by not networking with friends.<br /><br />Affleck's former company is wanting to lay more people off in order to increase the stock price. They are worried about a takeover all the while they are building a new office building in downtown Boston. Affleck is not doing well with anger management at his job interviews as job offers require relocation and his salary reduced to that of my own...I almost feel bad for the guy who may have to sell his Porsche. Affleck is finding out a lot of people lost their job and those looking for jobs are more qualified than him. He is also too proud to ask his blue collar family for help. Tommy Lee is having an affair with a woman at work, Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) who provides us with some gratuitous down sized brief nudity.<br /><br />I really have no pity for Affleck. He has 12 weeks pay and he could have been working during that time for his BIL. His Massachusetts unemployment benefits (which is never mentioned) is more than what most of my neighbors make. He didn't downsize his life in a timely manner. Good acting, but there were no real New England accents in the whole group.<br /><br />The ending was unrealistic, but hey, it's a movie.<br /><br />F-bomb, brief nudity.nudity.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I was very disappointed with these head sets base was awful you could the speakers cracking even at a low volume! As far as surround  they should not even be advertised that way! There are two speakers in these headphones so I only heard left and right sounds! Never front or back!<br />Amazon is great! They took these back with no problems!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for everyone..........whether you are new to the Bible or if your a pastor.  Provides reading plans for every category you could possibly desire wisdom about.  Has great tools.....bookmarks, copies verses, highlights.  Also tailors to youth.  Give it a try.:)
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this game contains openfeint which is a malware virus! be careful what you download! I uninstalled as soon as I realized this.
0439023513|4.0|The Mockingjay is an interesting finish for The Hunger Games series. The first two books have some undertones and warnings about the desensitization of the nation of Panam that came from the reality TV child gladiator show, but this last one has a small change of theme. The theme shifts to how video presentation of war replaces the role that The Hunger Games had in the lives of the people and it also desensitizes Panam.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins's decision to write the series in first person brings an interesting spin to the story. Hearing Katniss Everdeen's thoughts makes it easier for the reader to understand the process by which Katniss makes her decisions, but at the same time it is a little bit distracting. At times it seemed as if we were missing a lot of what was going on in the story because we were busy hearing Katniss talk about what she thought about what was going on in her mind.<br /><br />Overall the love triangle brought an interesting intrigue to the story and raised the stakes a little bit for the over all series but the way that Collins finally played it out left a little bit to be desired.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I plan on buying this movie and the soundtrack very impressed with the take no prisoners honesty and the cast in this movie.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|This is my very first album from symphonic metal band Within Temptation. I'm pretty impressed by this album in terms of the musical balance they have achieved. It's a very nice balance between symphonic elements, pop beats/grooves, metal/rock guitar work, and good sing-a-long choruses. Sharon has a very powerful voice! When I bought this, I was new to Kamelot and Epica and I was expecting more of a choir voice than a powerful yet beautiful voice. She can really carry these tunes! Robert and Ruud are a good guitar duo. The leads are very good and the solos; FANTASTIC! These two are very good. Martijn is a good keyboardist. I'm impressed by the keyboards/orchestras on this album. The drummer on this album was only a session member, but congrats to him, too. This drummer should become the full time drummer as he fits very nicely with the rest of the band. Jeroen is a good bassist as well.<br /><br />On to the music!<br /><br />1. \\"Why Not Me\\"- Just an orchestrated beginning with spoked words. I understand this is a concept album and this is the intro to it.<br /><br />2. \\"Shot in the Dark\\"- A very passionate rocker. It has a very nice beat, orchestral foundations, very catcy/addicting-to-sing-a-long-to chorus, and an AMAZING guitar solo! I was blown away by this song. I am very impressed by Sharon's passion and emotion in her vocal performance and that adds to the already good music behind her. The breakdown in the middle leads to one of the best guitar solos I've heard in recent metal music. Even if it is lots of notes, it has a passion and spirit behind it that makes it sound unique and gives it that fire. Very good song! Very impressed by it!<br /><br />3. \\"In the Middle of the Night\\"- This one is more of a metal song than any of the other songs on this album. It has some riffing and a great guitar lead over some double bass drumming. Still great symphonic foundations, passionate vocals, excellent guitars, and great drumming. I especially like the guitar riff on this one. It has a very interesting tone and it just makes this song unique. I was blown away by this song also. Sharon's vocals light this song up and the music: very good! This song has a good balance between symphonic and metal unlike most symphonic metal that leans more towards one than the other. Great job!<br /><br />4. \\"Faster\\"- Honestly, for the longest time I didn't really like this one. But it has grown on me. It has a good beat like \\"Shot...\\" though it is a higher tempo than it and it has a more melodic chorus. The guitar work is very solid on this one as well and the symphonic parts keep things interesting. Sharon's vocals aren't as impressive on this one except for the chorus. The chorus is the usual Sharon I've been introduced to on the previous songs, but she is singing at a lower register and volume giving the song a different sound until she sings regularly in the chorus. The solo on this one is very good, but it fails to capture the spirit of \\"Shot in the Dark\\"'s solo. Good song and good choice for a single, though \\"Shot...\\" is the strongest single on this album, period.<br /><br />5. \\"Fire and Ice\\"- This is a change of pace. This song brings out the symphonic elements in the beginning as it is just piano, orchestral parts, and Sharon until after the 1st chorus. Then the rest of the band comes in. I love this song. Sharon's voice alone would get me to buy their other albums. It's hard to find THIS MUCH passion in a singer these days. I'm seriously impressed by her singing ability. And the band: GREAT on this song. The music in this song is very beautiful. It's a very intense song. Very good!<br /><br />6. \\"Iron\\"- This one starts of with a good guitar riff and builds with the rest of the band and backing symphonic elements. This one is heavier than the singles but not as heavy as \\"In the Middle...\\". I like the chorus of this one. The song has a very nice beat, good music, and good vocals. However, I'm not as blown away by this song as the preceding tracks. It's a good song, but I'm not as impressed as I was with the others. Sharon's got the passion here, but not as much here. The band overall sounds good here as well. The symphonic elements seem to be more up front here and the guitar solo is pretty good, but it's not unique like the preceding ones. The solo sounds cool, yet a little uninspired. Good overall song though. I listen to this one a lot.<br /><br />7. \\"Where is the Edge\\"- Like \\"Faster\\", it took a while for this one to grow on me. I can say that this one is a slower rocker with a good melody. I personally could see this as being a single. This one has the beat and emotion like the previous two singles on this album and it would sure be a better single than the next song. But anyway, it's got a good beat, a good violin part in the verses, drumming is great here, the music sounds very layered and Sharon sounds inspired again. The guitar and synth part in this song is very driving, catchy, and interesting. Again, this one would be a very strong single. Nice song.<br /><br />8. \\"Sinéad\\"- This one sounds more like a pop-rock single. It sounds more modern and there's nothing wrong with it, but I'm not too big a fan of it. It flows with the album well, but not exactly what I expect to hear from a band labeled \\"Symphonic METAL\\". It has an 80's kind of synth part, with pop drumming, a good backing orchestration, and Sharon's singing strong here. It's a good song, but not my favorite by a long shot.<br /><br />9. \\"Lost\\"- A very nice song. It starts off very soft and nice. I like the chorus on this song. I feel a little haunted by this song. I'm pretty sure that's the idea of it. It has some rather interesting lyrics, emotion, and a haunting backing choir/orchestration. Good beat and good backing music on this one and the acoustic guitar solo: AMAZING! I'm a fan of acoustic guitar solos. It then bursts out into an electric guitar solo. I'm impressed by this song as well. It also has a very nice acoustic guitar outro.<br /><br />10. \\"Murder\\"- Starts off with a heavier orchestration with a darker sound. The verses sound very dark and frantic for the slow tempo. Then Sharon sings more melodically in the chorus and it turns into a great song (not that the dark parts didn't sound good). It's a very cool song. I like the darkness in Sharon's voice in the verses and the dark orchestrations add a lot to the music. Pretty good song.<br /><br />11. \\"A Demon's Fate\\"- Starts off with guitar and Sharon vocalizing and builds into an epic sounding rocker. Nice guitar riffage in the verses with Sharon singing very nicely and some good orchestral runs. A very catchy chorus, very emotional singing in her higher registers, and just amazing music in general make this song one of my favorites (along with \\"Shot in the Dark\\", \\"In the Middle of the Night\\", \\"Faster\\", and \\"Fire and Ice\\"). This one has some metal elements as well. This is a heavier song than the rest as well. Very nice guitar solo. Nice double bass drumming and the chorus of this one is just one of the catchiest here! I love the catchiness of this chorus as well as the chorus itself. Great song!<br /><br />12. \\"Stairway to the Skies\\"- This song sounds good, but ehhh I don't care for it. It could grow on me, but I'm not too sure about it. It's got a nice chorus and some nice music and emotion like the rest of the songs, but there's just something about it that I'm not to big a fan on and I can't quite put my finger on it. Nice closer to the album, but I don't listen to it much. I usually rewind back to \\"Shot in the Dark\\" or to one of my faves.<br /><br />Verdict: I'm impressed by this album and this band. I've already picked up The Silent Force and I might have to get some of their other albums. This is a nice listen for fans of Pat Benatar, Evanescence, and Epica. For fans of Epica, it won't be as heavy, but the symphonic aspect is just as good. It's a very nice listen and I know I've said this probably too much through this review,but Sharon ROCKS! Her voice is amazing and I will eagerly buy their next album!

B003GAFA8S|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Police Academy.\\" I remember seeing it a long time ago and remembered it as a fun movie. Well, it was. The movie set up the situation with an announcement from the mayor's office, where she proclaimed that henceforth the Police Academy was almost totally relaxing admission standards. Almost anyone could now get in. Well, that set it up, all right. The next class was a rag-tag crew if there ever was one. The movie then proceeded to trace this class through their 14 week training period and you might well imagine some of the results. It was a fun and frivolous romp. Enjoyable viewing and lots of good laughs. The movie was a bit overacted, as is common in comedies where everyone is striving hard for laughs, but I was laughing at their antics.<br /><br />In the latter part of the movie, a big city riot drew the attention and demands of the police force to the point that even the raw academy recruits were given tasks, albeit minor ones such as directing traffic out and away from the riot area. However, riots can be mobile so that as it progressed, even the academy recruits were right in the heart of it and under severe testing. It was fun and frivolous. Enjoyable viewing. There is no great meaning to this movie. Don't look for it. It's just a movie where you relax and watch the fun unfold.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

0374275637|5.0|A great book that explains the processes we use to make decisions. It has application to any number of situations- if you are in advertising or an attorney trying to connect with a judge or jury- the explainations of how we think and evaluate situations are insightful and helpful.  Plus, Kahneman's writing is easy to read and the concepts are clearly explained.  You may need to read the book two or more times (I am on the second read) but it is just as interesting.  One of the best books I have read in the last few years, even the second time around.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Just spent the last 3 days watching the MI series with my sister on her 72 in monster screen. She had never saw any of them and thoroughly enjoyed them all but was quite blown away by the tall bldg scene. I loved it again as much as the first time maybe not but very much as well

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I have been a progressive rock fan for most of my life. I have been a huge fan of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Yes, Asia, Kansas and of course Rush. I own almost every Rush album, multiple copies of different CD releases, DVDs, Bluray discs, audiophile releases - Original Master Recording Mofi and special release albums. When it comes to sound quality of the recording on CD I have a reference of almost their entire collection of digitally based media. My opinion based on decades of listening to Rush on many different media formats is that with the exception of Vapor Trails this is sonically one of their worst sounding studio recorded CDs. The songs are great. The concept is great. I like the album but I strongly dislike it's sonic quality.<br /><br />On the positive side the actual songs on this album should please most Rush fans. The album flows well from track to track and the songs individually and together as an album grow on you with each listen. I like all of the songs but my favorite tracks in order are Headlong Flight, Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, Caravan, BU2B, The Garden, Halo Effect. Most of the songs on CA seem to have a more familiar sounding character and cohesive rhythm that may prove to be more accessible for the masses than many of Rush's previous releases.<br /><br />Back to the sad reality... It really is too bad what happened with this CD. This isn't a \\"loudness\\" problem. It sounds like a digital over saturation problem with the CD mastering. Like many who have complained in reviews here I don't necessarily mind loud if the music is detailed and clear. I was at Gibson Amphitheater (Los Angeles, Universal City) last year for the 2011 Time Machine tour and listened to an extremely loud but clear sounding Rush concert for more than two hours. Almost everyone had a temporary condition of either ringing ears or subdued hearing immediately afterwards but the quality of sound for the entire concert was phenomenal. At some rock concerts I use ear plugsbecause I don't like the loud distortion that is often prevalent from speakers that are over powered to the point of distortion. From my seats in the upper back  mezzanine section the volume level was right on the edge of being almost excessive but not uncomfortable. Gibson is known to have some of the world's best acoustics, speakers and equipment for concerts and because the sound quality was so good I did not feel the need to use ear plugs so I didn't. Last year's Rush concert at Gibson was by far the best sounding rock concerts I had ever been to even though it was extremely loud.<br /><br />The truth is that with the exception of a few songs and passages this Clockwork Angels release doesn't sound good to me at all. I like the songs. It should be a great album to listen to on CD. The fact is that it wasn't transferred well to 16 bit digital CD. They mastered the CD way too hot and it sounds compressed. It lacks detail and to be honest it's boring to listen to for any length of time at ANY volume level...quiet, medium or loud. I felt the exact same way about the recent Van Halen CD....I liked the album but didn't like the quality of sound at any volume level.<br /><br />Despite my experience with the recent new Van Halen CD I thought maybe I could get used to the sound and that I would adjust to this Clockwork Angels CD. While I have grown to like the songs I also have grown to really dislike the \\"sonic wall of mud\\" sound of this CD more with each listen. I can't exactly explain why but I think I even like the digitally saturated sound of the Vapor Trails CD better than Clockwork Angels. Unfortunately after listening to it for just a few days and really wanting to enjoy it Clockwork Angles has already been finding it's way into the CD dust bin part of my collection. I will have to dig up my Snakes and Arrows CD (which I think sounds fantastic) to satisfy my sonic cravings for newer Rush music.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Long time Rush fans and new Rush fans should listen to this CD before they buy it. If you like it then great. If you don't like it only because of it's poor sonic quality then you still might want it because it's probably going to be better than ninety percent of the new rock music albums being released these days. But as much as I want to be positive about any new Rush release I still have to be honest with my review. Keep in mind that I can only rate it as I hear it. I can't review the entire CD release without also taking into consideration the actual sound quality. From what I hear from this CD media release I rate the songs 4 out of 5 stars and the sound quality of the CD 2 out of 5 stars. I rate Clockwork Angels with an average overall score of 3 out of 5 stars for this CD release.
1439152799|3.0|Mid-way through this book I wasn't sure I wanted to continue, but I am glad I finished it. Interestingly, invited by Amazon to write a review before I was finished, I re-read the story line and was amazed that it didn't match the actual contents at all!! That was one reason I continued, to see if the story evolved to match the on-line description, which it did not. Despite all this, I think I actually liked the book!

B003Y5H5F6|4.0|It hardly needs pointing out how great it was to see Kate back in Selene's black rubber suit, but did anyone happen to notice that she was a merciless hard-*ss in this one?  You think maybe someone had the effrontery to upset our girl?  Not the wisest of moves, you have to agree.
0547572298|4.0|Let's get one thing out of the way: this book is confusing.  A lot of weird things happen, and you'll often wonder whether you skipped a page accidentally.  Or if you are reading the digital version like I did, you'll wonder whether the publisher made a mistake and left a page out.  But plug through it and the book does eventually make sense... mostly.  PKD throws out a lot of dots and connects most of them, eventually, but leaves enough unconnected lines that you'll still be wondering what the heck is happening.<br /><br />Whether or not you like the book will revolve around this.  Do you want everything neatly explained and tied up with a bow?  If so, save yourself the money and agitation and skip this book.  Do you like theorizing and walking through details to try and explain it to yourself?  Then this is the book for you.<br /><br />The book really boils down to what is on the back cover: what is Ubik?  That question, plus trying to figure out what was happening, kept me turning pages in the hopes of an explanation.  PKD does a good job of throwing out enough clues and hints to keep you wondering, while holding back enough information to keep you in the dark. Just when you think you have it figured out, something will happen that will through your theory out of whack.  I've read other books that try to do this that just frustrated me, but PKD strikes a good balance.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book.  It's an interesting concept and at the end the overall story arc is unexpected to say the least.

B007JOM0GC|4.0|I bought the album yesterday for 99cents, it was on one day \\"crazy\\" sale and Im glad I bought it. Although not all the songs are great (that's why I gave 4stars) for me, I think this is one of the best album she had yet. I think this is actually a collection as it includes the hit songs from her previous album.<br /><br />One of my fave hit is WIDE AWAKE and THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Caution: this review contains spoilers.  Read at your own risk.<br />I loved this film enough to buy it on DVD which I so very rarely do.  I've only purchased 3 or 4 movies in my entire life.  This was the best of them.<br />The movie depicts a young woman, Lee, who self-mutilates and ends up in a mental hospital.  Upon release she is far from cured because no one has understood that her proclivity for self-mutilation is really a cry for love not help.  The love that she is seeking is not the vanilla love that a strange friend (Peter) offers her.  Lee needs to be understood and in order to do that she has to meet someone who realizes that Lee really wants a BDSM relationship where she can play out her submissive desires for discipline and, when needed, punishment.  Under the over watchful eye of attorney E. Edward Grey, Lee finds her mentor and eventually her Dominant lover.<br />It seems that neither Lee nor Edward really understands their own BDSM needs but as the story unfolds, they come to understand what they each lack and what the other can supply.  When Edward fires Lee, we see that he does not really understand his own insecurity.  Far from being a self-assured Dominant, Edward is not really sure how he feels about himself or about Lee.  Lee, on the other hand, hesitates for as long as it takes to don a wedding gown, and then has a moment of clarity.<br />She runs out of the gown fitting knowing what and who she wants.  Peter who has proposed marriage would be a ho hum lover and husband sending Lee right back to the sharp edges and cutting herself anew.  She knows that she wants and needs Edward and proceeds to run directly into his office and plants herself in his desk chair until he understands how much she loves him and how much he loves her.  It takes him three days of Lee not leaving the desk chair even to urinate.<br />In the end, Edward sees what Lee has discovered.  They are made for each other.  They may not be perfect but they are perfect for eachother.<br />We should all be so lucky.
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't anything I would usually choose to read.  I had no idea the book was going to take the direction it did but I found it interesting to be able to get a glimpse into a different world.  I will read the second book but needed a change of pace before jump back into Grey's world.
B005CAATXG|5.0|I bought this album on a whim from their merch table during Ichthus Festival 2012. I'd never heard of them before that moment. However, they \\"looked\\" like a band I might enjoy.<br /><br />Enjoy is quite the understatement. Not only does the album rock, but they put on a great live show and take the time to greet all us who stood around afterwards (while Emery played in the background).<br /><br />To me, the album is a combination of the rhythmic sensibilities of TFK and lyrical and vocal earnestness of Tiffany Lee (plumb) with a dose of high energy a la The Wedding. It's only been a week and a half, but they went from unknown to me to my second favorite band. . . . And close to knocking out my #1 favorite.<br /><br />If you like high energy rock with a slight techno edge, get this. See them live. Buy a tutu.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|This app frequently fails to load (requiring \\"force close\\" or \\"wait\\") for functionality.  By the time I wait or close and reload, I could have access to data via hard copy not made (in lieu) of the app.  The calendar on wall never requires I wait or reload it to view contents.<br /><br />Also, cannot use \\"list\\" feature when away from wifi.  Again, being green (cutting out use of extraneous paper) is not an option with this particular app due to such.<br /><br />I have not investigated this app beyond those two features as I did not feel motivated to locate another function I would enjoy or need that would ultimately be useless and/or difficult or impossible to access when desired.<br /><br />Not recommended.<br /><br />Christine

B007P3TMW2|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie because of the back story of the twin towers but oh my goodness....the son who is the main focus was obnoxious.  I am so glad my children are not like that!  He had special needs, having a borderline autism diagnosis but my child with special needs never behaved so selfishly and annoying.  The poor mother...so sad because she lost her spouse and to top it off she is abused by her son. Watch TOUCH with Keifer Sutherland instead....so much better!!  The only thing that made this movie good was Max von Sydow and Viola Davis.[[ASIN:B008AITIXO Touch: Season One]]

Really great!

1477670785|1.0|Hilarious!  The title of this book is incorrect!  The correct title phrase is \\"Origin of Species\\" not \\"the Species.\\"  What a blunder!
0609610570|3.0|The book didn't have any damage to it a far as torn pages, folded pages, and the binding is still in great shape. That being said, the book was listed as having very few  markings on it, but every page is high lighted and every third page is written on.  I don't mind too much, but the seller should have listed it at a lower condition rating.<br /><br />All in all, great price for a book that is still bandied about the workplace movers and shakers; and as previously mentioned the binding was in wonderful shape!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game.  Its really addictive and fun to play.  I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who enjoys these types of games

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The heroine(?) in this book has to be THE stupiest young woman on the planet.  I read about 1/3 of the book, felt the need to wash my hands everytime I put it down.  Bought it mostly out of curiosity after hearing so much about it.  I knew it was very..umm...graphic, but far as I was concerned, it had no redeeming value. A waste of time and brain cells.  I'm no prude, but more than I could stomach.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br /><br />I was very excited when I saw this book was the Kindle Daily Deal a couple weeks ago and purchased the book. There seemed to be a lot of hoopla about this books, so I was excited to dive right in...and I've been reading this book (or trying to) since, I just finished it last night.<br /><br />As a few other reviewers have stated, I did find a lot of parallels to Twilight. I like the book to start, but about halfway through I was wishing that this book was over. Diana really got on my nerves, for someone who complained SO MUCH about being \\"managed\\" and claimed to be so independent, she sure was a damsel in distress a lot of the time, I agree with another reviewer that said she was treated like a child and took a lot of naps.<br /><br />There is a LOT of filler in this book, just mundane things that people do everyday. Ho-hum. I found myself skipping pages (a LOT) looking for dialogue. It seemed like this book just never had a point and the characters never evolved or grew in any way. By the end of this behemoth Diana had only learned to master just ONE of the MANY skills she supposedly has. SERIOUSLY?<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book doesn't leave me wanting to pick up the next book when it becomes available. I don't feel the least bit sorry that I will not find out what happens with Diana or her band of misfits.
0393064476|3.0|An interesting book by S. Greenblatt that traces Poggio's travels and life<br />as he discovers the forgotten work of Lucretius: On the Nature of Things.<br />It's an interesting bit of history of the 15th c but not enough analysis<br />of the philosophical content of the poem.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Great movie, just happened on it by accident and fell in love with the animation and the characters, No one is selling it in the stores so you have to buy it on line.<br />the Kids and I watched it in the car just a few days ago again and I was wishing that it was on HD, then lo an behold it was released the next day :)<br />Glad to see Disney Release it on Blu Ray!

B0073ODRKG|5.0|This is her first eleven studio albums in a clamshell cardboard box with cardboard sleeves for each. Having lost some of the albums in various moves this serves as a essential backup for my iPod with the remastered versions of her first three albums. It was a good price for a what was considered used but you would not know it by seeing it. It came in mail from a private seller through Amazon in a very timely manner. I am very happy with it.
0307592731|1.0|If you are looking for an inspirational book like into the Wild, this is not it. If you are looking at being motivated and immersed in the Pacific Crest Trail, this is not it. If you are looking for a really sad book about growing up in Minnesota, this is it. Not sure how accurate this memoir is and some of it is hard to believe and feels like the writer is fabricating.
B0086700CM|2.0|The game is fun but I never feel like a death is my fault. The game consistently freezes and lags? Most of these end up killing your character. Its impossible to make it far due to all the glitches. By far I mean the 3/4 mil point mark.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|The IAP is not in your face. If you play the game you don't need to buy anything, if you want to progress more quickly, you can spend to do that. The frothy idiots who complain about paying twice for an app they got as a FAOTD just want to whine. You can play the endless modes to earn credits for upgrades or you can just buy the damn things. I don't see the point in buying when you can just play the game. For those who think app devs are greedy by trying to squeeze extra revenue out of a game that probably won't breakeven, get a grip...they charge $1 -$2 bucks for a game and then have to face you cretin one star reviewers. I wish there was a way to vote down idiots.
034580404X|5.0|As a retired nurse, I felt there was nothing I hadn't heard or seen before. Most of what I'm reading so far hasn't shocked me, its just a different point of view. I'm not quite done with book number two, then on to book three. It's well written, and I find the author's moral voices are hilarious, and I wonder how the author obtained her wealth of knowledge. Perhaps like I did, you read about it or discuss it with your friends or if that's your \\"cup of tea\\" you practice it--no thank you.  Either way, it was money not wasted, the material well written, and don't believe what you hear. I'd heard the reviews on \\"The View.\\" Perhaps for censorship reason's they couldn't reveal their true opinions. Its one of those series of book's I call, \\"To each his own\\" and which so far I'm enjoying.
B003V63VNI|4.0|As a friend of the Boyds, I find Wild Trapeze to be a new way of Brandon expressing himself. I like the gritty sound comparsion to an old Alice and Chains albums but still with a tribal drum beat to keep the music interesting. It may not have the Incubus feel but that's why its a Wild Trapeze :) I liked it!
B00846REIS|5.0|most excellent...can't wait until the next book in the series to find out more about Gideon Cross...He's on the list of fictional characters I've got a crush on...Christian Grey, Jericho Barrons, Eric Northman, Matthew Clairmont and all of Karen Marie Moning's Highlander men.  :)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love it becouse it has different birds on different levels and plants wend you finish all the levels you could choise any levels you want
030758836X|3.0|I got the book thinking that it was going to be pretty good. It reminded me a bit of the whole Scott Peterson thing (the guy who killed his wife, but made it seem as if she'd gone missing). I'll admit, it started pretty well. The characters were interesting enough to keep your attention, and the locations were also enough to captivate. Even if the back and forth points of view got a bit annoying, well, at least they didn't do it in the middle of a section. The author had me interested for most of the book. What disappointed me was the ending, which comes across as pretty unresolved. I'm not one suggesting all books have to have a happy ending, but one where the male lead stays in character would be nice.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I enjoyed this tenth season very much.  I liked the episodes and how the producers wove past and present characters into the season.  I might have made some plot changes myself, but I think everyone has their own ideas about changes they would make in a series or movie.  That's part of the fun.

Adams scoffs at its distortion of the real event's complexity, warning that it falsifies history for the sake of dramatic presentation.  \\"Do not,\\" he chides the artist, \\"let our posterity be deluded with fictions under the guise of poetical or graphical license.\\"      It was a curious admonition for the screenwriters to include, for the HBO series itself does, consistently and often egregiously, exactly what Adams is shown warning against...\\"
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Joyous movie, great acting, and wonderfully funny, especially to those who have been to India!  I can't say enough great about this movie!  Nothing really to compare it with--perhaps an Indian/English [[ASIN:B000056BSJ Grand Canyon]].

1468161660|5.0|I feel like I have been punched in the face but in a good way. Colleen has so aptly titled this book because she slams you head on, making you feel every emotion possible. You feel them so hard-- sometimes you feel like you can't breathe and then you feel like you can soar. This is Hoover's debut novel. She nailed it. The poetry is so alive-- it's like it grabs you by the back of the head and makes you watch what's in front of you. This book is about living and living through it all--- the suck and the sweet!!!!! Colleen Hoover is going to invade the literary world!!!

0345803485|1.0|By now everyone knows the plot:  Anastasia Steel, an awkward, sexually inexperienced, recent college graduate meets Christian Grey, and the two slowly fall in love.  Christian is an incredibly handsome man, and every woman he meets seems to find him irresistible, even before they discover that he's a billionaire, as well as an accomplished pianist, a helicopter and glider pilot, and a wine connoisseur.  (And why would they suspect all this:  after all, he's only in his late 20s!)  Things would be perfect for Anastasia, except that Christian's sexual proclivities run to BDSM, to which he was introduced by a friend of his mother's--a Mrs. Robinson--while he was still a teenager.  The main--actually the only--theme of the book is Anastasia's grappling with whether she's willing to be in a relationship that requires her to be a sexual submissive.<br /><br />The quality of writing in the book is really dreadful:  clunky and repetitive.  The sex scenes in particular quickly become impossibly tedious:  I decreased the font size on my Kindle so that I could skip over them more quickly.  Erotica, like science fiction, shouldn't have to suffer from poor writing, but you couldn't tell that from this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is addictive I play it ever day and it is like the real ice age and Sid and the gang convince you to buy a lot of things in this crazy game but you get even more than you spend so check out the best game ever ice age village :)

B008GXHOFW|4.0|The best part of this free roaming adventure is swinging around the open city. Other than some minor lag this is a console quality game that gives you the feeling of being Spider-Man. Its worth the premium price. A must buy for Spidey fans. Excellent graphics for a mobile game, sort of a PSP quality. If you're a fan get this.

B0006HBERA|5.0|[[ASIN:B0006HBERA Bus Stop Board Game]]<br /><br />I purchased this game for my 4 year old grandson.  He loves anything that has to do with 4 wheels and a motor.  This is the perfect game for a young child. It teaches simple addition and subtraction in a way that makes learning math fun.  I enjoyed playing the game with him.  The game consists of heavy cardboard pieces that can be wiped clean. The pieces will not bend or tear easily resulting in the game lasting for quite a while and looking as good as new. The idea of the game is to reach the bus station by rolling the dice and moving your playing piece the appropriate number of spaces while going around the board. The dice also determines how many passengers are being picked up or let off the bus. Each bus stop has either an addition sign or a minus sign, addition sign you pick up the appropriate amount of passengers, minus sign you take the appropriate amount of passengers off of your bus. The game ends when the first player arrives at the bus station and then waits there until all the players have arrived as well. Each player then counts how many passengers remain on his bus and the one with the most passengers wins. Players go around the board once and you do not need an exact count to arrive at the bus station.  The game takes approximately 15 minutes to complete which is definitely a plus to me and a young child whose ability to concentrate is not that developed. Great game for kids ages 4 years to 6 years as well as the adult who is  playing the game with them.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I have used a lot of phones in the last two years and this app in particular is part of my personal essentials kit. The results are phenomenal and make even ordinary scenes really interesting. I've taken photos of my holiday decorations, cool shadows cast on my walls, and many other objects that gain new life when using the different filters in Paper Camera. I don't understand how anyone could give it a poor rating unless they are using a phone that has a low quality camera already which no camera app could improve upon.

B0079XPUOW|2.0|Having fallen in love with John Scalzi books via Old Man's War I had high expectations for this book. Expectations that were not met. The plot was overly predictable, the characters shallow and unconvincing, and in the end the funny wit of Scalzi wasn't enough to keep me reading. I gave up half way through to seek better content.
B004N70MH2|2.0|I write from the perspective of a combat veteran with the 101st ABN Geronimo recon platoon, Vietnam, mid Dec. 1967 thru mid Sep. 1968.<br /><br />Marcus Luttrell's book about Operation Red Wings gives none of the history of the operation itself, a marine operation that<br />was initially designed without the SEAL team's involvement.  The details matter. They matter because this operation was a disaster.<br /><br />Matt Axelson was correct when he advised his teammates that the Afghans who came onto their position should be killed. At the very least, the Afghans should have been<br />secured until the mission was completed.  But this may be skipping over what I think is obvious: if the team voted that the Afghans were not to be killed and were not<br />to be secured in place, then the team's mission should have been aborted then and there.  That was a failure of leadership.<br /><br />The disastrous loss of the rescue forces was a lesson horribly learned: I've read that the gunships were outrun by the troop carrying Chinooks.<br />If the gunships had prepped the target area with cannon and rockets before the support SEALS and soldiers were set down, perhaps the catastrophic loss of their lives could have been avoided.<br />I don't think that this was beyond the purview of Lone Survivor. Whoever editorially guided this book, failed to make it all that it could and should have been.<br /><br />The political tangents are poorly written.  And their tone does not so much engage as they may repulse. That said, I agree with many of his opinions: in combat, you do not stand on political correctness.<br /><br />For anyone who has been a long term combat veteran, I recommend the book. I recommend it because, as I read the descriptions of the team's movement to it's target site and the ensuing combat report,  I sensed that the story did not track. And I wonder if others who have been in combat have the same sense.<br /><br />Matt Axelson, Danny Dietz, and Michael Murphy were magnificent individuals, team members, and warriors. Marcus Luttrell makes that clear.<br />And his regard for them has been echoed by many many others in the SEAL community. You can never detract from warriors their combat experiences, whether of Gettysburg or skirmish proportions.<br /><br />But action reports rarely get it right.  This is true in civilian life: if you've ever been witness to an event that is a day later reported on television and in print,<br />typically you wonder how the telecast or article could skew it so badly.  Perhaps this is why I am skeptical about the numbers and specific actions reported in Lone Survivor.<br /><br />Skepticism aside,  nothing can in any way diminish the honor and esteem we hold for the SEALS who died and the one who survived,<br />nor tarnish their supreme courage under fire and absolute devotion to one another.

0817439390|5.0|My Photography Experience/Skill: Beginner (I got my first DSLR in October of 2011, so about 9 months ago).<br /><br />This book is amazing and I'd recommend it to any beginner in photography.  Bryan Peterson explains aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and the light meter really well and the explanations and examples he uses were very helpful and memorable for me.  I honestly had no clue what I was doing with my DSLR before I read this book.  I watched online videos about aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and the light meter before, but after a few days none of the information I learned really stuck with me.  After reading this book, I now have a better understanding of how to take a correct and creatively exposed picture.  I'm nowhere close to being a pro, or even a skilled amateur, but at least now I'll actually know how to use manual mode on my camera.<br /><br />This book is also filled with beautiful photographs that made reading this book very easy and enjoyable.  I loved every single photo in the book.  I only bad thing I can say about this book is that some of his explanations of how he took his photos were pretty confusing/unclear to me and still are (probably 3-4 of them).  A couple of others (2-3) were initially confusing as well, but I understood when he explained it later in the book.  For example, he talks about metering throughout the book, however, he doesn't explain where to take meter readings until 2/3 through the book.  However, despite this, this book is probably still the best photography book out there for beginners.  It's not long or boring to read (173 pages and half are filled with pictures).  It really made everything click for me and it'll probably help you as well if you're a beginner.

B002SJKWZ4|4.0|It takes around half an hour to learn all the different movements and program the wand.  Some of the movements work better than others.  Some work every single time while others take a few tries or don't even work at all, which can get frustrating after a while.  The wand is fun at first, but after a while, using a remote just seems easier.  Also, the wand kind of randomly vibrates every once in a while (when it's just sitting there), which is kind of strange and annoying at times.  I kind of regret purchasing this wand because I don't even know where I put it.  I bought this wand for $89.99.  If it were a lower price ($30-$40) it might be worth it to buy.  I'd recommend this wand if you're a big fan of Harry Potter and wizards, which I am.  I'll admit, it was fun pretending to be a wizard.  Also, you should get it if you want to trick friends or give them something to play while they're at your house.  The remote works with anything that has a remote/infrared, so if you have infrared lights, it'd be cool to use the wand to turn them on (sadly I do not have infrared lights).<br /><br />So basically, it's fun, but it gets old.  If you're tight on cash, I wouldn't recommend it.  If you're not and you can afford it, go for it.  Honestly, I wish I had spent my $90 on something else, but that's just my opinion.
B000026OHN|5.0|I already had these recorded by Gould and liked his interpretations although they were at times idiosyncratic.  I had always admired Richter's sheer effortless technique and this comes through in these recordings  Not just that, but these interpretations are also supremely musical.

0307957934|1.0|I heard Robert Harris discussing this on the radio, and thought it sounded like it could be interesting. Unfortunately I agree with others here that the characters had no depth - nothing to draw you in to their world. The Darwin quotes were interesting, and in the opening, I thought there was potential for some fear in the fear index, but instead, I got an ending telegraphed from 100 miles away - and felt duped for finishing the thing.<br /><br />I even re-read the last part, thinking is this really it? Derivative, and not engaging. Had promise of a good ride, but the promise is never realized.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|The last surviving Beach Boy to turn 70 does so in September. That's hard to believe. For most of the 60s and early 70s these guys defined young energy, with carefree songs of teenage joy that resonated with a generation and made them all filthy rich. As happened to many stars of the day, the success and money may have been more of a curse than a reward.<br /><br />Fifty years later, out pops \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\". Many male singers in their 60s and 70s show a pronounced deterioration in their vocal talents. Range and breath control desert them, and that sometimes also leads to an inability to stay consistently on key.<br /><br />You won't find that here.<br /><br />If you could cover your eyes and just compare these voices to their songs from the 60s, I don't think you could tell that this was recorded 40 to 50 years later than their biggest hits. Voices, pitch, the signature harmony ... it's all there. However, this is a very mellow version of the Beach Boys. Even the up tempo tunes here have a mellow, relaxing feel. Now, in honesty, that was always somewhat true of Beach Boys music. A tune called \\"Summer's Gone\\" should sound mellow. A tune called \\"Spring Break\\" ... maybe not. LOL<br /><br />I only hold back a star because if you were to try to cut out a Top 40 hit from this album, as you would have from their hit albums of the 60s, you won't find it. On the other hand, you won't find a dud, either. All of this music is beautiful, often with a haunting quality. It exudes a feel of seasoned professionals producing a satisfying sound. To me, it had the feel of mood jazz, rather than the jaunty pop feel of their youth. But then, isn't that a fitting feel.<br /><br />Recommended.

031236198X|4.0|This was a short, to the point, and enjoyable read. I have no doubt there is a main character like Fred in every organization who is ignored by the seniority and arrogance of organizational leaders when a junior penguin professionally attempts to address the possibility of a catastrophic problem.<br /><br />This fable can easily relate to any organization or business since all must deal with change under various conditions. John Kotter did an amazing job getting his point across, and I look forward to his next fable. A must read for teams, families, labor unions, managers, bosses, and any aspiring leader. You will learn how important it is to \\"listen\\" to others. If you unscramble the letters in the word \\"listen\\" you will quickly recognize that it also spells SILENT.<br /><br />Fred and his persistence saved the penguin organization from a future meltdown. You are going to love it!

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad season 4 delivers everything the viewer is waiting for and the end of the season wraps up a lot of loose ends.  Once the season plays out, the viewer is left with a big \\"Wow\\" and is left needing to see season 5.  Since season 5 is to be last season, they are going to end on a super high note.  As much as the viewer would like it to go on forever, the show is staying true to the character arcs and will conclude the best show and characters ever played in a drama series.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was a little late to the Hunger Games as I did not read the book until after I saw the movie.  I was pleased with the film; however, it seemed obvious in parts that the book goes into greater detail.  As I was reading the book I found this to be true with the most notable examples being the sponsor gifts and the history of Panem.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is meant to shock you.  24 children and young adults put in an arena with the goal of outlasting everyone else by either killing them or surviving while your opponents succumb to the element.  I like Katniss as a character.  She is smart and does what you would think a normal person would do put in her situation.  The Hunger Games is also littered with other memorable characters such as Haymitch, Cinna, and President Snow to name just a few.  Another high point of the novel comes with the emotions that are channeled to you through the characters.  What Katniss thinks about people in the Capital and how she reacts was almost exactly how I felt while reading.  I felt a connection with Katniss and genuinely cared what was going to happen to her.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is meant to shock you.  Unfortunately the shock value has been a part of the hype and it elevates a good book into a cultural phenomenon.  There are some problems with the book, with perhaps the largest one being contestants in the Hunger Games forming alliances with one another.  Some, like Katniss and Rue, and Katniss and Peeta, make sense however some of the other alliances were such unintelligent decisions by the characters it is hard to believe someone would actually do it.  Another issue I had was how the book ended.  While the ending itself was satisfying it did feel a little rushed and anti-climactic.  It seemed like the Hunger Games ended and the book was over 5 pages later with, in my opinion, some very important parts being summed over in a few sentences.<br /><br />All in all the Hunger Games is a very good novel that does a good jobat keeping your attention.  I finished the book in a little less than a week and probably could have got through it faster if not for outside factors.  The author writes a compelling story with real fleshed-out characters and leaves me eager to dive into Catching Fire.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book to the fullest. It was very well written and everything was written with such delicacy. The love story between Abby aka Pidgeon and Travis is like one of those really good college movies between the good girl and the bad boy. I wish there was more passion described between them when they made love, as much as they fought I wanted to see them make up twice as much. Overall it was a great read with a happy ending.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Just like original quell but with a couple of new pieces e.g. wooden spikes.<br />When you have finished quell, get this ( and hope for q3 soon).<br />Quell is unlike other games, and becomes very challenging and addictive, and has tutorials to get you going.

0062060562|4.0|As this story unfolds, shadows of doubt are cast on multiple characters.  For me, the story became 'thrilling' in the final chapter.  The early slow pace contrasts with the action and emotional impact in the chapter titled \\"Today.\\"  The suspense increases, and the read time invested pays off. As the final scenes unfold, the reader learns the truth about 'who done it', and there are numerous possiblities for a final resolution.  Will there be a rescue, escape, injury, murder, or suicide?  Kept me guessing.
0439023521|4.0|I had never heard of this book until the movie dropped a few months back. I intitially ignored the whole thing thinking it was in line with adolescent hype the Twilight series generates. After a while I ended up hearing enough about the premise of the story to have my interest piqued. I just finished reading the Hunger Games and found the book very interesting. I definitely want to see the movie now. I do have to admit that by the end of the book I was somewhat disappointed. It did come up a bit short in my mind, but not by much. Without giving up too much detail for those who may not have read the story yet, I want to briefly discuss what is right with book (most of it) and what I found wrong (some of it).<br />  First of all, I found no problem with the level at which the book was written. Some of the more scholarly and well read types obviously complain about the writing style and use of grammar by Collins. Im sure these types could point to some supposed masterfully crafted work by an obscure French or British novelist that more eloquently covers some of the themes and topics brought forth by The Hunger Games. The problem with many literary masterpieces is that the level of the writing is just too esoteric for the common reader. We cant relate to it. I have no problem with The Hunger Games style at all. I am in no way an academic but I do like to read often. Yes the book is written with young adults in mind, but I do not think it panders to the least educated among them. It is written in a easy to digest, everyman type way but the style does not seem overly simplistic to me. It should be palatable enough to readers of all levels.<br />  I thought the book was expertly paced and quite enthralling from the beginning up to the time of the Katniss (main character, well written) and Rue (interesting side character) alliance. After this point, I felt the story bogged down a bit. The story seemed to get a bit more preoccupied with hunger and the acquisition of resources. I know the book is called \\"The Hunger Games\\" but I found the descriptions of day after day of Katniss hunting, eating and sleeping, and trying to give Haymitch and the audience the show they wanted to see in order to receive \\"gifts\\" a bit tiresome. Yes Collins wanted to show the desperation and the Spartan conditions the tributes were operating under, but day by day descriptions became a bit repetitive. I reached a point where I was all too ready for the final showdown. But on a whole I would say 75-80% of the book was an absolute nailbiter.<br />  I also had a slight problem with how events with the Tributes played out. We all know that the Capital is set up to be the real menace in this story. They oppress the people of the Districts and are responsible for these brutal Hunger Games. However, the Capital is an obstacle that is not really addressed in this story. Most likely to be saved for the later books. So in essence, the Capital is like a program running in the background on a computer; its taking up memory and consuming a bit of power, but it mostly goes unnoticed. Because of this Cato is the biggest baddie of the story. The problem with this is that Cato is not interesting in the least bit. A tribute, bigger and stronger than the rest, trained from day one to compete in and win the Hunger Games. He is unhinged and rabid and utterly BORING!!! One dimensional characters like this make the reader look for nothing more than their inevitable deaths. We care nothing of Cato's back story or motivations and they are not offered. A character like his should be cannon fodder, not the main nemesis.<br />  The far more intriguing Tributes were two whose stories concluded most unsatisfyingly. One was an enigmatic physical specimen that seemed to be even more imposing than Cato. This Tribute was more interesting because the reader was left wondering how he was surviving in the Arena, by himself, in an area unknown to the others. His menace also seemed more unsettling than Cato's because there appeared to be more depth and calculation to his existence. This was the Tribute I was always wondering about and fearing as I read the book. He appeared to have brains, brawn, resourcefulness and enough depth to leave the reader caring a bit about his back story. By contrast, Cato was more unleashed dog or runaway train. More linear and simplistic. I sensed with Cato that he would simply come storming into a scene at some point in the book looking for blood. No stealth or calculation.<br />  The other Tribute who stole scenes (no pun intended) was the one described as being fox like, the most intelligent, wily and crafty. You also wanted to see how she was making it out in the Arena with no apparent alliances. You wondered when and if she might pop up to sneakily kill one of the Tributes for their supplies. You always got a sense she was watching Katniss throughout her time in the Arena. You wondered how and where her skills were forged. I will leave my thoughts on these two Tributes here, for those who have not read the book or seen the movie.<br />  One of the complaints you sometimes hear about The Hunger Games is the amount of violence. I found the violence in it to be rather pedestrian, considering the theme of the book. Its not overly graphic in its descriptions of the deaths and really only a few are even described at all. Most occur outside of the narrative and you only really know when the deaths are reported at the end of each day. What probably troubles people about the violence most is that it is all committed by or upon people between the ages of 12 and 18. It is sort of taboo to depict violence happening to and by children in our society. But I found the violence to be neither excessive, once again considering the book's theme, or perverse.<br />  All in all I found the book to be thoroughly entertaining and would recommend it. The flaws I perceived are easily overlooked considering the far more apparent strengths.

I really like how realistic their characters were. Travis and Abby weren't perfect, they both had their flaws. Travis was a total alpha male with a temper and Abby was just stubborn. At times I felt like kicking both of their characters, because they were being so stupid. But Abby and Travis were able to look past each others flaws and fall in love.<br /><br />This book was extremely addicting, once I started reading it I had hard time setting it down. I really liked the author's style of writing.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a great book and I look forward to reading more of this author's work! :)<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars

No formulaic notions here ... `just do it' because you love it is the take away.<br /><br />I liked it (4-stars) as both a quick read backstory to Stephen King and his prolific writer's ways.
B006ZZCLV0|5.0|Very nice set of books that tells a story that could easily come to life.  I just started the second book and look forward to letting the story take me away to their world of injustice and fear.
0553381407|5.0|Full disclosure: This reader had carefully tailored a full and lengthy review of \\"Toxic Parents\\". It had been a painful process just to do that.  Then, in panic or pique, he deleted it completely from his Word file! Perhaps he was embarrassed to display dirty laundry in as public a place as an amazon book review. The following is an attempt to start over with much briefer, less emotional comments.<br /><br />This is strong stuff.  It is guaranteed to cause discomfort to many readers.  The  authoress deals directly with many aspects of \\"troublesome\\" parents.  Candid stories from several of Dr. Forward's patients give a very real world context to TP. The authoress has clearly been there and is abundantly qualified to produce a work of this type.  The following is certain: Anyone who questions if (s)he has been victimized by miasmatic parents will receive their answer.  At the end of the text, there will be no mystery as to where one's parents fall on the toxicity scale.  The advice from this reviewer is to take a deep breath, gird oneself and plunge into the text.<br /><br />Extra credit goes to Amy Dickinson of the \\"Ask Amy\\" advice column for recommending \\"Toxic Parents\\".  That smart lady hit that nail square on the head, as she routinely does.
B00006AW63|1.0|Movie would not play at all, tried it on two or three different players.  My little grand daughter was so disappointed, it's her favorite \\"puppy movie.\\"  Waste of money, that's for sure. Certainly should have been advised where it would play.
0345803485|1.0|Seeing this book as #1 on the best seller list, I downloaded it to my Kindle without reading reviews or looking at the ratings.  After chapter 10, I had to give up. I kept hoping it would get better but finally I had to move on to a different book.  I found the book juvenile, very slow, and most unengaging. However my adult daughter loved it and read all 3 books!  Might be a generational difference?  Now that I've read the reviews, it seems as if this is one you will either love or hate.  My advice?  Don't make my mistake - read the reviews and take advantage of a free preview download and then decide.  If you like how it starts, keep on going.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|As I listen to Living Things, I am astounded by how mature their sound has become. The sound, while slightly contrived and over-produced, is crisp and clean -- much more so than their freshman and sophomore efforts. That doesn't necessarily mean &#34;Living Things&#34; is better than its predecessors. In fact, I'm one of the few who ranks &#34;A Thousand Suns&#34; as one of the better rock albums ever produced. I'm a big fan of concept albums, and &#34;A Thousand Suns&#34; blew me away the way Pink Floyd's albums continue to blow me away today. I don't know that I like &#34;Living Things&#34; better than &#34;Hybrid&#34; or &#34;Meteora&#34;, but I do feel their sound has evolved quite nicely while adapting to the times. I never cared for &#34;Minutes&#34;, and judging by the reviews, few others did either. However, I'm not quite ready to say LP has produced its finest work. It's going to take a lot (IMO) to top &#34;A Thousand Suns&#34;, and while this is a GREAT album, it's not immortal. We're still hearing singles from their first three albums. A year from now, I doubt we'll be hearing singles from &#34;Living Things&#34;. Furthermore, this album doesn't carry a consistent theme like &#34;Suns&#34; did, which means listeners won't be able to categorize the effort as a package deal. I fear all those reviewers who boldly hailed this as LP's comeback album will have forgotten this release six months from now. I gave this album 4 stars, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the average listener will have dismissed it altogether when talking about pop-chart top 40 bands.<br /><br />One thing LP has managed to avoid is what killed great bands like Korn, Disturbed and even Metallica. LP has continued to work hard in the studio and produce work worth listening to. This album will never be considered a sell-out or a letdown. Personally, I do not subscribe to pop-chart top 40 bands so I could care less about stigma or what Clear Channel radio stations decide what is a hit and what isn't. &#34;Living Things&#34; is a decent effort, and it'll sell accordingly. It won't be your favorite LP album. It won't be your least favorite LP album. Even so, enjoy it for what it offers.t. &#34;Living Things&#34; is a decent effort, and it'll sell accordingly.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|After all the hype I found this book quite average. While it kept me reading, waiting for a point to the story, I found the writing average and annoyingly repetitive and the lead female character aggravating! I wish her \\"inner goddess\\" would slap her.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book makes my wife happy and that makes me happy.  She has read it seven (thats just the times I know about) times!  She loves this book and is a big fan of the author.  Go BD!!  My name is Travis...now I just need to work on the attitude and get a few tats :)
B00007LZ5I|1.0|This dvd was inadvertently ordered in error as Foreign made dvd's do not work on USA players and I had to return it and re-order one from USA. The movie is great and well worth the trouble in trying to get the correct one.  P
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really cool and I think the only down part in this game is after playing The Mini Game with Scrat, and you get a good score, you never get a good prize.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this game is just like Sim city two great city building games<br />real good strategy games very great
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun, challenging fast paced. A game that has something for everyone. Wish there were more games like this out there.
