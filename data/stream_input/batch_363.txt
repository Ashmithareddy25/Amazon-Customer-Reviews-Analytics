B00006SFBD|5.0|What can I say other than this is one of the worlds most unique metal bands. Opeth has that ineffable quality to elicit extreme emotional responses. I can't descibe with words how deeply this bands music strikes me. Deliverance is no different than thier previous albums, meaning this new batch of tunes is just as impressive as anything they've ever done. The first track on the cd is an absolutely furious piece of work, I was actually surpised at how heavy it was. The title track is an absolute piece of art! The mellow part at the ending is downright scary, this is music I hear in nightmares. The part where he sings &quot;deliverance...&quot; is probably the single most disturbing thing I've ever heard. These guys have tapped into a style music that is so far beyond what other bands can do. Fair Judgement is another masterwork, the vocal harmony in the middle section is absolutely divine. Masters apprentice is another godly work of art. It's kind of pointless getting too in detail about every song because there's just too much write about. This album is something I can't listen to very much because it does something to me not many albums can...it hits too deep. That might sound corny but it is the absolute truth, like I mentioned earlier, it elicits an extreme emotional response. If you are a fan of deeply moving music do not pas this experience up by any means. Opeth is unlike anything ever heard in music...get this at all costs.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I have been waiting sooo long for Alicia Keys to release her second album...and it finally was worth the wait. It still sounds like her but you can tell that she has progressed. Her songs are very soulful and very vivid. &quot;So simple&quot; is a catchy song that I cant stop listening to and &quot;you don't know my name&quot; is purely awesome--truly Alicia Keys. If you enjoyed the first album you will like this one, but personally I think it sounds simiarly tothe old album.
0899668380|5.0|My first introduction to I am Legend was as a child in the 70's via the old Black and White Vincent Price movie based on the novel. If you're a fan of the apocalypse, vampires, plague or survival tales then this is a must have!! Imagine a world destroyed by plague and you seem to be the only survivor ....at least the only survivor with half a mind left. Wife...gone...child...gone...best friend...gone(almost)....just you and your canned food ...oh and of course the angry horde of seeming zombies who just want to kill you because you are alive. Rumors have been flying rampant and there is a script out there for a movie already that was originally going to star the &quot;Govenator&quot;.
0790742780|5.0|The film starts off with Michael Douglas sitting in his car, caught in traffic while on his way to work. His hair is cut short, he wears thick black-rimmed glasses, nice black pants with a nice shirt and a tie to go along. He represents the average American businessman. As we see from the very opening, this man has been pushed over the edge by society. He believes that he is right, and everyone that argues with him is wrong.<br />After a few long minutes of sitting in completely stopped traffic, he becomes so frusterated that he gets out of his car in the middle of the freeway, and just walks off. This is how the day starts for D-Fens (License plate name) as he looses his mind, and encounters many people on his way. The initial thing about this film that surprised me was that it wasn't afraid of boundaries. Michael Douglas' character is bold, racist, violent, and profane...so there's a good chance that a handful of viewers would find this film to be highly offensive. I give this movie credit for pushing the envelope and not caring what anybody says.<br />The main thing that I liked about Falling Down was how much it struck a chord with me. I always look for films that are different and share some same ideas that I have. I also believe that society is corrupt, and this film shows it.<br />Along with the great acting, Falling Down is highly enjoyable and holds up on repeated viewings. The DVD is average, with good picture and sound quality, so I don't have any reason to complain. It seems that most viewers either love or hate this film, so see it for yourself so you can determine...which category do you fall into?
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Everyone here is arguing petty points about the story of McCartney, Spector, and Lennon, but what they are ignoring is the music on this.  This cd offers a different take on Let It Be.  The old Let It Be is still in the stores everyone.  It's not like this Let It Be is replacing the other one.  We have gained another album. We are not losing an album.  That said, This album is basically offering &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; as something new, and a faster version of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;.  That is what's new.  Both of them sound amazing.  The Long and Winding Road sounds better without all the orchestration, in my opinion.  Other songs, like stripped versions of &quot;Let it Be&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; can be heard on Past Masters II and the Anthology, but the quality of the songs on the album here is better.  In fact, the quality in sound of all the songs on this Let It Be is better.  The Bass is a little Deeper, and you can hear things a little more clearly. The levels of the vocals are a little higher.  I, Me, Mine is stripped of orchestration too.  All in all, there is enough here to justify it's existence.  Don't make it into something it's not.  This album does not replace your &quot;Let It Be&quot;, it's merely a different take on the same thing.  We have only gained.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This CD is the bomb.  I really love the songs &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;, and &quot;You don't know my name&quot;.  If you have not bought this CD please go out and buy it. You will enjoy it.
B00005JM02|5.0|A strong and likeable storyline, coupled with some spectacular computer-generated graphics, makes &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; a perfect movie for kids and soft-hearted adults alike.  The DVD set includes the usual bells and whistles of a DVD release, including three versions of the film for different TV screens.  An instant classic and a must-have for every American family.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Tull have always had a way with seasonal music.  Some years ago I gathered all of the Christmas-type songs I could find which the group had recorded - the four songs from the &quot;Ring Out, Solstice Bells&quot; EP, &quot;Another Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;Jack Frost &amp; The Hooded Crow&quot;, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; from the flute solo on the Live album, etc., put them all on one tape, and it amounted to what I thought was a pretty decent (though short) Christmas album.  I was quite excited when I read that Mr. Anderson and friends would be releasing a full length holiday collection, and as others have stated before me, it does not disapoint.  While it's a little strange to hear new versions of the familiar songs, these more recent performances are by no means inferior to the originals.<br />This is probably the best new Christmas album I've bought this season, and I recommend it highly.  It's just too bad they didn't include &quot;Pan Dance&quot; and &quot;March, the Mad Scientist&quot; from the original &quot;Solstice&quot; EP.  This seems somewhat incomplete without them.
B00005QDW1|4.0|What can I say? Rock Steady is another great effort by No Doubt. They can do no wrong. This CD sounds awesome, especially after the first couple of listenings. This is a departure from their previous CD Return Of Saturn and their debut Tragic Kingdom. So if that's what you're expecting you'll be surprised, pleasantly I hope. This album initially reminded me of something from the late seventies or mid eighties. We all know Hey Baby, Underneath It All, and Hella Good all went on be massive hits for No Doubt and many of the other songs have the same feeling as those. This CD is polished ear candy and is liked by many people I knew who previously didn't like No Doubt. Rock Steady is great and I can't wait for Gwen's solo CD!
076790592X|5.0|Wow. Ever thought about death, life, the meaning of everything? Morrie lays it out and it makes sense. A good read for anyone going through any kind of crisis. Life is short, enjoy it while you can, share it with others.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys has been my absolute favorite singer since she came out with &quot;Fallin'&quot;. When I found out about her new CD coming out I bought it the day it came out on Tuesday December 2, 2003 because I had been awaiting the arrival for two whole agonizing years.  I memorized all the lyrics by Wednesday December 3, 2003. Thatz how good it was.  People who haven't heard her other music besides the sophomore and first may say she's shying away from her roots.  Well she's not!!! Some of her other work is similar to the CD and itz great.  Songs in A Minor is different from The Diary.  They are both equally magnificent but they don't have the same vibe.  Me being a fan of oldies (i'm 14) i most definitely love this CD.  People who say that she doesn't include any original work on this new album r just hataz! There's no reason to bad-mouth such a talented person.  My personal favorites are EVERY SINGLE TRACK!!  I'm not hyping up the album-it really is that good.  The intro made me feel like i was entering Alicia Keys' very private life.  It was incredible how Akeys turned a classic like &quot;If i was ur woman&quot; into a hip-hopish song.  It was brilliant.  I like all the little bridges in her songs and how some of them get uptempo suddenly.  Thatz off the hook 2 me.  Ya gotta luv that! &quot;U dont know my name&quot; is so personal n got me reminicing.  &quot;If I ain't got u&quot; has some deep lyrics and I can relate to that because the words r so tru.  &quot;Diary&quot; was so simple and mellow and sweet-i really like that about it.  The way she sings the first line(lay ur head on my pillow. Here u can be urself.)is so nice. The rest is all mad good 2.
B00005JKC3|2.0|For a couple of decades, I was a big comic book fan, and among the supeheroes I followed was the Incredible Hulk.  Over the years, there have actually been a variety of Hulks:  the animalistic, growling Hulk (also seen in the TV show), the \\"Hulk smash\\" Hulk, the pragmatic Gray Hulk and the genius-like Banner/Hulk combination.  This has given the comic an erratic quality over the years, and the movie is likewise erratic in quality.<br />At first, I thought the worst part of the movie would be the cheesy looking CGI Hulk, but despite the unrealistic look, it wasn't actually that bothersome.  Unfortunately, there were enough truly bad aspects to this movie to overshadow the bad effects.  The action sequences are often hard to follow, with many held in the dark.  The acting is subpar, with Nick Nolte acts like he's half-asleep and Eric Bana showing no screen presence at all; Jennifer Connelly looks nice, but doesn't do that much with her reprise of her role as the lover of a strange guy (like in A Beautiful Mind).  The writing itself is problematic, with a conclusion where everything really falls apart.<br />Other than the writing, acting and effects, there isn't that much wrong with this movie, except maybe the direction.  Ang Lee may be great with art-house flicks, but his interpretation of a comic book leaves a lot to be desired.  His division of the screen into \\"panels\\" is clever but overdone and calls too much attention to itself.  Despite everything, however, Lee does make it interesting enough to merit a two star rating.<br />The shame of it all is that this could have been a decent movie if there was just better writing (they probably should have recruited Peter David, who has more experience in Hulk-writing than almost anyone) and better casting (Bana is not good at all).  In an era of good comic adaptations (in particular, X-Men and Spiderman), this movie only stands out in its lack of quality.
0385504209|5.0|Few books keep you as interested in continuing to read as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.  Without question, this is one of the most engaging books I have ever read.  After reading through the first fifty or so pages, I decided to start over with a highligher in order to mark points of interest worth researching on my own.<br />One comment from a reader's eye: I found it amazing how Brown was able to keep the story moving in such a short time span.<br />Simply put: this is an outstanding novel.
B000002G87|5.0|Rolling Stone Magazine recently devoted a whole issue to the 500 best albums of all time.  I was stunned that this album did not appear at least in the top 10.  It drives me to drink that there are millions of rock fans out there who don't even know this music exists.<br />It is well known what the back-story is for this record.  Clapton fell for George Harrison's wife, Patty.  They had a fling and then she turned her back on him.  The resulting emotional devastation for Clapton wound up expressed as these songs.  When the original album came out, we knew none of this.  For the first couple of years, Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs was overlooked not only because the public didn't know the story but also because most didn't even know Eric Clapton played on it.  But on first listen, we knew \\"something\\" happened.  For all we knew, some girl who worked in a teashop could have dumped him.  It didn't matter.  Something real and wretched happened-this wasn't show business.<br />Most women, unfortunately, do not know men can feel this way this deeply.  This is not to fault them.  They simply fall into the common human mistake of assuming that if men do not express it then they do not feel it.  Most men know well that these \\"blues\\" are all too real-they just rarely speak of them among themselves.  Sometimes they can pretend they are immune to them.  But deep down men know that \\"that certain woman\\" can destroy them.<br />For all too many the only way we can talk about these things is through the anesthesia of intoxication.  While it is true that we often drink to forget, just as often we drink to remember because it is only with a numbness that we can deal and look at what's eating us.  So it was with Clapton.  He was taking large amount of drugs during the making of this album-heroin being just one.  Some argue that it was only through the haze of drugs and alcohol that Layla could be made.  Maybe yes.  Maybe no.  But even if were true that Layla had to have the \\"blessing\\" of intoxication to be made, it does not explain why this music is so beautiful.<br />I have listened to this album ever since 1971.  Along the way, every single song at one time or another has become my favorite.  \\"I Looked Away\\" is the nice, gentle quiet before the storm.  It is deceptively a \\"light\\" beginning; but it immediately tells the listener what's going on.  \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" is more dynamic but interestingly many dismiss it the first couple of listens.  Upon repeated hearings one becomes aware just how much this song \\"cooks\\".  Thematically, I would argue that Clapton's story is first summed up here.  \\"Keep On Growing\\" seems to a positive, exciting \\"rave-up\\" except a few notes of self-doubt which seep in.  The end of the first LP side of the album is wrapped up with \\"Nobody Know You When You're Down And Out\\".  Compared to \\"Keep On Growing\\", \\"Nobody Knows You...\\" is more somber.  It is a blues musing on how as times are good and bad friends come and go and after a while one is no longer so certain what those \\"friends\\" are worth.<br />Side Two begins with \\"I Am Yours\\", an acoustic pleading that in spite the loved one's coldness the singers love still flows from the heart.  This followed by \\"Anyday\\".  I am surprised how many people do not care for this song; but you would have to have a heart of stone not the feel the combination of hope and anguish as the refrain is repeated:<br />The second side finishes a long version of \\"Key To The Highway\\" and the third side opens with \\"Tell The Truth\\".  These two songs may seem to have little to do with the main story until one recognizes that both deal with \\"leaving\\".  The album then continues with \\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\\".  While good in its own way, this version seems to be a mere blueprint to the extended one which appears on the In Concert album:  one of the all too few examples of where the \\"live\\" version is much better than the original.  The third side concludes with \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\".A sort of mediation and prayer over a love in which \\"the water is wide...I can't cross o'er\\".  It seems it's all over.<br />But there's more.  The fourth side opens with \\"Little Wing\\".  Clapton worshiped the ground Hendrix walked on and he cried at Hendrix passing not because he left but because Hendrix didn't take Clapton with him.  So it has been all the more surprising and delightful that Clapton took Hendrix' sad, quiet and gentle song and made it raw, emotional and thunderous.  It is a successful example of two contrary emotions being expressed at the same time:  the lyrics are worshipping and loving while the music is heartbreaking and cries of desperation.  \\"It's Too Late\\" is a relatively simply and \\"clean\\" realization that \\"that one last chance\\" is gone.  It is a little gem.<br />Then we end with \\"Layla\\".  \\"Layla\\" restates the story of the whole album and begs the lost love to take the singer back.  \\"Layla\\" ends with a dreamy, grand instrumental suggesting a sweet reconciliation of the two lovers.  The time of distress and torment is over.<br />But with \\"Thorn Tree In The Garden\\" we realize that dreamy reconciliation existed only in the hopes of the singer.  It is a new day and our lover is still gone.<br />This is one of the greatest rock and roll records ever made.  Do yourself a favor and get it.  Listen to it a lot.  Make it yours.  You will love it.  And then maybe after twenty years you'll begin to understand it.  May you never have to experience something like it for yourself someday.A sort of mediation and prayer over a love in which \\"the water is wide...I can't cross o'er\\".

B0000DJZA5|4.0|There seems to be quite a bit of controversy concerning this release.  Much of the bile has been aimed at Sir Paul McCartney accusing him of just trying to make a quick buck from this release and doing it after Harrison's death.  I doubt any of us are going to know the truth about McCartney's intentions, but I for one appriciate having this disc on my shelf.  The original album is still in print for those of you that frown upon this version.<br />For those that do not know, the original plan behind \\"Let It Be\\" (then called \\"Get Back\\") was for the Beatles to eschew big production values, and make a triumphant return to the stage playing all new songs.  This live album would have been the official interpretation of these songs.  [...]<br />I was never a big fan of Let It Be.  The songs seemed pretty dry, and while I am a big fan of Phil Spector's 60's production, I really did not like having his trademark \\"wall of noise\\" added to the songs.  I find \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" a definite improvement.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" sans strings is a marked improvement.  The cheesy strings are gone for a more spare and less syrupy arrangement.  \\"Across the Universe\\" reclaims its trippy charm that was laking on the previous album version.  \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" has disappeared to no detriment, and Lennon's amazing \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" has claimed its rightful spot on a Beatles album.  The rest of the songs are not too different from the original album, but the new mixes bring out a more live sound that helps out the stripped down idea behind the recordings.  If there is a downside, Ringo's drumming is now revealed to be a bit under his usual quality, but it remains quite servicable.<br />I've seen some negativity concerning the fact that many of the songs have been spliced from multiple takes or edited.  I don't really see this as a problem as even during the 50's, when recording totally live was very much the norm, this sort of engineering was quite common.  While this is \\"Naked,\\" it is still a commercial product.  The songs should sound their best.  There is still little to nothing present in the way of overdubs, so you are hearing the Beatles in a natural light.  The raw takes may be compared to the album versions via bootlegs.<br />We are now faced with a rather confusing album, as there are multiple widely availible versions.  Both \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" serve different and worthwhile purposes, so give both a try and you'll end up with your own preference.  I personally think that it's quite nice to have a choice.ill a commercial product.  The songs should sound their best.

B00005JMFI|4.0|This is a warm, cute and funny Christmas movie! The theater was packed with laughs from the audience jerking in their seats from Will Ferrell's comedics. Will Ferrell is extremely hilarious and plays off the role of Buddy the Elf very well. It's a great family movie that people of all ages can enjoy. There's jokes for everyone, some crude humor that probably the little ones won't understand anyway. It's a nice feel-good movie to get anyone in the mood and spirit of the holidays. Also watch out for Ralphie from \\"A Christmas Story\\" as the head elf. <br />AND if you don't laugh once during this movie, someone needs to get you a sense of humor for Christmas!
B00005JMGC|5.0|Fresh out of graduate school in California, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) lands her dream job: Art History professor at Wellesley College, an exclusive all-girl private school in Massachusetts.<br />Watson is a \\"forward thinking liberal\\" from sunny California - finding herself in a land where women are educating themselves for the sole purpose of marrying well and then making no use of their intellect.<br />Surprisingly written by two men (Lawrence Konner & Mark Rosenthal), the movie has an all-star cast: Roberts, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal (you will be hearing a lot about her in the future), and Marcia Gay Harden... battling their way through the 1950s mentality of girdles, washing machines and pipe-smoking, well-bred husbands.<br />Intending to ace their way through college so they can get on with producing heirs, Watson's students have already memorized the text and syllabus, so Watson re-writes their lesson plan and annoys everyone on campus with her feather-ruffling, \\"subversive\\" ideas.<br />I was expecting this film to be a preachy feminist diatribe, but it wasn't. It was about lust vs. love, loyalty vs. society, and heart-felt emotion vs. hiding behind a sweet smile and a stony heart.  The film does not present marriage as a farce or promescuity as the preferred option - rather it embraces the idea that a woman can have a family AND still learn and grow and be more than a proper hostess and trophy wife.<br />Watson is not portrayed as the all-wise, all-knowing, always-right person - rather she is someone who awakens her students to the possibility that they can do more than be consumers and baby factories - they can know and understand art and radical ideas - without having to like either... but at least to have a more rounded view of life than the narrow objectives portrayed on television and print media at the time.<br />In the mid-1950s (when this movie is set), Watson's subversive notions do not make her popular with the staff, but they make her very popular with most of her students.<br />While there is no nudity and only a couple of \\"bad\\" words used, there are mature themes and lots of implied non-traditional sexual relationships, so parents should be aware.<br />While I am always impressed with Julia Roberts' acting ability, and even though she was the lead - I really think it will be Maggie Gyllenhall and newcomer Ginnifer Goodwin (Connie Baker)  that will be most noted for their performances in this film - believable, flawless and truly stellar.  Topher Grace (\\"That 70's Show,\\" \\"Traffic\\") makes another impressive (albeit small) appearance into a substantial film, ironically the love interest of Julia Stiles as was the case in \\"Traffic\\" and Tori Amos has a brief singing role.<br />In the end, this is a sweet, feel-good movie peppered with some bitter-sweet moments.

Out of sheer curiosity, I found some of their other songs and was bought.. hook, line and sinker.  I just bought this CD and must say that it's my favorite.  Evanescence is such a perfect mix of strength and beauty, dark and light, with fascinating rock beats and Amy Lee's angelic voice.  They have truly managed to make their presence known.  A MUST-HAVE.

B0000DD7NL|4.0|This is 1 of the 2 albums this year, only because I find the music on the radio lately to be lacking in quality. When I heard \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" I was so happy to see AK back in the scene to give a taste of what real music is, not like the talentless entertainers hogging the spotlight nowadays.<br />I love the intro \\"Harlem's Nocturne\\". I'm also a fan of classical music so hearing piano mixed up with a little uptempo gets me amped up. I've been listening to the album the whole day and so far the ones that stand out are: \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", \\"If I Was Your Woman\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", and \\"When You Really Love Someone\\". This girl is talented and can SIIING! She utilizes her strong, soulful voice beautifully. Her voice has definitely matured. However, comparing it to her first album, I think I enjoyed the soft mellow sounds of her debut album more. This happens to be more uptempo than her previous album. I was hoping for more of AK's \\"piano playing\\" on this one but that's okay. Overall, I say it's a pretty good album and it was well worth my money. If you plan on purchasing it, be sure to get the one with the bonus DVD that includes behind the scene footage of AK on tour and the making of her album.

B000085RTZ|3.0|The only bright spot on this album is &quot;The Edge of Paradise&quot;.<br />The songs fall flat, and Khan's singing lacks power. Of course, he can sing, but he doesn't have the voice that commmands respect. <br />This is the problem these prog/power metal bands face: Operatic singing without balls, range and power. I've heard so many power metal vocalists fall to that category.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Even though I'm only 32 I absolutely love anything about world war two.Thsi is one of the best i've ever seen along with saving private ryan.After watching this and getting attached to certain characters who i'm sure remind us of people we have once met or known in our life.These guys did truly save the world from evil aggression and dictatorship.If you don't appreciate your freedom after watching this then you might want to go to the doctor and see if you have a heart.A very gripping masterpiece of these guys and what they did.Anytime it snows or it's very very cold I think of what they did in Bastogne.You will enjoy this.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|This is 1 of the 2 albums this year, only because I find the music on the radio lately to be lacking in quality. When I heard \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" I was so happy to see AK back in the scene to give a taste of what real music is, not like the talentless entertainers hogging the spotlight nowadays.<br />I love the intro \\"Harlem's Nocturne\\". I'm also a fan of classical music so hearing piano mixed up with a little uptempo gets me amped up. I've been listening to the album the whole day and so far the ones that stand out are: \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", \\"If I Was Your Woman\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", and \\"When You Really Love Someone\\". This girl is talented and can sing! If you own her debut album, you can tell that this girl has also matured vocally. She utilizes her strong soulful voice beautifully. It's more soul than radio-pop. If I had to compare it to her first album, I'd say they're on the same level except that this is more uptempo than the last one. Overall, I say it's a pretty good album. If you plan on purchasing it, be sure to get the one with the bonus DVD that includes behind the scene footage of AK working on the album and other goodies.
B0000039PW|3.0|Biggie drops a solid first cd worth picking up.  Subject matter is nothing ground breaking and his flow is average (no Big is no lyrical god), but combined the cd is worth a listen or two.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'd never bought a Britney album before and I honestly don't know what inspired me to buy this one.  Reasons not-withstanding however, this album is actually pretty good.  True, Britney's singing voice isn't amazing but it's far from bad.  I'm not a big fan of her hip-hop influenced tracks but her 'techno' tracks are quite good.  If you can find this album for a deal and aren't an elitest fan-boy of music (yeah, all you negative posters), then you should enjoy this album for what it is, a pop-album.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This CD will leave you utterly speechless. I KNOW she has done it again!!!! This worth the experience. She is able to capture real human emotions in eloquent words over smooth sound music. I am in so much AWE!!! BUY THIS!!!!! Totally worth it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I've been waiting for 2 years and here it is! In the Zone is a great album and something completely new for Britney. No more pop stuff, this is adult.<br />1. Me Against The Music - Hated it when she performed it on the NFL show but I love it now. It grows on you. 9/10<BR>2. Boom Boom - Ying Yang Twins are useless on this but it is a great urban song for Britney. Next single I think. 9/10<BR>3. Showdown - Great kind of mellow song, one of my favs. 9/10<BR>4. Breathe On Me - This sounds like a Kylie Minogue song and I love it! Very sexy. 10/10<BR>5. Early Mornin - The Moby song. I just love this song. Its about partying too hard. Great lyrics about hooking up. 10/10<BR>6. Toxic - Great dance song with violins. Very impressive. Could be a single. 9/10<BR>7. Outrageous - Very urban song. By R. Kelly, totally unlike anything Britney's done before. The 70's R&B throwback in the middle is tight. 8/10<BR>8. Touch Of My Hand - The masturbation song. It uses Asian rhythms and is very creative. 9/10<BR>9. The Hook Up - This is a reggae song, very good to dance too. 7/10<BR>10. Shadow - An Avril Lavigne-like rock song that is by her producers. Very sad song. 8/10<BR>11. Brave New Girl - This sounds like an 80's song and she sounds like Madonna in the chorus. Its a very fun song, the most poppy one on the album. 8/10<BR>12. Everytime - Love the song and the lyrics but the vocals are too weak. It was excellent when she sung it on Saturday Night Live. Download that version. 6/10<BR>13. Me Against The Music (Remix) - LOVE IT! There are some Indian beats and its very upbeat. Good album closer! 10/10<br />I love the album but I just wish Britney displayed more vocal ability. It seems like she just kept it safe. But this is a really good step in the adult direction. It might not sell as well as her past material but at least Britney has one album of all good material under her belt. <BR>For those of you who aren't Britney fans, I think you will like the CD so give it a chance. Thereis something on here for everyone; hip-hop, pop, Euro-pop, reggae, rock, techno, trance, and 80's music.<br />Also, download, The Answer, Don't Hang Up, and I've Just Begun. These are great tracks that are not on the US versions of the album. The Answer is by P. Diddy and I've Just Begun sounds like Hella Good by No Doubt.
B000002WPI|4.0|If you only own one Wu Tang cd, then make it Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).  This is a classic disc full of those raw, crazy-style Wu-Tang lyrics and flows.  Recommended for all rap listeners.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|A. Keys is an innovative, mature, and sophisticated young talent with sooo much promise for longevity.  The Diary is pure artistry, lyrically rich, and something that we should be proud will someday represent our era in music.<br /><br />The Diary of Alicia Keys is an extenstion of its predecessor, the incomparable \\"Songs in A Minor\\", and like it, there is not one single song that you'll need to skip past.  At the same time it's refreshing to see where she's grown.  She knows that she doesn't have to shout it, no gratuitous/showy vocal runs are necessary, the girl just saaangs the song, you know?  I saw her peform at the Fox in Detroit and it amazed me all over again, how fantastic of a musician and vocalist she is.  All I can say, no... all I can PROMISE is that this CD is another classic, another must have.  Don't sleep.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I am usually sceptic about movies, especially comic book adaptations being a hardcore comic fan and all.

THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I eagerly anticipated the release of this CD in the U.S. and I wasn't dissappointed! Celine Dion has managed to create a CD with songs that reach deep into the heart and move you. The quality of the music is so good that you certainly don't need to speak French to enjoy it. But if you do speak French, you're in for a double treat because Celine sings some of the most moving lyrics I've heard in a long time. Jean-Jacque Goldman, French singer and superstar, adds his special touch to many of the songs which, for instance, produces the wonderful Irish feel of \\"Je Lui Dirai\\" that is similar to his \\"Et l'on n'y peut rien.\\" Other highlights of the CD are the hauntingly beautiful \\"Le vol d'un ange\\" and the irresistibly rocking \\"Ne bouge pas\\" that sounds like it comes straight from a Cajun bayou in Lousiana. Each song is a treat, however, that shows why Celine deserves to be called a diva. Pop in \\"1 fille & 4 types\\" and get ready to be transported to a wonderland of French music and soul!
0786112581|1.0|On the earth, only Americans are believing the Atmic Bomb attacks to Hiroshima and Nagasaki have saved millions people's life. The truth is they were done only for the demonstration to the Congress and the Soviet. The last chapter in WW2 might start like this if a Japanese writes the American history textbook. I would not miss that Japanese POWs suffered several kinds of cruelty by American soldiers.<br />Actually, this will never happen in America but happened in the case of Japan. After WW2, China has been interfering with Japan's domestic affairs. As for &quot;Nanking Masscre&quot;, it was forged by Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang (KMT) and supported in the Tokyo Trials with no evidences other than the testimonies of few eyewitnesses. Japan's cross-examinations were rejected (therefore, America might be an accomplice of this forgery).<br />Chinese Communist Party has succeeded in putting this forged holocaust on history textbooks for Japanese students. In Japan, anyone can write and publish textbooks if they pass the Japanese government's examination and, as you can imagine, Japanese government can not deny &quot;Nanking Masscre&quot; since it was &quot;confirmed&quot; in the Tokyo Trials though it was victors' unilateral judgement.<br />After the Tokyo Trials, Americans have &quot;forgotten&quot; that they supported China's conspiracy. Iris Chang's &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; is supposed to be the 2nd stage of spreading the propaganda in America.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|If you are a TRUE....lemme me repeat..... a TRUE erykah badu fan, you need to cop this CD. A lot of reviewers were balking that it was too short, too different, too this too that. Well everyone is entitled to their opinions, but the real fans know that this is just a filler until  the next badu creation comes along. I enjoyed it for all the reasons everyone else enjoyed. Its not gonna win any awards or have a  classic single (like Tyrone or On and On)  or even get played on the radio, but it will quench listeners thirst while badu prepares her next concoction.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Tolkien, the greatest writer to ever live would have been extremely proud of this series of cinematic perfection. The most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Thank God Almighty that I have lived to see and own these movies. I am greatful forever.<br />THANKYOU !!!!!

B0000640SA|5.0|I think that Memento is to be seen by generations to come as one of the most intriguing and best thrillers done in history. After  seen it, you won't be the same. In a certain way, we all have our episodes of amnesia which disturb our daily life and make us sometimes feel embarassed and/or upset with ourselves. We say to ourselves and to friends that our memory was not the same it was some years/months ago. Where the hell did I put the keys? My credit card, where is it? What was the maiden's name of my wife? But the questions asked on Memento are quite different from the simple ones we ask ourselves: Who is the murderer of my wife?, is the initial question. The second, sure, is Where is he? But things gets progressively complicated to a man enmeshed in such a personal tragedy and say he has no short term memory, and who uses as his very personal notebook nothing more than his own body. A good idea, isn\\"t it? The best way to remember things when you don't have memory at all, is to tatoo things in your own chest, left arm, right leg and so on. Stand up and read your body in the mirror and you will gonna have all the answers. Who killed your wife, where is he, etc... Or not? When to begin? When to stop? So many questions, so many answers. Somehow akin to Blade Runner in asking many intriguing questions to viewers.<br />This is one of the best films I ever saw. Ok, maybe I have also forgot some other good films to compare with Mememto, but the film is pretty much good. I will see it again, and again, and again....
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown has much to say in Da Vinci Code (most of the details which can be found in the very silly, yet richly entertaining, vaguely non-fiction book, Holy Blood and Holy Grail).  It is too bad that story crafted around his polemics could not have been more intriguing, the characters stronger, or the writing better.  Too often, characters give long speeches about &quot;symbology&quot; (by which I think they mean symbolism), frequently while being chased on foot.  I can barely sputter two words while on the tread mill but it is nice to know that a cryptanalyst and a university professor are so much more fit than I.  The author does keep The Da Vinci Code's action moving quickly though and has fashioned a very satisfying ending that wraps up all the loose ends in a moving manner.  The book is not all it could be but it could be so much worse.
B000022TSW|4.0|this movie is a hilarious movie,..,but the thing is it doesn't really have any special features.Only 2 trailers and a teaser. i was expecting commentary or a behind the scenes, or something like that. but the movie still covers it. it is genious.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album brang me on an emotional ride through amazing vocals by Amy Lee, awesome guitar solos by Ben Moody, and to sum it all up haunting lyrics and mezmorizing sounds. When I first heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; on the radio the first 20,000 times I never showed much interest in the group. I read reviews on them doubting the album's success and comparing them to Linkin Park and I had to agree from thier first single it sounded a bit like them. It wasn't until &quot;Going Under&quot; came out when I dashed to my local record store and bought the album, surprised at the results. This group is NOTHING like Linkin Park, I never heard ANY rap or spin tables in the lyrics. All I heard were resonating sounds mixing pianos, heavy metal, violins, and huge choirs making this something I could listen to everyday. Amy's voice engulfed me in melody flames, especially the songs &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; where her voice really shines. My favorite songs on the album are &quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, and &quot;My Last Breath&quot;. Evanescence has a refreshing new sound in rock that sizzles my ears with beautiful music. My favorite CD of the year.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has done it again with her 4th album In The Zone & now Britney has been writing some of her own music on her last 2 albums and she has changed a lot over the years like Christina & Leann have!This C.D. Has 13 tracks including the hit Me Against The Music featuring Madonna. In The Zone has great music on it & she also wrote most of the songs which makes it even better! This album is one of her best! If You Like This Album I Recommend These Albums!Christina Aguilera StrippedMariah Carey Charmbracelet,Beyonce Dangerously In Love, & Leann Rimes Twisted Angel
B00005YW4H|1.0|I was given this album as a gift, and I know I'm going against the popular grain here, but I have to say it like it is...her over-played radio \\"hits\\" were tolerable but after playing the overall collection of songs twice it just doesn't inspire me to play the CD again.  (My wife says that she sounds like a cat \\"yowling\\" on a back fence - a little extreme).    Fortunately, I had picked up CDs by Eva Cassidy & Diana Krall prior to receiving \\"Come Away With Me\\" and was blown away by their voices and musicianship...this made Norah Jones' efforts come off weak in comparison.  In short...it's fashionable, one note music that's tolerable in the short term but I'll be curious to see if the music endures the test of time or if it goes the way of the \\"Pet Rock\\".    UPDATE:  Yep, she went the way of the \\"Pet Rock\\" - vindicated
0061015725|4.0|Here we see the \\"old\\" Crichton again. He wrote a novel full of suspense after having done his homework in research very well. Over the last twenty years or so the topos of the magician's apprentice who uses his wand without considering the possible - and often disastrous - results of his doings has become a classic in modern stories. And this happens frequently when corporations are too profit-orientated to analyse implicit future dangers that may result from their new technological projects and when they accept possible dangers for the lives of people - or on a larger scale the destruction of mankind. Logically the novel's ending is ambiguous. It is the reader's choice whether he wants to be an optimist or a pessimist in these issues.<br />The characters - above all the narrator Jack - are well constructed to help the development of the novel and the understanding of a rather complex subject. There are minor flaws in the story's plot, though. Some twists in the action are not really logical. Why is Jack called in to help when he is a potential danger for those who call him? Why does his wife not kiss him at the beginning of the novel? OK, OK, it would have been a completely different story. But a plot has to be logical after all.<BR>Nevertheless I have enjoyed reading the book, I liked the story and I can recommend it to all those who are interested in modern technology and its possible dangers.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When a certain magazine of renown that has become incredibly commercial over the years, and has an annual &quot;critics poll&quot;, and this album was voted best of '97, my response was &quot;hmmmm, I've heard of these guys, do I believe the hype&quot;? I bought this record and couldn't stop listening to it. I've enjoyed all of Radiohead's releases since then, and look forward to more. I only pray that they never get to be &quot;stadium sized&quot; when they tour. <BR>As far as the previous review, I find it harder to believe that people would like Britney or Justin, instead of this. Count the number of sales of those two against those of Radiohead. As far as whether people actually like this album, I bought it only on the basis of word of mouth and reviews, couldn't stop playing it, turned my roommate at the time onto it, and she couldn't stop playing it either. I assure you we were both ga-ga over this disc instead of reassuring each other that we actually liked it. I rest my case. <BR>I can't guaruntee that anyone else will like Radiohead, but I can guaruntee you that there are many who now understand what all that hype was about.
B00005N5S2|4.0|The 1977 film \\"MacArthur\\" is well aware that there were two sides to the controversial military leader Douglas MacArthur, and you can almost see the makers of this film flipping a coin to decide which side Gregory Peck gets to show in the next scene.  On the one hand there was the brilliant military strategist and leader who directed Allied forces in the Pacific against the Japanese in World War II and for the first half of the Koran War.  On the other hand that was the vain and egotistical man who selected official photographs with as much care as he plained invasions and attacks.  Most of the credit in this film goes to Peck's performance in making these two diverse sides fit together for the most part.<br />The contrast between the two is probably best captured in two scenes involving Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright (Sandy Kenyon), who was left behind in command of the Philippines when FDR ordered MacArthur to get to safety in Australia.  Even though he promises MacArthur he \\"will be here or I'll be dead,\\" Wainwright is ultimately forced to surrender and MacArthur goes off the deep end, insisting that Wainwright has gone insane and heaping invective on the man's name.  Later in the film, on the day the Japanese signed the articles of surrender on the U.S.S. \\"Missouri,\\" Wainwright arrives, a gaunt figure after years of captivity in a Japanese prison.  MacArthur embraces Wainwright warmly, brushing away all apologies and assuring the man he can have his Corps back as soon as he says the word.  MacArthur remains the same man, unconcerned by the obvious contradictions of his nature.<br />Director Joseph Sargent frames this biopic with MacArthur's famous speech to the cadets of West Point, where he extols the virtues of \\"Duty,\\" \\"Honor,\\" \\"Country.\\"  Beyond a brief look back at his early life and military career, the story of the film begins with the general and his besieged forces in the Philippines.  But throughout the film we are supposed to hear those words \\"Duty,\\" \\"Honor,\\" \\"Country\\" resonating.  MacArthur is forced to leave the Philippines, but he vows to return, and he does.  The UN forces are almost forced off the Korean peninsula, but MacArthur retakes it all before the Chinese get involved.  MacArthur is able to force FDR to go with his plans, but finds Harry Truman unwilling to go along, thereby ending a distinguished military career of over half-a-century.<br />Which sides comes out ahead?  The ways Sargent tries to balance the two sides gets pretty interesting.  Both Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) and Truman (Ed Flanders) have their pokes at MacArthur, while it is a pair of his Japanese adversaries who speak to his military ability (scenes that are reminiscent of the Germans doing the same thing in \\"Patton\\").  The Presidents give the general credit for his military endeavors, but those accolades are buried beneath the verbal ripostes; on the political side the rebuttal comes from actual film footage of Republican Senators (e.g., Nixon of California) supporting MacArthur and blasting Truman.  Even stranger, MacArthur's aides are forced to play it both ways.  On the one hand they are doing everything they can for the general's public relations, but then there are also times when they basically roll their eyes at what is coming out of MacArthur's mouth.<br />In the end, MacArthur is not only redeemed by Peck's performance, but by having the final two scenes of the film be the famous pair of speeches MacArthur delivered when he returned to the United States.  The first was the \\"The Old Soldiers\\" speech given to the Joint Session of Congress and the other the speech to the cadets.  When you have a character who has been saying some pretty stupid things from time to time throughout the film and then allow him to reach such flights of oratorical elegance, it is hard not to end on his side of the ledger.  \\"MacArthur\\" is not enough to allow anyone to make a reasoned judgment on the man and his career, but it should be enough toinspire those who are interested to go read some books that can provide you better evidence for really making up your mind.to inspire those who are interested to go read some books that can provide you better evidence for really making up your mind.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have loved these two installments so far.  Not having progressed past the Hobbit in my literary knowledge of the series, I'm continually surprised and impressed as the directors vision and execution and have since put the leather versions of the books on my wish list.  Frodo and Sam continue towards Mordor with the Ring while the rest of the band strike out on their own story arcs.  Truly epic in scope, they redefine the fantasy film genre.  It's amazing the difference in this trilogy between say, Matrix and Star Wars.  There is a gritty sense of realism which filming in NZ brings to the table, it seems so much less sterile than the almost completely CG world of the first three Star Wars films.  The magnificent battle for Helms Deep at the end is so much more emotionally compelling and visceral than the battle for Zion in Matrix 3 it's not even worth comparing, the former is so well done.  The extended DVDs are the ones that people should wait for adding a lot of missing footage it extends and fleshes out the original theatrical versions by 30-40 mins.  This trilogy deserves to take its place as one of if not the best of all time, combining the best of effects, storyline, acting, and presentation.  Highly recommended.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This second album from Miss Keys is very nice...<br />Does the US released version include a 16th track &quot;Streets of New York&quot; like it does here in Australia?

B0000C1733|5.0|OK, here's the deal. The songs here are super, so we definatley have a five-star on our hands. That said, as the review title tells, the Chilis have far too many brilliant songs to fit onto one CD. Grab this one for a nice array of Pepper hits, or if your current CD collection doesn't provide access to the early 90's hit, &quot;Soul To Squeeze.&quot; While your at it, pick up &quot;Uplift Mofo Party Plan,&quot; feat. the late, great guitarist Hillel Slovak. Everybody has heard the songs from BSSM onward a million times, but very few realize the greatness the Chilis brought in the 80's. I promise you'll love this one!

B00005JKWJ|4.0|BLADE II  is a far superior film from BLADE in just about every element: the acting, directing, writing, effects, music, lighting, sound, plot, believability are all better in this sequel than the original. I'm not sure why that is because at face value, it would seem that BLADE II is a totally unoriginal film, borrowing from the best of action-horror movies. However, the film works and works quite well.<br />BLADE II starts off not too long after the original movie ended. Two years have passed since Blade saved the world by ridding it of the young vampire who was threatening to destroy it.  Blade has spent that time killing vampires and searching out their lairs, seeking to find his weapons-manufacturer, mentor, and friend, Whistler. In BLADE, everyone assumed that Whistler was killed. However, we soon learn that wasn't quite the case. He tried to kill himself, but the vampires wouldn't let him. Instead, they turned him into one of their own and beat him as close to death as possible and then began the procedure all over. Blade succeeds in finding Whistler and injects a serum into him that will either turn him back into a human or kill him when the sun rises. The serum works and things seem back to normal.<br />However, things aren't quite normal. A new breed of vampire has risen that doesn't seek out human blood, but vampire blood. Also, unless a vampire is devoured, it turns into one of these new creatures, too. The creatures seem to be a cross between zombies and vampires, but stronger than either one. Silver and garlic have no effect upon them and only sunlight does any substantial damage. The vampire lord summons Blade seeking a truce. He wants Blade to help him hunt the creatures down. Blade agrees, only because it brings him farther into the vampire world than he has ever been before. And so, the chase begins.<br />The action was quite good in the film and though much of it is derivitive from the Matrix, those style of stunts work in the world where BLADE II takes place.  I was also impressed with how fleshed out the characters were. All of the major characters were fully developed in this movie and we see sides of Blade and Whistler that weren't even hinted at in the first film.<br />Overall, BLADE II is a fairly decent action picture that is far better than the original film in the series.takes place.

B0000256VK|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!, with Killer production work, flawless musicianship, sweeping soundscapes, excellent vocals, exotic and visionary, imaginative, original and timeless, almost unbeatable in every department. A must have for real music(and I mean REAL MUSIC)lovers catalogue. Try Bryan Ferry's \\"Boys and Girls\\" runs a close second. Ignore the clownish boob who wrote the review beneath me, he obviously couldn't enjoy good music, let alone  understand it. I find his predilection towards grandilquent words to be both infatuistic and bombastic(oh and by the way learn how to spell).  I studied music all my life and I play many different instruments, so I know from whence I speak...This CD is not for the ignorant simpleton or the meek.
B000065U1N|3.0|To get the real gist of this battle that was a real cluster of an operation read the book.  The DVD starts out well but then doesn't jell together to describe the real highlights of the battle that are depicted in the book. But then again, movies have a difficult time capturing the essence of any book.
B00000I2PG|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this great album! Stunning production work! better sounding than 98 percent of all pop music ever recorded! even has powerful dynamics, which are absent from modern recordings. Must own for serious music fans.
0679411585|3.0|I read the book twice and saw the movie twice.  The movie does not do justice to the book.  It is the best historical record of a brutal battle in  Vietnam in 1965.  However, the book does not flow easily.  Nonetheless, it is painful to imagine the staggering losses on both sides with the Americans having a 5 to 1 kill advantage.  But 200 troopers killed in this battle from Custer's old 7th Cav made me reflect that history repeated itself somewhat because Custer lost about 200 troopers too.  Hal Moore had high technology to back him up in the way of air support and artillery.  Custer had neither.  And yet the losses are the same.  Politicians should read this book rather than us military history buffs to learn what the human cost is to wage war.  Like Fredericksburg, Ia Drang drives home the old saying that war never decides who is right, only who is left.
B0000067L2|1.0|I can't believe this. just recieved Disraeli Gears remasters. This CD was never remastered, I played it along with the orignal CD, AND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. Moral of this story, Don't waste your money on cream remasters. Also, no additional text, and no bonus tracks. I also bought Fresh Cream remasters, can't wait till it comes in the mail, so I can throw it in the trash along with Disraeli Gears!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Just a terrific series.  I keep watching it over and over.  It is really better than the book but read the book to get the details.  The acting is superb, the historical background is accurate, the stories are real, and the final words by the real Lieutenant Winters sums up the entire spirit of the series.  This one is right up there in the top five of dramatization of historical accounts on film of World War II.  If you like the airborne, military history, and first hand D-Day accounts, you will like this DVD.
B00005JM02|5.0|My family and I really enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  It has such an important message about letting your children find their own way, and has some hilarious moments.  My kids love fish so much that we ordered Captain Jon Explores the Ocean, and we learned so much about the ocean.  It was exciting to see actual incredible video of tropical fish in their habitat.
0743216458|5.0|Airborne troopers have a special bond.  Not to say that legs (non-jumpers) do not share the same camaraderie of soldiers everywhere.  This book gives a good account on how the American airborne, a concept executed by the Germans, developed into an effective military strategy by war's end.  A group of average American boys become Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment and go from green troops in Toccoa Georgia to seasoned veterans capturing the eagle nest of Hitler.  Read it then buy the companion HBO miniseries.  Former 101st Airborne troopers can stand proud because of this book. I had the pleasure of sharing a beer with Colonel Sink at the 82nd Airborne Assoication convention in New York in 1958 (he served in the 82nd after the war).  He was as crusty and highly admired as the character in the HBO role.  If you like D-Day history, especially first hand accounts on the night of 5 June 1944 as troopers stood up and hooked up to float or crash into Forteress Europia, you'll love this book.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldpay's debut album is a portion of good,relaxing and catchy nusic.as they are coming from Great britain there is something in their music that makes it a bit dark and atmospheric.&quot;Spies&quot; and &quot;trouble&quot; is the best examples from here.<BR>Chris dreamy vocals,flowing guitars,magical atmosphere through whole album...it is not genious or something that never have been made before - but definitly if you haven't got familiar with Coldplay this is a good way to know them.
B000089RVX|5.0|This has to be my favorite album so far, next to Maria's &quot;My Soul&quot; and Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot;. This is hard and ethereal at the same time, rattling your head continually with hard drumbeats and guitar chords, and the next minute, soothing your soul with &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot;...actually, I cry when I hear &quot;My Immortal&quot;. Long story. Anyway, I can't wait for what should happen next.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The task of following up a blockbuster, genre-defining film with a sequel is no easy task.  It is even harder when production delays and on-set tragedies push the release of that sequel from two years to four years after the original.  Faced with the pressure of expectations that are only exceeded by those that the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels endured, \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" more or less is successful in continuing the momentum of its predecessor.  While the awe of discovery and imagination is not present here (and couldn't be after the first movie), \\"Reloaded\\" still manages to pack eye-popping actions scenes with mind-bending philosophy, without getting too hampered by the incompleteness that plagues most `middle' films.  <BR><BR>\\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" takes place at an unspecified time after the events of the first movie.  Emboldened by Neo's (Keanu Reaves) victory against the agents in the first film, the first of any kind for the humans against the machines, the emancipated humans have been stepping up there actions against the machines, freeing more enslaved humans and creating a definite perceived threat to the existence of the machines.  Striking from the home base of Zion, near the center of the Earth, the humans have faith, thanks to Neo's presence and exploits, that the war is theirs to win.  Of course, the machines, sensing that they must make a final strike to eradicate the human threat, have sent a huge arsenal of sentinels boring towards Zion with the single missions of extermination.  Will Neo be able to save humanity from this threat?  That question will not answered here (it is saved for the third part of the trilogy, \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\"), but the actions that will set in motion that climax are presented in \\"Reloaded\\" and are quite compelling.  <BR><BR>In \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\", almost all of the characters who survived the first movie have returned.  Neo, of course, is back, as well as his lover, Trinity, along with Morpheus.  The absence of Tank (who did survive the original), however, is both jarring and barely explained.  As the Matrix was introduced to audiences in the first film, so is the city of Zion and its inhabitants introduced to all in this film.  There are many new characters added to the mix, which are too numerous to list here.  Some of the new characters are very entertaining, although almost none of them qualify as `good guys'.  The two twins who do battle with Neo in the Matrix provide some skilled martial arts action.  The always-gorgeous Monica Bellucci glows in an all-too-short cameo as Persephone.  The true enigmatic addition is that of the double-talking Frenchman, Merovingian.  It's not quite clear what he is or where his loyalties, but his rapid fire verbiage dripping with a thick French accent is both maddening and amusing.  It should be noted that even Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) returns, although somewhat `changed'.  <BR><BR>Much like the original film, \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" excels when it comes to action sequences.  An early where Neo battles more than 100 Agent Smiths provides a visual martial arts treat for the audience.  A later battle, which takes place at high speeds on a crowded highway, is one of the most suspenseful, white-knuckle action scenes to hit the screen in years.  Watching Morpheus leap from vehicle to vehicle while battling agents (and those twins) in an attempt to protect a vital entity known as the `keymaker' keeps the audience on the edge of its collective seat for the duration.  <BR><BR>Unfortunately, there are some negative aspects to this film, too.  Aside from the incomplete feeling, of which it is merely the victim of the `middle film syndrome', \\"Reloaded\\" doesn't blend the action and philosophy in nearly as seamless a manner as the original.  While amusing, the discussions between the heroes and Merovingian, are confounding and, when examined more closely, reveal nothing.  The same can be said of a later encounter between Neo and a man called `The Architect' (whose purpose will not be revealed here).  The Architect's clipped, harsh delivery and double-talk is particularly aggravating.   The human scenes also don't resonate quite the same way the did in the original.  There is one particular scene where Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is giving what is supposed to be a rousing speech to the masses gathered on a night to celebrate their recent successes.  The speech is so grandiose and so over the top that the message Morpheus is trying to convey is lost in the posturing.  <BR><BR>Fans of the original \\"Matrix\\" will come out of this film without the same sense of wonder that accompanied the first film.  Perhaps, they will even have a sense of disappointment due to some of the factors mentioned above.  However, \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" still strongly holds its own as a worthy sequel to \\"The Matrix\\".  The table has been set and the pressure is on for \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" to satisfactorily conclude this saga.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is even worse than I expected.  I actually liked<BR>her first few singles, before the snakes and ho outfits<BR>began to outshine the music, and I use the term &quot;music&quot;<BR>lightly.  But at least she was fun!  Now, what IS this<BR>supposed to be about?  Moaning over great production is<BR>still moaning, not singing.  This is the luckiest girl on<BR>the planet!  I've seen more talented people doing drunken<BR>Karaoke nights at the local bar.  Seriously!  Britney,<BR>stand still while I rip out your implants and cover my<BR>ears with them.  You make J-Lo seem like an artist!!!!
0345440900|5.0|With so many parenting books out there, and so many recommendations, I will say just one thing:  this is the ONE book that OB/Gyn's and midwives should REQUIRE their expecting mothers to read!  After reading this, and experiencing such positive results from it with my own daughter, I feel genuinely sorry for all the babies I see in public with mothers who obviously don't know how to read their babies' cues.  This book makes it so easy to understand and to adapt real-life practices that make parenting the absolute joy it should be.
B00008LDPU|2.0|i have to admit that some of the different parts of the film were very cool, but its just plain dissapointing when they finish. there is only about 20 minutesin each of the films, so they have to wrap each one quite shortly. if they had spent the time to make lets say four 40 minute films instead of nine 20 minute ones, i would have been satisfied. the best one was the detective story.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is simply an amazing artist.  With her second album, she proves that she has one of the greatest gifts in the business.  From beginning to end, this album is a pleasure to listen to.  Songs such as &quot;Diary&quot; and &quot;Dragon Days&quot; (and all the rest!) exemplify the type of sound that is the heart of all R&amp;B/soul.  Ya gotta love it.  Go Alicia.  NYC baby.
0684833395|5.0|Whatever can I say about Catch 22 that hasn't been already ? I can say that it is the first book I ever truly LOVED. It was the first book I ever read twice in a row. I can say I have read it possibly more times than any other [Who keeps track ?] at least 10 and maybe 20. I can say it still makes me laugh my ass off. I can say I LOVED ALL the characters even those I hated. I can also say I am very happy I got to shake Joseph Hellers hand and tell him how much I loved his book before he died. I wish I had had a hardback copy of Catch 22 for him to sign for me but I got him to do me a paperback. Well anyway I think Catch 22 is a totally wonderful book and everyone should read it. Many times for full effect.<br />And WHO the hell is Christopher Buckley ? I do NOT like to read anything about a book that is not from the author, I will rip that crap right out of the book. The Kindle edition makes it look like he co wrote Catch 22 which I resent extremely. This not a problem with the print edition because CB is clearly listed in smaller print at the bottom as writing the preface but his name should be removed from the Kindle edition especially as his preface is not included.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I came to this album as someone only vaguely aware of Radiohead and curious about all the fuss. I came away from this album trying to decide just where in my top 10 of all time it fits.<br />It takes real nerve to put guitar-based rock like Go To Sleep side by side with electronica like Backdrifts. It takes real SKILL to actually make the juxtaposition sound good! Each song on this album has its own very individual sound-world, and Radiohead somehow manages to sail across the transitions as if it's the most natural thing in the world. Which it is, judging by what I've now heard of their earlier albums.<br />Good music comes in many styles, and Hail to the Thief sets out to prove just HOW many can be packed into less than hour. Well worth the price of admission.
B00005JM02|4.0|Sort of a two sided adventure telling the story of a young clownfish named Nemo and his father Marlin. Nemo is inadvertently captured by a diver during his first day at school and most of the story involves both his and his father's attempts to find each other. <BR>I was somewhat bored by the general story and thought that dome of the scenes might scare young children (remember the minefield with the sharks and especially that very toothy deepsea fish.).<BR>I did really like the animation, the fish didn't look real but they had a very good look to them, Pixar could sure do a real fish if they ever decide to do so. The water effects were amazing, almost enough to buy the DVD for all on their own. I liked how the water looked on the surface, so real, the underwater effect was very good too with detail including the tiny specks you always see in a real undersea shot. The shark chase through the submarine wreck could get scary for a little one but look it over well, much of it has a near photographic look to it.
B000002BE9|5.0|I do not know what it is about this album, but it is the only work of music that can so completely bring me back to the time in my life that I listened to it. Every song places me right where I was when I listened to it before. This is one of the best albums around and everyone should own it. Her voice is filled with such dark pain and hope that it transports you to another place. With all the meaningless music that was not even written by the artists, it is so nice to listen to something that is full of meaning and substance. You can understand where she is coming from when she sings because she lived throught the songs. All in all, on the best albums ever--truly meaningful and heartfelt.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|Diary shows alot of growth for Keys in a few areas: <BR>-Vocals (much stronger and flexible, the touring and recording have and are seasoning her pipes, I'm hearing different colors in her voice that were not there with her debut.<br />-Lyrically the content is more mature, ie. &quot;Girlfriend&quot; from her debut.<br />-Musically it's creative with the piano highlights, yet old school with the string arrangements and backing vocals, ie. &quot;You Don't Know.&quot;<br />-The overall sound is polished and well cultivated compared to other music that's saturating cd's and radio airwaves.<br />Diary is a well appreciated effort by me, considering that &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; was COMPLETELY over-rated and over-hyped. Diary is above par compared to her debut. <br />Stellar Tracks:<BR>-If I Ain't Got You (best vocal and song for Keys to date)!!!<BR>-You Don't Know My Name (old school personified, although I could do without the cell phone convo. Having the guys do the backing vocals really added to the magic of this song-it reminds me of &quot;The Pips.&quot;)<BR>-Diary (mellow groove with seductive vocals).<BR>-Heartburn (&quot;CALL THE FIRE DEPT, IT'S OUT OF CONTROL&quot;)!<BR>-Wake Up (I'm feelin' the bridge and the percussive beat in the bridge of the song).<BR>-Samsonite Man (tight track-I love the piano and the acoustic guitar).<br />To sum this up, Diary is definitely worth a listen and the purchase. Keys' talent can't be denied, but she still has a ways to go and I believe she'll reach her destination.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I loved most of Sarah's previous work which have become musical treasures in my collection. The first time I listened the new album &quot;Afterglow&quot;, I didn't think it measured up but after a few listens I became wiser. Each song becomes quite catchy after 2 or 3 listens and I think that was Sarah's intention. The best songs are ones that you grow to love and they stick around longer than the average top 40 hit. <br />I love every song on this album. She did not rehash her previous hits but simply evolved from where she left off. Her lyrical content seems more driven by frustration and achieving peace of mind probably due to the recent events in her life: her mother's death and the birth of her first child.<br />Do not sleep on this album and do not trash it after the first listen! It's as wonderful as her previous albums.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Movies are like teabags, each sequel following is like reusing the teabag over and over; it loses its flavor.  T3 fails to do so.  Much like the terminators themselves we are left with a nigh-indestructable teabag that is cybernetically enhanced for your iced or hot tea enjoyment.<BR>    Instead of rehashing old stories, T3 adds to the future-history of the series, filling in old blanks and introducing intriguing new characters, i.e. Claire Dane's character (she acted remarkably good here), as well as our favorite master of disaster 'AH-nold'.  He retakes his old role of tin-head with a heart, while adding an sinister new twist to the mix.<BR>    Altogether an entirely enjoyable ride.  Lipton, be forewarned.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|David Bowie has played a million roles in his glorious lifetime.  First he was Ziggy Stardust, glam rocker and hit-maker with no eyebrows and an even stranger wardrobe.  He continued shocking the crowds over the years by experimenting with the then-unexplored worlds of electronica and grunge, finally grounding in the `80s as a pop-rock icon.  But if there is one role Bowie has never played, it is that of himself--until now.  With 2003's Reality, our innovative hero finally comes to terms with himself and proves that he can create an amazing album while still dealing with personal issues such as his role in society and the ominous idea of a nearing death.<BR>   Every aspect of Bowie's previous career can now be heard somewhere along the journey of the new and fascinating Reality.  He kicks off the winning lineup with the pounding yet never imposing beat of \\"New Killer Star,\\" a catchy tune that chants, \\"I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,\\" until the listener cannot help but tap his foot and start believing that he too is ready for all that Bowie has to offer.  Next comes \\"Pablo Picasso,\\" a peculiar Jonathan Richman cover that leaves you craving more, followed by the desperate yet strangely uplifting \\"Never Get Old,\\" in which the aging artist claims that he is \\"Never, never, never gonna get old.\\"  And after 56 years and 26 albums, Bowie has solid evidence for his bold yet valid claim.<BR>   The first time I listened to Reality, I sat through its entirety in a captivated trance, breaking only to bob my head to an unavoidably catchy beat.  I now gratefully absorb the cult-like chants of \\"Looking For Water,\\" (I can't breathe the air/ Can't raise the fight/ Cause all we've got left/ Is a beat in the night) and the almost Latin vibes of the reminiscent \\"Days\\" (Hold me tight/ Keep me cool/ Going mad/ Don't know what to do/ Did I need a friend?/ Well I need one now).  \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" stands out as one of the strongest tracks, the cover of a song created by the late George Harrison that would make the Quiet Beatle smile in his grave if only he could hear it.  But no other song on the album meets the jazzy charm of the final track, \\"Bring Me the Disco King.\\"  A whopping eight minutes, its sultry piano riffs and bizarre, spooky vocals help it stand out as the most original tune on Reality.<BR>   Whatever your mood, David Bowie's latest album is apt to be the fitting soundtrack.  Don't expect another metamorphosis of his career, but rather an album about the \\"real\\" David Bowie--one that confirms with grace his secure position in our ever-changing music scene.
B00005JL78|2.0|Sure the acting was nice, the effects awesome, but this was one boring movie (that's just from a visceral point of view w/o any specifics). One major gripe of mine is that this movie tried being metaphysical in terms of predestination and intellectual time travel. No matter how carefully you craft your plot and script, there's bound to be gaps too big to fill in a couple hours. So if the metaphysics is a deal breaker and there's no other action elsewhere, there's no point watching this waste of celluloid.
B00005NKW3|3.0|There are some movies, despite their faults, that will never lose their place in America's heart.  Turn on your television up to two months before December 25th, and chances are you'll see a miniature Natalie Wood (who later starred in both West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause) gazing into the twinkly eyes of a dwarfed and frighteningly jolly \\"Santa Claus\\" (Edmund Gwenn), telling him sternly that she does not believe he is really Kris Kringle.  You've stumbled upon one of the most famous holiday flicks in history: Miracle on 34th Street, filmed in glorious black and white.<BR> After 97 minutes of sugary, cheerful simplicity, little Susan (Natalie Wood) and the rest of New York has been convinced that Macy's Santa Claus is indeed the real thing--the crafty old man even tricks the United States government into believing in him.  As you can see, this is not the most realistic of all stories... though definitely optimistic in its assumption that the Supreme Court has the compassion to rule that reindeers can fly for the mere sake of saving a dying lunatic.<BR> Maureen O'Hara, who plays Susan's mom, does an awful job as an actress.  Every woman over the age of 50 will probably dismiss my naive judgment of their former idol, but, like most bad actresses of her day, I think O'Hara is over dramatic and extremely unrealistic.  In this way, her performance reflects the entire movie--very cute, yes, but leaving you with a sickeningly sweet aftertaste similar to that which can be obtained from listening to an entire album of sappy \\"White Christmas\\" remakes.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|One listen to &quot;You Don't Know my Name&quot; and you can clearly see that Alicia Keys has narrowly side stepped the sophomore slump with The Diary of Alicia Keys. The album showcases her undeniable love for smooth, old-school soul as well as classical piano instrumentals which make her sound so unique among the artists in the industry today.<br />Despite her undeniable talents, she lacks the charisma &amp; bluesy sounds that artists like Erykah Badu &amp; Jill Scott have already mastered. And while the album is indeed a pretty thorough listen, it doesn't have the type of songs that made her debut so damn likeable, such as &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Goodbye&quot; &amp; &quot;Why Do I Feel So Sad&quot;. In its favor, songs such as the pulsating &quot;Karma&quot; &amp; her incredible cover of Gladys Knight's &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot; are greatest hits worthy.<br />Elsewhere on the album, she dwindles into mediocrity on such songs as &quot;Diary&quot; &amp; &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, but impressively recovers with the oddly titled &quot;Samsonite Man&quot; &amp; &quot;Nobody not Really&quot;. I hate to strattle the fence, but while their are key errors that cease the apportunity for the album to be dubbed flawless, Alicia proves herself as an amazing artist one with so much potential its haunting.<br />If she combined the best songs from both albums and releases them together in the form of a recorded live collection, I think that she would finally achieve the perfect album that she is trying to attain. I'm intrested in seeing where her career will take her and I'm stamping this one as an early favorite to dominate the 2004 Grammy awards.
0743506650|5.0|Stephen King's humorous account of his career as a writer since childhood is a great motivator for writers.  He provides excellent tips and even if you've never written before, he will make you want to start.  On Writing motivated me to write my novel, Time To Heal, which has since been published!
6301978587|3.0|When \\"Yentl\\" was first released it proved to be neither the I-told-you-so triumph producer-director-star Barbra Streisand hoped, nor the total failure detractors  gleefully predicted. In years since, \\"Yentl\\" has become the punchline for many jokes, particularly from men who were dragged to see it with their wives or girlfriends, but most of those jokes aren't warranted.<br /><br />As a director, Streisand has much to be proud of. She gets stellar performances from co-stars Mandy Patinkin and Amy Irving (Streisand has proven herself to be an actor's director), the photography is lush and she makes the non-commercial story quite compelling. The movie's main weakness, though, is Streisand's work in front of the camera. Being miscast is nothing new for the star of \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" and \\"A Star is Born,\\" but usually she's buoyed by her star power. In \\"Yentl,\\" that star power is a detriment. We never buy Streisand as anyone other than Streisand, and we certainly don't buy her as a boy. \\"Yentl\\" needed an actress, not a star.<br /><br />However, not many film actresses have Streisand's voice, and this is a musical, after all. The songs in \\"Yentl\\" -- all sung by Streisand; fellow singer Patinkin doesn't even hum along -- function as internal monologues, and as such they work fine in the context of the movie. But this is no \\"Funny Girl,\\" despite a finale that looks very similar to that movie's \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" sequence. There are few tunes that will be stuck in your head by the final credits. Turning \\"Yentl\\" into a musical seemed more of a concession to the studio, anyway.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, and despite what all those snarky husbands and boyfriends say about it, \\"Yentl\\" proved Streisand's formidable talents aren't just limited to singing and acting.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|I found this soundtrack to be a total disappointment. It sounded like a lazy ripoff of the Gladiator and Crimson Tide soundtracks.<br />It's just a shame the soundtrack didn't live up to the movie's originality.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a fine collection of Nirvana, no doubt! I love just about every song on the Cd. If you don't have any of Nirvana's Cd's buy this one! You will love it.
B00004YZFQ|5.0|This video should be seen along with reading Rolling Stone issue #50 and Sonny Barger's book 'Hell's Angel' for a full perspective  of that day.
B00005QB9A|5.0|I've read the negative and I've read the positive and I can't help but think the negative reviewers just didn't get it.<br />Sometimes movies are meant to make you think (often foreign and Independent films) and other times movies are meant strictly to entertain.<br />This movie walks a tightrope, and I feel the negative reviews are due to people both taking the film too seriously and not taking the film seriously enough.<br />I watched this movie for the first time, not knowing what to expect.  As the end credits rolled there were tears in my eyes and a smile on my face.  Within a couple weeks I went out and bought a copy of it on DVD.<br />Anyone I've shared this film with has thoroughly enjoyed it, they watched with no expectations and by the time the end credits were rolling there were smiles on their faces or tears in their eyes.<br />If a movie can elicit such a strong emotional response, be it positive, or negative it has done its job.  This movie not only did it's job it's kept me coming back for seconds, thirds, and...  well you get the idea.<br />Tim Roth is brilliant, and while I wasn't a fan of his before this film, I certainly was afterwards.  Knowing he can play vile and venomous (in &quot;Rob Roy&quot;), quirky and fun (&quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern are Dead&quot;), piss and vinegar (&quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;) and then take a turn in an utterly sentimental role truly shows his versatility.<br />Ignore the naysayers and give this film a chance, you won't regret it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I was instantly hooked with the Dance of Death song and the whole album just rocks! Iron Maiden prove again that they are kings of metal (I don't even want to compare Metallica to that, 'cause they are sad history!)
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD is almost too much to watch.  If you want a moment away from the banality of current music landscape, enjoy this with some friends and revel in pure love for George and what he gave us.  Audio and visual quality are outstanding, makes you want to cry and laugh.  Can't ask for anything more.
B00006879E|5.0|I was so tempted to write a review three month ago when I first got their Album, but then my opinion would have too biased. After a while to calm down, and finally replacing the Cd player in the car from Songs About Jane with The Stroke's Room On Fire. I still can't help giving them 5 stars. <br />Their music is a fresh new breed, something I have not heard before. To call them Pop would be injustice! Maroon5 is a Alternative Rock with Massive Soul and Funk influence, a couple of their songs may have a pop feel, but overall Alternative Rock is more accurate. Perhaps a new genre could be introduced to better describe them. <br />Songs about Jane is so intoxicating, almost emotionally addictive. I could't really find a song that I didn't like, for argument sake, I found the song &quot;secret&quot; a bit too soft and slow, but maybe that's just because I am so used to heavier rock. Even then, I don't skip it. The entire album has a slightly melancholy feel, but each song is different. I had the cd playing for weeks before rotating it down, I will try to keep them off for a while to avoid wearing out the music, after all i probably heard each song a dozen times already.    <br />Its getting hard to find new music, especially with all the rap and hip hop bloating the industry. Songs About Jane was a rare find, making it even better. There are 2 songs on their site to sample aside from the overplayed Harder to Breath. I am sure that will be enough to convince you to get the cd.
B000000W6X|3.0|This is a decent CD, but not quite as good as Mezzanine.  I was hoping for more lyrical goodness from MA, instead I was greated with a lot of instrumental tracks and lackluster vocals.  Despite its shortcomings, however, it will be one of my main CD's for quite awhile.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I'm really feeling this album. All eyes was on this album because the first CD, Songs in A Minor, do so well. And it's uncommon for a artist to come out so strong on their first CD, and come out even STRONGER on their second. I'm really feeling the intro...Harlem's Nocturne. And maybe it's just the beat, but I be bangin Heartburn on my CD player. Her current single, U Don't Know My Name...is off day chain. My baby Mos Def is looking sexier than ever! If I was your woman and When u really luv someone, had a sista reminiscing. If I Ain't Got U and Slow Down was aiiight at first, but after listening to it more and actual sitting down and listening to the words...there two of my favorite songs. To get to the point, this CD is HOT! Her, Mary J. Blige, Jill Scott, and Floetry are showing current R&B female artist in the industry today how it should be done!<br />1. Harlem's Nocturne - 5/5<BR>2. Karma - 3.5/5 (If u can relate to it - 4/5)<BR>4. If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By - 4/5<BR>5. U Don't Know My Name - 5/5<BR>6. If I Ain't Got U - 5/5<BR>7.

B00005O438|5.0|Cujo is one of the friggin' best dog movies! who wouldn't live a movie with violence, horror, and a not-so adorable saint bernard?<br />This movie is basically about a friggin' psycho dog that hates everybody. this movie reminded me about the friggin' psycho dog I came across when i was trick or treating this year. you gotta love this movie, even the kids'll love it. F.Y.I.:I  also reccomend Christine in additoin to this movie.
B000000WCV|5.0|This is one of the most important albums of the 90's. Put it this way, I remember where I was, and what I was doing the first time I heard this record.<br />I was dancing, by the way.<br />If you have any roots in house, r&b, funk, soul, and rock n' roll, they cover the visceral experience of these latter genres. One has to understand the fact that it's not a deeply serious record, which lifts the burden of digging for something truly meaningful. Because, when you let your guard down and open your ears, this record will make you smile more with every listen. It's so carefree, and fun. That's all the attitude you need to dance. <br />Sure, this album may not deserve 5 stars for musicality. But, its sheer importance to me, and its ability to sound fresh with each new day while flashing me back to the moment I heard Daft Punk for the first time has made me more than just a fan. I am Daft Punk's disco disciple.<BR>   <BR>Also, I can't believe how many people considered rock n roll, and rollin' n scratchin the worst tracks on this album. I love them! I guess these are an acquired taste. But, those are among the tracks they often seem to choose when playing live. I saw them live from an Oakland warehouse, and they turned me inside out! I've had very few live performances match their raw intensity that they've perfected so well. Daft punks indeed.
B00001PE4D|3.0|Cruel Intentions, a movie about sex, lies, and truth, delivers a pretty good on/off screen chemistry between Philippe & Witherspoon. (It has to be good, right? They ARE married!) Selma Blair plays a good ditsy-minded girl, who plays a new sexually active woman in the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellar played a great [actress] in the movie, which you'll find very amusing. It's also kinda funny how she wants to hook up with her cousin, (Philippe) and totally mis-lead his girl (Witherspoon)<br />The end has a cool climax where Witherspoon rats SMG out about everything she's done. You'll like it, on way or another.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2 Go Home is spectacular.  It truly made me fall in love with this band all over again.  It has heart and it rocks the house. Equally wonderful is the inclusion of the Unforgettable Fire documentary.  A great look at the process of making an album and the evolution of the song Pride.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|A few weeks ago while looking through another music site I noticed that Dream Theater had a new album coming out. I owned Images and Words when I was a teenager, and even though I loved it, my musical tastes changed and I forgot all about them. So I figured I'd go grab Train of Thought (along with Images and Words) to see how they'd changed. Wow. I was thoroughly impressed with the new album. The musical talent was still very much there, the songs still top quality, and LaBrie had even toned the overdramatic shrieking down quite a bit. Quickly ran out and bought all the others I had missed - and this one easily holds its own. Each album (minus Infinity) was incredible, but in very different ways. Frankly if all their later efforts had just been rehashes of Images and Words (classic as it was), I doubt they'd still be around. This album doesn't carry the slighest hint of Metallica (from any point in their career), so don't let those comments stop you. Great work, looking forward to more!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I'm sorry this is one of THE worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of spending $9 to see. Not even Kate Beckinsale in figure hugging attire could save it. The acting is wooden at best, the script is childlike and the dialogue unconvincing and bland.<BR>Bad bad bad bad...BAD

0156027321|4.0|This book is wonderful.  It is a beautifully written story so satisfying and wonderous, that you are immediately taken in by Pi Patel and his monumentally heroic, heartbreaking, uplifting, and amazing struggle for survival with and against Richard Parker, (a full grown bengal tiger).<BR>The most wonderful bonus to this already fantasic novel, is the ending, which I will not give away.
185984054X|1.0|How can one review this book without reflecting on the mind behind it? Do you wonder what makes it tick?<br />What is his goal, his motive in writing? Maybe to make his living and reputation off the attraction many people have to controversy?  His motive then is materialistic, not surprising in our culture.<br />Ironically, his own understanding of humanity would assume that his motive was evil and completely selfish.<br />Giving him the benefit of the doubt, based on the anger underlying this book, it seems possible that his goal is to teach people that human nature is evil. That anything that looks good is not good at all, but always has an evil motive behind it.  Maybe he really believes it. Maybe he is motivated by great hurt done to him by someone who looked good to the world but was a hypocrite. <br />Does he have a long term goal to prove that there is none righteous, not even one? If so, the Bible already makes that point.<br />But doesn't he wonder why so many people look for someone good to admire? If all people were completely evil, would anyone admire Mother Theresa? Does he miss the reality that there is a part of human nature that reaches for the good?<br />Mother Theresa's goal was to love the unloved. She didn't pretend that it was to heal the dying. Her motive was love for God, who called her to reflect a facet of his love. She had buildings built to house people who shared this goal. In fairness, nothing he writes proves that this was not her goal or motive. Just that he disagrees with the value of her goal.<br />I admit, I haven't read all of Christopher Hitchens' work. When young, I used to muck the manure out of the stable where our horses were sheltered because I liked horses, not because I was enthralled with manure. If The &quot;Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice&quot; was written with a theme different than the discovery of unrighteousness human nature in someone admired by many people(what a new and revolutionary discovery!), I missed it.<br />Do you wonder what the epitaph will be on Christopher Hitchens' tombstone? If he is remembered at all, will it be for discovering some unrighteousness in people who are admired for goodness?<br />Mother Theresa will probably be remembered as long as this world continues. Whatever she did wrong will be unimportant because she spent so many years modeling human love for the unloved; a love each of us were created to enjoy and desire. The kind of love that might have quenched the anger in Christopher Hitchens' life.<br />I would rather share a tiny part of Mother Theresa's epitaph, wouldn't you?
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Believe it or not, this CD is better than her previous work.<br />ALICIA clearly masters the &quot;keys&quot; ingredients to create a meaningfull moment in music (vocals, musicianship).<br />The tracks on DIARY such as YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME blend the attitude of 60s soul with current production standards.<br />Titles such as FEELING YOU FEELING ME allow fans to pay close attention to her musicianship.<br />&quot;SO SIMPLE&quot; is a track paying tribute to a Stevie Wonder vibe while the sultry &quot;DRAGON DAYS&quot; honors the legendary ISAAC HAYES groove.&quot;KARMA&quot; could easily be remixed leading to a massive club hit (strong BEYONCE feel on KARMA).<br />Most songs on DIARY will remind listeners of the classic song styles of the late 1960s or early 1970s. A cleaver change of pace and revamped sound for Ms.KEYS.<br />Her vocals on this project are less &quot;in your face&quot; and are produced to compliment the music.<br />This is one of the best releases from a true artist during 2003. A must have cd for any fans of POP or R/B.
B000127LW2|3.0|As the author of the fantasy epic Bloodspiller I appreciate good sci-fi when I view it.First, I do agree with many fans who say that ALL the dvd box sets are way over-priced. Baylon 5 ( the best sci-fi show of them all )and the equally fantastic Stargate Sg-1 boxsets are much more reasonable in price. However, I am too, a Star Trek fanatic, though I prefer Next Generation as my personal favorite with Voyager as the runner-up. The only problem with Voyager, as was with DS-9, was that it didn't become a great show until its third year. Not until Worf showed up in the former and the lovely 7 of 9 ( my main reason for watching the show )in the latter, did these shows gain an edge. And Voyager had to confiscate the Borg to generate its edge.If they decided to be a little less harmonious, they could have kept heat going by having the two factions, Star Fleet and Maqui ( which was taken from the French underground in WWII )at each others throats a bit longer in the storyline.  Even Janeway took away from Picard the \\" foremost expert \\" title regarding the Borg. I most enjoyed the Doctor, who with 7 of 9 eventually stole the show and took on the \\"Data yearning to be human with Picard as his mentor in human affairs \\" relationship. The problem with this show for me, was unlike Next Generation and eventually Ds9, they never really developed the characters in the show, which beyond the Holy Trinity, also happened in the original series. In NG every character changed over the years and became fully three dimensional people, and for this reason I am strongly and emotionally bonded to NG. Voyager ignored the potential of Chokoty, Tuvoc, Kim and others. They at least advanced Belana  and Tom slightly, but in the last three seasons totally concentrated on the Doctor and 7 of 9, almost to the point of shunting aside Janeway. The show in its first two seasons was as spotty  but thank goodness not almost as boring as Enterprise ( which only exists because UPN would be out of business without a Trek show  and demanded one to be aired and thus it's mediocrity ) until they adopted the Borg ( Holy Xindi, Batman! )and found 7 of 9. I  WILL buy the series, however -after passing over Ds9- if only for the pleasure of enjoying the Doctor's antics and to gaze at Jeri Ryan.Frankly, due to her scientific expertise, I don't think they ever would have gotten home....And why is Janeway now an admiral before they made one of Picard? At least he saved civilization dozens of times, and was instrumental in holding together with Worf the Klingon Empire, which if it had fragmented would have destabilized our corner of the galazy. All she did was get lost and luckily find her way home.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|First I wanna say that Michael Carr is a loser :)<BR>Yes he is indeed. The fact that he's present in the top 500 reviewer's chart doesn't mean that his reviews are written in a sensible way :) Actually he makes people vote for his  preposterous reviews just because they are really stupid. Smart move!!! Dumb ass. Enough with advertisements.<br />I think the fourth Britney Spears album is truly amazing. Yes, she doesn't have strong voice like other artists (like Christina or whatever). But actually who cares so much about the strenght of the voice? Timbre is the important thing, ain't I right? And Britney's voice is just intoxicating. It just gets into your brain, and with all that catchy beats, you can't get her songs outta your head. In comparison to her previous albums, In The Zone sounds more mature (well actually not as mature as Shania Twain's albums, but hey, Britney's only 21 DON'T FORGET IT :P), but it's really easy listening. It just makes you feel good.<br />BUY IT! What are you waiting for?<BR>P.S. If you prefer to go deaf and envy someone's voice, you should definately buy Christina's album :))) But you'll get bored by most of her songs.

B00004VWA7|5.0|it only takes a few seconds of the opening track to realize that jaco was a very special musician. right from the get-go this outing is alive. from the chop-suey assault on the standard 'donna lee' to the serpeant charming 'opus pocus' - jaco can play! unbelievable command of the electric bass. besides the stunning vituosity, you' ll hear some deep, spacious music too. a great slew of guests as well.
B00005JLKB|4.0|So this is how it all began, back in Smallville.  Smallville tells the story of a young Clark Kent, growing up and going to high school in a small Kansas farming town.  I was a little skeptical about this show when in first came on, but I have grown to love it.  As the story goes, Smallville used to be a normal town until one fateful day when Kal-el's (Tom Welling) home planet of Krypton exploded.  His father, Jor-el, sent him to Earth in a spaceship, and along with him came Kryptonite, little shards of the planet.  Kryptonite has very severe and diverse effects on the human genome, and due to exposure to this rock, many Smallville citizens are mutated.  Anyway, Kal-el is adopted by Jonathon and Martha Kent, a married couple who are incapable of conceiving a child of their own.  Renamed Clark Kent, he grows up with some very special gifts; super speed, strength, senses, and x-ray vision.  Unbeknownst to the Kents, this is because of our yellow sun (Krypton had a red sun, and so Clark gets these powers).  Along with his friends Pete, Chloe, and Lana (whom he has a huge crush on), Clark solves mysteries and saves people.  Also along for the ride, as well as many of his own, is Clark's future archnemesis Lex Luthor.  As of now, the two are great friends, but someday, somehow, they will become sworn enemies.<BR>The first part of the season is okay; the stories are good, but not as good as they will come to be, and they don't flow together.  Once the episodes begin to make an arc is when the season gets good.  If  you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, you will almost definitely like this show, for there are many similarities between this show and Buffy especially.  The main thing is that many of the stories are metaphors for lessons that teenagers need to learn such as why not to go on killer wait loss programs, and why you should be yourself.  Also, the Kryptonite's role in the show is exactly the same as that of the Hellmouth in Buffy.<BR>This is a great show that is definitely worth taking a look at.  Some of my favorite episodes from this season include Hourglass, Nicodemus, and Tempest.
0812550706|5.0|Card is perhaps the best genre writer working today, as this novel amply demonstrates.  Ender's Game is a bildungsroman, or coming of age story, of a very young military genius, Ender Wiggin.  At the tender age of six, Ender is recruited by the powers-that-be for battle training in hopes that he can be molded into the leader who will destroy the dreaded alien invaders<br />It may be helpful to compare this book to Robert Heinlein's classic Starship Troopers, which has some broad similarities of plot.  Troopers has strong a basis in the sciences, both military and social.  Card leans more toward fantasy; his real fascination is with human beings and their feelings, not with the technical details of how the hardware works.  So if you're the kind of sci-fi fan who reads a book hoping to learn something about physics, dig out an old Asimov book instead - Card's not your man.  Also, the hero in the typical Heinlein juvenile is not only super-smart (like Ender's characters) but they are often \\"gee-whiz\\", \\"can-do\\" types for whom everything always seems to just fall into place.  Ender, on the other hand, is often conflicted, frequently miserable, and constantly manipulated.  One reason this book is so long is that Ender seldom has an easy victory - instead he has to fight his battles over and over until he finally wins.  And while Heinlein's ing&eacute;nues always have an older comrade to mentor them, Ender is intentionally forced to learn everything the hard way - by himself.<br />Card is so skillful at making us sympathize with poor Ender's plight that we can't wait to see him jump the next hurdle.  We care about his fate with an intensity that is almost unknown in genre fiction, which is probably why so many reviewers claim that this novel is really serious literature.  While that seems a bit much, there's no denying that for sheer entertainment value, this book beats 3 out of 4 \\"literary classics\\".  Accessible enough for younger readers, but too intense for children, this is a book that practically everyone will enjoy.  Don't miss out on one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasies ever.a book that practically everyone will enjoy.  Don't miss out on one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasies ever.
0804106304|4.0|Be Better Than Me<BR>Joy Luck Club<BR>Faith Blythe<br />The Joy Luck Club is a book composed of four different women who grew up in China. It is a story about the relationship between mothers and daughters. In China, the four women went through a lot of painful events. All of their daughters grew up in America. America is thought to be the land of freedom and the land of unlimited amounts of opportunity. Even though this book is about the relationship between mother's born in China and daughters born in American. Their relationships still resemble the relationships between American mothers and daughters. Both ethnic groups want the same thing for their children, which is something better than  they had. Mothers try to tell their daughter know when something is wrong, give them advise, teach them what they are worth, respect, and that sometimes life is going to be challenging. <BR>Most mothers see things that their children just cannot see. \\"All around this house I see the signs. My daughter looks but does not see. This is a house that will break into pieces. How do I know? I have always known a thing before it happens.\\"(Amy Tan 275) Mother's often see things that their daughters don't. They try to tell them but they do not listen, until it is too late. In today's society daughters still don't listen, until it is too late. Lindo told her daughter Rose that her husband was sleeping with someone else. She did not believe her. Later in the book she found out that he was having affair. If she had of  listened to her mother maybe she could have prevent the situation but at least she could have prepared herself emotionally for it.<BR>\\"I was six when my mother taught me the art of invisible strength. It was a strategy of winning arguments, respect from others, and eventually, though neither us knew it at the time, the chess game.\\"(Amy Tan 89)  Her mother taught her not the cry and the strongest wind cannot be seen. She showed her how not to show people when she was hurt. Many times, in many cultures, mothers teach their daughters not to show their pain. The reason my mother taught me this is because people will too often attempt to play on your feelings. If they know how to hurt you,  they will continue to hurt you, whenever they feel like it.  She did not want me to be vulnerable.<BR>My mother's expectations are so high of me. Sometimes I don't think I can live up to them. I don't want to let my mother down. I now know, as long as I try my best my mother will be proud of me.  What happens if I fail!? June's mother believes her daughter could be anything she wanted to be in America. She could open a restaurant. June could buy a house with almost no money down or become rich. Suyuan, June's mother wanted her to become a prodigy. Suyuan wanted June to become a famous pianist. June never tried to play the piano. June wanted her mother to love her for her, unconditionally. Even though her mother paid for piano lessons. She never got better because she did not practice. `You want me to be someone that I'm not. I'll never be the kind of daughter you want me to be.'(Amy Tan 153) Suyuan finally explained that all she wanted her to do was try. So that she could have a better life than her. \\"But you never tried. That is what disappointed me.\\"  Suyuan gave up on her daughter becoming a child prodigy.   <BR> Lindo wanted Waverly to know her worth and polish it. An-mei was \\"taught to desire nothing, to swallow other people's misery, to eat my own bitterness. And even though I taught my daughter the opposite, still she came out the same way!\\"(Amy Tan 241) An-mei asked her daughter why she would not speak up for her- self. Rose and her husband were going through a divorce. Rose did not know what to do. Ted, her husband was estranged. He told her over the phone that he wanted a divorce. Afterwards, Rose did not call him, all she did was to sit and think. Her mother An-mei asked:  \\"Why don't you talk to your husband?\\" After that conversation Rose stood up for herself. She told Ted that she was not moving out of their house. Mothers show their daughters how to respect themselves, let them know how much they are worth and not just except anything less than the best. If you settle for anything less than the best, then you compromise the quality of life expected for you by those who want the best for you.  My mother still tells me: \\"Life is a sum total of our choices and that what we receive is in direct proportion to what we expect.\\"   <BR> Mothers pass a lot of themselves down to their children, especially their daughters. They pass down behaviors, spirit, pain, love, and strength. An-mei's mother ate sticky sweet dumplings filled with a kind of bitter poison. \\"When the poison broke into her body, she whispered to me that she would rather kill her own weak spirit so she could give me a stronger one.\\"(Amy Tan 271) Mothers can't tell their children how to act, but they can teach them how. An-mei's mother did not know how to teach her. So, she taught her the best way she knew how. By killing herself, she did teach her daughter how to have a strong spirit. Sometimes mothers use very hard tactics to get points across to their children. But they get their point across.<BR>The book was excellent reading. The only thing I didn't like was the way the book kept switching between characters. The way the four women raised their daughters, is the same way mothers of today's society, raise their children.. Mothers want their daughters to be better than them.
B000000W5H|4.0|By the early seventies the Rolling Stones had gotten plenty of Satisfaction, and were already looking around for the next big thing.  They paid tribute to Motown, toyed with country and western music, and even took the briefest of flings into jazz, but couldn't find anything that really suited their talents and tastes.  And that's pretty much the picture we get with this, their 1974 release.<br />There are some good songs here, and even a few classics (the title track, the haunting \\"Time Waits for No One\\", and the deliciously funky \\"Fingerprint File\\") but the overall quality is somewhat off.  The cover of \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\" is okay, but nothing really special.  \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" and \\"Luxury\\" are both good enough songs that just don't quite seem to have enough punch, like they're being played under water (or possibly under the influence).  The band is far more effective on \\"Dance Little Sister\\", which would be a real knockout if it wasn't quite so... well, dumb.  \\"If You Really Want To Be My Friend\\" is the only total washout on this recording, and its position probably prompted a lot of listeners to either put on something else or fall asleep altogether, in either case missing the underrated and often-ignored standout \\"Fingerprint File\\".  While some consider this song's paranoid lyrics satirical. Jagger's experiences surely give him a unique slant on what it's like to live in a fishbowl.<br />Fans of the older, hard-rockin' Stones can be forgiven for being lukewarm about this offering.  But if you don't mind the variety (some might call it lack of focus) there's certainly enough here to warrant investigation.  On the other hand, if you don't have many Stones' CD's in your collection, there are others that you'll want to get first.  A rating of three and a half stars would be more accurate, but given the availability of \\"skip\\" buttons, I rounded up to reflect the high quality of the best tracks, rather than down to reflect the stuff you might not listen to anyway.anyway.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This is not only David Bowie's best record, but it may also be popular music's best.  There is not a single misstep here.
B00009TB5G|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this edition that hasn't been said already.  I had the usual problems with the theatrical version (a shallow Faramir, too little Treebeard, and a generally rushed pace) and am happy to find that nearly every gripe I had has been eradicated.<br />I feel bad for the numerous viewers who ended up with defective discs.  At this point I've watched all four discs from start to finish and have encountered nary a glitch.  It would be wise of New Line to re-press the set, minus defects, and offer a no-strings replacement deal for all the customers out there who purchased a faulty product.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I think &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; is Bowie's finest hour - not a misstep on the entire record - and I don't think he'll ever be able to top it, but I had great hope for &quot;Reality&quot;, as it reunites him with producer Tony Visconti.  After &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; Bowie went seriously off the rails, the nadir probably being the horrendous and empty &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;.  But since &quot;Earthling&quot; his work has been getting better with each record.  &quot;Reality&quot; is another step up.  His cover of Jonathan Richman's &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; is witty and infectious; it's much more credible than his Jack Black cover on &quot;Heathen&quot;.  My one problem with this record is the opening song, with its allusions to 9/11 - as catchy as it is musically, Bowie demeans the disaster with his opaque lyrics.  The song starts with the sound of sirens and I expected at the very least a sense of mourning or horror; instead we get a catchy little pop song with an insipid punning title.  With that exception I really like this record and I believe it's his best since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead must be unique in the disparity of opinions about their music and their fans. I'm fairly new to the band and to the album, but it's already one of my all-time favorites. The most important points about this album have been made, and by far abler reviewers than myself. The music is extremely original, the lyrics both thought-provoking and poetic, and while the style may not be the most approachable, all you need to do is stick with it. Listen to it once, and the beautiful melodies and chord structures will haunt you until, upon further experience, you will look past Yorke's vocal style (or whatever else is holding you back) and love the album. And no recent rock album can beat it for mood or message.
B0000TB03W|5.0|EVERY DAY I LISTEN TO THIS CD BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN UP BEAT. IT MAKES ME WANT TO PUT A LITTLE MORE TIME IN TO DOING ALL THE THINGS I NEVER HAVE TIME TO DO. THE SONG SHE'S NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE IS SO REAL TO ME. I HOPE EVERY WOMAN OUT HERE LISTENS TO THE WORDS AND KNOW YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL. THIS CD IS GREAT.
B000127LW2|5.0|I wasn't much of a Star Trek Fan until I watched a few of the beginning episodes of \\"Voyager\\". I liked the spin that the show gave the Maquis; instead of treating them as simple terrorists, we got a reason behind their treatment of Cardassia. <br />Of course, it also helped that in \\"Voyager\\" we got a strong cast of characters, including a female captain. The writing was interesting, as were the encounters with new alien races, including the Viidians (sp?) and our old favorites, the Borg.<br />I'm thrilled to see that Paramount finally got on the ball and decided to release this fine show on DVD. Can't wait to start collecting them.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Film direction is like gambling; no matter how well you've done you always think you can do better. That's the premise behind this re-release of the four Alien films. So did putting it all on the line pay off? Sometimes. Ridley Scott's original film was a masterpiece of suspense and terror. The snail's pace pacing, like Hitchcock's best films, created an underlying tension that found release in a few key scenes. Unlike Blade Runner, Scott's vision of Alien hasn't changed significantly. The extended branching scenes do add a number of fine character moments but they don't make the film any scarier or more effective. In the boxing match between Alien vs. Alien Revised Directors Cut, it's nearly a draw where both films have their merits. Ultimately, though, the leaner, meaner original cut wins simply on the sheer power of the film. It's hard to improve on perfection.<br />Cameron's Aliens is an altogether different matter. Cameron was contractually obligated to provide a film to Fox that didn't go over a certain time limit. As a result, Cameron had to work with a number of restrictions and knew, despite the power of many sequences, that he was going to have to slice and dice the film. The original theatrical version was pretty powerful (and has been only available on video and laserdisc--this is its DVD premiere) but the extended version (which saw life on DVD and laserdisc previously)wins the match. Cameron's ability to craft strong characters and create complex, intelligent storylines only enriches this film. The extended version has visuals that were completed long after the film wrapped but the quality is comparable to the original visual effects. These sequences seamlessly fit in with the older visual effects. I still like the idea of having both because they are each unique. The theatrical version is a punchier and more direct experience. The extended version is like watching a flower unfold; you appreciate each individual petal and its unique form. OK, that was a lousy simile.<br />Fancher's Alien 3 was crippled from the start. Vincent Ward's original premise was fascinating and the rewritten screenplay kept some of the basic elements but dispensed with some of the best plot points and themes. Still, the workprint offers a fascinating glimpse into what might have been if Fancher had been allowed to release a longer version of the film. I have to agree that the newly added CGI effects don't measure up to the original (unlike the care that went into Cameron's revised version)but the added sequences do improve the film and make it much more distinctive and less derivative.<br />I have to disagree with the assessment of most critics regarding Alien Resurrection. It's an underrated gem that manages to be both satrical and full of over-the-top dramatic moments. It lacked the power of the original, the character development of Cameron's second film (and action)but played with the conventions and expectations of the audience. Joss Whelan's original screenplay is witty and fun. It's a script (and a film)that's self reflective and about film. The final theatrical version is the superior version although it's interesting to get a glimpse at the &quot;alternate&quot; version as well.<br />The extras include a number of featurettes (the original Alien only come with 9 vs. 11 for most of the others). There's also the original laserdisc extras archieved on the final disc. You also get a glimpse into screen tests and other cool rarities.<br />The big question would be--is this worth the gamble and the additional money? It all depends on how much you appreciate the first two films. The previous DVD version of Alien had a wonderful commentary by Ridley Scott but it didn't have anything near the extensive extras this version has (including Dan O'Bannon's original Star Beast treatment which, in my mind, resembles It! The Terror Beyond Space even more than the finished product does but with signiciant departures as well).<br />Cameron's secondfilm also was available on a terrific DVD previously. It had lots of extras but, again, the extras are more indepth here. Still, without a Cameron audio track, this DVD reissue is missing something. On the other hand, for those who were fans of the original theatrical version of the film, having both versions is a big plus.<br />The third film is a toss up; Fancher's film wasn't well liked by most fans or critics. It had its merits but was compromised from the beginning by the revised screenplay. Still, there are marvelous performances given by Charles Dutton and Weaver among many others. The work print version gives a glimpse into what might have been and makes for interesting viewing even if you dislike the third film.<br />The fourth film showed the franchise on its last legs; the satire and tongue-in-cheek approach to the material revitalized much of the film. On the other hand, the much of the plot and the character of Ripley had been played out by the time of the fourth film. It's still a noble effort that doesn't quite capture the raw power of the original or vitality of the second film but does improve on the third film. If you need to have the extras and the digitally improved picture quality for the first two films (I didn't see a huge difference but Alien did look a bit sharper and cleaner) and all the extras, this is well worth picking up.<br />First I have to admit I haven't had the time to investigate all the extras or investigate every crevice of this new version.<br />If you're a fan of the third and fourth film as well, this would be a good boxed set to pick up.d film also was available on a terrific DVD previously.

B00005UKE0|5.0|Wow...  George's first piece of work following the fracturing of the Beatles revealed just how much talent lay repressed beneath the tyrannical domination (I exaggerate, I know, but I just want this to sound cool) of the Lennon-McCartney Regime (not that the Lennon-McCartney partnership was a bad thing, for it produced some of the greatest music the people of this world would and will ever be fortunate enough to hear).  \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is a true epic, spanning two compact discs and demanding many listens, and is sure to provide a lifetime of enjoyment for all those who give it a chance.  <br />I received my copy for Christmas of 2001, less than a month after George's death, and I loved it from the first moment I put it into the CD player.  Often enough I have to hear a song more than once before it blossoms into a personal favorite, but that certainly didn't happen when \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was listened to by me the very first time.  \\"All Things\\" is a fantastic piece of work... Bob Dylan collaborates, together with Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr turns up again to play the drums, so this really isn't a lonely venture for the \\"Quiet Beatle\\".<br />First let me mention the massive production values... talk about a \\"wall of sound\\"!  Listening to this is like being submerged into an \\"sonic ocean\\"... the music really surrounds you.  Some would say that this is a very dated and negative aspect of the recording, but I wouldn't agree.  It's a very unique sound experience, part of the enjoyment that comes with the album.  Now, the music.  Every song here has something go for it, really.  Some album highlights... \\"Wah-Wah\\" has a great melody and wonderful guitar parts, and I really like George's vocals on \\"Let it Down\\".  \\"My Sweet Lord\\" stands as my favorite song on the first disc, together with everyone else's other favorite as well, \\"What Is Life\\".  If you enjoy bonus tracks (I do sometimes... it all depends on the quality.  Often I feel that the bonus tracks included on an album were excluded from the original for a reason, but every so often you make a happy discovery of something that should have been there from the very beginning.  For example, the bonus tracks on Uriah Heep's 1977 release, \\"Firefly\\").  While I generally don't count bonus tracks in my rating of the actual album (all depends on how strongly I feel about them), I would like to mention the alternate take on \\"What is Life\\", which is really just a vocal-less backing track with added trumpets.  Highly enjoyable, that... unfortunately, in spite of the fact that George actually likes it better, I detest the new version of \\"My Sweet Lord\\".  What's wrong with the big production values?  I say the original was perfect... why try to do it again?  I know they say that 'less is more' (whoever they are), but certainly not in this case.  But as it's a bonus track, an extra, it won't bring down my rating.<br />The second disc I actually like even more than the first.  \\"The Art of Dying\\" is excellent, in a \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" sort of way, and I love the harmonica bits (courtesy of Dylan, I'm guessing) on \\"Apple Scruffs\\", which is just a fun tune to listen to.  Though I have theological reasons for disagreeing with some of the lines included in \\"Waiting on You All\\" (though I DO agree with some of the rest as well), \\"Waiting\\" is another favorite, musically and for the feelings it generates (George really does sound very joyful while he's signing it).  My most favorite song on disc two, though, and possibly the entire double album, is the very last proper song of the original release, \\"Hear Me Lord\\".  A perfect prayer... I'm very religious, and though I do not hold the same beliefs as Harrison, the thoughts expressed in \\"Hear Me\\" are universal for anyone who believes in, desires, and loves God.  My favorite line, when George describes God as being \\"at both ends of the road, to the left and the right, above and below us\\" is just magnificent, and the music makes it even better.I think on this line quite a bit when I'm praying, and the thought of it has given me a tremendous amount of peace and comfort.  Even if for just \\"Hear Me Lord\\", I say this album is worth aquiring.<br />The bonus tracks on disc two had absolutely nothing to offer me, even less than disc one.  Forget about them, I say.<br />I'll finish up by saying that \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is a beautiful piece of work, and I'll almost say (though I'll hesitate to) that it would never have happened if the Beatles hadn't gone their seperate ways.  It's a wonderful thing to listen to, and I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy it more and more as \\"life goes on\\".  Ha ha.  <br />Thank you, George... Rest in Peace.<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
0783225725|5.0|An odd supernatural western with a number of twists, Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter is now recognized as a pivotal and important western. When it was released it was blasted by many critics for its violence since then its critical reputation has risen.<br />Eastwood plays a stranger who arrives in an odd town called Lago. The residents are wary of any stranger and the gunslingers hired to protect the mining operation (among other things)immediately want to take him down a peg or two. They have no idea who they're dealing with. There's a dark secret involving murder eating at the heart of Lago and its residents. Its corrupting effects are hidden by pleasant facades of the buildings.<br />The residents want to hire The Stranger who defend them against outlaws who have a grudge against the towns people. He's initially reluctant but agrees after given carte blanc to the town. He does lives up to his end of the bargain but not before exacting a brutal revenge.<br />The film certainly merits five stars. It's an assured second film from Eastwood as a director. The script by Ernest Tidyman (with uncredited rewrites by Dean Reisner)marvelously captures many of the elements that made Sergio Leone's westerns so popular and manages to invert many of them at the same time. Reportedly inspired by a subgenre of samurai films revenge films, Eastwood chose to make the film when the treatment intrigued him. Tidyman's (The French Connection)screenplay is lean and compact providing a perfect frame work that echoes and compliments the films that Eastwood made for Leone. The haunting musical score also echoes Morricone's scores for Leone's films without imitating them.<br />Universal has given this classic western shoddy treatment. The cover you see here isn't the cover on the current version. It's a much less dramatic photographic image. Additionally, it's clear that this is just a re-release of the original 1997 bare bones DVD. The film has not been remastered and there's loads of analog artifacts as well as some interlacing problems in a couple of scenes. The film deserves to be restruck from the original negative and remastered with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. It also deserves a commentary track from star/director Eastman as well as a documentary on this magnificent film. There is a promotional film floating around that was made at the time of the film and the least Universal could have done with this reissue was put it on disc. That, along with a retrospective documentary and interviews is really what this terrific film deserves. Sadly, Universal has chosen to release it with little fan fare at a budget price but without any of the extras that would make it worthwhile. There is the original trailer (in pan and scan format) and production notes.<br />One other minor flaw is that the transfer is cropped incorrectly in this widescreen presentation. As a result, some of the credits appear at the very edge of the screen. While this isn't a major issue, the film isn't presented in quite the way it should be.<br />Eastwood deserves kudos for this fine western which was a pivotal film in his career as both director and star.

B000008LOV|5.0|If you are one of the lucky souls fortunate enough to get your greasy fingers on this album (why are the good ones always out of print?), then you are guaranteed a good time from the moment you place the disc in the player and hit \\"play\\".  George Harrison is the first voice you'll hear, and he sounds wonderful... <br />I was fortunate enough to experience a sort of personal \\"Beatles Revolution\\" during the last part of the summer of 2001, brought into the fold just a few short months before George passed away from cancer on the penultimate day of the November of that year.  Following his passing, I really made an effort to hear more of his solo material (I caught a clip of his 1987 tune \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" during a news announcment on the day following his death), and was very disappointed to discover how hard-to-find his work from the late 1970s-1980s had become.  Strangely, it seems to be easier now... used copies of both the Wilburys albums and Harrison's \\"Cloud Nine\\" seem to be readily available now through Amazon and eBay.  After telling myself how lucky I was to have copies of them all, it's just 'note faih'!  But really, I'm glad that others will have a chance to give the later Harrison material a try.<br />But back to the Wilburys, who weren't just George, but I want to say one more thing about him.  He sounds great... happy. Really happy. In fact, this is a very happy record, on the whole.  Highlights include the final song, \\"End of the Line\\", which features Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison on each chorus and Tom Petty singing each verse (the fifth Wilbury, Bob Dylan, is noticably absent from the song.  Was he just playing guitar and doing backing vocals?  The world may never know), which is probably my favorite tune on the album.  Also notable are the first almost ethereal and then just bizarre \\"Margarita\\" (I couldn't ask for a more interesting song, and one that's so catchy besides.  Check out the bass playing right before Petty tells us \\"she wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper\\".  Who's that guy playing bass?), the light-as-a-feather \\"Heading for the Light\\" (let me mention one more time how happy George sounds.  You'll be smiling yourself by the time the song is over), and the slow and sorry Dylan tune \\"Congratulations\\" (listen to it a time or two and it will grow on you).  But really, the whole album is great. I should specifically mention, though, track number five, which is the late Roy Orbison's \\"Not Alone Anymore\\".  It, together with \\"Congratulations\\", form a sort of island of melancholy in a sea of genuine joy.  But this is not a bad thing at all... \\"Not Alone\\" is really very beautiful.  I love Orbison's voice, as he really emotes through the song, making it twice as heartbreaking as it would be on its own.<br />If you want to spend the dollars, I'd highly recommend grabbing a copy of both of the Wilburys albums, in addition to George's \\"Cloud Nine\\" (which I really consider to be a sort of pre-Wilburys Wilburys release), and Jeff Lynne's \\"Armchair Theater\\".  All of them came out at about the same time, between 1987 and 1990, with the second Wilburys release (deceptively entitled \\"Volume Three\\") finishing them up in that same year.  Also, jump ahead a few more years to 2001 and give a try to the highly abundant and readiliy available \\"Zoom\\" which pretends to be an ELO album but is REALLY another Jeff Lynne solo work, which features George Harrison as a guest on two tracks (and, even though he wasn't a Wilbury, Ringo Starr on two more!).  I stand open to correction, but I'm guessing that the two songs on \\"Zoom\\" were among the last recordings George made before his death.<br />Anyway, back to the album I'm really reviewing (I just thought I'd suggest a few \\"companion pieces\\" in case you were still hungry for more).  If you check out The Traveling Wilurys Volume One, I know you'll have a wonderful time, and I promise you won't be sorry.  Remember Roy and George...<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
B00005JM02|5.0|I have never seen that movie in theater until it appear for home. I knew it's worth to keep. Guess what? I am right. It's full of humor and enjoyable watch this movie.<br />Oh yeah, it's worth to keep that movie for home. It have all SUBTITLE available on all special features - very helpful for hearing impaired  (deaf). It make great for use on the laptop or portable DVD player for travel. PERFECT!
B00002EPMF|5.0|and an amazing CD. Tim's vocals are beutiful, chuck does excellent guitars, and the overall sound is great. A must-have CD for everyone. However, against popular belief, Chuck DID record the guitar parts for the next album! And were it not for a massive legal battle over it, you might have bought it already.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|First thing, this movie is great action. I may agree with other comic lover's.<br />I have the bad thing about this X Men 2 on special features. None of them are available fo SUBTITLE or CLOSED CAPTION that leave us, for hearing impaired so useless to watch this. It's better for you to rent it. Definely not worth to keep.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Let me start off by saying that there is not a bad song on this CD.  The first four songs are some of Dire Straits most popular and for good reason.  When you put this album on there is absolutely no reason you would need to skip any of the songs in the beginning.  Unlike some albums where there is a less than superb song in the middle of a great run this album is simply perfect.<BR>     Now we move on to the second half of this album, a lesser known half.  So maybe you don't know many of the songs on the second half.  All i have to say to you is \\"Why worry?\\"  There truly is no need to worry, Dire Straits will come through.  I will agree that songs like \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" and \\"Ride Across the River\\" are not as good as some of the other songs on this album, but you can't say that they are bad.<BR>     Not only are the songs on this CD wonderful but the order in which the band put them on the CD is also very well thought-out.  The CD starts off with a Bang with 4 of the band's top 5 songs.  The only song missing in this is, of course, Sultans of Swing.  But what do you think would happen if Sultans of Swing was on this album?  The album would then be TOO good.  God only knows what would happen if an album THAT good was made.  Then after taking you through some of the lesser known songs the CD finishes with title track, Brothers in Arms.  Brothers in Arms is just another of many many great songs on this CD.<BR>     You cannot go wrong in purchasing this album.  There is just too many good songs and 0 bad songs, what have you got to lose?<br />Oookkkkkk....So what i really meant to say was : YOUR LATEST TRICK.  Your.  Latest.   Trick.   it's over and done with.  If you know anything about that you know that that's all you need to know.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I can recognize that Britney Spears doesn't make the most meaningful music in the industry, but she sure knows how to make a great pop record!!  She has never tried to be anything she isn't and she sticks to what suits her, which is probably why she's had staying power.  If you want a fun and danceable record, this is definitely the one to get.  Each song has something different to offer listeners, from the edgy &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; and &quot;Toxic&quot; to more sensual and trance-like tracks such as &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; and &quot;Touch of my Hand.&quot;  Unlike Britney's previous recordings, there aren't any filler tracks.  Every song has something unique and different to offer and you will find yourself listening to the entire album all the way through.  Even if you dislike Britney Spears, I guarantee that you will find something on this album to like or even love!
B0000255CL|5.0|This record takes a whole new approach to the art of musical warfare. Demonaz had to leave the band due to severe tendonitis in his arms, this is of course not really surprising if you consider the years of hyper speed riffing culminated in the release of the previous opus 'Blizzard Beasts'. Previous record also saw the addition of Horgh as the drummer. In my opinion he is one of the best Black Metal drummers around. He manages to pull of sharp blasts and with uncanny ease change the tempos without blinking an eye. His drumming seems to be there with a clear purpose and serves to underline the music instead of just 'being there'. <BR>The guitar sound, riffing and structures are quite different on this record. To many Black Metal purists this was a disappointing departure from the traditional sound. The sound is thick and the repetitive riffs are replaced with more complex structures and tempo variations. Old school thrash metal and death metal influences are often audible but of course Immortal would not be themselves if they omitted their trademark light speed Black Metal riffs. This record sees the introduction of synthesizer sound for the first time during sparse atmospheric interludes. Whether the band wanted to ride the popular wave of melodic Black Metal or it was a just an artistic choice I do not know. I do know that it works surprisingly well. This has two reasons, firstly it is sparse enough to not be overwhelming, secondly (this is especially audible on the intro to the title track) it manages to add to the atmosphere and, in my mind at least, it conjured images of 80s fantasy films like Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. It simply adds to the intended storyline to which the band has adhered for so long. <br />The artwork for the first time abandons the band photo cover art and introduces us to the first, and last, graphical depiction of Immortal's mythical realm. Much has been said about the artwork in the press and it won a prize for best cover art back when it was released. The band more than makes up for the lack of a band photo on the inside of the booklet though ;-). <br />At the risk of being accused of not being critical, this being my fourth favorable review of Immortal, I have to say that unlike some I am not at all bothered by the band's new direction. They chose to deviate from their early path without sacrificing integrity in the process. This may not be as grim as 'Pure Holocaust' or as much of a rusty knife as 'Battles In The North' it certainly is the most creative and varied record released by the band to date and shows their maturity as recording artists. (I just wish they kept their shirts on). All in all yet another classic record by a classic band. <br />8.5/10
B00005AXEL|5.0|Captivating from beginning to end, Trouble in Shangi La might be Stevie's finest work to date.  It is so difficult to pick just one track as your favorite, because the album is so hauntingly beautiful as a body of work.
B000002HPV|5.0|&quot;Homogenic&quot; is appropriately titled, because unlike the diverse &quot;Post&quot;, it has a much more uniform sound. Sonically, it's a combination of inventive techno beats and classical orchestration. Lyrically, the tone of the album is set with the first track &quot;Hunter&quot;: Bjork seems to be &quot;hunting&quot; for love and peace of mind, both through intimate relations and within herself. &quot;Joga&quot;, a gorgeous love song, is one of my favorite Bjork songs ever, with Bjork crooning &quot;All that no one sees, you see what's inside of me&quot; over evocative strings and an arctic beat. With &quot;5 Years&quot;, Bjork scolds a lover for his emotional unavailability, but then scolds herself in &quot;Immature&quot; for looking to others to complete herself. &quot;Alarm Call&quot; is the album's most upbeat track, with Bjork imploring the listener to embrace joy, and &quot;Pluto&quot;, an homage to the disturbed fan who committed suicide after sending her a bomb in the mail, is an abrasive explosion of sounds. The album ends on a subdued and pleasant note with &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, which is almost hymn-like in its theme of surrender and unity.<br />Overall, this is a gorgeous, inspired and groundbreaking album. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves music.
0345409671|1.0|This book was dreadful, the intrusion of all the religious dogma Rice drowns us in her books from here on out is unwanted. This is the downhill slope where all of her characters personalities start changing until they're not their old selves anymore. I'm refurring to all of Anne Rice's books that came after this.    I remember reading this in highschool as a Rice enthusiast with another like-friend. We both thought the book was awful. We really didn;t care about whatever \\"point\\" there was supposed to be to it. A few bbooks latter, my friend swore off Rive & switched to Poppy Z Brite & I switched to Christopher Pike & Lemony Snicket.
B0000C1733|5.0|The new single is amazing and all of these songs are great.  But how could they justify leaving &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; off of a greatest hits album?
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever come across, in terms of variety, innovation and general entertainment value.<br />The eponymous 'Lady Marmalade' aside, this is truly the most outstanding re-working of classic songs, and ranks alongside the 'Forbidden Broadway' series as one of the all-time greats. Particular highlights are David Bowie's 'Nature Boy', full of melancholy and heavy gothic emotion, which never once becomes overstated or cloying, 'Complainte de la Butte' by Rufus Wainwright, a touching and beautiful lovesong sung in french and english, and Beck's rendition of the classic 'Diamond Dogs'.<br />The surprise here is Ms. Kidman's voice - although technically not the best singer in the world, she manages to pull off her showstopping 'Sparkling Diamonds' with as much charisma and gusto as she does 'One Day I'll Fly Away' - a version, which in my opinion, suits the lyrics and tone of the song better than Randy Crawford's original.<br />Although not all of the better pieces of music from the movie are on this CD, it's worth owning for the sheer quality of production. People who haven't seen the movie will still be impressed by how different and refreshing this CD is.
6300181553|5.0|This movie has become one of my holiday traditions. great dancing, and one of those which you get both Bing and Fred! They just don't make 'em like this anymore! Get the Dvd, and you get &quot;Going My Way&quot; too. It's worth it..and this IS the original &quot;White Christmas&quot; redition (for you purists). Lots of fun any time of the year!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|After almost 1700 customer reviews I'll just say this - only buy this DVD if you really, truly loved the movie. I liked it plenty, but having purchased the double digipack edition, I've never actually watched the film again - just the extras (which, by the way, are the absolute best in terms of content, variety and quality that I've ever seen on a DVD).<br />MR is a phsychidelic, visual, loud, brash and fun love-tragicomedy, and worth buying for the Extras DVD alone. For lovers of the story, the disc with the movie on it is a nice little add-on :-) For those of us who weren't as blown away by the actual plot, rent it first...
B0000DZEA1|5.0|My friends have asked me why I adore the LOTR films so much and my response is the musical score.  Everything in these films are truly wonderful, but in my opinion, the one thing that really connects the audience to the many emotions of the story is the oustanding score by Howard Shore.  The main theme, that lalala la la la la...........gets me every time and this soundtrack is oustanding and moving with its beauty and loveliness.  When I saw the Fellowship of the Ring the first time and heard Enya's \\"May it Be\\", it haunted me for days, it was so beautiful and I was greatly disappointed it didn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song.  Now we have the equally beautiful \\"Into the West\\" by Annie Lennox.  Let's hope at Oscar time that this song gets rewarded with gold as well as this soundtrack winning for Best Original Score. The first time I listened to the final tracks, \\"The Return of the King\\", \\"The Grey Havens\\" and \\"Into the West\\" I actually started getting misty eyed just thinking about the images that will be on screen as this moving music is being played.  I'm sure that when I see this film I won't be the only one in the theater whose eyes are welled up with tears as this wonderful story finally ends.  I've purchased the soundtracks for all three LOTR films and this is by far the best (sorry Enya).
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Unlike 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and 'Tommy', Fosse's 1970's homage to everything 1930's is that rare thing - a celebrated cult (and mainstream) musical that even now, almost 30 years after its initial release, still hasn't lost its sparkle.<br />'Cabaret' deals with the story of a penniless writer (Michael York), who, upon arriving in pre-Hitler Berlin, meets and falls in love with a lounge singer named Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli). His life is turned upside-down by social and sexual revolution, played out against the backdrop of a city broken by depression and crying out for change. <br />It's the depth of emotion in this movie that gives it the edge over its contemporaries. The Jewish Vs. Christian love story provides a metaphor for the pre-Nazi turmoil experienced by 1930's Berliners, and Marisa Berenson gives one of her best performances as the Landauer heiress plagued by uncomfortable emotion and anti-semitic feeling. Similarly, Helmut Greim's performance as the wealthy, if somewhat sleazy, playboy Maximillian von Heune, provides us with an insight into cloak-and-dagger attitudes toward wealth and sexuality, prevalant at the time.<br />York's performance as the hapless Brian Roberts is very good indeed, but York has almost always played this sort of character - weedy Englishman with hidden depths. He does it well, however, and we truly believe that he is enthralled by the exotic Sally. But it's all Minnelli's show anyway, and her once-in-a-lifetime performance as Sally is the true heart of this picture. She is reckless yet innocent, another metaphor for pre-Nazi Germany. Crying out for love, yet deliberately eschewing it when it does eventually come her way, we too are sucked into her web of wide-eyed innocence and ultra-feminine sexuality.<br />Fosse's stark direction and sleazy, obvious choreography of the Kit-Kat Club, coupled with his detached, almost-bored perspectives on a depression-era city provide a grim and realistic backdrop for these stories.His complete lack of Hollywood-style glamour stands the test of time - why should a sleazy burlesque house in an impoverished city look like a Busby Berkley staircase, anyway? It's in this gritty portrayal of realistic poverty and living on the edge that Cabaret shines, with ugly, overweight dancing girls and a malevolent, amoral Emcee (the excellent Joel Gray) fuelling the fire of a doomed train on a one-way track. <br />The DVD extras are also rather good, interviews abound and there's some interesting comments to be had from the production team. <br />All in all, 'Cabaret' still shines as a cinematic masterpiece; a cautionary tale of love and infatuation. It's not a feel-good musical, but then again, very few of those are as worthwhile as this. Highly recommended.
B00005JM0B|1.0|Am I the only one who was amazed at just how bad this film is?<br />The biggest problem is that the John Connor character is in no way a credible adult version of the boy in Terminator 2 - the John  Connor of T2 was a tough street-smart kid who learned that his mum wasn't crazy and that it was all true. The guy in the film I just watched was a vacuous dork who couldn't manage his local McDonald's, let alone spearhead the human resistance in a post-apocalyptic world.<br />None of the actors were any good, including Arnie, who appeared to be sending himself up,  and the whole thing had a distinct low budget feel - cheap locations, few actors (not even many extras), despite what it is rumoured to have cost. I fell asleep during my first attempt to watch it and had to force myself to stay with it to the end, simply because I'd paid to rent it.<br />The SFX and action scenes didn't improve on anything we saw ten years ago in T2 (despite the fact that the first 20 minutes or so were a more or less straight repeat of the opening of T2), there was no pace, tension or drama. I didn't care what became of any of the characters. The female terminator was indeed machine-like (as in mechanical) but without the presence or sense of menace that Arnie had in the first two films. Even the physics of the second film was forgotten - the terminator there couldn't make itself into mechanical systems or projectile weapons.<br />The only bit I liked was the twist at the very end about Skynet and judgement day.<br />What a shame to spend all that money and make such a crap film.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Rolling Stone Magazine voted the JAYHAWKS the most influentual band of the 90's . Critics and other musicians praise the JAYHAWKS but radio play eludes them. It is not suprising given the state of commercial radio these days . GARY LOURIS has an amazing voice and writes with such depth and feeling . Most people were worried when MARK OLSON (co-founder) left the band , but the JAYHAWKS have only gotten better .<BR>It makes me sad that nobody has heard of them. I have all their albums and RAINY DAY MUSIC is the best one yet . When I listen to a JAYHAWKS album I recall where I was living (I have moved around alot) , and what was going on in my life at the time , it's that kind of music. If someone stole this album from me I would hunt them down and give them five more copies for their frends . <BR>If you buy one CD this year , Buy RAINY DAY MUSIC .
B0000BWVCM|5.0|One of the very few sequels to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor, X2 is well worth picking up. Aside from Sabretooth and Toad, all the mutant characters from the first film return, and we get to know them all a little better. X2's casting is excellent; the actors are all instantly believable as their super-hero (or -villain) counterparts, sometimes frighteningly so. There is a good story being told here, not just a collection of effects.<br />Speaking of effects, though, there's more of everything this time around, including action scenes, as William Stryker wages war against the X-Men. If you're a fan of watching Wolverine tear people new orifices -- and who isn't? -- you won't be disappointed. The filmmakers use Nightcrawler's teleporting ability (BAMF!) liberally, and to magnificent effect. And there's even a brief cameo from Colossus, who is every bit as cool as you're hoping.<br />I haven't watched all the special features yet, but what I have seen has been fairly interesting. There are some oddities to be found -- for instance, no fewer than three of the so-called &quot;deleted scenes&quot; are actually in the film -- but it's a strong package all-around. Highly recommended.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I have seen the first season,I dont have cable,but this show is great.I need to know when it will be out(The 2nd season)???????<BR>I have never been so addicted to a show in my life,This show is great and please get this out on dvd asap please,please bring this out asap on dvd or vhs,we need this in our lives......
B000001XN2|5.0|I reviewed another release of this same recording, which is a bit more expensive, and just as great, though the sound quality of that release is better than this one (however, this is fabulous). To everyone reading the reviews, there is a problem if you read a review from &quot;a European visiting America.&quot; That review is not of this opera, or this work, or this composer. That review deals with a live recording of Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. Many of the details are inaccurate in that review as Corelli sings nothing above a hig B in it, and none of the cadenzas for his character. <br />However, be that as it may, this opera is IL TROVATORE, and I think it only right to let readers know which opera is being reviewed. You won't find a Joan Sutherland in this recording (what role would she sing with Price singing the lead female role). I find it very irresponsible of reviewers who love a particular performer to put their one review on every recording that was issued with that singer, even if the recording reviewed is not the one spoken of in the review. Amazon should really remove that review from this recording as it has nothing what ever to do with this recording. <br />As for Trovatore, well, this is an extremely energetic fabulous recording and all the principles are in wonderful voice (not to mention ability). The entire performance just rushes forth and we are swept away in it. The orchestra is incredible, and the conductor really sees the drama of the score. Sadly, the cabaletta that comes after the Miserare is missing (it isn't in many live recordings of the work) and it is something Price does so wonderfully well. As far as time goes, it doesn't take that long. It could have been added. <br />We are witnessing a performance that has few to match it, one where the energy and the &quot;special magic&quot; that seldom occurs in performance is happening. <br />This is a great buy, and I recommend it to everyone.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I own all three soundtracks now and this one is by far the best.  Billy Boyd sings on &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; and Viggo Mortenson sings on &quot;Return of the King&quot;.  Both of them do fantastic jobs.  I was close to crying the first time I heard Billy's song.  &quot;Into the West&quot; is by far my favorite; sweet and sad, but hopeful at the same time.  Annie Lennox was perfect for the song.  I look forward to December 17th with great anticipation.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|I'll make this short. There is no such thing as a moderate Rush fan. You either love them and have a connection with their music, or you hate them. Being the former, I will obviously purchase anything Rush puts out. And after the release of Vapor trails, which was a phenomenal album with horrible audio quality, I was just excited to see the boys back in business after their much-needed hiatus. I saw this tour in the DC area (the seventh time I've seen them live) and had to listen to five drunken jackasses from Georgetown yell and scream at each other (totally ignoring the show) behind me the whole time. BTW - I hope you guys get the clap. <br />Anyway, I felt like I missed out on the show, and this CD is redemption for me. I'm not going to complain about the audio quality on this one because it's live and for once, I feel like while listening to it, I'm in the crowd watching the show, instead of on stage with the band. Call it a new perspective. Hearing 60,000 Brazilian kids scream their lungs out like it's a world cup soccer game gives me the chills and I love it! The crowd makes this show. It also serves as a final memoir as the last date on this tour of a band that survived a lot of personal tragedy since T4E, picked up the pieces, toured together, and finally regained the cohesion that has always made them the three most gifted musicians in rock. <br />Now for the whining. I gave it four stars because about half-way through the show, it almost sounds as if they're in a hurry to finish up quickly, a feeling that doesn't go away until they launch into the encore of Bytor/Cygnus/Working Man. I also, like a lot of Rush fans enjoy it when Rush decide to grandstand their musicianship and for the last few tours that I've seen, the trio seem to be holding back some of the energy and virtuosity which each have demonstrated in the past (i.e. Peart going ballistic on drums on All the World's a Stage, Lifeson playing like he's possessed on Exit Stage Left (yeah, I know, these were a long time ago). The only guy here that really seems to &quot;play his ass off&quot; on this particular show is Lee, plucking the living hell out of his bass. And, it really pains me to say this but, I'm growing tired of Peart's &quot;newer&quot; drum solo (i.e. electric kit and jazz ensemble). I like to hear the best drummer in the world just pound the living Christ out of the skins like a machine gun personally. And as far as Lifeson goes, take a real careful listen to his solo on La Villa Strangiato on ESL. That, my friends is lightning in the fingertips. <br />Anyway, I'm drifting. It's Rush and even a mediocre Rush performance is a phenomenal performance by any other band's standards. And for those of us who are used to a new Rush disk every two to three years and a live release after every third disk, this was surprise. And hey, I paid $20 and got three CD's in one package by my favorite band, not a bad deal. Geddy, Alex, and Neil, thanks for sharing your experience with us, I felt like I was there. <br />Oh hey, when I said this would be short, I lied.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|Let me start by saying, except for a few songs, I wasn't feeling her debut album. I think Alicia Keys is extremely talented and if <BR>she continues to put out quality like THE DIARY OF ALICIA KEYS, she will be here to stay. <br />It's a nice blend of old R&amp;B &amp; modern sound. It's very adult, especially in comparison with the other  so called young &quot;artists.&quot; <br />While the CD is very good, it doesn't have many &quot;radio friendly&quot; songs. The singles will not do as well as the over-played ones on SONGS IN A MINOR. That's not a bad thing, especially given the fact that most of what's out on the radio is trash. There's a few tracks that will take some time to grow on but no big deal.<br />This CD will stand the test of time. It's a great CD to sit back and relax to And my wife loves it.
B0000844MV|3.0|This is a great movie. WHY did they dub it. I would like to get a copy of the original German version with subtitles.<BR>Dubbed movies destroy the feeling. The rhythm is all lost!<BR>This is as bad as Ted Turner colorizing all of the great black and white movies!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I considered myself a Sarah McLachlan fan from the days of &quot;Solace.&quot;  I loved both that album and &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot;  With the release of &quot;Surfacing,&quot; I was disheartened, and with &quot;Afterglow&quot; I just can't be a Sarah fan any longer.  I only found 2 songs to be good (&quot;Perfect Girl&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot;), another 3 to be so-so, and the rest of the album to be tripe.    It's a sleepy version of &quot;Surfacing&quot; with nothing new to offer.  Even Sarah sounds bored singing her songs, and she looks sleepy in each of the three photos where she's shutting her eyes.<br />Could there be any less emotion as she sings &quot;'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen&quot; in &quot;Train Wreck&quot;?<br />Then: &quot;you save me<BR>you complete me<BR>you're the one true thing i know i can believe in&quot; in &quot;Push:&quot;<br />Say it isn't so Sarah...this has got to be the absolute worst song you have ever written.  Trite!<br />I'm just so disappointed with this album.  The only thing I can think to use it for is to put me to sleep.
B000002U94|4.0|I got this album on vinyl at the end of the Eighties and inmediately fell in love with it cause very few sets can top this one, and I just ripped the cd version a friend of mine lent me yesterday. <br />A nasty surprise was waiting for me - the most rockin' song on the cd (Let It Rock) has been edited for this one, and unnecessarily so, because the normal version appearing on the vinyl would've had room here as well, being only two minutes longer than the edited one (For the record, the cd's running time is 73 min, so there was no need to cut the song). The keyboard and sax solos after Drew Abbott's incredible solo have been lost alongside the 'shake, baby shake' audience chanting as well.<br />This annoying thing aside, the cd rocks all the way through, despite the fact it has not been remastered and this is something we'd all have acknowledged, no matter the vinyl sounded awesome.<br />4/5.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania and her bandmates look and sound fantastic! They make such an excellent ensemble and their performance in this concert is worth every penny. What a performer! What a dvd! Shania moves around a lot So there is a lot of action to see. From moving around on stage with the band to making her way down into the audience. Shania knows how to pull a crowd into the show So even if you weren't there you'll definitely get the full concert experience. The editing could have been better. The sound quality is good especially if you listen to this dvd with headphones on. For the diehard fan a must!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I listened to Jack's first CD continuously for the first 6 months I had it without even changing it. That is great! This CD is even better. With even more soul than the first, Johnson vocals and lyrics are excellent. The CD is great for everything, dinner, a date, driving to go surf, its all perfect. Every song portrays a different feeling. This CD is well rounded, yet each song flows into the next.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania sings all her hits in this explosive dvd that would be a great gift for the holidays.  only 3 songs from her woman in me album though, but come on over and up she sings most all of the singles and more.
B00005QG9J|2.0|Horrible, nothing like the old days,hopefully next CD will be better. BTW, their not so hot live either :-\
B000065TQR|5.0|These guys used to hang out with Hawkwind about a million years ago, doing free gigs and 'stuff'.  They don't sound all that much like their pals, though; compared to the first Hawkwind album, most of the Pinks' debut is a lot more polished and (dare one say) accomplished.  Yeah, there is some noodling about ('Uncle Harry's Last Freakout' would have been a lot better had the band not tried so hard to make it sound so. . .well, like a Freak Out) but that's okay.  The songwriting is great elsewhere, especially on the first five tracks (Side One of the original LP), and the hazy production gives the whole project a sort of ether-like effect.  'Do It', named after Jerry Ruben's Anarchist manifesto, leads the album with an appropriately anarchic statement of intent.  'Heavenly Man' is a stunner, a metallic ballad (nowadays they cunningly call this sort of thing a Power Ballad, folks) with a decidedly smoky aura, and the title track is an amusing and catchy little invitational calypso: 'Come, we'll take you by the hand, we'll fly to Never Never Land, we plan to never never land', get it?  It goes on little too long after the punchline, but that's what happens when you hang around Hawkwind.  Also included for Your Listening Pleasure on this reissue:  the original B-side single-version of 'Do It' along with its A-side 'The Snake' ('He's comin' here, he's comin' there, he's comin' almost everywhere'- - talk about stamina), and an early take on 'Uncle Harry' which proves that the Freak-Out was pretty well-rehearsed after all. Oh yeah, and a pretty decent extended disco remix of 'War Girl'.  Just kidding, it isn't really disco.
0684803356|1.0|Hemingway will be remembered as the Lord Byron of the 20th century; vastly overrated, woefully untalented.
B00009TB5G|5.0|It will be difficult for me to say anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll say that the extended scenes and new scenes are worth the price of the set alone and that they add a new depth and flesh out the movie a lot more.

B000002J29|5.0|Rara vez me da por comentar trabajos que ya han sido extensamente reseñados. Pero en este caso, conviene detenerse. SECONDS OUT fue grabado luego de que Peter Gabriel se separara del grupo y, a decir verdad, eran muy pocos los que pensaban que la banda sobrevivirìa. Sus composiciones, su talento en el escenario y su voz lo convirtieron en el alma del grupo. Es aquì donde GENESIS decide grabar una serie de conciertos que efectuò por Europa entre 1976 y 1977 (una làstima que los vì mucho despuès). Escuchè este albùm por primera vez en 1977 y crèame, no hay canciòn que tenga desperdicio. Son muy pocas las bandas que pueden superar sus grabaciones en directo. Este es el caso de GENESIS. Escuchar la versiòn en directo de &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, &quot;Cinema Show&quot; y &quot;Afterglow&quot; es impresionante. Es una làstima que no se incluyera en este CD las versiones de &quot;Chosen One&quot; y de la mejor canciòn interpretada por GENESIS, &quot;Fountain of Salmacis&quot; y sì se hiciera en la versiòn revisada de THREE SIDES LIVE. Definitivamente, este es uno de los mejores CD en directo grabados...... <br />I asked myself: &quot;why I'm doing this review after 66 people doing it? Simply, this is a very special work. SECONDS OUT was recorded after the departure of Peter Gabriel from the band. Many people thought that losing GENESIS &quot;mastermind&quot;, the band was over. That's why GENESIS record this live album in 1977, a recopilation of they performance in Europe between 1976 and 1977. There are few groups that can perform even better at the stage for a couple of reasons. GENESIS is one of the megagroups that do this by far. &quot;Supper's ready&quot;, &quot;Cinema show&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot; are my favorites, but the whole CD is a jewel. It was a real petty that &quot;Chosen One&quot; and, perphaps, one of the best progressive songs ever made, &quot;Fountain of Salmacis&quot; (that were part of the tour of 1976-77) appears in the new remaster vertion of THREE SIDE LIVE....Nevertheless, this is a truly masterpiece of progressive sound......
B0000DIXRU|5.0|Here is another masterpiece by one of the greatest band around today...Anathema. I didn't believe that after A Fine Day To Exit (maybe the best album of the band)they were able to repeat the unrepeateble......but that's it! Far from the sound of their old works A natural disaster is a mix of what I have heard on Fine day to exit and something new...the mood is the same of the preceding work, the lyrics are similar and the emotional intensity as well, but the songs are easier and more direct, reaching the ears and the heart of the listener as a sharp blade. This album is an earthquake of deep feelings and emotions, a trip into the inside of ourselves.....

B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; album its have alot of traditional songs on it that Whitney Houston deliver on. Starting with &quot;O Holy Night&quot; after hearing Whitney Houston sing &quot;O Holy Night&quot; nobody else can sing this song like she did. Whitney made the song into a rollercoaster ride...She takes you High then low then have you sping around. Whitney's voice is amazing on &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; she belts like she use to do its great. Whitney Houston is back like you never heard her before!
B00003CX5P|1.0|It's sad when a creator has completely lost<BR>touch with his creation.
0385504209|5.0|Yes, it's a work of fiction, but, much like some of the classics, this highly controversial book can be a reason for some people to take up lessons from - well- Torquemada.  Christianity's  early leaders quickly recognized how to wield the power that they held and as a result we had bonfires, crusades, and ultimately Hitler.  Dan Brown skillfully shows that the horrors of Christianity can only be attributed to men.  Men were so eager to have all the power that they even controlled physical love, most particularly love for the Woman.  In this country, \\"carnal\\" love it's still a \\"sin\\" and a source for scandals.  Christianity effectively stifled science, individualism, respect for other cultures, but prominently fostered xenophobia, homophobia, hypocrisy and cynicism.<br /> Luckily for us all, the church has less power these days, otherwise Dan Brown would have been burned at the stake and his books burned as well (maybe we would all be tortured for reading them too and forced to denounce the book).  I invite all the reasonable human beings to rejoice about this fact and explore myriads of other historical enigmas that are often, just like Da Vinci's clues, are hidden in plain site.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|After buying Harry's new album, Ashanti's new album and Bebe n CeCe's Christmas albums, Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; is the only one that I have grown to love over the past few weeks.<br />THE VOICE!!!!!!!!! It is completley AMAZING..everyone who doesen't like it should go 2 hell becuase she sounds great and it looks like she is FINALLY in a good place in her life. From &quot;The First Noel&quot; to &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot;, you will NOT be disapointed with this CD---A MUST BUY TREASURE!
B000001E3V|4.0|I am listen this wonderful record some thirty years after attending the(Friday early) show, where this recording comes from (well the series of shows anyway).<br />After exiting the Fillmore, being unable to hear from the incredible volume, I ran into a friend on the late show line and all he wanted to know was &quot; did he play?&quot;  That was enough said, and the question most everybody going to the show wanted to know.  I too have reservations he'd play pop songs and sing way more than play.  Well as we all can hear, HE PLAYED!  These performances are way more coherent than I remember.  The playing is clean and inventive.  Short of the Allman Brothers, and maybe a very good Santana release, this is likely one of the  definitive live recordings from the Filmore, at least for me, and not to be missed.<br />Now, I know they recorded the J.Geils band's closing Filmore sets, and this I'd also like to hear again!<br />Larry
B00006690G|1.0|I never really understood why this guy is so overhyped. Maybe it's because the trendy suburban crowd finally have an idol they can worship because of his skin color. Interscope catered to the sheltered suburban sheep with this one. Now all the suburban little boys and girls can pretend that they're from the streets!
B00006J9OT|5.0|I always get a little excited when another Diana Krall cd is released. I think I have almost everything she's recorded commercially and have rarely been disappointed. She's not Oscsar Peterson or Shirley Horn but then who is? She is just Diana doing what she does best, just playing, swinging and singing with mostly with a small group that really kicks on several cuts like the opener, &quot;I Love Being Here With You&quot;. She also included a few cuts from other cd's (Deed I do, Devil May Care, etc.). Personally, I think a great deal of Diana Krall's success has been due to her ability to put just enough of a vocal twist to many old standards to pump some new life in them and make them appealing again. She does that again on this cd.If I had any complaint about this particular cd, it would be the lack of album notes which, for some reason, were restricted to track listings. I would have enjoyed some description of her Paris tour.Other than that, I believe &quot;Live in Paris&quot; is another one of Diana's cd's that will again spur the question from casual listeners &quot;Who's that singing&quot;?It's Diana Krall.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Don't buy it. It's 2 CDs, one of 35 minutes, the other of 21. So you'll pay double for 56 minutes of the worst music in the Beatles' career, with dire, dull, boring performances. Only two exceptions: the crisper &quot;For You Blue&quot; and the better &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. Excepting these two cases, Spector's album is light years better than this stuff.<br />    With zillions of hours of rehearsals and outtakes, was this the best they could do with disc 2? I'm really angry at this ripoff.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|After suffering through the Matrix reloaded I couldn't help but be reminded of the second Highlander movie. <BR>Highlander 2 (the Quickening) was not only a bad movie in its own right but managed to completely alter the way I felt about the first instalment. All mystery had been explained away with a cheesy sci-fi plot (something about planet Zargon?).<BR>The comparison may be a little unfair on the Matrix but at least Highlander 2 didn't drag on for hours.<BR>The original Matrix (like Highlander) was a great movie that should have remained sequel free.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|I give three stars for only three listenable songs, Voyageur, Boum Boum, Page of Cups..........
B00003CXXM|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie when it came out, as I am a huge fan of the original Ludlum books. (The Bourne Identity, Supremancy and Ultimatum) As is all too often the case in movies adapted from books, this version sacrifices far too much to get it to the big screen. The depth of the plot of the book is truly stunning - the twists and turns are intriguing and really serve to drive the book forward. The movie eliminates a lot of the back story to fit in the time limit. While I will agree that the action and pace of the movie are on the high side, I was very disappointed in how little of the original plot was preserved. And while I've loved Matt Damon in some of his other roles, I don't feel that he did a very good job of portraying the inner turmoil of Jason Bourne as he struggles through his amnesia and trying to discover who he is. If you haven't already read the book, then the movie might still be enjoyable, but fans of the original novel will likely find that this film version comes up short. If you've already seen the movie, please read the book - you won't regret it.
B0000UJFCO|4.0|When news first came out concerning Yes recording with an orchestra, I was excited about the prospect. After Magnification came out, they had fulfilled my expectations. When the DVD became available, I purchased it immediately. While the performances are first rate, they aren't without reservations. First off, while Tom Breslin is a competent keyboardist, personally he isn't the same caliber of musician as the actual members of Yes are. I'm sure that there are a myriad of other more competent keyboard players(my first choice would've been Rick Wakeman but egos/schedules didn't allow) that would have allowed for a better integration between musicians. The aging &quot;hippie&quot; antics of Jon Anderson were a bit distracting (see other reviews) but that is part of Jon's nature. The icons and animation were the most aggrevating, distracting and amateurish pieces of drek that I've seen. I realize that Jon is interested in computer animation but  please leave their performance dvd's alone. Those complaints aside, this is an exellent dvd for any Yes fan. The accompanying cd in this set is an abridged version of the dvd leaving out &quot;In The Presence Of&quot;, &quot;Magnification&quot;, &quot;Gates Of Delerium&quot;, &quot;Ritual&quot;(some of the better performances in the dvd) and Steve Howe's solo segment so it's a little disappointing in that respect.
B000056HE9|4.0|&quot;The Bishop's Wife&quot; is one of the better Christmas movies out there.  I wouldn't place it as high as &quot;Miracle on 34th Street,&quot; but it's in that league, and certainly has a similar feel.<br />Henry Koster does a fine job of giving the film a leisurely pace without letting it drag, and the performances are uniformly solid.  It is somewhat of a shame to see David Niven stuck in a part that doesn't allow him much room for humour, as he can be so funny.  And I do have to admit that Loretta Young's allure alludes me somewhat.  She doesn't seem very dynamic for two men (or should I say a man and an angel) to be making such a fuss over.  But she's certainly more than passable.<br />One of my favorite performances came from Elsa Lanchester, in a minor role as the family maid.<br />This movie becomes magical only once---during the ice skating scene between Cary Grant, Young and James Gleason.  That could have gone on for hours and I would have been transfixed.  But not every movie can be magical, and this film is a very good (if non-magical) one. <br />Pop in on a snowy night, light the Christmas tree, make some hot chocolate, and enjoy.<br />Grade: B+
B00005KARK|2.0|As a disabled woman I can wholeheartedly recomend such Disney movies such as Finding Nemo but have a hard time recomending Dumbo. Dumbo was made fun of by everyone except the crows and his mother in the movie and was treated cruely. In the end, the thing that made everyone like Dumbo was when they found out Dumbo could fly. So if Dumbo never learned to fly they would have never considered him worth treating nice? Cruddy message.

B00004Z400|5.0|From my car to my system at home this cd is getting none stop play. I orginally listened to this album the week it came out (in 2000) and didn't like it. It all seemed to run together. &quot;Change&quot; was all that stood out. I have recently been going through a sort of musical awakening. Which started with &quot;Tool&quot; which led me to &quot;A Perfect Circle&quot; and then to the &quot;Deftones&quot;. I believe this cd is for the more enlighten listener and not for the average person who frequents the MTV top 25 scene. I must for rock fans!!

0897500482|5.0|This book is a great look at training and gives you a complete view of combat in all its ranges Bruce was an ultimate fighter before Ultimate fighting was a thought. I also advise anyone whoe has read this book to pick up Revelations of a Warrior it is light an up date to real fighting from a real street soldier.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Let's face it... this album changed the rap game completely in 1996 and early 1997.  The talent of this individual was amazing...he recorded this flawless album in 7 days!  The 12 Tracks on this album have influenced such hip hop heavyweights as Eminem and 50 Cent (both have said they feel this is one of the most powerful rap albums of all time).  Shakur is raw on this battle record, yet also shows his dual nature and rhymes about women's rights and African American struggle.  This is a must have for any hip hop fan.  If you don't buy any other rap album in your life time, Makaveli's DK7DT is one you should purchase!
B00009TB5G|5.0|For those of you who love The Lord of the Rings series, but have not seen the extended versions, you are missing out!  The Two Towers E.V. (Extended Version) shows over 40 minutes of extra scenes.  After seeing many of the scenes, I understand more of the movie.<br />The E.V. consists of 4 discs, 1-2 being the movie.  In the first disc, I thought that the extra scenes were simply used as humor devices to lighten the movie.  The first DVD, however, did not seem to contain as many significant added scenes than the second.  In the second disc, there were more influencial scenes in which I thought provided a clearer understanding to certain parts.  I will not go into detail, but to name a few, there was a scene where we understand more about who Faromir is his relationship to his father and brother, Boromir, who was part of the Fellowship.  There was a scene in which involved the trees playing a more significant role as to the outcome of the Battle of Helms Deep.  Already, I can not go on!  Take my word for it and see the E.V.  It will be well worth the time!<br />The two other discs that come with the movie are more features.  These features are very fun to browse through as it contains more interviews with people who helped make the movie and such.  There are behind the scenes activity and more.  My favorite was looking at the art work of nearly all the characters and the designing and building of Middle-Earth.  I suggest after watching the movie, you take some time to browse through these features, as I am sure you would then agree it was well worth the money you put in.  Be careful where you buy it, though.  If you do not plan to purchase it through Amazon (which I suggest you purchase it from), be aware that there are prices ranging above $35 elsewhere. Just an FYI.  I could go on about how great this extended version was and how much I enjoyed it, but it is an experience in which you should feel for yourself.  Enjoy!
B000075BFK|5.0|Despite what critics of his posthumous albums say (u know the arguements: oh they are reaping off of his death, oh he would never remix the tracks, yada yada yada), this album is a great collection of Shakur's Makaveli era tracks. The production is great on this album and fit the songs perfectly.  I could not find any flaws on this one, in all honesty.  It's too bad this album was not promoted as well as it should have been...My Block Remix, Thugz Mansion w/ Ant Hamilton, Mama's Just a Little Girl and the title track, Better Dayz, are great singles that could have been used for promotion.  Despite the mistake of putting Nas on an acoustic version of Thufz, which is probably the one thing I hate about this album and the thing that probably turned many fans off, this album is very solid.  The much anticipated &quot;Fame,&quot; which pac referred to in an old interview is included in this album.  It confirmed the existence of this song which has been hotly debated among fans for years...  The people at Amaru are trying their best with all of the politics involved in dealing with Interscope and Death Row.  Give them credit on this one...  This is a great album.  People should purchase this one!
B00008WG3U|5.0|IT sounds just like every other NOFX CD. But there's nothing wrong with that!!! Some Idoiots out there are like this cd sounds so different or they matured. B.S&gt; It's a NOFX cd. They are still the immature punks that they always were and always will be, which is a good thing. It's a new NOFX cd. Enough said. Buy IT!!!!!
B00005AQE8|5.0|The first double album in hip hop history is well worth the purchase.  This album is considered by many hip hop fans as a classic.  Shakur was out of jail and hungry in the studio.  He did not disappoint.  This album changed the game in 1996 and established Shakur as a powerful artist in music regardless of genre.  Production is flawless.  The last two or three songs on the 2nd CD were not as potent as the other tracks; however, one cannot deny that this is a true hip hop classic in every sense.  A must have for the collection!
B00005UEAR|5.0|I will be honest with you, I did not like this album when I first heard it. In fact, I wanted to smash it with a baseball bat, but I do believe everything deserves a second chance. When I listened to this album again I was completely floored by the agressive manner in which the band was playing. This album is heavy and immensely dark. I don't care if the songs are 30 minutes each, this band pulls out all the stops with this album. From epic songs to more straight-forward progressive metal songs, Dream Theater did a fine job of constructing all of the songs. By far better, to me anyway, than anything they have done. For those of you who enjoy extremely dark progressive metal then &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; will be an outstanding addition to your music collection. Oh, and guitarist John Petrucci absolutely rips on this album (as usual).

0060930187|5.0|One of the best reads of my life.  Dark, brooding, and insightful.  This is a chronicle of an ambitious woman who happens to have problems.  A brilliant woman poet on the verges of successful publication, depressive descents, mood swings, and family life.  Sylvia Plath's autobiography of a time in her life under the Bell Jar.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|\\"Underworld\\" has two great things in it; beautiful images and elegant Kate Beckinsale.  Period.  Except for them, you get nothing particularly special about it -- the actions are not new, the acting is not good, and most of all the story is very slow-moving and uninvolving.  <br />\\"Underworld\\" is, some say, the Romeo and Juliet story in vimpire/werewolf version.  This account is quite misleading.  It is about Ms Beckinsale's Selene, deadly assassin with guns among the vampire clan.  They are fighting the bloody war so long with the now-outnumbered werewolves (Lycans, they are called), so no one remembers the original cause of the war.  So, Selene is told to kill, and she kills.  So far so good.  <br />And the opening subway gun-shooting scenes are reasonably done.  And Scott Speedman's doctor named Michael enters as the possible target of the Lycans.  Selene only seems aware of the fact that Michael has some secret he doesn't know, but the leader of the Lycans (Michael Sheen) is desperately after.  Now the plot is going to thicken.<br />But it doesn't.  Soon we get confused because of the very clumsy storytelling, i.e. talk, talk, talk, which includes many monologues, intricate relations of characters, and some ritualsa and traditions about the dynasty of old, sleeping vampires.  Some are intrigued by these webs of facts, but I must say ... Isn't this supposed to be Romeo and Juliet?<br />The director Len Wiseman unaccountably doesn't show any interest in the relations between Beckinsale and Speedman.  This misguided choice kills any potential power they might have been given; instead, we start to lose interest in them.  How should we care these uninteresting characters?<br />If you have seen \\"Blade\\" \\"Blade 2\\" or the first \\"Crow\\", don't expect the actions, which lack originality.  Not that they are bad -- far from it.  But the fact remains that we have seen more exciting and unique ones in them, and to make matters worse, for all the inclusion of creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, the werewolves are not convincing.<br />We got good production designs including the cobbled streets of Budapest; we got credible and often very sinister atomospher.  Still we need more power, or elegance, or humor, or anything here, which might heighten the tension between the two clans.  We need danger, and only in danger Beckinsale's death dealer starts to shine.
B0000TB03W|5.0|There in the lights the crowd the noise then the music startes and Shania starts to sing and everyone goes wild and then they start to sing along. Shania in all her beauty starts singing man I feel like a women and goes on to the end with rock this country. Singing the best I have heard her old and new songs to the complete delight of everyone in the crowd. No goes away unhappy except maybe they did not touch hands with her. She jumps down sings with a young women touchs many hands to show her love for the fans. This is the one and you can see it now.
0800177975|4.0|After his monumental success with Terminator 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger re-united with his Predator director John McTiernan for this action/fantasy farce.  The storyline concerns a young boy (Austin O'Brien) who comes across a magic movie ticket which allows Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger), a movie character who is played by Arnie, to leave his film world and come to the real world.  Get all that?  Good.  Schwarzenegger (who also served as executive producer) is great as he pokes fun at his action roles, his career, and himself.  The cast is sharp (including Charles Dance, Mercedes Ruehl, Tom Noonan, Bridgette Wilson, and Ian McKellan) with plenty of cameos (including Jean Claude Van Damme, Sharon Stone, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick, and Arnie's wife Maria Shriver) and the action is nicely directed, but Last Action Hero comes close to wearing out it's welcome thanks to it's overly long running time and anti-climatic ending.  Last Action Hero wasn't too well received by critics upon it's release, but it still stands as a fun Arnie romp.
B0000TB03W|5.0|In time there comes along those who stand above the rest of the crowd. One such person is Johnny Cash &quot;the man in black&quot;. He is seen as the one outlaw at the top. Well this has happend again in that now Shania Twain is here and singing. She is an &quot;outlaw&quot; in her own way and has fought the regular ways of Country music to gain her own foot hold. Well it is no longer a foot hold it is the top of the ladder and this DVD is the very best of her and her ability to sing. She is on top of it all in this DVD. She did not miss anything and in fact she made everythig perfect. This is an excellent outstanding DVD. One that you need to have.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|This is by far one of the best live cds I have ever heard and seen. I have heard a lot of live albums and the problem with lots of them is that the bands sound like crap live but Coldplay has the same great sound in concert as they do on their albums. The Dvd is really awesome and reminded me of how great their show really was. Another review of this album said that all their songs were the same as on the albums and they didn't change anything. And that is total bull!!! I own everyone of the coldplay cds including the limited print Blue Room EP and they did add things and make changes to their songs to make them even better. Overall I feel that if you like Coldplay you should buy this cause you will not be disappointed by the quality and energy on this set.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I just received my own copy of this DVD and watched it again and it is good. Her movements, energy and ability to sing is just over whleming. It is far and above the best preformance she has done. She is just getting better and better and one wonders how much futher can she go.
0812550706|5.0|If you're looking for a quick, light read; or you're looking for a serious, well-written piece of literature; or you're looking for a fictional treatise on leadership and command; or you're looking for a socially-charged essay about the dangers of charismatic leaders and clashes of cultures - this is a GREAT choice.<br />Card created a fantastic - maybe even unique - work in Ender's Game.  From a military perspective, only the scenery and technology is unfamiliar - set as it is in a time far in the future.  Otherwise, the book could be a textbook on extreme leadership challenges.  In fact, it was recommended to me while I was attending a military leadership school.  And it was better than any of the assigned textbooks or practical exercises.<br />Not &quot;into&quot; the military - don't fret.  There's enough anti-establishment, anti-violence undertone in the book's message to tickle anyone's imagination.<br />Highly recommended, and couldn't agree LESS with the reviewer who complained about the book's message.  It's not about the virtue of child labor - it's about the virtue of a childlike sense of loyalty and adventure, a child's willingness to take risks, a child's love of the &quot;game&quot;.  And, most of all, it's a serious message about the contrasts between intelect and experience.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|ah, the strokes. they have militantly avoided being the darlings of the fashion industry, but their tapered jeans, cheekbones, and natty jackets have failed them. like their appearances, their music is as eclectic and contrived. on room on fire, they continue to amaze me in their seamless combonation of velvets-style stupor and arena pop-metal pomp, maybe even a little television (marquee moon, anyone...?). room on fire does not not offer anything new, but do not be so quick to equate originality with integrity. the familiar &quot;billie jean&quot; snap courtesy of fabrizio moretti is as fresh as it was twenty years ago, and let's face it--will michael be needing it anytime soon?<br />if you liked is this is or the modern age ep, room on fire will not dissapoint.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|if you look through alot of these customer reviews, you start to see a trend.  big fans giving 5 stars and then random people (who have written more than one review, which is odd) giving the cd 1 star.  hmm, usually they either have references to mariah carey in their review or you see that all the other cds they reviewed are mariah carey cds with 5 stars.  so you come to realize that mariah carey fans have an unhealthy obsession with trying to keep whitney's new cds from being successful.  is this because of insecurity, jealousy, pure insanity? its obvious they feel threatened and have way too much free time. look at new york times online, and any other website for newspapers online, better yet check your local paper.  they have all written glowing reviews of this cd.

B0000AQS0F|2.0|In all fairness, I only caught one episode of FIREFLY (&quot;Shindig&quot;) before Fox yanked it. So I am giving it two stars to be fair. I will also make an sincere attempt to rent the video set and watch the whole thing. I have to admit that in my one-episode view, I was very put off by the whole Wild West thing -- in my humble opinion, when a futuristic sci fi series utilizes 19th century costumes, it isn't some act of great cleverness...it's because it is far cheaper to dip into the movie studio's big archives of western clothing from various cowboy series of the past than it is to come up with neat, interesting futuristic costumes (and requires far less imagination).<br />I have to mention, also, because I just read all 158 reviews here on Amazon, and not a single one of mostly enthusiastic supporters managed to say: This is basically a re-do of Joss Whedon's &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; plot minus, of course, the copyrighted Aliens. Honest.<br />I always thought that &quot;Alien Resurrection's&quot; crew of the freighter &quot;The Betty&quot; had some kind of backstory that never made it to the screen. Unfortunately due to the demands of the Alien franchise, half of the Betty crew gets eaten...and early on. I think Whedon always wanted to develop this idea, and &quot;Firefly&quot; was his big chance.<br />Don't believe me? Re-rent &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The Betty is also a small, dirty unregistered freighter running slightly illegal operations, occasionally smuggling or doing mercenary work in a ragtag universe. Just like FIrefly, aside from the famous &quot;Aliens&quot; (who are unknown to most of humanity) there are no other extra terrestrials (ala Star Trek) in this universe. Despite being set 500 years in the future (just like Firefly), the sci-fi setting looks contemporary and industrial...no fancy high tech anything. And it's very dirty. The Betty originally had a crew of 8 (cut down in the final shooting script to just six) and the Serenity has acrew of 9.<br />The Betty captain is crude mouthed, morally ambivalent but is basically a decent guy, who thinks of the crew as a kind of family -- he calls the ship the &quot;family wagon&quot; and its constantly out of food or supplies. While he isn't exactly married, he is clearly in a long-term romantic relationship with the ship's pilot. The ship's mechanic is a fiesty, cute young girl, just out of her teens. There a &quot;muscle man&quot;, who is big and burly but a nice guy underneath it all. The ship's female pilot and second-in-command is a tough cookie who is just as smart and strong as the guys.<br />I can only guess that this is an idea Whedon just can't get out of his system...he was reportedly VERY unhappy with the final shooting script and production of &quot;Resurrection&quot;, as were most hardcore Alien fans. Maybe it would have worked a whole lot better to have started &quot;Firefly&quot;  off as a movie, maybe on the Sci Fi network if not big screen, and THEN spun off a series... .when there was a measurable fan base. Cuz THIS method sure didn't work.<br />Clearly everything to do with the advertising/promotion and the scheduling of Firefly was blown, big time. I am generally a sci fi fan, and would have given it a chance, but the reviews were very damning and the whole western thing really put me off. It will be interesting to see what kind of movie Joss Whedon comes up with out of the flotsam and jetsam that is left...for example, will he shoot the movie with the same cast as the TV series?<br />Not really a good or bad review here....I just think that fans and even non-fans ought to know what the back story is.

0312263120|3.0|This is the third book I've read in the Dan Brown series and this book is probably a trial run of writing a thrilling novel. This book wasn't researched as much as his future books like &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and of course &quot;DaVinci Code&quot; so it doesn't have the mystery and realism that makes his books enticing.  The premise of the book was interesting but how the book developed the plot was weak and probably played on the paranoia of sending covert e-mails at that time.  After awhile it was just unbelievable.  Halfway through the book you'll realize and say to yourself, &quot;So what if the bad guy gets what he wants, it doesn't scare me.  The world's no worse off.&quot;  The prose is simple which I think is fine to a certain extent but the flow of the prose was choppy at times when it didn't need to be.  It's fine of the book is describing some exciting scene where action is about to happen but during a lull in the story the prose can almost be aggravating.  <br />All in all the book passes as a decent read yet Brown's skills as a suspense novelist haven't developed yet.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This DVD is a must have!  If you watch the show then you know that its about Clark Kent (aka Superman) back in high school, where he also battles bad guys.  I didn't buy the DVD when it came out because I had already seen most of the episodes, but then I started missing some of the episodes so I decided to buy the DVD, and I was so glad I did. Buy the DVD if you absolutely love the show, its cool because its played in widescreen, which if you're like me you'll appreciate it. Seriously go out and buy the DVD, you'll be glad you did.

6303855512|4.0|This film is one of the strangest films you may encounter. The search for a father that turns sour-sweet, sour first because the father does not want to believe the boy is his son, sweet then because after some negociating with several witnesses of the meeting he will accept the idea and come to some fatherly agreement. The search for a father by a mother for her daughter in order to attempt her salvation from drugs and the salvation of the baby she is carrying. It turns frankly sour if not even bitter without any hope for recognition from the daughter and any salvation. The search for some financial success that has to do with hard work on the side of Auggie and pure luck on the side of Thomas, aka Rashid. And the good luck of one will compensate for his negligence that turned the hard work of the other into destruction and loss. And it all ends with a strange Christmas story, for the New York Times, mind you, where Auggie assumes the identity of a shoplifter of his and celebrates Christmas with the shoplifter's blind grandmother and shoplifts her apartment of a brand new camera that was probably stolen anyway in the first place. The film ends thus on pictures of the obvious pleasure of the black grandmother kissing and hugging the white Auggie as if he were her black grandson who had of course forgotten to come and celebrate Christmas with his grandmother, too busy he was shoplifting magazines, or other valueless goods, here and there.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Expressive but not overextended. The compositions are balanced without being monotonous; she sings the line and moves on. The album is an island of musicianship in the current sea of  (albeit interesting) pressured rhyme atop grainy samples or monotonous breakbeats. A long awaited welcome back to sophistication. Excellent for a rainy day, or with a glass of port by candlelight.
0780624890|4.0|I know that some people will point to &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; as good comic book adaptations; that they are, but the subsequent attempts fell flat on their face.  I believe that &quot;Blade&quot; paved the way for the current &quot;comic book adaptation renaissance&quot; that we're enjoying right now (apart from the Hulk, anyway.)<br />For starters, Blade stays far away from the entire &quot;secret identity/pulling cats out of trees&quot; cliches that are normally associated with superheroes.  Blade is dirty, Blade is nasty, and Blade isn't afraid to kill; in short, the makes the movie much better suited for modern audiences.<br />Another thing I like about &quot;Blade&quot; is that it keeps the character's origin as a backstory; it's explained, yes, but does not make up the bulk of the action.  This prevents long-time Marvel readers from being bored and gives more time to devote to the action.<br />I've dinged the DVD a star for a couple of reasons; first, the special effects aren't very good in some places (like when Frost regenerates his hand.)  I know the movie was made on a shoe-string, so maybe I'm being a bit unfair, but I still feel that they could have done a little better.  Also, you have to sit through commentary during the deleated scenes, which I would have preferred to have been a seperate option (at least they got rid of the original ending, though; that, in itself, would have made Blade a much worse movie.)<br />Great movie for vampire/horror/action movie fans.
B000007MVM|3.0|If anything, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; is aptly titled. It's just that...mad! Syd Barrett was most certainly dancing on that thin line between reality and delusion when he wrote and recorded his 1970 album as evident in his monotonous voice, lazy guitar picking, inconsistent rhythm playing and (at times) incoherent lyrics.<BR>On most of the tracks, the inconsistency and delusion makes for some pretty groovy lava lamp listening (the haunting &quot;Golden Hair&quot; and melancholy &quot;Long Gone&quot; for instance). On others, it's just plain stupid (Love You being the perfect example<BR>Psychedelic and (in particular) Pink Floyd fans should, by all means check it out. But I warn you, don't expect Piper At The Gates of Dawn.
B00005JL2O|3.0|&quot;Goldmember,&quot; like &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me,&quot; sees a lot of the jokes from the first film recycled.  However, I like &quot;Goldmember&quot; better than Austin Powers 2 because I feel that it offered a little bit more originality.  This doesn't mean that it's neccessarily funnier, though.<br />The best departure from Austin Powers 2 is the addition of the Foxy Cleopatra character, who gives the film a completely different spin from the first two Austin Powers movies.<br />The &quot;Hard Knock Life&quot; video between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me is exceptionally funny, as is the interaction between Austin Powers and his father.<br />However, I disliked the ending, and also felt that the &quot;Goldmember&quot; character himself was irrelevant to the plot.  <br />Better than Austin Powers 2, but just can't compare to the original.
B000002UA0|3.0|In 1967, Pink Floyd (with original guitarist, Syd Barrett) entered Abbey Road studios and recorded an album that would later be regarded as a masterpiece of British psychedelia. Featuring crudely written guitar riffs, acidic hammond organ, monotonous singing, long free form jams, eastern chanting and strange animal noises, Piper at the Gates of Dawn is quite a trip. <BR>Piper at the Gates of Dawn plays out like a collection of Grimms fairy tales. You have the obligatory mystical characters, lollipops and gingerbread men which can be fun in a demented way, but tracks like &quot;The Gnome&quot; are just a fruitless (or fruity, depending on how you look at it)attempt at being trippy. <BR>Then we have the jams. Granted, the original Pink Floyd lineup was somewhat technically challenged and with the exception of Interstellar Overdrive, the jams seem long winded and unable to carry themselves. I'm not asking for a Ry Cooder solo, but a few interesting guitar licks or organ runs on &quot;Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk&quot; or &quot;Pow R Toc H&quot; would have breathed some life to the 8 minute sound-effects drones. <BR>Overall however, &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; is pure acid rock fun. Dated? Yeah. Self indulgent? Sure. Childish? You betcha. But for those of us who just enjoy rocking out, &quot;Piper&quot; is worth a spin or two
B00000ILDE|5.0|I know it's a science fiction movie, but I get more freaked out by this movie than any other film I own.  The film plays upon fears that people generally have--the unknown, the dark, insects--and exploits all of them brilliantly.  The action scenes are very well shot, and the film, as a whole, is acted out very well.  A must for any science fiction/horror fan (stop with this film, though; don't bother with the last two films in the &quot;Alien&quot; Legacy.)
B00005JKC3|3.0|A pattern is starting to develop here.  All the superhero movies with the exception of the X-men in recent years have all been terrible.  Why is that?  I think the big reason is that the studios emphasize the wrong things.  First and foremost they ought to work on the story, but the screenplay often seems to be an afterthought.  Instead, they focus on who is going to star in the film, and on all the special effects.  At least THE HULK showed signs of the filmmakers trying to make a good movie.  They tried to do more with the plot than in, say, THE DAREDEVIL or the first SPIDERMAN.  I will add that I think the next SPIDERMAN could be really good, because Michael Chabon did the story.  But we'll have to see what happens.

0553212478|4.0|As with many of the other reviews for this novel, I too was surprised to find that the original character bore little resemblance to the movie representation.  This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech.  While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure.  It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility.  This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them.  There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help.  I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions.

B00005JMFR|5.0|\\"Revolutions\\", part III of the Matrix trilogy, is a fitting conclusion to one of the most creative film concepts ever conceived. Along with \\"Star Wars\\" and the \\"Jurassic Park\\" films, it will go down in film-making history for its originality and unique, special effects. Part III pulls together the mystery, intrigue, romance, and tensions developed in the first two films. The mysticism and religious allusions are effectively balanced with the \\"war\\" that is inevitable ...<br />It begins with both Neo and the other guy lying on two stretchers - out cold, trapped in the cyberspace of \\"the Matrix\\". Trinity, Morpheus and the others are trying to revive them, to return them intact to Zion. The next scene is Neo at a train station ... talking to an Indian couple and a little girl of about 4 years old. They are waiting for the 'trainmaster' who will help them return to the 'real world', for them it is the one created by machines. Neo learns, the little girl, is Seti, their daughter, whom they love ... but she is a program, who can be deleted. Neo discovers how \\"love\\" transcends *even* the programming of machines. Neo finds out the trainman works for the Frenchman, the Frenchman controls their fate ... the trains is due, but it is late ... How does Neo escape this trap, of being caught in a purgatorial existence, not really belonging to either the world of Zion or the one created by the machines? The scenes are phenomenal. Naturally, he makes it out, with the help of his friends ...<br />Zion plans for the inevitable invasion by the machines. The humans prepare a few surprises of their own ... indescribable combat scenes, indescribable special effects. I sat with clenched teeth and tense muscles, as swarms of insect-like and squid-like machines zoomed and descended into Zion. The fighting scenes are some of the best I have ever viewed ... When the Oracle is consulted we learn the simple but hard truth, that she does not predict anything, she provides information and those who summon her help \\"make a choice\\" based on their \\"belief\\" in themselves. Neo and Trinity leave in a ship -- with a stow-away on board ... Neo \\"believes\\" in his abilities after a tragic occurrence. Neo does what must be done ... you have to see the film to know what that is and how the film ends. This film is *highly* recommended. Of the three films, this is my favorite. One must view all three to fully appreciate and understand why the Matrix series is so popular and appealing.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is one of the best bands in years. They put out an awesome debut album (&quot;Parachutes&quot;) and then topped it with this one. It solidified them as one of my favorite bands. This album is beautiful, musically, vocally, lyrically. And, echoing another reviewer, they are NOT Radiohead. They are brits, yes, but other then the sometimes similar vocals they are completely different. Coldplay is all about simple, clean, uplifting melodies and heartfelt lyrics. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is an amazing song, &quot;Rush of Blood...&quot; is one of the best... actually I really can't just pick a couple. They're all great. Passionate, beautiful... I can't wait to see what they got in the future.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Well, when I first heard There There on MTV, I was a little turned off by Radiohead, eventually, the music grew on me, it's beautiful great music, without a doubt one of the CDs of the year...although OK Computer I think is better.....
B000089RVX|3.0|I heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and thought it was pretty cool... the female vocals interested me. So I got the album (at a Christian store... before their whole 'denying they were a Christian band' thing) and I liked it. Some of the songs do sound similar and some of them are kinda boring, but there are a couple standout tracks where they go in different directions (&quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, and a few others). Overall the disc is pretty depressing and I couldn't listen to it for long periods of time. While the vocals sound pretty good on the CD, I've seen them live on MTV2 and she is not as good live. While the CD is good, it's too much of the same stuff (heavy riffs, haunting 'gothy' vocals) over and over.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I think that Shania has put effort into this DVD and on stage for herself after the long lay off but I think she did this more for the fans. She came out booming and moving around so all could see her. She jumps down and runs along trying to touch hands with everyone she could. For a professional I think she has a lot of love for her fans and wants to do her very best for them and this DVD shows this to the max. She does her best singing and she interacts with the fans so well it is amazing. For her and the fans. You gotta have to see it every night.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I am not a frequent reviewer, but when I come across something that deserves awesome praise, I review it. Alicia's The Diary of... is one of those things. The album is such an amazing ear-candy and is worth every listening. I was not as excited about Alicia when Songs in A Minor came out, but after listening to her first single of this CD, &quot;You Don't Know My Name,&quot; I was thrilled! After I listened to the CD the first time around, I was awed - all of the songs are amazing and I found that these songs are superior to the singles of the previous CD. This is the first CD I have ever listened to in which I didn't dislike any song.<br />Some highlights of the CD are Harlem's Nocturne (an eclectic intro-like song that combines hip-hop and piano-playing that seems to be a lead-up to the next song), Karma (an addictive, different kind of song), You Don't Know My Name (obviously - an amazing first single of the album that represents what R&amp;B is really about and you can almost feel Alicia's desire for the man she sings about), If I Ain't Got You (almost similar but slower sound to You Don't Know My Name), and When You Really Love Someone (a song that could be a follow-up to Fallin' and A Woman's Worth). Truly, all of the songs on the album are amazing; her voice, the music, the lyrics, everything works very nicely together. Devoted and new fans will love The Diary of Alicia Keys! Go and get it!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|What a horrible album! The songs are abysmal, devoid of harmony and trite. The Beatles took music to new lows, ushering in a new wave of crap. Thank God they were only around for 6 years! For real music listen to Fleetwood Mac, Michael Jackson and the Bee Gees. I prefer real music to NA NA NA and YEAH YEAH YEAH.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|-  Obviously, LIBN is not what they originally intended, but maybe it's what they *ought* to have intended, if only they'd been willing to put some work into it.  Certainly to these ears it seems a better album than the original, largely for how it improves Lennon's musical presence, though for other reasons as well.    Lennon's writing contributions have always been the great weakness on this album--really, the writing is the worst of his entire recording career.  But adding Don't Let Me Down in lieu of Maggie Mae and Dig It helps the record considerably, the cleaned up and stripped Across the Universe is an improvement, and his bass playing on the title track no longer sounds like musical sabotage.  Now, if there was only some way to replace I Dig a Pony with The Ballad of John and Yoko...    Harrison's compositions are fine, if a little minimal; one longs for one of his gems from All Things Must Pass.  Starr does what he does.  McCartney, in 1969, was working at the zenith of his powers and his contributions are the saving grace of the album.  That was true before, and it's true now.  There's little more to say on the matter, except to confirm that The Long and Winding Road is a better, less maudlin song when presented more nakedly, as it is here.  Sorry, Phil.    Other than that, I should mention that the song order makes better sense on LIBN and the sonics are the best of any Beatle release yet.    Few would claim this as the best Beatles album, but I think now that they're \\"naked,\\" these recordings are no longer embarrassing, and for that we should be grateful.  -
B0000A36J5|5.0|I watch DVDs on my computer system, and I can't watch discs 3 and 4 because the content on those discs can only be viewed with the InterActual player!  Problem is, this player always makes both of my systems crash (one has 1/2 gig of memory, the other has a full gig). I was able to watch discs 1 and 2 (HOORAY!) using another player with no problems.  Anyone else have this trouble?  I'm returning my copy in the hopes that the new one won't have this problem.  New Line, why do you insist on providing the InterActual player?  It's a really poor excuse for a product!<br />What I WAS able to watch was stunning, hence the 5 stars.  I couldn't get over the high quality -- this was recorded at a higher bit rate than the theatrical release -- and it shows! The movie itself is an awesome achievement and all of the performances are riveting. I've noticed that other movies are now touting the authenticity and detail of their costumes, sets, etc.  Well, PJ and crew did it first and have done it to perfection. Bring on The Hobbit!
0151008116|4.0|The life of Pi was what his name represents in math.  That is, a significate character in determining a complete circle or 360 degrees. What a wonderful read it was.  I listen to this story on cassett tapes.  I believe that the reader, who spoke in the Hindu religion accent made this book all the more refreshing.  Ergo, that sense of hearing the story read with the right tone completes the circle of enjoyment.<br />Now for the story.  Poor Pi suffered early childhood taunts from the neighborhood &quot;hoods&quot; because of his name which was not a typical Indian name.  I believe he sorted and found relief in establishing his nickname as Pi not because of the meaning I attributed to his name but because it was shorthand for Pistingh.<br />In deed, this could easily have been a true story for I enjoyed it as if it were true.  Pi's struggle with religion, surviving the sea, the animals, the Japanese Men and his limited exposure to life contributed heavily to the enjoyment of this book.<br />He did what I would have done had I found myself in a similar situation.  There were some parts of this book which did exceed my imagination, however.  But, I won't spoil it for you by telling everything that is in this wonderful epic.  Read it for youself.  But, be prepared to laugh, shout for joy, whistle for happiness, hum a song, praise, encourage, commiserate and disbelieve as Pi unravels his quest for religion, faith and survival.---LET THOSE TV STATIONS TAKE NOTE OF WHAT A REAL SURVIVAL STORY LOOKS LIKE.---Beverly C. Sanders
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a beautiful and intriguing story about an Indian boy, son of a zookeeper, who finds himself lost at see after a ship he is on, with many of the zoo's animals, sinks in the middle of the open and deserted ocean. He comes to realize that the life raft, on which he clings to life, is occupied not only by himself, but by a crazed hyena, a confused orangutan, an injured zebra and a dangerous Royal Bengal Tiger. Needless to say, he is petrified, and of course starving and thirsty for fresh water. Pi's story of survival and courage begins here through the author's (Yann Martel) great skill in making a fantastical novel seem incredibly real. By the end of the novel, where we are reminded of the fictitious nature of the story, it seems hard to believe that any other version of the story's events had taken place. <br />I loved this book. It held my interest all the way through to the end. The characters are very seemingly real, and it was hard not to sympathize and want to reach out to save poor Pi as you read his story. Pi's interest and zeal for religion, all three, is intriguing and mystically thought provoking. As he bobs on the open ocean, no help in sight, it seems that Pi's devotion to higher powers is not aiding him in any form of rescue. It can appear to the reader that perhaps, due to unanswered prayers, Pi creates an alternate reality or story to help him accept the fact that he, being a former vegetarian, must now kill and eat fish and other sea creatures to survive. In Pi's fantastical story, he must not only catch and kill the sea's inhabitants to feed himself, but also the dangerous tiger who inhabits the lifeboat along with him. For if the tiger was to get too hungry, Pi would likely be next on the tiger's dinner menu, no doubt. The story is just filled with wonderful symbolism, which infiltrates the young man's story of his amazing journey across the ocean. <br />Simply, I really enjoyed the book from beginning to end and liked the fact that itwas a book that required attention and thoughtfulness. Yann Martel gives us a hint to the story when he wrote in the preceding &quot;author's note&quot;, &quot;If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams.&quot; Please read this book. Other titles I recommend: The Lovely Bones by Sebold, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B00008H2LB|5.0|i really enjoy LP's new album, meteora. It just proves once again this band in itself is it's own genre. I very strongly recommend it. It's a little repetitive at times, but not so much that it turns you off of the entire album. <br />Chester's vocals are awesome. He can definatly hold his own. We hear Mike alot more on this album than HT. The lyrics, well most of them are very real. It's not teen angst. It's pain. It's raw human emotions. For instance I completly related to the song Breaking The Habit: it's about self-injury. I've suffered with SI for three years now. It was written about a girl one of the guys in the band knew. I was so relieved and shocked to see that for once a song was about something very real. They aren't afraid to say things others will stay away from at all costs. <br />Listen for the different instruments. I STRONGLY recommend listening to this CD on headphones. It will blow you away at times and definatly get you going. They are musical genious's. If its not the lyrics, its the raw music at the very core of the songs. And no im not talking about the guitar rifts some of you say are simaliar to those in everyother rock song. Im talking about the combination of everything. It's mindblowing. <br />just one more thing:<br />Its funny i keep reading reviews about how much LP sucks, but hello the people who are dissing them dont listen to and have never liked LP in the first place. Im so sick of people constantly judging other peoples taste in music. It's music people. The one thing that saves so many of us from ourselves. Everyone has had that one band that matches with their own beat, their own thoughts. If you've listened to the album(not just heard a song in the car with a friend)and you think its bad then fine, of course review. Dont just say you hate them because they have become to &quot;mainstream&quot; for you. I get so pissed off reading things that ignorant people write, just so they can try to prove that they have &quot;real&quot; taste in music. The music that is &quot;real&quot; is music that is written from the heart by the musicians performing them, when will people get that? damn sorry so long. peace guys.
0393317552|3.0|The author did a good job of making points about where the effective changes came from that determined which societies conquered which and why different societies became as dominant as they did in the modern world. <br />However, I found it a bit irritating to listen to the paragraphs on end where the author attempted to convince us that native New Guineans are more intelligent and adaptable than Europeans. For the majority of the book he uses New Guineans in his examples, and he, strangely, refers to New Guinea as a mini-continent on a frequent basis, which is strange to me, since it is quite small, and, in both economic and political terms, unimportant on a world-wide basis. His infatuation with the culture and the island, I think, hurts the book. <br />In other places, he makes references to certain facts, I don't recall what they are off-hand, that are not true, most especially having to do with disease etiology and origins. Actually, I do remember one, where he cites influenza as having origins in swine, where it really comes from fowl, and it is amplified and altered by genetic recombination in swine. This also undermines his credibility, and these factors hurt the ability of the author to make persuasive arguments, making it difficult to accept them.<br />I would recommend reading it to people, but only with caution. Like everything else, think about it when you read it, but take more caution than normal, as the author is very intelligent and quite persuasive, but potentially fundamentally flawed.<BR>Harkius
0780622553|5.0|You pretty much know the story from all the other reviews here, so I'll skip the film intro. I was lucky enough to see this film in theaters; I was completely blown away by it. Unfortunately, since almost no one saw this film in theaters, Proyas' career tanked.<br />This is no hyperbole: this is the greatest film I have ever seen, on top of being my favourite. It is true that my opinion might be slanted since I like dark atmosphere, great production design, attention to detail, shifty characters, which many have noted; however, the film is much, much more than that. These elements are merely instruments used to deliver the film's message, which unfortunately too many have missed, even though the film spells it out. It is my conclusion that had these people understood -- or cared -- about the point of the film, their opinions would be radically different.<br />So what is the point? I am loathe to reveal key film points, so I'll just say this: it's about what makes us human, it's about what is the human soul, it's about purpose and meaning in life. This means that if you're not willing to think during this film, and just want to be entertained, this film might not be for you, although many superficial reviewers found the visuals and production sufficient for that purpose.<br />It might be seen as a difficult watch, while I found it profoundly engaging, finally a film that doesn't take its viewers for complete idiots (contrary to your average Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster). It is capable of awakening many fundamental questions about Humanity, without being arrogantly presumptuous in attempting to answer it all; it's up to you to decide what you believe in. For instance, are we born evil? Does evil exist? Are we more than the sum of our memories and experiences? Do we have a soul? What makes each individual unique? So many questions, so many possible answers, makes for each new viewing of this film unique in its own way, although I've now seen this film around 30 times.<br />Is the acting flat? The characters paper-thin? The plot almost non-existent? Yes and no. Yes on the surface, but a *resounding* No when taken into context with what the film is trying to say. The characters *seem* paper-thin, only because that's what artificial characters created in a laboratory are supposed to be like. The plot may seem non-existent, only because the plot is part of the delivery device for a much greater story for which you must think; the ending is not a battle of good versus evil, but a man's struggle to make life his own. This is important, because instead of making it the usual Good/Evil formula finale, the film makes it into the single most moving scene since the \\"Battle of the Anthems\\" in Casablanca. The sunrise at the end of Matrix Revolutions is clearly an hommage to that scene in Dark City.<br />Which brings me to my final point. This film prefers to tell its story with visuals, instead of being unnecessarily talky. Today's films are lazy in the sense that they use dialogue to move the story forward, and only use special effects to awe the entertained audience. Not so in Dark City. Everything is said visually, using dialogue to underline, or to accompany the visuals. Most striking is a scene where John is in jail, and gets visited by his \\"wife\\"; the screenwriters could have just used dialogue to repeat ten, fifteen times that they love eachother (à la Neo & Trinity), but instead makes it much more meaningful and convincing by their kiss across a pane of glass that shatters as they get closer.<br />Too many people compare Matrix with Dark City though. Yes, they are very similar in terms of the basic plot, and the dark, bleak atmosphere. But the comparisons end here. Dark City, for one, is not an action film. Also, Matrix always stayed rather superficial by comparison, which is not a bad thing, since it made for a more accessible film, but makes them incomparable. Dark City used all the elements described previously for the explicit purpose of exploring many unanswered fundamental questions on Humanity, while Matrix was essentially a thrilling ride, which on a side plate talked about the self-determination versus destiny dichotomy. Matrix was about fake reality, while Dark City merely used fake reality for a much greater purpose. Matrix is enjoyable as pop-corn entertainment (à la Commando, First Blood), while Dark City clearly is not.<br />In other words, a life-changing film, but only if you're open to interpretation. I'm glad Roger Ebert also got it, and contributes the single best commentary track on any DVD; incidentally, Ebert also rated it the top film of 1998.
B000002UB3|4.0|Released in 1969, Abbey Road was the final statement from a band that was collapsing from within. At this point the Beatles (especially John and Paul) were no longer friends, and the tension showed. The Fabs rehired their old producer George Martin and proceeded to release their swan song. At the time, the psychedelia of the mid-'60s was giving way to the blues-based hard rock of Led Zeppelin and later Rolling Stones and the proto-punk of bands like the Stooges and MC5. In this darker, edgier environment the Beatles' lighter and occasionally whimsical pop appeared to some passe, but their final album has aged very well.<br />It's clear that both Paul and John were releasing less consistent work than before, but it still stands fairly strong. Lennon's Come Together opens the album, with bizarre Dylanesque lyrics and the opening line of \\"Here come old flat top..\\" that was swiped from a Chuck Berry tune. While it's a fine song, it can't compare to Taxman, Back In The U.S.S.R, or the title track of Sgt. Pepper as a Side 1, Song 1. Maxwell's Silver Hammer is a hiliariously macabre Paul ditty that John despised. John's dedication to Yoko Ono, I Want You (She's So Heavy) is a decent song, but unfortunately drags on for far too long with its heavy, dreary arpeggios, and Because, though it features some nice vocal harmony, doesn't fare much better. However, McCartney's You Never Give Me Your Money, a sly shot at their record label, is a great way to start Side 2.<br />There are two things that redeem this album: Harrison's contributions and the excellent medley on Side 2. George definitely steals the show with the excellent ballad Something and the so-beautiful-it-hurts Here Comes The Sun, which will stand alongside Taxman, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and Savoy Truffle as the best material he's ever released. The Side 2 medley consists of incomplete songs, but the way they are integrated together is simply brilliant. I especially love the marching-style chant of Carry That Weight preceded by the wistful Golden Slumbers.<br />The End is the last song the Fabs ever recorded, and it's definitely a fine way to wrap things up. Of note is a Ringo drum solo (the only one he did with the Beatles) and the brilliant closing line \\"And in the end/The love you take..is equal to the love you make.\\" Sublime. The throwaway Her Majesty humourously undercuts this with Paul strumming his acoustic for 18 seconds.<br />While for me this album doesn't rank on the level of either Revolver or the White Album, it certainly deserves its classic status, and is way better than Let It Be (which consisted of Spector-ized previous sessions recorded earlier and released after Abbey Road). If nothing else, Abbey Road is worth it for that timeless cover art alone.That Weight preceded by the wistful Golden Slumbers. <br />The End is the last song the Fabs ever recorded, and it's definitely a fine way to wrap things up.

0385504209|3.0|The book is fairly good provided that you remember it is fiction and nothing more. Brown's claim of &quot;FACT&quot; printed on the introduction page appears to be a marketing ploy, and a highly successful one at that. Without that one statement none of the theological discussions or controversy surrounding the book would be taking place.<br />Countless others, much more qualified than I, have already pointed out the numerous historical errors in the book so there isn't really any need to rehash what has already been written, except to say if all the errors were removed what you would have remaining would resemble a pamphlet instead of a book.<br />The book is a fairly quick read that moves along at a nice pace, although the ending is somewhat of a letdown. Dialogue can be rather juvenile at times, but not to the point of making you want to throw the book down.<br />Brown has included all the elements of a good conspiracy, the Knights Templar, the Catholic Church, a few murders to quiet people, etc., so it's easy to see why the book has done so well.<br />While I disagree wholeheartedly with Brown's version of history, in no way did I let that interfere with reading the book. I'm in no hurry to rush out and buy Brown's other books, but wouldn't automatically return one if I received it as a present, either. There are far worse ways to spend your time than reading The Da Vinci Code, but there are better ways, as well.
B000002UAX|5.0|Yes my friends, this is the ultimate Fab Four experience. Why, you ask? It's uneven, it's scattershot, it's basically all four members working solo, and it has no unifying lyrical or musical theme.<br />And it's one of the most daring artistic statements made in the last 50 years by commercial musicians.<br />For this album, the Beatles went from being merely a top-notch pop group to mature artists. Everything about this album is a challenge to their listeners--the stark white cover, the bizarre eclecticism, the more straightforward production, the odd orchestral segues--it's all here. To realize how big of a departure the White Album actually is, listen to Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour beforehand. Not much of the spirit of those albums carried over to the White Album, and I think that has much to do with the splintering of the band's four members into separate identities. With this fracture came not only lyrical pisstakes (John and Paul write songs slyly, and humourously, mocking each other in this album) but genuine inspiration.<br />The album goes in a million directions at once. McCartney explores the worlds of pop (Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da), ragtime (Honey Pie), hard rock (Helter Skelter, Everybody's Got Something To Hide..), bluegrass (Rocky Raccoon), and folk (Blackbird, Mother Nature's Son). Lennon tackles the blues (Yer Blues), campfire sing-a-longs (The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill), avante-garde weirdness (Revolution 9), politics (Revolution 1), art rock (Happiness Is A Warm Gun), pans of Beatlemania (Glass Onion) and wrenchingly personal ballads (Julia, I'm So Tired). Harrison puts in an EP's worth with a beautifully sad ballad (While My Guitar Gently Weeps, featuring Eric Clapton), a scorching rocker (Savoy Truffle), a darkly satirical baroque piece using the harpischord (Piggies), and a melancholy acoustic song (Long, Long, Long). Even Ringo gets in on it with a song of his own (the jangly country of Don't Pass Me By). Wild.<br />This totally random approach is what makes the White Album so great. Personally, I don't like Revolution 9 or Wild Honey Pie (though the latter is good for an occassional chuckle) but that's not the point. It proved that the Beatles were ready and willing to experiment with anything and everything, record it, and release it to a public expecting another Sgt. Pepper (hence the occasional dissenting opinions of this release). It took some serious nerve and ambition. I wish more bands would release something like this.<br />Of course this isn't the ideal place to start with the Beatles--Revolver or Abbey Road are more user-friendly and should be your first choices. Nevertheless, if you have any musical taste at all this record is essential, essential, essential. The only question is whether you should buy more than one copy.y random approach is what makes the White Album so great.

B0000B3FCX|4.0|Yes there is nothing new here on the latest album from Nickleback.  If you liked their last album you will probably enjoy the majority of this disc. At this point in their careers there is no reason for them to change their formula however their next release should have something fresh on it before they start losing momentum. The Long Road isn't filled with meaningful moving lyrics so for those people ripping it because of that need to remember this is simply a rock album and these guys are having fun. The guitar isn't innovative or fresh and sounds alot like the last album but it is great to listen to loud. Remember music doesn't need to be complicated.From start to finish this album is not as strong as their previous realeases but have some really good tunes. Best songs are:  Do it anymore, Believe or not and Figured you out. There are no duds on the album but I personally cringe everytime I hear &quot;Saturday Night's alright.....&quot; If you like Nickelback then buy the album.If you don't like them don't buy it.I gave it 4 stars but 3.5 would be more appropriate.
B000002UAU|3.0|You know, I can't entirely fathom why this album continues to captivate the legions of Beatles fans to the degree that it has. Yes, it was somewhat innovative for the time with its orchestration and (at the time) second-to-none production, but those factors alone don't make it a classic, much less \\"influential.\\" And to those who have heralded this as the first \\"concept\\" album--no, it isn't. 1966's Freak Out! (Frank Zappa And The Mothers) probably deserves that honor, and The Who Sell Out was also released in 1967 which also had a unifying concept to it, and then there are a few Kinks records that were conceptual too. All Sgt. Pepper has is a brief reprise of the title track followed by A Day In The Life to end the album, which I guess suggests some loose thematic element, but not really. Overall, this is my least favorite \\"studio-era\\" Beatles record, and while it's better than the early pop records before Rubber Soul it can't stand in the same company as say, Revolver.<br /><br />There's nothing particularly objectionable about the music--most of the songs are pleasant ditties. But calling them \\"innovative\\" just because they've been slathered with all sorts of studio effects simply doesn't hold water. If you strip the gloss away, most of the songs are subpar. At heart, the Beatles were (let's be honest here) pop, but it worked thanks to strong songwriting and solid hooks, not excess gimmicry. Rubber Soul, Revolver, most of The White Album, and Abbey Road still hold up today for that same reason. Sgt. Pepper (and its companion Magical Mystery Tour) don't.<br /><br />Despite all that, there are still a few decent tracks on Sgt. Pepper. The title track is very good, with some great guitar from Harrison, and so is the reprise. The Ringo-sung With A Little Help From My Friends isn't bad. She's Leaving Home is a rather touching ballad, and Harrison's Within You Without You is an enjoyable and underrated raga-rocker. And then there's A Day In The Life--breathtaking. The rest alternates between saccarine and twee (When I'm 64, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds), or nonsensical and overproduced (Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite, Good Morning Good Morning).<br /><br />Both Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour represent the Beatles in an uneven spot; their highs were amazing (Strawberry Fields Forever, A Day In The Life, I Am The Walrus), but the lows were some of the worst in their career. If the best material from both LPs was pieced together into one album, then it may have been a classic despite the dated production. As it stands, Sgt. Pepper is really nothing special. If it's psychedelia you want, consider Hendrix's Are You Experienced?, Pink Floyd's Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, and The Doors' debut; all were released in the same year, boasted some genuine innovation, and have aged remarkably well compared to this bloated Beatles opus.between saccarine and twee (When I'm 64, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds), or nonsensical and overproduced (Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite, Good Morning Good Morning).

B0000DJZA0|4.0|I've seen a lot of bashing of this new live CD, and I guess you would have had to see them live to realize how awesome their live show is.  I also can't see how Rolling Stone can say Coldplay is &quot;too mellow&quot; because I saw them live at a small venue and they were anything but mellow.  Chris was packed with energy and they sounded amazing.  Also, you have to realize that their style of music doesn't really allow for extended jams and long, improvised solos.  Anyway, on to the DVD/CD set.  The CD is an excellent companion to the DVD, and it's great when you don't have access to a DVD player, but you still want to listen to Coldplay live.  My only complaint is that in some places, the audio quality is less than perfect, but it's not a hindrance to the music.  I also like how they included &quot;One I Love&quot;, &quot;Moses&quot;, and &quot;See You Soon&quot;, since they were previously unavailable, except on the CD singles.  As for the DVD, I'd have to say that it fully captures the essence of Coldplay live (especially in 5.1 DTS) and it brought back memories of seeing them live.  As for standout tracks, i'd have to say all of them, simply because they're all great.<br />I'm also sick of the Coldplay/Radiohead comparisons because, being a fan of both of them, i have found a huge difference.  Though both Thom and Chris sing in falsetto, Coldplay's music is much more emotional and heartfelt, while Radiohead's is much more biting and brooding (and that's not bad, mind you).<br />Anyway, if you like Coldplay, buy this.  If you don't, buy &quot;Parachutes&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood To The Head&quot;, decide whether you like them, then, if you do, buy this.
B000002UAR|5.0|Sgt. Pepper is the Beatles record that inevitably gets showered with the praise and accolades, but in my opinion the REAL groundbreaker came one year before (1966) with Revolver. A transition from the folk-rock/pop stylings of Rubber Soul, Revolver is their first foray into psychedelia, and their best. It's clear that the band's drug experimentation along with their growing maturity as musicians fueled a lot of Revolver's creative vision, and the album is all the better for it.<br />(...) There's quite a bit of cynicism and bleakness here, especially for a \\"pop\\" album. Revolver has the darkest overtones of any Beatles record. Just listen to the themes of the first few songs: Money-hungry politicians (Taxman), desolation and death (Eleanor Rigby), catatonia (I'm Only Sleeping), and the transience of life (Love You To). Even some of the lighter, happier-seeming songs have dark underlying messages. For example, Doctor Robert is a sneering Lennon song about their drug supplier, and Got To Get You Into My Life is said to be Paul's ode to acid. However, there are fun pop tunes like Yellow Submarine and Good Day Sunshine as well.<br />At any rate, this is a fantastic record. It would be a great record just for the one-two shot of the cynical, rocking Taxman (Harrison always was my favorite Beatle) and the haunting violin ballad of Eleanor Rigby, but there's more to be had. Try the sitar-drenched Love You To, the hushed beauty of Here, There, And Everywhere, the heartbreaking For No One, the yearning I Want To Tell You, the horns of Got To Get You Into My Life, and the otherwordly nightmare of tape loops and backwards guitar that is Tomorrow Never Knows. Every song could have been a single and a hit, without relying on any of the lame formulas, overproduction, or forced angst that seem to be in vogue today.<br />This is the best single LP the Fabs ever made, and the place to start if you don't have any Beatles records. Unlike Sgt. Pepper, which is a little creaky in spots, Revolver still holds up amazingly well today. Highly recommended.ts, Revolver still holds up amazingly well today. Highly recommended.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Lemme' see.<br />Do not expect an Images and Words. A Scenes from a Memory. This is more metal than progressive. You may like it or not.<br />I, personnally, like it. It's harder and more metal than SFAM (my favorite) but as I love metal too, I like it. Simple... I think this is why it has generated very different reviews.<br />PS Honor Thy Father rox. Don't cross the crooked step :D
B000000WG4|5.0|Hi all, my name is Martin and I'm only 14 years old.<BR>I really like Mike Oldfield's music.<BR>I searched his many albums and I found &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;<BR>It became my favourite one.<BR>My fovourite artist is Mike Oldfield.<BR>That's all!<BR>Thank you all-Martin
B000001ELF|5.0|Oh God.....this album takes me back. Think back in the 70's when you didnt know the faces of KISS. When music was an extension of the times. I tell you people, KISS was THE superband of the 70's and it was headed by Ace Frehley. I say this because Paul didnt play guitar much. Anyways, Anton Fig is an awesome drummer. The 1st song is Rip it Out and includes a sample of Antons ingenuity.<BR>Its simple yet complex, and fits the music perfecly. This album fits right in with KISS Destroyer, which is the best all time Rock-N-Roll Album of all time. If you like the Superband KISS of the 70's, you will LOVE this album....but you probably already have it.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I was a little doubtful about this album, I'll admit. I couldn't help but wonder how John and George would react, and if Ringo really had any say in it... but it's great. LIBN may not contain what are considered the best versions of the songs, but that wasn't the point of the album. This was to be the de-Spectorized version, offering another view of the songs.<br />I did miss some of the songs, but the addition of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; healed that. The version isn't my favorite, but at least I have another side to look at it from. &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is my favorite song ever, so it doesn't matter what version I listen too. &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;Two Of Us&quot; are clear as bells. In fact, all the songs are.<br />If you don't like anything of what you've heard of this album and are still in doubt, at the very least listen to &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; the king of LIBN. I heard Paul wrote the song as a reflection of his feelings at the time of the LIB sessions. I never believed that with Spector's version - too upbeat. With this one, I can actually hear the sorrow. A very touching song.<br />Overall, I am very happy. And who wouldn't be? These are Beatles songs.
B000089RVR|2.0|Didnt listen much to Dido but fell in love with 'White Flag' on the radio... She has some great lyrics, and alot of her songs have very catchy tunes. (1)White Flag, (6)Dont Leave Home, (7)Who Makes You Feel, (11) See the Sun. Anyway, hope you enjoy it... I sure do ;)
076790592X|5.0|As someone who does not find time to read often, I was unable to put this book down.  It drew tears from my eyes, and put smiles on my face.  The story does beautiful justice to the ordeal brought about by ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), both to the patient and his or her loved ones.  As a former caregiver of my mother who suffered the same fate as Morrie Schwartz, I recommend this short book to families that are enduring the same experience, and to everyone else out there whose eyes will open to some of the simpler things that make life so wonderful, that we all too often take for granted.
B00005JMFR|1.0|I was sooo pumped about going to this movie. I waited in line for 2 hours to get a good seat.  FOR WHAT!!!!! A crappy ending.  the first matrix got my pulse pounding and made me thirsty for more, only to be utterly dissapointed in the end.  Dont get me wrong i liked the action and the great special effects, but the story was horrible.  There was no closure to the film. The machines are still there so if they wanted they could enslave humanity again.  All of the population is still plugged into the matrix.  At the end i found myself saying WHAT THE HELL!!!!!!!  why bother making a trilogy if you dont end the story.  all that happened in the 3rd film is Neo dies Trinity dies and Smith dies, and the machines leave the humans alone.  See the movie for yourself but it is not worth the 9 dollars for a ticket.
B0000CD5I6|1.0|I think someone bungled in his jungle and mixed up the intended cover with the cover of &quot;The Jethro Tull Halloween Album&quot;--gabled haunted house, foreboding bare trees (rather than frosted evergreens) with ominously (and unrealistically) twisted branches. <br />But I'm here to review the music, not the cover....Oh, never mind. What's the point? You've heard these songs before. Now you get to hear them recut by a tired, uninspired, rundown band and a singer whose voice has expired. <br />Whatever. See you in Vegas then?
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater has been one of my favorite bands, ever since I first bought \\"Images and Words\\" a couple of years ago.  Every album they have released is a unique and rewarding experience.  So, naturally, I have been waiting eagerly for the release of their latest work,\\"Train of Thought\\".<br />Let's start with the basics.  The band promised us a heavy album, and that's exactly what we got.  Song for song, this is DT's heaviest to date, without a doubt.  With the exception of the short ballad \\"Vacant\\" and the more atmospheric instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\", this is an album thathits hard, and rarely lets you catch your breath.  Each song has its share of melody to balance things out, but most of the album is an all-out metal fury.<br />The leading single, and opening track, is \\"As I Am\\", and while many fans seem to have been disappointed with it, I think it is a definite highlight.  It's slightly more to-the-point than the rest of the album, but that's not a bad thing (I'll discuss that further in a bit), and the sheer groove of the main riff is just sick.  DT isn't generally known for being a groove-based band, but this song grooves like nobody's business.  Killer song, with a powerful solo, and John's defiant lyrics only further increase its impact (those who claim that DT \\"sold out\\" obviously didn't pay much attention to the lyric sheet).<br />From here, things get a bit dodgy.  While this is a killer metal album, with some excellent and powerful riffs, I can't help but feel that a lot of the songs are just too excessive, and way longer than they really need to be.  For example, \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is an excellent power ballad, and starts out very strong, but toward the end, it trails off into no man's land, and ends up being a good 2 or 3 minutes longer than it really needs to be.  \\"This Dying Soul\\" is an intense continuation of the \\"Mirror\\"/\\"Glass Prison\\" saga, and parts of it are just amazing (especially James spitting out those rapid-fire verses along with the machine-gun riffs), but the long<br />periods of mostly pointless instrumentation make it a bit of a chore to listen to (a shame, considering it could have been a killer song).  Most of the time, it's not that big of a deal, but there is at least a little bit of practically every song that doesn't need to be there. They wanted to make a \\"classic metal\\" album, but it sounds like they just threw some extra stuff in to make sure everyone knows they're still prog.  DT have been accused of \\"wanking\\" since day one, and I've never had a problem with it...until now.  This is the only album on which I feel they really went way overboard.  Usually, there is something going on in the &quot;wank parts&quot; that keep it interesting, but here, they more often than not detract from the song, rather than adding to it as usual.<br />But anyway, back to the good points.  Besides \\"As I Am\\", two songs in particular really stand out.  The first is \\"Honor Thy Father\\", a vitriolic rebuttal to the \\"my life is bad because my parents don't care about me\\" mindset, with some interesting dynamics, and not as high of a \\"wank factor\\".  And yes, hold onto your seats prog snobs, but Labrie actually RAPS in this song.  Yes, you heard me.  This song actually has a few rapped vocal lines in it, and you know what?  They're really good!  Labrie apparently has a hidden talent, as he belts out those \\"rhymes\\" with precision and flow that would make Public Enemy proud (well, maybe).  Not bad for a white guy from Canada.  And for those of you who are vehemently opposed to rapping of any kind, it's only a few seconds of a 10-minute song, so don't worry.<br />The second standout is the closer, \\"In the Name of God\\".  The<br />longest song on the album, it is a sweeping epic melodic rocker, with a strong political statement.  While there is a good deal of \\"wanking\\" here, it is mostly done pretty well, and doesn't serve as a distraction for the most part.  Plus, this song features some of the album's finest melodies.  Could be destined to become a DT classic.<br />The instrumental track, \\"Stream of Consciousness\\", is worth a<br />mention as well.  Very nice melodies, and a lot of diversity.  At over 11 minutes, it goes by quite fast.  It's no \\"Ytse Jam\\"<br />or \\"Erotomania\\", but still an excellent song.<br />So, anyway, to wrap it all up, I am overall quite pleased with this album.  It is pretty much the worst thing they've ever done, but it's still really good.  I do think they should have \\"trimmed the fat\\" a bit, to make the album a bit more cohesive, but that's a small complaint.<br />And on a side note, for those who are worried about the accusations of this being a \\"numetal\\" album, I can assure you that they are false.  While there are a few \\"numetal\\" elements in the music, to refer to this as a straight-out numetal album could not be further from accurate.  And as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't hurt the album at all.  I'm certainly not the biggest fan of numetal, but such elements can be used to make music that's actually good, and DT does just that here.  And besides, a lot of bands, such as Candiria, Pain of Salvation, Dead Soul Tribe, and many others have combined<br />prog and numetal elements before, so this is certainly not a new thing.<br />At any rate, I for one enjoyed this album. But for those of you who didn't, never fear, because the band have made it quite clear that this is not going to be their signature sound.  This was interesting for what it is, but whatever they do next will almost certainly blow it away.st melodies.

B00009MEJU|1.0|&gt;The movie has an eerie but not scary tone to it. The story can also be described as erotic in timbre, although there is no nudity.<br />Look, if you're going to review movies without actually watching them first, at LEAST read some of the other reviews. This HAS nudity. What do you think we've been going on about?<br />(And let's stop pretending all those who give this an unfavorable review do so because they were disappointed not to find &quot;Terminator 800&quot;. In fact, we are disappointed to find that Soderburgh has dumbed down Stanislaw Lem's novel and turned it into a religious tract.)
B000089CJI|5.0|I admit, that like many others, my approach to this album was one of complete skepticism.  After 20 listens and the urge for at least 20 more, it's grown on me in the most peculiar way.    It manages to dust off all the cliches of pop music songwriting from the past decade -- relationships are featured almost exclusively -- and puts a unique spin to the subject matter.  Fans of Dntel or Death Cab For Cutie will find elements of those groups here, but may be put off by the exceedingly radio-friendly nature of the compositions.  In fact, the super-shiny production and hook-heavy progression lends well to an optimistic tone that isn't found often in today's music.  Lo-Fi digital synth tones and distorted drum machines abound.    Those not familiar with the other projects the core members are a part of might not know what to expect from this record, either.  It starts off with a slow building, almost narrative track featuring beautifully placed vocals that might elicit tears from the more delicate listener.  Around the center of the album the tracks have some sort of dance element to them -- usually in the form of a 4/4 kick drum.  Thankfully this isn't the centerpiece even at it's most hectic, and fades to more melancholy territory 2/3's of the way through, right before reaching a breakbeat infused climax on the last track \\"National Anthem\\".    In all, those willing to lift their chins and revel in some honest and emotional songwriting will find an album worthy of sitting on their top shelf.  You get the complete package: joy, sadness, conquest, love, and understanding all within 45 over-too-soon minutes.  All this from a reviewer that rarely finds anything worthwhile in this area of the musical map.
B00006LSM3|5.0|These is easily George Harrison's second best (at least) post-Beatles record. Its only George Harrison rival is &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. It's also as good as or better than all of John Lennon's post-Beatles records except (of course) &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;. It IS better than EVERY Paul McCartney non-Beatle record, with no exceptions (although slightly less than one half of &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; is very good also). So: if you're a George Harrison or Beatle fan, what's holding you back? Get this.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This album comes straight from the soul...the chord progressions on each song are so unique..bring us back to the days of Roberta Flack, and Stevie Wonder. This is an excellent album to heal your mind aswell songs ranging from every aspect of life you can think of. From the funk beats provided by non other than Timbaland(who else) to the slow sultry jams the light the fire for anyone. If you like Songs in A Minor, you will definetely love this compilation, although is very different, very awesome. Tracks 2,4,5,6,9,15 quickly become so addicting you crave them.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I am a huge Terminator fan, and when i saw T3 in theaters, i was blown away.  It surpassed all my expectations.  The audio and picture quality on this DVD is jaw dropping.  The extras are pretty good for a standard release.<br />I actually prefer this one to T2, and it is tied with T1 as the best T-film.  The acting was excellent, the story was great, <BR>the action/special effects were amazing, and the ending was nothing short of fabulous. Bring on T4 and the T3 Ultimate Edition DVD!!
B00004THAY|5.0|This CD is just fantastic. If you are into BB or Clapton's old blues stuff its a must have. They will rock you right down to your soul. Fantastically done....King and Clapton seem to be into every track. \\"Key to the Highway\\", redone by Derek and the Dominoes as well as Clapton himself, pave the way for great chemistry heard here on this albumn. If youre a blues fan, dont miss this. Probably my favorite CD and i cant turn it off once i put it on.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Were there a way to give a movie a six, that would be this movie. It is truly the best film that I have seen in many, many years, and was a brilliant telling of a very classic story. The blend of musical numbers with acted scenes was pulled off remarkably in this movie, and the film version allowed for plays that would not have been accomplished on the stage. <br />The vocal talents of actor Richard Gere and those of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are unbelievable. Who knew? But it is Queen Latifah who really took the stage away in her brilliant portrayal of Matron 'Mama' Morton. We knew she had a brilliant voice, and we knew that she could act. We knew that she was gorgeous, but how she pulled this movie off is truly, truly outstanding. She brings it all together and it is her talent that glues the entire film together and makes it what it is. She is stunning and unbelievable in this role, and is to be commended for the great work which she did. Her fans will be thrilled with this movie, as will fans of the musical genre as a whole.<br />This one is a 'must see!'
B00005JLEJ|5.0|I actually prefer Kagemusha to Ran. My Japanese language University teacher used to gripe that Kurosawa represented a \\"western\\" style of cinema, as opposed to Ozu, for instance. Ran is basically King Lear set in medieval Japan, whereas Kagemusha is more original in many ways, and less anachronistic. The themes of the Kagemusha's futile fight aganst destiny and his doppelganger-like identification with Shingen are also magnificently played. Finally, the very Japanese emphasis on passive control (Shingen's strategy is always to act as an umovable mountain on which to shatter his enemies) resonates in interesting ways.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore in my opinion has now topped anyone with talent in composition, even Mozart!!Return of The King is the most amazing, and best. But Fellowship, Towers, Return of King All work together and create such a chill with their emotion that one can not help but to feel what the music is portraying. It is by far the greatest score I have heard in my life, and I honestly have doubts that anyother piece will be better. The themes become more emotional, and varied from their changes in the movie. When you combine the greatest music, movie, special effects, and actors of all time, you get the greatest Piece of art imaginable, and before seemingly impossible, Lord of the Rings has done just that!!!
B000001GXI|4.0|i'll get the obvious out of the way first: wunderlich is wunderful as tamino. crass is also excellent as sorastro, and fisher-deskau makes a capable papageno. now for the women: technically, they sound awful. roberta peters is frequently out of pitch, and evelyn lear is occasionally shrill when she reaches for the higher registers. but unlike others here, i think this not neccessarily a bad thing. you just have to imagine that we have a different kind of pamina here. just picture roseanne playing the role. then think of what her mom would look (and sound) like. voila! you've got lear and peters. i'm not kidding. when i make this little mental gestalt, this becomes a very credible zauberflote. admittedly, i still cringe. but story-wise, it works! just try it.<br />bohm recorded at least two other flutes. the one with leopold simoneau as tamino is highly recommended. simoneau had a beautiful, creamy tone, and like pavarotti could hit his high notes seemingly effortlessly. i like his tamino even better than wunderlich's. wilma lipp is a queen of the night second only to lucia popp on the klemperer set. and kurt bohme as sorastro is just as good as crass on this set. hilde gueden, singing a spicy pamina, rounds out the main cast. all around, it is one of the best versions of die zauberflote.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is great for any Britney fan and great for anyone who is just beginning to like her.  She is re-creating herself into a sexual person instead of her shy innocent persona.  Songs like \\"Me Against The Music,\\" \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\" remind me of the previous Britney sound.  Whereas \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" awaken the listener to a whole new Britney.  All in all this is a excellent album from Ms. Spears and is a must have,
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Easily the best DVD collection I've ever owned. The special edition of Alien 3 was worth the price of admission. The documentaries offer some incredible insight into the movie making process in general and the Alien universe in particular.<br />I was fascinated by Michael Biehn's (Hicks - Aliens) vehemence about being left out of Alien 3, David Giler's disdain for Alien: Ressurection, and Fincher's notable absence. <br />This is truly a wonderful collection. If you're a fan, it is must have.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Personaly I thought I was setting myself up by purchasing this set. I thought the first and second were excelent but I never thought much of Alien 3 and Resurection, they were not the best of movies. After watching the special editions of the first two, the added scenes added ALOT to the movies, good things. Alien 3 with the added scenes was actually ALOT better then the theatrical release, still flawed, but not nearly as much as the theatrical version, its actually enjoyable to watch. Alien Resurection, thats still the same old movie with 8 minutes more. Good movie for alien fans, but for people who wanna see a movie, you might be upset. The extras combined have never been matched, even in the Lord of the Rings box set ( probobly because there is an extras disc for each movie and an extra disc overall) there is nothing missingTeres anything else you could possibly want in aliens
B00005RHGK|4.0|UPDATED Monday June 20, 2016 for grammatical and structural errors, original review from 2003:<br /><br />. Time has shown that this is one of the best and most creative horror films of the early 2000's (it is now 2016), even in it's many imperfections.  It's gruesome, fairly frightening, and it has some actual character development, a novel idea for a horror film. I was disturbed and scared after having seeing this film, and even after 13yrs, the ending is still seared in to my brain, I will most likely never forget it. I still cannot think of the song &#34;Jeepers Creepers&#34; the same way, and that is a testament to the staying power of this film, despite it's flaws.<br /><br />  A brother and sister are driving home on a country road and are being chased by a maniac in a beaten up truck, once the chase stops, they decide to follow the truck and see witness the &#34;person&#34; from the truck bodies dumping bodies  into a drain pipe. Of course they go, and check it out or there would be no movie, and this begins a tense cat and mouse chase.<br /><br />  The acting was somewhat silly, but appropriate and the chemistry between the brother and sister was realistic and convincing, I felt sympathy for them, I didn't want them to die which is very rare for any horror film, they had great chemistry. Would I watch it again? I think so, the final image in the film really haunted me.<br /><br />  I'm a horror movie maniac (I was back in 2003, not anymore), and for a horror movie, considering that most horror movies are lazy rehashes of old tropes, this was above the normal standard. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars, primarily because of the characters stupidity and lack of real motivation for investigating the drainage pipe. :p<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy
B0000AQZYM|5.0|Finding Nemo is wonderful,I watched it with my family and all of us from the 39 year old to the 2 year old loved it.<BR>It drives a good point(don't squash your childs exploration instincts,you may provoke them to act out when things actually are dangerous)as did nemo.<BR>A great family film.<BR>Ellen Degeneres was awesome!
B00005JMFO|4.0|The theme of the movie was excellent--that Love is all around us.  That part was very inspiring.  But the sexual content and scenes ruined it for the family and general public to see.  The sex scenes spoiled the theme.  The soft porn was not an example of the love that was characterized in the rest of the movie. <BR>I was sorry I couldn't recommend it to my teenage grandchildren.  Too bad to ruin such a good movie with degrading material.
B00005V9QJ|1.0|What a shocking recording. Having seen Sade in concert once, and watched a couple of video recordings I know her bands (in the past) can really play. But this is a few years on now, and its really stale. Live recordings need to be recorded really well to make them worthwhile and this is flat as a pancake. The audience sound levels are so annoying - it wrecks the CD for me. If you wanna try a live album worth the purchase, try Eryka Badu ... now we are talking. <br />Sade records next to nothing. When she does release something expectations are high. This is pure lazyness, and cashing in on the past.<br />Bin it.

B0000VCZK2|3.0|i love the movies, but the packaging is some of the worst i have ever come across. the plastic trays that hold to the cardboard foldout have already started to pop off completely. there is a serious issue with the quality in the packaging. why did they do so poorly on this. i'm very disappointed. i wish i would have waited to purchase the discs separately. i am now stuck with a box set that is a real pain in the ass to fold out (it's five feet long folded out, and is one of the msot awkward box sets to get into.) and after 2 days of having the box, the trays are already popping off completely. i've had to superglue them back on myself. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. don't bother with this box set.

B000002GGU|5.0|RECKLESS, is probably Bryan Adams best cd.  It's a toss up between this cd, and his WAKING UP... cd.  This cd starts off rocking with the song ONE NIGHT LOVE AFFAIR, and stays rocking, even on the slow ones, all the way to the end. Many top 40 hits on this cd, ONE NIGH.., RUN TO YOU, HEAVEN , SOMEBODY, KIDS WANNA ROCK, IT'S ONLY LOVE, and the awesome SUMMER OF 69.   there is only one weak song, as that is the closing song, AIN'T GONNA CRY.  Excellent production on this cd, excellent writing and playing too, you can't help cranking this cd up, when you put it on.
B000002BBY|5.0|Have you ever felt a song growing on you? Not hitting you in the face, and making you go \\"whoa!\\", but makes you feel like you can never get enough. A song which keeps making you want more and fills your senses. I can truly say that every song in this album is like that. I may sound a bit grandiose, but every song in this album is a masterpiece in its own right. This album proves to their critics that Oasis is not a one hit wonder, they are a bunch of guys with real talent, who just keep getting better and better, with every album.<BR> What's the story? Morning Glory, this successor to their first album, Definitely Maybe, is more mature and has a lot of variety in it than just pure brit-punk. They experiment with their sounds a little more in this album, especially \\"champagne supernova\\", which is a seven minute long epic song( which also happens to be my favorite song).  Noel Gallagher wrote all the songs on this album, which just showcases his immense song writing talents.<BR> The first song \\"hello\\" is kind of funky, with a catchy tune and it is pure rock and roll. Next comes \\" roll with it\\" which is not my favorite song, but it is good nevertheless. The next song is \\"wonderwall\\" which was a huge smash hit and I'm not surprised. \\"wonderwall\\" is truly a beautiful song with its heavy background orchestra, and its melodious base. <BR> The next song is \\"don't look back in anger\\" which was another huge smash hit. Noel has not only proven himself as a songwriter, he has also proven himself as a formidable vocalist in this song, with him giving the lead vocals for the song. My second best favorite song in this album was \\"she's electric\\", a truly catchy song which you can hum all day, and with a tune which will never quite leave your head. My most favorite song in this album was \\"champagne supernova\\" a seven minute epic song with a mellifluous opening, flowing into a wave of electric guitars and back again. The length of the song feels like it was less than three minutes, and that is the greatness of this song.<BR> All in all, this album is one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time, making Oasis as one of the best British rock and roll bands found today. Buy this album, even if you are not a fan of Oasis, this album is a MUST for any music collection. BUY IT.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|This version is worth buying because of \\"Don't Hang Up\\" alone. This is the best Britney song I have ever heard. It has a crisp techno background, and is full of whispery, melodic vocals.
B00003CXTG|3.0|To begin with, I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars instead if the rating were available. Apparently the same one or two people have written most of the last couple of dozen reviews, and they REALLY didn't like it. Its good points-the special effects are GREAT, it has a good cast, and it concerns an important event in our history which deserves to be remembered, especially appropriate now that the U.S. is at war again after suffering another sneak attack. The attack itself is well done, and the CGI is fitted in well within those scenes. The film examines some points not delved into much in other films about the attack. For instance, most of the 2,000 Americans who perished in the battle drowned below decks of their stricken and sinking ships, never having seen their attackers. Their struggle is shown in a compelling and moving fashion.<br />Its bad points-it's WAY too long, it's too sappy and sentimental, there are too many unlikely coincidences in the story, and it doesn't try hard enough to provide all the pertinent facts about the attack. Showing Dolittle's retaliatory raid on Japan at the end was a good idea, but it made it a bit long. If they had cut out at least half of the sappy love triangle, it would have helped move the story along and reduced the length to a more tolerable level. <br />The two main characters are loosely (VERY loosely) based on two American pilots who managed to get airborne during the attack and account for 6 Japanese planes between them. Apparently just shooting them down wasn't dramatic enough in itself, so the movie has the two Americans nearly flying into each other to get two Zeros following in pursuit to crash into each other. That is perhaps the most ridiculous moment, but there are a few others. Nevertheless, I found the movie overall to be enjoyable enough to watch. However, if you really want to watch a well-done film about the attack that is historically accurate, without the burden of a plodding love triangle, buy Tora! Tora!Tora! and just rent this one, or catch it on the tube.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Being my all time fav band, this has to be the best tull since Crest!!!!!   This is not a traditional xmas album in the sense of pop standards but a very unique beautiful Holiday cd!!!!<br />I will not get into each tune but some rmakes are included from the past including Bouree, A Christmas Song, Weatherock, Another Christmas Song, Ring out Soltice Bells, Bouree and Fires at Midnight!!!!!  some are not traditional xmas songs but fit the spirit of the Holiday season.  Season favs include God Rest, We 5 Kings, and a twist on Holly Herald.  New great tunes withg a christmas edge are Jack Frost, Pavane, First Snow and A Winter Sounscape!!!!  The sound of this JTull cd is similar of Songs from the Woods and Heavy Horses and is more on the acoustic side then the electric side but Martin plays just wonderful!!!!!   If you are a Tull fan, u need this being the best one in a while.  The best thing is that this album can be played at any time, not just around the holidays!!!!  There are several cool instrumentals but most with vocals, Bouree, Solstice, Christmans Song and Another Christmas Song are great new remixes and new great tunes include Jack Frost and First Snow.  This is a definate Tull album and JTull is back in bloom again.  This is a great christmas album in the sense where u do not get all the rehashed xmas songs on every artist's christmas album!!!!   This is just beautiful and essential.  Then get Ian's Rupi's Dance which is in the same vein and a more acoustic based album.  Without any doubts, the best christmas album of the year, so Celebrate and celebrate often with this holiday extravaganza!!!!!       If you have any Tull albums, you need this on, NOW
B00000IPAX|5.0|this is a great one from on of the bands that has paved the way for plenty of new bands and people...
B00000IMCW|5.0|I seem unable to leave this one alone; this will be my third review for &quot;Dawn of the Dead.&quot; As people who have read my reviews probably know, I used to despise this film. I rented it on the strength of a Roger Ebert review that pointed it out to be one of the most apocalyptic yet satirically relevant horror films ever made. I expected something more along the lines of Paul Anderson's &quot;Resident Evil,&quot; I think. Pure action horror from beginning to end. What I got was something I initially didn't understand as a sophomore in high school. The horror was remarkably subdued, and not really as a result of the zombies themselves, but more from what they symbolize. Of course, I didn't know that at the time.<br />This was best summed up 11 years after completion of &quot;Dawn,&quot; when George Romero, director of this film, rewrote his original masterpiece, &quot;Night of the Living Dead.&quot; Under the direction of makeup effects artist Tom Savini, Romero added a nice little line of dialogue that reverts back to all his previous work: &quot;They're us. We're them, and they're us.&quot; Thus lies the truly psychological horror of &quot;Dawn of the Dead.&quot; This film is not terrifying, but what it implies is. Who are the real monsters? The zombies? Grey people ambling about in search of food? They are acting on instinct, all traces of civility erased. In essence, they are blameless. Toward the end of &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; we get a glimpse of a band of surviving bikers who loot the shopping mall in a sloppy heist. These people still have minds of their own and act on much more than instinct. As they make sport of killing the zombies in a variety of wholesale ways, all the while stopping to indulge their curiosity with the blood pressure monitor at Penney's, the (other) bloodthirsty humans turn on each other. And for what? To save money on jewelry? I doubt the cashier cares. He's the one behind the bushes in the food court with his throat torn open. No, not him, the other guy with the funny hat. There you go.<br />Now, I suppose here is where I had my initial trouble with the film back in 1998 when I first watched it. As all this chaos ensues on screen (humans versus human, human versus former human), there's a jubilation to the tone. Only when a swarm of zombies encroaches on a biker or an elevator door unleashes a half dozen of the ghouls does the music stop and the tone become one of complete terror. I didn't know what to make of this conflict of emotions then. Five years later, older and wiser, I understand it now. I see the satire in every bit of film and not just the two seconds of frame that show a zombie clobbering down the up escalator. This entire film was meant to be fun. The idea behind George Romero's &quot;Living Dead&quot; series is that human beings are screwy. Throughout his trilogy, we were given all three tones of this: Paranoia (&quot;Night&quot;), dark comedy (&quot;Dawn&quot;), and psychological thriller (&quot;Day&quot;). &quot;Dawn&quot; remains the fan favorite to this day. The other &quot;recluses&quot;, as Romero calls us, prefer &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (don't be fooled; it's his favorite of the three).<br />Anyway, I wrote yet another review for &quot;Dawn&quot; for the reason of personal rebuttal. I claimed in my last review that, although I was beginning to like &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; I doubted I would ever include it on a list of my favorite films. Well, I was wrong. &quot;Dawn&quot; is one of my favorite films, and although it does not succeed on the horrific nor technological level that &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; does, it is still a masterpiece in a class of its own, and for the sake of James Gunn (writer of the Zach Snyder-directed remake coming in March 2004... and, oh yeah, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;) I hope he keeps in mind that you can't recapture greatness, you can only try and re-envision it.<br />This goes for you, too, Michael Bay, and your stupid idea of remaking John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween.&quot; Do me a personal favor: Pull your lip over your head and swallow. Regurgitate. Repeat. Thanks.making John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween.&quot; Do me a personal favor: Pull your lip over your head and swallow. Regurgitate. Repeat. Thanks.
B00004T0US|4.0|this album has a little of everything for fans and collectors, drug abuse, bad eating habits and his cronies the memphis mafia..all contributed to his  unhealthy life and demise.
B000089RVX|5.0|Not surprisingly, metal-heads bash this album for being friendly and pleasing to the ear. For some reason, it's a turn-off that Amy Lee can actually sing unlike most hard rock singers. She not only can sing, but she has one of the best voices in music today. Well, sorry, but I buy music according to what is pleasing to my ear. <br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is a solid collection of songs that not only rock, but carry strong vocals void of screaming and nonsence. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; was the monster single that brought them to the mainstream and it's still a great track no matter how many times its been overplayed. I didn't care for &quot;Going Under&quot; at first but it quickly grew on me. &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Haunted&quot; are great too. &quot;My Tourniquet&quot; reveals the band's spiritual side and is a definite highlight. &quot;My Last Breath&quot; is awesome and with the exception of BMTL is my favorite rock track. &quot;Fallen&quot; also includes two stunning piano ballads *I'm a sucker for a good piano ballad.* &quot;Hello&quot; is very pleasant, but the star is &quot;My Immortal.&quot; &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a stunning piece of work. I've heard a lot of people criticize it for its bland lyrics, but Amy Lee sounds amazing and the melody is breathtaking. I really hope this song takes off at radio...it's sorely needed. Over-all awesome rock album.<br />I'm not one of those people who over-anazlyze music and complain about certain artists or bands being too &quot;Commercialized&quot; *as many people have said about Evanescence* and to those people...get a life. Worry about something more important...like world hunger.
B000002J09|5.0|Hey, I just wanted to say to you that gave this album a 1 star...YOU HAVE NO TASTE IN MUSIC!!! OK there I said it. Black DOg and Stairway to Heaven are both on here, Stairway being a little bit overplayed... but both are debatably the best songs that have every been played.
B000084T18|1.0|This guy sounds like he has a speech impediment. The only positive thing about this CD is that some of the songs are mildly catchy. When I first heard this &quot;artist&quot; on the radio, I laughed. I would be so ashamed of myself if I had a song called &quot;In Da Club.&quot; First of all, &quot;the&quot; is a really easy word to spell but he somehow gets it wrong, and writing about how shallow you (Get rich or die trying) is pretty tacky. Please listen to music by people who have real vocal talent and have deeper ambitions in life. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
B000066NW0|5.0|It is true that Avril's image is somewhat laughable, but her music is not. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; &quot;I'm With You&quot; &quot;Mobile&quot; &quot;Tomorrow&quot; &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; &quot;My World&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; all outdo the major hit &quot;Complicated&quot; and showcase an up and coming talent that could bloom into something of a Melissa Etheridge phenomenon. She is certainly a sink or float case that could either take off like a rocket in years to come or sink fast.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals by Pink Floyd is by far their most omplex album ever. Its a concept album about peoples place ment in the social and political world. The Pig, Sheep, and Dog being the three platforms of your status in the world.<br />Now on to the music. This album is really one you will have to listen to a few times to fully understand. 'Pigs On The Wing' are bolth love songs about Roger Water's wife, and they are bolth really amazing. 'Pigs (Three Differnt Ones)' is a gerat song with just an amazingly killer guitar solo by David Gilmour. It may be Gilmours best guitar solo ever, and that is saying a whole lot! Dogs, is another killer song with another killer solo and I am not really sure what its totaly about but its really deep and really good for that matter. This may be Pink Floyds best album if its not its their deepest and most complex thats for sure!
B000006OAM|5.0|I have been a fan of Merchant for years, but when I listened to this album for the first time I must admit that I didn't know exactly what to think. At first, it seemed a little too dank for my taste, but with time the inner beauty and light began to shine through.<br />Wonderful songs such as &quot;Life is Sweet&quot; and the ever infection &quot;Kind and Generous&quot; will hook you, and keep you coming back for more.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Pronounced by Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd, is one of the greatest albums ever made its as simple as that! Every song here is a classic! This is Lynyrd Skynyrds best album ever, hands down! Not a weak moment. Even the demos of 'FreeBird' are good!<br />  'Freebird,' well what can you really say about it? Its one of the greatest songs ever made! Amazing lyrics, great slide guitar at the beginning, and the guitar solo! Oh my God the guitar solo is just....its...just damn insane is what it is! ITs over the top and more. Its got build and everything a solo should have its just great.<br />  Dont get me wrong all the other songs on the album are great two but its kinda hard to stand out when you are on the same album as 'FreeBird'
B00005NP04|5.0|I have loved McBride for a long time, but never was inspired to buy any of her albums except &quot;Evolution.&quot; When I saw she had a greatest hits coming out, however, I knew it would be a must have and I was right. Martina hits every note perfectly and the music is perfect on every track. I won't even do a track by track because they are all wonderful. A country classic.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There isnt a whole lot to say really, but this is way better then the original album The Beatles put out... what was it 30 years ago. They got rid of all the stuff that was cluttering the record and got rid of the bad songs and put on better ones. Let It Be....Naked is worth the money for 'Across The Universe' and 'Dont Let Me Down' alone. 'Dont Let Me Down' should have been on the original album anyways, I mean it is the best thing they did since &quot;A Day In The Life.&quot;<br />I never liked 'The Long And Winding Road' but now that it has all that crap like the strings and all off the album this song is really quite good.<br />Other Highlights are 'Get Back' 'Dig A Poney' 'Two Of Us' and the great title track 'Let It Be'<br />In concluesion this blows the original out of the water!
B00005RFAI|5.0|M!ssundaztood is one of the best albums, from a popular artist, in recent years. It blends R'n'B with Rock with amazing results. There are a few infections fun songs (Get This Party Started), but most of the album is a more serious side that was not seen on &quot;Can't Take Me Home.&quot; Songs like &quot;Just Like A Pill,&quot; &quot;Family Portrait&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; make one sit back and wonder if Pink is really singing. From what I understand she had more say over this album than from the last; if this is true, they should give the reigns completely to her.
B000002KJQ|5.0|Tres Hombres along with Dugello is ZZ Tops best album. Almost every song on the album is a classic. Tres Hombres is driven by the mastersful guitar of Billy Gibbons. But none more then the hard rock classic 'La Grange' that guitar is about 25% ZZ Top and 75% Billy Gibbons guitar, its just a pure joy ride through a killer guitar solo with lyrics!<br />The rest of Tres Hombres is killer as well. 'Waiting For The Bus' being another classic with a great guitar riff is probly the best song on Tres Hombres. 'Jesus Just Left Chicago' is just an all around great song. Other highlights being 'Beer Drinkers, And Hell Raisers' and exelent 'Have You Heard.' Every song is a classic but these seem to stand out the most.<br />As I said Tres Hombres and Deguello are ZZ Tops best albums, everone may not agree but for the most part I garentee most every ZZ Top fan comes back to these two more then any of their other albums!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is great and really different from anything Britney's done before. Great background mixes and catchy tunes highlight this album. Yeah, the lyrics are adult and she's no Celine Dion or Christina with a great voice. I was really shocked to read people saying she can't sing. Having a poor voice doesn't mean you can't sing. Her voice sounds slightly unpleasant but please listen to her first album (especially the soft ballads) or her third album and then declare she can't sing. <BR>If you like dancing, you'll love this album. Check out (not the samples) Toxic, Breathe on me, Showdown, Shadow, Everytime and Brave New Girl. The lyrics aren't better than Christina's or anything. I mean how many albums do you want to hear that's going to go deep into facts of life and all? Stripped is excellent but that doesn't mean In the Zone isn't. You ought to give it a chance.<BR>I was rather disaapointed because of the less number of ballads and was expecting bubblegum pop but this grows on you within no time whether you are a Britney fan or not.
B00006F83Y|5.0|normally i don't buy albums, i find that whenever i buy an album i end up liking one song on it and i realize i just wasted 15 bux, this is NOT a waste.  every song on this album is awesome, Queens of the stone age is the one band today that can truly be classified as nothing but ROCK!  The album is an incredible experience but it doesn't even compare to the live experience.  these guys are AWESOME live.  They are so loud and rock so hard, it seems like they just blast the stage.  SO buy this album, and if u like this u have GOT to see them live u will not regret it.
0451204530|4.0|Luke woke up to find himself sleeping on the floor of a public toilet with a bum named Pete. It was a staggering start of a novel. Luke couldn't remember even his name. His street life began. These anecdotes of homeless bums are quite different from those of Street Lawyer by John Grisham.<br /><br />Soon a woman named Elspeth appeared. So the woman knows about Luke. The tale returned to the past; the year was 1941, and the relationship was unfolded between Luke and Elspeth, Luke and his colleague Anthony, and Luke and Billie Josephson who was dangerous to Elspeth's happy life with Luke.<br /><br />The tale comes back to the present. The year was 1958. Luke was loitering in the city for his lost memory. He sensed he was followed by two people. His friend Anthony Carroll was now Luke's enemy. Somehow Anthony was responsible for his loss of memory. Luke was Dr. Claude Lucas responsible for space programs of USA. A rocket was to be launched soon, but something was wrong and Luke knows the reason behind his lost memory. He must get back his lost memory to save USA. Untold story by Luke's side was mysterious enough.<br /><br />I knew the enemies of Luke, but the enigma was Elspeth whose intention was not apparent. She is Luke's wife, but acts against Luke's welfare. The drama unfolds with lightning speed. Every chapter consumes only half an hour. Luke moves, Anthony counter-moves, Billie enters, and Elspeth spins the wheel.<br /><br />This setup was superb enough to attract and grip my heart to read along faster and faster to the final mind-numbing conclusion of this splendid masterpiece of love and deception. You won't regret holding this book in your hand.
0060930349|5.0|This is an excellent book.  As a Southernor, a libertarian, and history buff, I did not see ONE SHRED of bias in his writings that others have mentioned..in fact, he praises democratic presidents (and progressives like Lincoln) endlessly in this book. <br />Unlike the singular/linear fashion in which we learn education in American public schools (this president leads to this president, leads to this war, to this war, etc), Johnson does a wonderful job of showing WHAT is going on at the same time a particular person is president or a particular, well-known event is occurring.  So instead of just learning about the two leading men of a certain era, we also learn who their contemporaries were in industry, finance, art, etc.  Most Americans do not realize for example, that so many people (Presidents, Generals, etc) were contemporaries during other matters/conflicts...that those who shaped the Civil War, and Reconstruction, were around during the Mexican-American War...which also had leaders who were around the same people who formed the Revolution.  There is much overlap, and while reading you are amazed at how Johnson brings this to light, with social and political references, as well as dates and places. <br />He further explains another phenomena (ok, I'm biased here) that is often overlooked.  The role of geography and immigrant group in the &quot;second tier&quot; leadership of the US.  Yes, there were the stereotypical Jeffersons/Washingtons/Adams..of Anglo-Saxon origin running the early US...but behind them were the rugged Scots-Irish &quot;country&quot; (or Southern in many cases) leaders like Jackson, Calhoun, Clay, etc. (or Cyrus McCormick in industry). <br />It is a wonderful book, and provides insight into many areas simply not taught in primary and secondary education.  And contrary to what other reviewers have written, I found it quite DRYLY refers to such politically weighty matters such as the use of the A-bomb.  You simply get references to letters, quotes, and news accounts...in other words, FACTS...NOT his views on the matter.  So I am not sure where that is coming from...he is quite objective about FDR, as he is with every other president. <br />The statistics on industry are enlightening...rail, steel, skyscrapers...you simply don't get this broad of an overview in school...and you certainly don't get the impression that skyscrapers (or their early predecessors I should say) were being built in the late 1800s, while we think of that era as simply the era of the &quot;old West&quot;. <br />Buy this book..it's fascinating.
0385504209|3.0|This novel is basically an excuse for Dan Brown to expose some pet theories about DaVinci, the Holy Grail, and some intruiging notions about the history of the Christian church.  Worthy and fascinating topics, if handled correctly.  Unfortunately, Brown decides to dump all of these ideas into the middle of a half-baked police thriller filled with cardboard cut-out characters.  The plot starts well but then rapidly disintegrates into one near-miss and close-escape after another, getting more and more unbelievable as it progresses.  By the time I reached the end I just wanted to throw the book across the room and yell out, YEAH RIGHT....<br />But... that being said.... i read it in one night.  It keeps the pages turning.  The best part is the historical discussions and theories.  In the hands of more skilled writer, this would be a fanstastic concept for a novel.  Something a bit longer and more detailed, and not trapped within the lame framework of a made-for-TV-movie potboiler.<br />A great opportunity wasted.  Still, I recommend it just for exposing readers to some very interesing ideas and theories.

0800141660|5.0|Let's face it: Jane Austen film adaptations have a reputation both for being slow and for being chick flicks.  Yet here we have a male reviewer who hasn't read any one of her novels who's also telling you that this is one the finest movies he's ever watched.  I have seen a great many of Victorian-era films and I believe this picture captures the old fashioned \\"English reserve\\" more amusingly than any other.  Everybody acts so decent and proper that it really makes you laugh.  How did people ever express themselves and let out their true feelings in that day and age?  Maybe they didn't.  As with any movie bearing costumed actors and beautiful English countrysides, it is also a great looking film.  The casting is perfect, with Hugh Grant in a shining moment of his career and Emma Thompson giving an unforgettable over the top climactic performance.  My advice to the men out there is to give this movie a try because you'll get more out of it than you will with Terminator 2.  Yes, there really is such a thing as a chick flick for guys, and its name is Sense and Sensibility.
B000000JO3|5.0|Being weaned on Minor Threat, you would think most here would recognize it when 'Fred Dursts Numba One Fann' slams them over the head with an completely over the top, overt, obviously * ironic * manifesto. His other reviews are funny too -- the ones for The Essential Bruce Springsteen and The Saved by the Bell Soundtrack are especially hilarious.<br />[As for the conscientious mother alarmed at the preponderance of cursing in Minor Threat's lyrics, I hope you have since then taken a moment to reconsider their content and full meaning before rejecting them a second time as wholesale abominable.<br />You are right to try to take an active role in your son's life -- more should take this vocation seriously -- but the fact of the matter is that Minor Threat's music, most likely, would only have a * positive * influence on your son's life, especially if he, even without adopting them, at least seriously considered the themes of abstinence from drugs, alcohol, meaningless sex, and the general call for critical evaluation of that which give life meaning as one finds in Minor Threat's songs.<br />This kind of thing, I would bet, is not in ready supply among much of what your son sees and hears day to day. And I bet it's also what you yourself most want for him. So don't stifle him when he searches for something greater.]
B00005JLSE|5.0|\\"Chicago\\" is a sleek, sexy film featuring a powerhouse cast doing their own singing and dancing-- which is surprisingly good and makes this movie just that much more impressive. Director Rob Marshall choreographed the numerous dance numbers, which are energetic, sexy, and entertaining. <BR>The biggest complaint people seem to have about this movie is that they don't like the characters. No, they're not quite the protagonists Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor were in \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" but they're not really meant to be. \\"Chicago\\" is, after all a satire and Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, and Gere are all great as slimeballs who are completely oblivious to just how slimy they are. The press, of course, knows but doesn't care since these people help sell papers. The whole point is that our obsession with the scandal du jour has the perverted effect of making celebrities out of people who shouldn't be profiting from their actions.  Look at the media circus that surrounds big trials, and made household names out of Amy Fisher and Lorena Bobbitt in the 90s. Making comparisons to real life, it's not hard to see the point that \\"Chicago\\" makes.<BR>That being said,the disc could've had better extras but it's still worth five stars.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|Yeah, I'd like to see her actually play that riff from Chopin's Winter Wind Etude, let alone sing at the same time. Please, it's actually insulting to REAL pianists. I have to agree with the other reviewer who pointed out the single critical factor of her success: LOOKS.<br />Contrast Keys to Beyonce. Although Beyonce, too, owes most of her success to her looks, at least she can sing without going overboard, and she even has some signature vocal riffs which set her apart. Alicia Keys has NOTHING innovative, plus her voice is rather weak and stale. So she tries to compensate with relentless vocal acrobatics, and it's EXASPERATING.<br />Oh, and just because she writes her own music, unlike most in hip-hop/R&amp;B, doesn't mean it's good. Stevie Wonder she's not.<br />Basically, Keys falls into the category of overrated, overhyped egos who can't dance. Like Mary J Blige... Oh no, don't get me started on her...

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Well if you're a big Beatles fan you'll want to own this one.<BR>Let it be was never one of my favorite Beatles albums, it's over produced &quot;wall of sound&quot; tracks never quite sounded like a beatles lp... But this new let it be naked is way better than the original... first off deleting the Phil Spector over production of choir and strings... then eliminating no nonsense songs like maggie may and dig it. Then raising the level of billy prestons keys... It's not really a different album, just a better way to listen to it... I give 41/2 stars out of five... worth the 12-13 dollars it will cost you, unless you downloaded the damn thing...
B0000E1WKE|2.0|If this album had been released 10 years ago--before all the drug-induced damage to her voice--I would have snatched it up in a second.  But now, I will pass on it.  Whitney used to have the most wonderful, angelic, glorious voice I had ever heard.  Even now, almost 20 years after her debut album, I can't think of anyone whose voice was as angelic.  <br />But now, her voice sounds old and raspy--and it is too depressing to even listen to her anymore.  The saddest part about this story, is that she did this to herself.<br />All the great reviews of this CD are undoubtedly from die-hard fans who cannot face the truth about Whitney.  Oh well, ignorance is bliss, I guess.
B000002KD9|3.0|De la trilog&iacute;a de excelentes discos de la primera etapa de Neil Young, sin considerar su debut, After The Gold Rush es el menos destacado, lo que en ning&uacute;n caso equivale a decir que es un paso atr&aacute;s, s&oacute;lo pierde un poco su brillo al estar en medio de dos gigantes como Everybody Knows y Harvest (o tres si tambi&eacute;n se considera D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu). El tono del disco es oscuro, predominando las baladas folk, memorables temas como Tell Me Why, el mejor tema del disco, Only Love Can Break Your Heart o I Believe In You dejan ver su lado m&aacute;s intimista, mientras When You Dance... y en especial Southern Man vuelven a recordar al disco anterior, con la t&iacute;pica interacci&oacute;n en las guitarras que ser&iacute;a una de las marcas del caracter&iacute;stico sonido Neil Young.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Honestly, hearing Sarah's voice again is just wonderful.  She could be singing the menu at Denny's and I'd be just as moved.  But I really think that everyone who has been critical of this cd need remember two things - this CD is influenced by two huge events in her life - the birth of her daughter, which I'm sure brought her unmeasurable joy, and the death of her mother.  Her emotions, her very being, are being pulled in opposite directions.  We've all experienced the death of a loved one, and sometimes, afterward, you don't know what to do with yourself.  You feel guilty everytime you smile, or laugh.  In her case, I'm sure she wanted to share the joy of her mother with her daughter, and that will never happen now.  I didn't expect this CD to be stellar, or one of her best ever just because she's been gone for so long.  The fact that she has finally returned to music is enough for me.  Give the CD a chance, and give her a chance too.
B000002LQR|5.0|I just turned 30 recently(hold your applause). I was driving to an neighboring town and I was flipping through the radio; all I heard were songs from the early '90's; I turned it on the local rock station and heard my favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers song, &quot;Under The Bridge&quot;. Three things came to me;that I'm getting old, that music used to be great 10 years ago, and that I haven't really realized how influential this record is. 75% of the bands on the radio have taken influence from this band and album(Korn, Limp Bizkit, No Doubt, Alien Ant Farm, 311, etc), though I doubt the Chili Peppers would take credit for most of them. Anthony Keidis was rapping over rock riffs long before it became popular and fashionable, and still does it better than most. And speaking of riffs; if someone doesn't say that Flea isn't one of the best bass players ever to walk the earth, do me a favor and give them a good hard chin check(a punch in the face for those who don't know). Essentially, this is the last Chili Peppers album in which they would revel in the accesses of life, in particularly drugs; they would go on to become rock elder statesmen and role models for the next generation.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I listened to this album over and over again-- because i wanted to listen out for the lies i heard on these boards like:<br />Whitneys Voice Cracks: UNTRUE! She held her notes great!<br />Whitneys Voice is gone: if shes singing then..?<br />Whitneys having a crack christmas: come on people, arent we a bit old to be making judgements<br />another thing--if you didnt listen to the cd, it isnt good to review on a guess cos its misleading. as well as to the fanatics of other artists---please stray from writing horrible reviews because you wanna grab more attention to your favorite..<br />anyway O Come O Come Emanuel is the most amazing song on this album! and O Holy Night! Her best run on this album was at the end of o come o come emanuel and throuought o holy night! I suggest everyone buy this because its definitely brigthened up my christmas season as well as others
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Coming from a person who REFUSES to buy music because of the mere fact that I have a problem supporting artists' crazy lifestyles-- the fact that I actually went and brought this cd (A first in the last 5 years) is saying a lot. This cd is a work of art in the sense that she has dared to take me back to a time in which music was so pure. She decided to go in another angle with her work.  It is real and refreshing. I am not going to say that it is perfect because no artist is perfect but she has definately raised the bar for R&amp;B artists. It is definately much more consistant than her first album, which I believe had too much hype and not enough substance. I could listen to her diary straight through!<br />Now some may argue that she samples, she's not original. I beg to differ. First off, a real music lover would understand that there is NO artist who is exempt from sampling or &quot;borrowing&quot; a little somethin' somethin' from their influences. Whether it be Alicia or Aretha! Think about the gospel people. EVERYBODY's done it. Some do it less tasteful than others. But hey, the more creative, the better. I am not going to break down every song, but trust, if you LOVE R&amp;B music (and i don't mean that pop sh*t, or rap and reggae infused stuff that cats wanna put out there nowadays) you'll love her album. I must say it was money well spent...she deserves it, and I didn't mind giving it to her. Thanks Ms. Keys, as your female peer I am truely impressed! Keep it up...
B00007AJGH|5.0|It's good to see how well this \\"antiquated\\" movie translated to dvd! Compared to the newer high tech movies Roger Rabbit still stands up and entertains with beautiful picture and sound. There are numerous extras that make you feel like you've entered the action including:<BR>Who Made Roger Rabbit - a mini- documentary hosted by by Charles Fleisher the voice of Roger<BR>The \\"Trouble in Toontown\\" Game<BR>Audio Commentary with the filmakers<BR>\\"Toontown Confidential\\"  an intriquing  & hilarious facts and trivia viewing option<BR>And so many more options!<BR>The movie is rated PG for some \\"Human\\" cussing. If you're disappointed about the toon Jessica Rabbit's bare breast scene being edited out, you should get a life and protest more important things going on in the world.<BR>The Vista Series Edition of Roger Rabbit was a delight and I'm happy with this purchase. My five year old realizes that the few swear words are inappropriate and the \\"fantasy violence\\" to be politically correct  isn't real and isn't the correct way to act.. Overall I think RR was a top notch movie and was meant for DVD.<BR>JOHN ROW

B000084T18|4.0|Many people have the illusion that all rap is the same. If you aren't deaf you can tell that it's not. (This is not so much a review as a comment on other reviews, mostly the negative ones). There is a distinct difference between rap of this generation and of past generations. There is also a distinct difference between different kinds of rap, and there really are different kinds. It's impossible to  compare 50 Cent's music to the Black Eyed Peas - considered a contemporary rap group. His music is bold and real and so is theirs (Black Eyed Peas) but it's two different, distinct forms. Does anyone remember the East Coast vs. West Coast ordeal? Not only did it spew from a rap battle gone ary, there was also a distinct difference in the music. Even the artists today will tell you that and there's nothing wrong with it (different styles). Nowadays there's East Coast, West Coast, Dirty South, Midwest...all over. Perhaps the only thing you can compare with these different kinds, and they aren't limited to where the artist is from per say (check out rap from around the world), is not the type, but the artists lyrical (not vocal) ability. People want to hear someone who sounds fresh and new and 50 Cent definitely carries that, whether or not you like rap, 50 Cent,  Ja Rule, or anything/one else. If you want to hear something old told a new way, because that's what essentially everything is, then get this album. Don't go judging someone's art. It takes a lot to do the things that these artists (including all artists in the entertainment industry) do, whether you think they can rap, sing, dance so on and so forth. There should be some respect for it, as long as they come for real. Remember at one point everyone dug Vanilla Ice (some still do)and that's cool too. If you like it you like it, if you don't you don't. Try not to glorify or denoucne anything. Let people find out for themselves.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The mutant versus non-mutant issue rises again in this even greater action sequel to X-Men.  The mutants (good and evil) are forced to unite to face a common non-mutant enemy bound to exterminate mutants altogether on earth by making use of a duplicate copy of Cerebro the mind connection chamber Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) uses to locate all mutants.  Starting with a bogus attack on the President, the mutants are used as pawns in a plot to undermine the Xavier School for the Gifted which is assaulted like a third world country and to locate all mutants around the world.  There are many wonderful special affects such as the wall of ice made by a new X-man Iceman and the disappearing acts by another newcomer Night Crawler (Alan Cummings).  Familiar favorites such as Magneto (Ian McKellan) don't disappoint either.  He has a most unique scene were he breaks out of prison with the help of Mystique.  Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stomas) in her own right is one tough woman.  She can fly planes, manipulate computer systems and kick butt.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackson) finally connects with the past he's been searching for and has a dynamic fight sequence with Deathstrike (Kelly Hu).  And we say good-bye to one special mutant.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Since the plot has been dicussed from beginning to end in alot of the other reviews, I won't take up your time with another repeat of that. Gladiator won 5 Academy Awards including best picture for the year 2000.<BR>The single disc version offers very little in bells and whistles. Even what should be the little booklet inside is single sheet with a picture just like the outside package and an ad for other DVDs from Dreamworks. The actual movie is beautifully reproduced both visually and in stunning Dolby Surround Sound.<BR>The few extras you get on the single disc version are:<BR>Film commentary from Ridley Scott the award winning director<BR>Deleted Scenes, with director's commentary<BR>Treasure Chest: a unique montage of additional footage cut to the powerful score<BR>Special slide show featuring concept art and storyboards<BR>Photo Gallery from behind the scenes of the Gladiator set<BR>In-depth Production notes and detailed cast and filmaker biographies<br />This single disc version is put out for those who appreciate the film as being the star of the DVD. Which is the point of such a well made movie, isn't it?<br />I'm happy with this purchase. Be aware it has an R rating for &quot;Intense, Graphic combat&quot;. But, there's alot more to this movie than the battle scenes and gladitorial action.<BR>John Row
B00005JG6Q|5.0|If you want a brainless fight cartoon look elsewhere. Akira is a has a complex plot and is beautifully drawn.

In the end only Number 28 -- Akira can control Tetsuo... But can Akira save Tokyo from destruction?<br />The DVD has a super feature that provides translations of text and graffiti in the movie via pop up &quot;capsules&quot; Some of this text is important to the plot. <br />Akira is an essential addition to the collection of any animation or anime fan.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Her holiday album is here.  Whitney comes back to her choir girl roots, and the result is pleasing.  Not unbelievably good, but very good.  She may have been through a lot personally, but her voice sounds rich and strong.  <br />The song featuring her daughter is a special gift and mothers will find it touching.<br />It is a traditional album which would be good for playing during tree-decorating, cookie-baking days.  Also nice for the car ride at night to look at lights.  A little less of a party background CD, because people would listen to the CD instead of talk. Overall, enjoyable Christmas music from a Whitney we have missed.  She can still sing.  Welcome back.
B000084T18|4.0|First of all, I think rap is horrible.  I am a Zeppelin and Doors fan at heart, and when I first heard of 50 Cent I was sure I would hate him along with all of the other rap starts out there. But while listening to the cd in a friends car I realized there is a time and a place for his music. It's FUN, though, I don't think he would agree with this. I listen to the CD when bored, and like his beats, he's good at what he does and for this he gains my respect. I told a good friend of mine if &quot;Fitty&quot; was around and popular for more then a year, maybe I'll like him, well it's been about a year and I have come to enjoy his music.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I found this CD to be totally awesome. Fleetwood Mac hasn't lost thier touch despite the fact that Christine McVie is no longer with them. Lyndsey Buckingham is the center of this group. His talent is beyond words. His guitar playing leaves you in toatl awe.!! I loved ALL of the songs. And Stevie Nicks and the rest, I think have made this album their best of all time. Such great songs written by the talent of all of them.The special tribute to 9-11.. Illume~~ reached my heart.Stevie and Lyndsey's vocal's together could not have made this CD what it is. AWESOME~~~~~~~~~~ I've worn this CD out already.... Buy it, it's well worth the listening.
B00005JMFO|3.0|There is no denying that Love Actually is a very entertaining film. There are some very funny moments, often genuinely witty and warm, and the cast, for the most part, is first-class. The nowadays more mature Hugh Grant is no longer the annoying foppish twit he was earlier in his career, and actually manages to be quite endearing. Martine McCutcheon--already known to British audiences as a TV soap star, and certainly not an actress I would have deliberately chosen to see--turns in a serendipitously understated performance. She delivers what could have been some very tedious comedy episodes (such as the early \\"Oops, I just said sh*t twice,\\" scene) in a surprisingly low-key manner. Also worth noting is Bill Nighy as an aging rocker, who has some of the film's funniest lines.<br />Curtis brings a number of strands of plot together (the cast is huge, and many of the different storylines do not interconnect until well into the film), connecting them up in some very clever ways at times. However, it doesn't always work. At least two or three of the subplots could have been dispensed with altogether--they simply don't engage us or make sense.<br />Lastly, there is no doubt the film is an emotional rollercoaster. You'll be fighting back the tears at times. The most emotional moments, however, arise from the filmmakers' shameless manipulation of the audience: The most banal and embarrassingly lazy cliches surface regularly to tug on our heartstrings; the score periodically swells into patriotic fervour or overblown sentimentalism to wrench our innermost feelings out of us. The British journalist Will Self furiously called the opening sequence, during which Hugh Grant refers to the phone calls from the planes to loved ones on 9/11, \\"the most grotesque and sickening manipulation of the cinema audience since Leni Riefenstahl's [Nazi propaganda film] Triumph of the Will.\\" A bit of wild overstatement, perhaps, but not totally removed from the truth. Get your audience thinking back to all those images of people weeping and embracing after 9/11, and you'll have them eating out of the palm of your hand should you want to feed them a message of \\"love, love, love,\\" no matter how trite the means.<br />What saves this film is that, apart from the triteness, there are some genuinely moving moments: The scene when wrinkled rockstar Bill Nighy confesses his love for his \\"chubby employee\\"; when recently wedded Kiera Knightley watches her friend's video of the wedding and makes a startling discovery. There are also some genuinely funny moments, even if Curtis more than occasionally gives in to the temptation to sink into the predictable. And finally, there are some very clever moments, when Curtis does actually manage to defy our expectations and deliver something other than what we wanted or anticipated. Beneath the banal, there really is some warmth.<br />Go on, suspend your critical judgment for the evening. I am not convinced it is all love, actually. It's entertainment, actually.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I really like this CD, but it's not Brit's best. Her last album was better, though not by much. This album had some very good potential, &quot;Outrageous&quot; &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; and obviously &quot;Me Against The Music.&quot; Its pretty good and I give it 4 stars.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Written in memory of Maestro Michael Kamen, (15 April 1948 - 18 November 2003), by a fan of his.<br />There is no doubt in my mind what an amazing and passionate spirit Michael Kamen is...this only made it even more evident.<br />The arrangements, of course, were spectacular, and I cannot think of a single song that did not benefit tremendously from Michael and his orchestra. One could hardly imagine two more different genres of music--and yet the result was such that every note, every majestic chord was exactly where it should be...as if it had been destined from the very beginning.<br />I began my musical life through classical music and only later moved into rock when I heard Pink Floyd, with whom Michael collaborated--and for me, having enjoyed both genres, this is the perfect synthesis.  I will probably not ever investigate Metallica's other works...for I feel like all that I need to know is right here.<br />Obviously from a visual standpoint, I wish there would have been much more footage of Michael, as I am much more his fan than I am of Metallica, but I am very pleased that they honored him with his very own &quot;Maestro&quot; section in the bonus materials, and I was also very happy with the interview he did in the documentary. When he was visible, I couldn't help but feel invigorated by the sheer energy of his personality. His joy was obvious--watch for when he shouts &quot;MASTER!&quot; along with the audience during &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;! And his vitality becomes all the more amazing and wonderful when you realize that Mr. Kamen was already having to deal with the challenges of MS--but he never allows that to stand in his way here. That in and of itself is a testament to the power of his spirit. Even when he isn't visible, that power reverberates through that orchestra and into the heart of the listener! Even now, when I sit here writing this in silence, the memory sings joyously in my heart...where it will be treasured forever.<br />Despite S &amp; M being a DVD of bold statements, experiencing it was often a case of being touched by the little details...one of the most wonderful moments was as Michael came back onstage for the second part of the concert, and one of the hardcore Metallica fans in the front row greets him with that 4/4 time gesture, just as enthused about Michael's presence as he was with the presence of the band. It was clear that the audience loved him--and at one point, I could very clearly read Michael's lips as he looked out at them: &quot;I love you!&quot; And somehow, even the song with the grimmest lyrics became part of this great celebration. And that's how I think he was...smiling even through the most difficult things--and in a different way, smiling even now.<br />&quot;How does it feel to be alive?&quot;<br />What can I say after watching this, but WONDERFUL! Both this life and the life that is eternal!<br />There is one fact that cannot be denied...Michael Kamen will ALWAYS be remembered.<br />I don't think he'd want it any other way...I feel that I have just experienced a celebration of life, a legacy of power.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I wouldn't say i'm the &quot;authority&quot; on Punk rock, but i see what alot of you are saying. What I dont see however, is how you can say an album by a band that has a history of punk rock is bad, just because it doesnt meet the standards of so called &quot;punk rock.&quot; I mean I'm no expert, but isnt the main thing that punks are fighting conformity? And assuming that, isnt judjing an album by how it fits with a particular genre just supporting another system of conformity? Anyway, just my opinion.
B0000C1733|3.0|sure, its on the DVD, but thats just unacceptable. Its SO much better than some of the songs that made the CD.
0385504209|1.0|Poor storytelling that copies/plagerizes everything from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Heat just not as well and certainly with no disguise.<br />Not sure if catholic bashing is a sport yet but Brown certainly pushed the envelope. Very predictable and very corny - great possibilities but never got off the ground. The characters are horrible stereoypical that I would be suprised if this makes it to a B movie at best. A dis-service to the material for sure.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|This is a great CD if you listen to it a few times.  Absolutely stupdenous.<br />Whitney's voice sounds great.  She's gaining back her power and her beauty.  Her depth of feeling is unmatchable. No other female singer today can match Whitney's glory.<br />I gave it four stars, because I thought the title song &quot;One Wish&quot; was hokey and un-inspired.  Whitney deserved a better single than that.<br />But her rendition of COME O EMANUEL is the best vocal performance I have EVER heard from her.  Absolutely magical.<br />This is the perfect christmas album.  GO WHITNEY!

B00002MZ12|5.0|First of all, I might say that this album is surely the best made of Alanis Morissette. She performs many songs fron the success &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; and many new songs. She proves how many times better she is comparing to another singers, because if you're a singer, you gotta sing well. Have you read that? This goes for Ricky Martin, Britney, Justin, Enrique Iglesias, and all that rubish that fills our radios everyday.<BR>So, this CD is 100% recommendable, &quot;Uninvited&quot; is maybe the best of her performs, also Ironic, You Learn, You Oughta Know and a very nice cover from Sting: &quot;King of Pain&quot;.<BR>I would've included &quot;Hand in my pocket&quot; but nothing is perfect.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Well this is definatley the be all end all of box sets this thing is huge!!! the packaging i agree could've been a little better but come on people were talking 9 discs i think putting each one in its own case and then slapping it all together would have resulted in a package so big it would've been challenging you for breathing space, and to put to rest some rumors some people say they didnt keep the original aspect ratio for the first alien this is incorrect i have viewed the movie and the aspect ratio is indeed 2.35.1 and i also had no freezes or difficulties viewing the movie in its entirety and lastly call me crazy but i liked all the alien movies and alien resurrection was my favorite, so say what you may but as far as i'm concerned alien fans that bought this set are definitley getting thier moneys worth

Hay tres grupos de personas importantes en la pelcula.  El primer es los indigenas se llama los guaranis.  El segundo grupo es los jesuitas.  Los jesuitas lidera por la padre Gabriel.  El tercer grupo es los portugueses y los espaoles.<BR> Padre Gabriel ofrezco su amistad con los guaranis.  Despus de ganar la confianza de los guaranis Padre Gabriel crea la misin para converso los indigenas a buenos catolicos.  Padre Gabriel ensea mucho para los guaranis incluyo musica.  La pelcula muestra la lucha para los guaranis demonstar que ellos son buenos catolicos y no son personas que no tiene la capacidad para aprender los mismos cosas de los portugueses y los espaoles.  La pelcula muestra la lucha de los guaranis para mantener la mision tambien.  <BR> Los jesuitas trata a ayudar los guaranis en demostrar el converso de los guaranis a los portugueses y los espaoles quien no piensa que los guaranis son buenos catolicos y no pienso que los guaranis viven en la mision.  La pelcula de la mision muestra un problema que muy grande en las americas latinas y muestra la viste que el director Roland Joff en esa tema.  Yo pienso que esa pelcula es muy buena y muestra los problemas de los indigenas y los problems entre diferentes grupos de personas muy bien.
B000022TSW|5.0|QUOTED FROM \\"USER IN MARYLAND\\"<br />\\"\\"\\"I first watched the South Park movie last night at midnight on comedy central. They were doing a special and showed the movie UNCUT with barely any commercial interruption. I loved this movie the moment it started.The beginning is like this: Stan comes out of his house and starts to sing a song about his \\"Quiet Little Mountain Town\\" and he goes around and gets his friends Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.Then, they go to an R rated movie and use a homeless man to make it look like its their guardian so they can see the movie. After viewing the movie, All of the boys talk trash big time:...The story goes that after viewing the movie, the four friends tell other boys and girls and then all the children of South Park and now using bad language and the Mothers of South Park get angry and declare war on Canada.>>>>>>> (Thats because the makers of the movie were canadian.)<br />Now, this movie is definetly not for kids, even though i am a kid, but i can handle this ...right? just kidding. anyway, theres a TON OF BAD LANGUAGE, LOTS OF SEXUAL REFERENCES, AND SOME GRAPHIC (ANIMATED) VIOLENCE. so dont let people under 13 watch it. just make sure people 13 and over can handle all the swearing. <br />PSSSST!: Heres an extra: in this episode, kenny goes to hell, and at the end, you see kenny's face! it looks like stans but it has messy blonde hair!!! also, kenny goes to heaven at the end.\\"\\"\\"<br />Why are you wasting space, even on an internet movie chatboard with this $hit. First off, nice try Trey Parker and Matt Stone are from Colorado, not Canada, any fan with 1/15th of a brain knows that. Next, good job with the spoilers. I hadnt seen the movie before I read your review and you totally ruined it, and third, how the he11 did you pull the age 13 out of your a$$ for the \\"correct age to see this\\"??? I think we should make a rule that kids should not be able to waste board space with their irrelevant opinions.<BR>God what a waste of space and time.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I hate this movie because it manages not only to be terrible in its own right but an insult to the series, that manages to decreases my enjoyment of the other two. I found myself, on numerous accasions, looking away from the screen such was the level of embarressment i felt for the actors. Why was this film made as a flatly unfunny parody of the other two?
B00008977N|3.0|I own a high end home theatre system (sony XBR CRT display, lexicon processor, B&amp;W 7.1) and I am a professional in television so I feel qualified to comment on the technical quality of this disc.<br />Other reviews have noted the graniness of the film; the concert was recorded on film, not tape, and there's a lot of classic Gabriel moody lighting so maybe this accounts for the abnormally high graininess.  It's certainly not unacceptable but is, admittedly, a little coarse.<br />The DTS mix is not up to speed...I find it too compressed and shrill lacking sufficient depth and bass, in particular.  The imaging is pretty weak too.<br />The camerawork is frustrating at times, cutting off the arms of (virtuoso drummer/percusionist) Manu Katche.  There is some gawdawful lip-syncing too which really removes the viewer from the illusion that you're watching a live performance.<br />My biggest complaint is that the show is self-conciously choreographed to the point that there's not a single moment that has any spontenaity.  As with all Gabriel shows, there are some fabulous lighting effects and smart use of props but the show is far too restrained and Gabriel looks rather stiff as he swings around the stage trying to look free and improvised but obviously following rigorously well-rehearsed steps.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I have just seen the movie at a special preview in Palm Springs, CA. Ian McKellan was there for a special guest presentation. The way that this soundtrack complements the movie is great! Even better, is the soundtrack alone. Put together they all make a great compilation. This is one of those soundtracks that truly captures emotions that we only feel at the movies. This is a great work, and Howard Shore shoudl be commended. The use of meloday and development throughout the other three soundtracks shows the escalation in story line, and in the trilogy's development.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|When the first Matrix film was released, it was definitely the most original science-fiction movie in years. It was a fresh idea in the world of the 'man vs. machine' concept and featured some of the most revolutionary special effects ever, many of which would be duplicated by countless others. Now comes the Matrix Reloaded, the long-awaited follow-up to that now cult-classic sci-fi hit. Sadly, the once-anticipated series has now taken a complete step backward.<br /><br />Needless to say, the Matrix Reloaded contains some of the silliest plot elements ever conceived. Anyone who believes this movie has philosophy in it is a total imbecile. The dialogue scenes are filled with ridiculous aphorisms that are either common sense or just idiotic gibberish. The amount of such annoying dialogue really hurts the enjoyable factor. All the characters seemed to have lost their cool edge from the first film. While Keanu Reeves still has no idea how to act, the Trinity and Morpheus characters have much limited roles here. The action scenes fall short of being impressive. Obviously, they've simply been added to add more length to the movie, such as the monotonous freeway chase. There's barely room for any plot, thus there's still a lot left to be desired.<br /><br />Visually, there isn't anything to be fascinated by since everything has basically been recycled from the first. It is all too familiar now. The soundtrack has predominantly tribal-sounding music that sounds like it belongs elsewhere. The fight sequences seem uninspired and lack the originality and tenacity of those found in its predecessor. If you're a sci-fi fan, you might dig Reloaded, but Matrix fans may be disappointed. The lukewarm storyline, nonsense dialogue and tedious action scenes prevent it from even coming close to the original.
B00009TB5G|5.0|the two towers extended edition dvd lives up to the expectations with every possible extra feature that any LOTR fan would have ever asked for! this is definitely one hell of a dvd you'll never regret buying. peter jackson's finesse and craftmanship in every frame of the film leaves you asking for more. no words of appreciation are enough. even 10 stars are less.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This is the best show ever and has to be relesed on DVD. It is so better than any other show that has been relesed on DVD, and hasnt been relesed yet.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I have all 3 of her previous albums and I have always enjoyed having a bit of a boogie to her songs but I'm sorry this new album is completely lacking! It actually began to really bug me! I didn't enjoy listening to it at all and all I could think was thank **** I didn't actually buy this!<BR>If you are looking for something similar to what you've heard from Britney before DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!Her sound has completely gone down hill!not good!
B00005LO5P|4.0|Now that apocalyptic visions of the future are back in vogue, this movie reassumes its original &quot;resonance&quot; with audiences worried about population pressures and violent conflict between nations.  Logan's Run was one of a very few &quot;philosophical&quot; science fiction movies in the pre-Star Wars era, and it has lost very little of its original punch.<br />The setup and surprises are so familiar that they are a part of our modern culture...if life is to be idyllic, it has a dark side, and you die young so that the domed city doesn't become overcrowded.  A pre-catastrophe symbol, the &quot;ankh&quot;, allows &quot;runners&quot; to signal each other and participate in the underground railroad that leads to &quot;sanctuary&quot; outside the domes.  All does not go as planned, and Logan and Jessica find that there is nothing left of the old civilization to assist them following their escape.  You know how it ends...is humanity any better off than it was before?<br />Unlike Star Wars, &quot;Logan&quot; leaves something to think about afterwards.  The significance of this story is still being decided.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|When i First purchased APC, i thought it would be tool-like since i didnt hear Mar De Noms, and this is what i got out of the cd...<BR>1. Package - 5 out of 5 (should be 6/5). Greatest song on teh whole cd. The bass is great as well as the flow and tune of the song. Maynard once again makes the song work. <BR>2. Weak and Powerless - 4.4 out of 5 (only becuase it was a single and was played out) this song captures the tool feel really well but at the same time is different. It was a great song but got played out on the radio<BR>3. Noose -  4.1 out of 5. Had the potential to be great, because Maynard had some good lyrics, but there was just something about the song that kept it from top quality. Still a good song though. <BR>4. Blue - 4.6 out of 5. I really liked this song because of the mystical sorta feel but also at the same time Maynard made it work once again. Listen to this song just for maynard.<BR>5. Vanishing - 3.8 out of 5. Was an OK song. Didnt tip the scale for me either way as good or bad. Its a very mood-dependant song that is great when you are in the mood but sucks when you arent. <BR>6. Stranger - 4.3 out of 5. This song is very soft. The angelic voice of Maynard makes this song work. Good song, not great. But when you are in a happy kinda mood, it kinda makes you feel great.<BR>7. Outsider - 4.8 out of 5. Great song. I like the way how it kind of starts off sounding as if it will be slow then it jumps into bass and beats. From there, Maynard takes over, as in all his other songs and the song becomes beautiful. <BR>8. Crimes - 2 out of 5. This song sucks. Dont know why they put it in the album?<BR>9. The nurse who loved me - 3.4 out of 5. This is a dreamy type of song, which sounded kinda stupid. Maynard messed this one up.<BR>10. Pet - 4.6 out of 5. Another song that is nice and upbeat with great Maynard action. One of the must-listens on this cd.<BR>11. Lullaby - 2.3 out of 5. This song sounded pointless to me. But thats just me.<BR>12. Gravity - 4.4 out of 5. Very nice bass and flowing touch to the song. Maynard works his magic on this track and was a great end track. Makes you feel good about the cd once this song has been played.
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|X2 is simply an awesome movie and a great DVD.  The movie was great in every possible way and I found very little to zero flaws during this movie.<br />For starters, X2 is certainly better than the first movie.  This reason being simply that the first movie was more of an introduction to the whole idea of X-Men for the audience that was not familiar with X-Men as a whole.  However, this movie really gets into the hard core storylines such as Jean & Cyclops' relationship, Wolverine's past, and adds some interesting if not critical characters like William Stryker, Pyro, and Nightcrawler.<br />The movie never gets boring and always keeps you into it with its great acting and eye-popping action.  But make no mistake about it, X2 really focuses in on the storylines of the comic book which has made X-Men a successful franchise.<br />A lot of credit has to be given to Bryan Singer for directing this film because he was able to stick to the main plots without making any real significant changes to the X-Men storyline.  He also improved this film by getting rid of Sabretooth and Toad since those characters really were never critical to the comics nor are they in Singer's 1st film.  Also, Singer cleverly keeps out the most annoying character, Jubilee, from the movie.  In fact, this DVD reveals how a minor scene that included Jubilee was deleted.  Some characters that Singer may want to introduce in the next film are Beast, Mr. Sinister, or even Omega Red.  He may want to consider giving Colossus a bigger role if he includes Omega Red.  <br />But most of all, Singer has to include Gambit in the next film.  His real name (Remy Lambeau) is shown in one scene as another reviewer already wrote and Henry McCoy (Beast) is briefly shown on a TV set in one scene.  So one has to expect that they will be included in the next film.<br />Overall, X2 is brilliantly directed and screenplayed.  The DVD is awesome in that it's a two disc set which has plenty of features that really go behindthe scenes of X2.<br />If you're an X-Men fan, don't hesitate buying this DVD.  Buy it right away, you won't regret it!  I can't wait until X3 comes out because it will be interesting to see where Singers goes with the the transformation of Jean into the Phoenix.
0380778556|5.0|After not reading this book for at least ten years, I picked it up again.  It's a masterpiece, no doubt, but as I've gone along my own life my reaction to the characters changes.  The second Mrs de Winter IS very young, like a self-conscious adolescent, so concerned about what others think, so easily intimidated, refusing to speak up in a way that is frustrating.  (For example, if Mrs Danvers tried that costume trick on me I would  fire her within the hour -- but at Mrs de Winter's tender age I would have been intimidated.)  She wastes her time imagining terrible situations, not realizing that her husband loves her the whole time, that what she wants is close at hand, too frightened to be happy.  Both Maxim and his second wife are flawed, and in some ways another reviewer is right, Rebecca, not seen, who grabbed life with two hands, is to be admired.  Nevertheless I enjoy the scenes narrated by the second Mrs de Winter, even the slower first chapters, as they draw you through the novel.  I disagree with other reviewers that some of the dialogue is dull -- or rather, it is meant to seem like a dull overlay to the terrifying secrets just below the surface.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Any one who bashes this movie and says you have to have no IQ to enjoy this.....you are the ones with no IQ! This is a great movie and you knpw it, you're just too stupid to understand it thats why you hate it and have given it 1 star! And for other people who have said that the word DARK comedy means it failed...how wrong could you be? Dark comedy means that it is not supposed to be funny and only funny it menas its supposed to be funny and touch on facts not many people dare to go. SO before you throw around phrases like Dark comedy means it failed...um think about what your saying. This is a great movie. Look at McDougal reviews on this moive and other movies he's written on. Even though he's only 15 he is still smarter than most of you adults out there who are trashing this movie for no reason so keep your lame opinions to yourself....
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I haven't much liked the Beatles remastering efforts that came before (Yellow Submarine, the '1' album), because they seemed to suck the life out of the songs. Right now I'm giving this CD a second spin, after liking the first spin a couple of days ago. Unlike the previous remasterings, this one absolutely, positively brings the songs to life! This is a very warm, exuberant album, and it really brings a smile to my face. This is probably the most live sounding album they ever did, next to Please Please Me. And stripping out all of Specter's garbage is a phenomenal improvement. The Long and Winding Road is actually growing on me, there's some very delicious parts to that song.<br />I always liked the original &quot;Let It Be&quot;, except for some teeth-gritting moments. This is a much better release, no teeth-gritting moments, and it's almost like hearing the Beatles again for the first time! Congratulations and thanks to the guys who remastered this one. Beautiful!
0060977493|2.0|I came to this book with great hopes as it had been praised by so many. I came to it on a real high after reading Rumpole's Last Case and the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night, both of which I really enjoyed. I found myself growing annoyed with this book almost immediately after I began reading it. Some of the prose is quite beautiful, but much of the time I felt it just got in the way. I don't mind long complex sentences, but I found myself skipping entire paragraphs here. Too many of her words and sentences seemed like needless window dressing and the small insights they proffered seemed inadequate for the effort it took to get them. I hate to give up on a book once I have started it, but this one is really trying my patience. I am about three-quarters of the way through, but there are many other books beckoning me that I think might be more rewarding.
B00008977N|4.0|This concert is excellent, Peter Gabriel puts on a terrific show with an excellent support band and gorgeous vocalist Paula Cole.<br />The music in this DVD is mostly taken from the &quot;US&quot; album (&quot;Come Talk to me&quot;,&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;Blood of Eden&quot;,&quot;Secret World&quot; &quot;Kiss that Frog&quot; &quot;Washing of the Water&quot; and ) which is a great album.<BR>The high points of this concert are indeed from it : &quot;Come talk to me&quot; and &quot;Secret World&quot;. The greatest hits are included too: &quot;Sledge Hammer&quot;, &quot;Don't give up&quot;, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; and the other highlight in this DVD : &quot;In your eyes&quot;.<br />Peter Gabriel and the Band put a great show that manages funny, sharp, dramatic, goofy AND very cool. Sound quality is excellent though I only listened to it in a low end 2.0 system. The video transfer is poor - as in grainy - but totally watchable because of the great show. The extras are not nearly as interesting : <br />a)Slow Steam Photo Gallery has very nice pics but Steam should have never been slowed down. <BR>b)Concert Set-up Timelapse : Once you've seen a concert timelapse you've seen them all and this one has no music to it so it's quite dull<BR>c)The &quot;behind the scenes&quot; is barely insightful or interesting but you would miss it if it hadn't been included.<BR>d)The film &quot;taster&quot; of Growing Up is just that.<br />The show and music are great so this DVD is a must-have in any collection.<br />4 stars out of 5 because of the grainy transfer and poor extras.
B00005QIPH|1.0|people,<BR>this album blows, and I mean it really sucks. they're not even good enough to be a garage band. the only 2 reasons they're so hyped is: 1. rolling stone magazine is pushing them as the next U2 and 2. they're good looking young dudes. easy to sell to a marketing driven public. <BR>honestly, there is nothing good about this record or this band. even their big hit &quot; last night&quot; , has to steal a riff from tom petty's 'american girl&quot;. could you get any lamer than stealing from  tom effing petty?<BR>try any VU album, also the new remaster of Television's marquee moon. anything but this pile of crap!<BR>honestly people, are we so desparate?<BR>this really is a case of the emperor's new clothes.<BR>YUCK!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I admit, I was one of the people who was calling Alicia &quot;overrated!&quot; after she received all the hype for her debut, SONGS IN 'A' MINOR.  I thought it was overhyped and overrarted, and I still do.  But she surely made a fan out of me with this album.  When I first heard 'You Don't Know My Name' I was in love.  I wasn't too sure about buying the album b/c I didn't want to be duped again, but I did it and I'm very glad I did because you can tell she had more creative reign on this album, and she is coming into her own.  Every song on a scale of 1-10:<BR>1.Harlem's Nocturne [Intro] - 10 (Great intro,even the name of it is beautiful.)<BR>2.Karma-9 (This song has a phat beat with gorgeous strings in the background.  It's a club banger which is something I am not used to hearing from her)<BR>3.Heartburn-10 (This Timbaland produced track is definitely one of the highlights of the album.  It is very old school, it reminds you of the Supremes and the lyrics are great)<BR>4.If I Were Your Woman/Walk On By- 9 (At first I did not like this one because it was not as good as the original, but after listening a few times you can see she puts her own stamp on it and it turns into a nice club joint)<BR>5.You Don't Know My Name - 10 (The first single, the thing that made me buy the album.  Not much to say except it is a beautiful love song)<BR>6.If I Ain't Got You- 10 (This is a fiery blues joint.  Alicia's iano playing is great on this, and this is probably her best vocal performance ever)<BR>7.Diary-10 (Probably my favorite track on the album.  The melody is gorgeous and the vocals are so seductive)<BR>8.Dragon Days-9 (This is another track that took a while to get used to.  I thought it was wierd at first but now I love it.  It's very funky)<BR>9.Wake Up-10 (This is a Motown style song through and through.  The beackground vocals are very nice on this.  You can tell how influenced she was by that period)<BR>10.So Simple-8 (This song is pretty good.  I like the voice distortion, it's very Kanye-esque. It's a nice listen, but nothing too special.)<BR>11.When You Really Love Someone-10 (This is classic Alicia doing the sound that made her.  Excellent song, nice lyrics.)<BR>12.Feelin' Me, Feelin' You-8 (This is a nice interlude.  I love how her interludes are music and not silly convos.)<BR>13.Slow Down-6 (This is my least favorite song on the album.  It sounds like a Mary J. Blige throwaway.  Why this was included I don't know.)<BR>14.Samsonite Man-9 (This is a pretty mellow song.  Good lyrics about a man who is a rolling stone)<BR>15.Nobody Not Really-10 (Why oh why wasn't this a whole song?!?  It is so beautiful, it is reminiscent of Marvin Gaye.  Alicia definitely needs to do more of this music on her next album which I am already looking forward to.)<br />So there you have it.  An excellent album that I was *quite* surprised with, and I look forward to hearing the next one.
0316666343|5.0|I think the vast media attention to crime and serial killers is a shame, so when I read the back cover of this popular book I thought, &quot;Oh, no!&quot;<br />The book was not about evil so much as about loss, regret and caring for others. The main character was such a much loved child, and her sweet portrait is so fully drawn, that it is hard to read her story and not be left feeling hopeful.<br />The narrative carries you along in the same way as a good mystery novel does.<br />This book is entertaining and involving.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard Evanescence's song &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;, in the car, and I knew immediately that this was a band in a cattegory of its own. Its heavy metal guiter and drums are balanced by Amy Lee's saprano voice and the piono. I never thought that I was really one for this kind of music, but when I heard it I got hooked. Amy Lee doesn't try to add things to her voice that it hasn't got (endless trill, ups and downs, etc.) and the overall effect is better for it. <br />This CD is also very truthful in the pain that goes along with life, and it has a lot of emotion to it. I think that it might be cool for Lee to sing a happy song once and a while, but other than that she's fine. <br />A warning to people who might buy it: it takes a certain kind of person to like this kind of music, so if you're considering buying t, it might be better to listen to the sample songs first.I suggest that you listen to My Immmortal, Bring Me to Life, and Haunted. It might give you the basic idea of their style.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Kathryn and Sebastian are actually step-siblings in the movie. Kathryn refers to Sebastian as \\"dear brother\\". And near the beginning of the movie Kathryn said, \\"The parental units called while you were out.\\" Sebastian replies, \\"How is your gold-digging w***e of a mother enjoying Bali?\\" To which Kathryn responds, \\"She suspects that your impotent, alcoholic father is d*ddling the maid.\\"<br />\\"Cruel Intentions\\" (1999, directed by Roger Kumble)  was adapted from the 1782 French novel \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" by Choderlos de Laclos.  If \\"Cruel Intentions\\" seems a bit familiar, the Glenn Close, John Malkovich picture \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" (1988, directed by Stephen Frears) was based on the same book and the characters have similar names with an almost parallel plot.<br />Cruel Intentions begins with Sebastian Valmot (played by Ryan Phillippe) in a session with his therapist.  After he leaves, the therapist's daughter calls and tells her mother the things a guy she met told her.  Sebastian said the same things to the therapist only moments before.<br />Sebastian and his stepsister, Kathryn Merteuil (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) make a bet:  Sebastian has to take the virginity of Annette Hargrove (played by Reese Witherspoon) before school starts in the fall.  If he is unsuccessful, Kathryn gets his most prized possession, his 1956 Jaguar Roadster.  If he is successful, get his to sleep with Kathryn.  Sebastian also has to 'deflower'  Cecile Caldwell (played by Selma Blair) because Kathryn's ex-boyfriend, Court Reynolds, is interested in her.<br />As Sebastian sends more time with Annette, he really begins to care about her and falls in love with her, however, he is not free from Kathryn's manipulative ways.  She convinces him that she was only using him and that because of her, he gave up the only person he has ever loved.<br />Sebastian gives his journal to Annette because it is the only way he can apologize because she refuses to see him.  When he is walking by Annette's apartment building, Ronald Clifford (played by Sean Patrick Thomas), who is in love with Cecile, spots Sebastian and wished to confront him about the tryst with Cecile.  Before Sebastian can explain, Ronald, who is also caught up in Kathryn's web of deceit, starts throwing punches.  When Annette tries to intervene, she is thrown into a busy street with a cab coming right at her.  Sebastian pushes her out of the way and is hit by the cab.  Sebastian and Annette profess their love to each other.<br />At his funeral, Kathryn attempts to eulogize her stepbrother, but many of the students start walking out of the church.  She tries to continue, but more students walk out.  Curiosity gets the best of her and she walks out, too.  Once outside, Cecile hands her a copy of Sebastian's journal, inside is the truth about the bet to bed Annette and the plot to turn Cecile into a tramp.  Also, he has pages about Kathryn, calling her \\"Benedict B***h:  Kathryn's Backstabbing World of Friendship\\" and her cocaine problem.  Headmaster Hargrove opens her rosary to reveal the cocaine inside, while all the students look on.  The movie closes with Annette driving Sebastian's roadster with flashbacks to times they spent together.<br />This isn't actually the film that Ryan and Reese met on.  They met at her 21st birthday party (March 1997) and began dating shortly after that.  \\"Cruel Intentions\\" was released in 1999, the same year that Ryan and Reese were married and their daughter, Ava Elizabeth, was born.<br />This movie is one of my favorites, as is \\"American Beauty\\".  Take away the money (prep school, roadster, designer clothes), and I think that there are quick a few people, mostly high school and college students, that can probably relate to this movie.

0689835604|5.0|this is a beautiful and educational little book that i highly recommend.  once your baby finds his/her bellybutton,  he/she may want to sing drum tunes or play drums.  for this, find a very fun bilingual picturebook (4-8)called, DRUM,CHAVI,DRUM!/TOCA,CHAVI,TOCA! (it's written in both Spanish and English!) and when your baby is in middle grade,he/she may want to check out every book by LEMONY SNICKET.  But of course,finding his/her bellybutton comes first!
0786122234|5.0|This guy loaned me his copy, in his tepid way enthusiastic about it.  I devoured it wholly.  Karma brought me to this book (bought my own copy, thanks) and I'll fondly remember that guy because of it.  To the author, a posthumous thank you Mr. Toole for creating my friend Ignatius and for your brilliant vocabulary and your skillful use of it.  Amen.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the best and most important album of 2003.  Forget the White Stripes.  When it comes to music at its most underground, you really can't look any further than Britney Spears.  I didn't think she could get any better than &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U,&quot; but she totally outdoes herself on this CD.  My favorite song is &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; with Madonna.  Yeah, I know she kissed Britney, but that doesn't mean she's a lesbian.  She did it for shock, and you fools fell for it.  Anyway, the rest of this album is awesome!  Buy it today!  I'm not kidding you, here.  You will NOT be disappointed!
0767811070|5.0|This is an emotional, educational, smart, and realistic movie about one of America&iexcl;¯s biggest problems: poverty. For such a wealthy nation America has some serious poverty issues. This film highlights that in a way I have never seen before or after.<br />I wish more people watched this movie. It could do a lot of good. This is such an educational movie yet it rarely feels like it&iexcl;¯s preaching to you. The message is simple. There is too much poverty and thus violence in the ghetto. People just don&iexcl;¯t seem to care enough.<br />I will not mention the plot, see above for that, but must say that Cuba Gooding Junior and Lawrence Fishburne are excellent together. Also, Ice Cube does a great job as an actor, playing a key role. What I will say about the plot is that it is slow-building and then explosive for the last twenty minutes. What I also found interesting were the little scenes mixed in with the plot. There are some great side scenes, for example in one scene Furious (Fishburne) takes his son and his friend to Compton to tell them about gentrification and how people devalue property in the ghetto then buy it up cheap and sell it at a profit.<br />All in all this is a riveting movie that you must have in your collection.
B00005AAFS|2.0|I don't like Rammstein. It's not the kind of music I listen to. But if you like buy it! Cuz it's from Germany! *hehe*
B00005JLSE|5.0|But I love great work, and this is a great movie.  Rob Marshall has taken the Bob Fosse musical to the screen with such imaginative direction, editing and choreography that he has made it his own.  Not a copy of Fosse, but a nod to him while being fresh and new.   Fast on its feet and clever as hell, it benefits from great original material that is funny, sexy and smart.<br />The surprising cast of Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Latifah, Gere and Reilly are uniformly terrific.  Who knew John C. Reilly has a beautiful Irish tenor?  They all learned their chops and performed them admirably.<br />I applaud Rob Marshall  not only for the  clever and imaginative construct of constantly cutting back and forth from \\"real\\" sets to stage, and the rapid razzle dazzle of the editing and direction throughout, but also for bringing the picture in at 107 minutes.  Many directors today do not know how and when to end their films and they go on and on forever passing a half dozen places they could have ended it (the exception being Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films that are actually better in the extended versions).  Chicago gets right to it and never lets up. <br />As I titled this review, I am usually not a big fan of musicals, but this film blew me away.  Just great work throughout and it is a real MOVIE, not a filmed play.  For once in a long while, I can't argue with the Best Picture awarded this film.  Five stars all the way.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I am quite fond of Alien 3 narratively and visually, but also recognize it as a departure from what had been set up in the first two films.  I will also admit to the utter dissapointment I felt when I first saw Alien Resurrection in theaters (but have warmed to it over the last six years - mainly for its visual presentation being the best of the series and having Ron Perlman in it), but this is an amazing DVD set.<br />In the mold of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions this set gives you everything Alien you could ever want.  All the movies are digitally restored and presented beautifully (highlighting the look of Alien Resurrection against the other three when viewed back to back to back to back).  There are two versions of every film (commentaries on each version by cast and crew - noted absences are Fincher, Weaver, and Khondji) and even though the original theatrical releases are ultimately the better, more balanced and paced cuts in every case it is interesting to see some of the deleted scenes worked back into the films.  And the supplemental materials go on forever.<br />Alien is a masterpiece.  Aliens is a close second (close).  Alien 3 is an intriguing work almost apart from the series.  And Alien Resurrection is not without merit.  That said this collection makes even the more difficult moments of the third and fourth films worth watching again and gives us a greater appreciation for Ridley Scott's vision and James Cameron's extrapolation of that original vision.<br />Cameron's commentary is not to be missed.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Ok sure this isn't what most fans were expecting DT to put out but i think it's just one more success they have chalked up. Back when Portnoy was asked about the type of format for this CD would be, He said it was gonna be more &quot;back to the basics&quot; type of rock like the old metallica feel to it. The way i'd put it is this a &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; CD they wanted to just rock and lay off the &quot;story formated&quot; stuff they had put out on the last two CDs. Iv been a DT fan since they were &quot;majesty&quot; and they amaze me every time they put out a cd, each one might sound in some way like the other but has it's own flavor which hooks you and makes play them till the cds wears out. I think the CD is exellent in its own and is just one more showing of dream theaters many upon many arsenal of musical abillity they posses.
B000001C6M|5.0|I didn't get introduced to Slayer until I had heard &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Seasons of the Abyss&quot; some time back, and since then I backtracked through the rest of Slayer's catalog.  Admittedly I'm not as fond of Slayer's early recordings on Metal Blade as I am of they're albums on American Recordings, but I found myself pleasently surprised with the furious guitar work and well put together musicianship on they're debut album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;; and Slayer certainly doesn't here.  From the opening tack &quot;Evil Has No Boundaries&quot; on, you are thrown head first into the beginnings of one of the greatest, most controversial, and most well respected bands to ever hit the metal scene.  Standout tracks include &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, &quot;Die By the Sword&quot;, &quot;Metal Storm/Face the Slayer&quot;, and the title track, but the real highlight of &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; is the incredibly tight guitar work of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman.  All in all, if you are into true heavy metal or thrash, consider this essential listening.
B00004XOWM|5.0|SOrry for mistakes-at first:))!! I don't understand why you are all dislike this great album? I don't really like BILL and SIGNIFICANT OTHER(except some good song's), actually i didn't even know that LB exists before bying this CD, but when i bought this CD- i was surprised. I like this album so much. Comparing Starfish with REsults may vary-Starfish is a perfect album!!!! And maybe this is the best album, that i've ever heard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMFR|1.0|OK, let's see, the tag line is \\"Everything that has a beginning has an end.\\" So what is this really saying to us? Basically I see it as an excuse to make the movie: we began it, therefore we need to end it. This is even more uncreative as \\"Every saga has a beginning.\\"<br />Most of the movie is a killer action sequence - the machines boring down into Zion and killing people. Sure, it's spectacular effects, but it even gets dull after a while, when you realize the battle is futile and they have to defeat them another way. They could have made that point in just one quick scene. <br />I like stories where I actually care for the people. When one of the main characters dies (I won't say which one. If you've seen it, you probably know which one I mean), the only reason I felt bad was because I was laughing. I think I was supposed to be sad. But I'll never know.<br />Memorable lines: \\"It ends tonight!\\" \\"We all know I'm the one that BEATS you.\\" That's about it.<br />If they put in this movie as much character as they did computer effects and action, it may have been decent. I did think it was interesting that they brought in the idea (from \\"Reloaded\\") that \\"we need machines and they need us\\" for the conclusion. But even that was stretching it.<br />One final comment: someone I know, *who has never seen the movie or heard anything about the plot or conclusion* said this in joking: \\"I think it would be funny if the computers and the humans actually work together and become friends. That way the people could still go into the matrix for vacations and stuff. ...but I know they'd never put that in the movie. That would be too silly.\\"
0767805712|3.0|I think this movie is slightly overrated. The acting is not bad, camerawork not bad, but it's not excellent either. The dialogs are not really realistic -too many functional dialogs- and most characters are quite 'flat'. Don't understand me wrong, it's not a bad movie, but it's moralistic undertone probably caused it to become slightly overrated (just like movies like American History X).
B000001OAA|5.0|Shirley Manson who wrote the lyrics speaks from the heart on pain and loss.  Her throaty vocals are impressive, she moves from a silent whisper of a secret to a controlled yet unadulterated release.  The music is moody, hard and edgy at times but others time soft and brooding.  The music and feeling is comparable to early Smashing Pumpkins or RHCP's Californification album.  In my opinion no female lead singer of any band in popular music today is as expressive or deep with her voice as Shirley.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|&quot;Lost dogs&quot; is as interesting as let's say their new album.why? you might say - b-sides are left as rare tracks because they didn't fit on regular albums.<BR>this might be true if they were made by other bands but Pearl jam proved that almost anything they will touch it turns into gold.both discs are truly amazing.<BR>there are too many songs to mention.as many other reviews were telling - it's simply stunning<BR>it is really hard to believe that these songs were once sessions outtakes...
B0000DD7NL|1.0|I like Alicia Keys.  I think she is a wonderful singer/songwriter.  But this album is not good at all.  I was dissapointed.  On a scale of 1-5 I will rate each song for you. 1-poor 2- alright 3-good 4-decent 5-great<br />1. Harlem's Nocturne-2<br />2. Karma- 1<br />3. Heartburn-1<br />4. If I was your woman/walk on by-4<br />5. You don't know my name-5<br />6. If I aint got u-5<br />7. Diary-5<br />8. Dragon Days-1<br />9. Wake up-2<br />10. So Simple-3<br />11. When u really love someone-2<br />12. Feeling u feeling me (Interlude) I don't rate those<br />13. Slow Down-2<br />14. Samsonite Man-1<br />15. Nobody Really-1<br />This is not her best work at all.  I still enjoy her music, but I really believe that her first single is her strongest one.  She might get away with tracks 4, 6, and 7 but that's it.  The next album, I won't be so quick to get it just because the first single was good.  The DVD section, I though was pretty good.  It was nice to see Alicia Keys behind the scenes.  It's always nice to see artists behind the secens to see how they really are.<br />At any rate.  I wouldn't spend my money on this album unless you are just a huge fan and don't really care.  But I think she could have done a whole lot better with this album. So my recommendation is, borrow it from someone before you buy it.
B000002J2F|3.0|this album sounds impressing when compared to epic art-rock &quot;And then there were three&quot; (their previous release).&quot;Duke&quot; has much more modern sound to it,experiments with new technics and instruments (drum machines,midi-guitars) and slightly different arranges.transition is huge.but the fact is that the things that worked so good on &quot;Abacab&quot; are sounding here not as great...<BR>Do not get me wrong - &quot;Behind the lines&quot;,&quot;duchess&quot; or &quot;Man of our times&quot; are simply stunning.Phil screams his lungs out while the rest of band is giving an interesting background.but with addition of some slow (and boring) ballads wihtout that something that ballads had on &quot;And then there were three&quot; are not leaving the best impression.&quot;Missunderstanding&quot; is not the best song too.some progressive elements are putten here like they were thinking &quot;well,we can't go to much modern beacuse tey will stop liking us&quot;.that no spontanic parts of &quot;Duke&quot; are making it much weaker effort compared even to &quot;Invisible touch&quot;.although many fans claim that it is their best,i have not that fine impressions.<BR>if i could say something about it in few words i would say - good album but not breathtaking at all.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love the storyline because it teaches children things. Also the characters are great.  The turtle reminded me of a surfer guy. Doreen was my favorite character.  To me she made the movie all fit together.
B00005JMD3|2.0|Clark Johnsons action adventure starts off with a \\"save the hostages, kill the bad guys\\" mission where SWAT members Jim Street (Colin Farrel) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) break all the rules to save the day. However Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter) relegates them to the gun cage for doing the \\"wrong\\" thing. Gamble leaves on bad terms with his former partner but Street works his way through six months in the cage to be picked on Sgt. Hondo's (Sam L. Jackson)new swat team, along with LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt.<br />Their Mission? To escort wanted billionaire Alex Montel (Oliver Martinez) to jail. However when Montel offers $100 million to who ever can bust him out, the new team have their hands full.<br />In a film like this, you need to have action scenes that blow you away and snappy one liners, but SWAT fails to deliver. Instead theres alot of training sequences and attempted character building.<br />The action only really kicks in the last half hour and its nothing to write home about. <br />While the rest of the cast are very \\"I got your Back\\", Farrel plays more mature and almost makes the film worth watching. Almost. Farrel has so much talent he should pick btter films thatn this and The Recriut. Hopefully \\"Alexander\\" will shape him into the actor he so nearly is.<br />Dont go to see this. It is a waste of time and money.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|I love A.Keys album I think it takes you back in time when music wasn't commercial.  I love her new found energy that she brings to this album she shows that she's for real.  That she wants to be taken seriously.  Great job!
B00005JM9C|4.0|It seems that about once each decade there is a dance movie that captures the popular imagination, an &quot;Honey&quot; is definitely an attempt to be in the mold of &quot;Saturday Night Fever,&quot; &quot;Flashdance,&quot; and &quot;Dirty Dancing.&quot;  Unfortunately while &quot;Honey&quot; is entertaining, and has some minor moments with regards to the dancing, it is not going to end up being in the league of those contemporary classics.  Still, from the dancing perspective, &quot;Honey&quot; does come out ahead of &quot;Save the Last Dance,&quot; but that is because Jessica Alba does more of the actual dancing than Julia Styles.  However, she does not do enough of it and the routines are not as exciting as they should be.<br />The story is rather incidental, because it is just an excuse to have people legitimately dancing as opposed to the musical tradition where people suddenly break into song and dance.  Honey Daniels (Alba) wants to be a dancer.  She works at a record store by dance and tends bar at a club at night, and when she goes off shift she struts her stuff on the dance floor.  Honey also finds time to teach hip-hop dance classes at the local center.  A toadie working for big name video director  Michael Ellis (David Moscow) records her on the dance floor and he brings her in to save the day on a video shoot.  The next thing we know Honey is not just dancing, she's doing choreography.  Her big dream is not to be the next Paula Abdul, but to open up a real dance studio for the kids in the hood.  Ellis derails Honey's plains, but the girl has got spunk, and, as everybody who has seen the ads for this movie knows, a pretty impressive guardian angel.  The problem with the story is the director character of Michael Ellis.  His idea of directing is a joke and I find it hard to believe that he is fooling every single one of these artists, except for the fact the story got written that way.  But none of that would have mattered if the dancing had been presented a lot better.<br />The character of Honey has lots of minor interpersonal problems that provide some breadth but not true depth of character, such as getting successful while staying tight with her best girl Gina (Joy Bryant), putting up with all the negative vibes from her mother (Lonette McKee), hooking up with Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) the barber, and keeping an eye out for brothers Benny (Lil' Romeo) and Raymond (Zachary Williams), who are a couple of at risk kids in the neighborhood.  For those who showed up to see what Jessica Alba is like without the barcode they will see some strong similarities with Max from &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in that Alba's best moments are when she is acting the big sister.  Whether dealing with escapees from Manticore or the kids in the hood, she connects with them.  Her best scenes are with the kids and her dance class.<br />The fault with this movie is not with the cast or even with the writers, the latter being excused because if you want to make a good dance movie the story is not as important as the actual dancing, so you if you want to go back and pull out the Andy and Judy bit about the kids putting on a show, that is not necessarily a bad thing.  The problem with &quot;Honey&quot; is that the dancing is not as great as it should be.  Honey is involved in a bunch of music videos, all of which involve real hip hop stars including Tweet, Ginuwine, Shawn Desman, Jadakiss &amp; Sheek, Rodney Jerkins, and Silkk.  But the presentation of the dancing almost always is less than inspiring.  The initial scenes of Honey in the club set up things nicely, but director Bille Woodruff, a popular video director, must have really been aware that this was a big screen motion picture because there are only bits and pieces of flair for most of the movie.  The fault is not with the choreography of Luther A. Brown and Laurie Ann Gibson, but with the way Woodruff is presenting things.  We never seem to be getting an entire dance routine, just bits and pieces.  The best set piece is probably the one with Ginuwine and the kids, but all we get is part of a rehearsal and the camera angles and cuts do little to enhance our enjoyment of the routine.<br />Another part of the problem is that halfway through the film, Alba pretty much stops dancing as she turns into a choreographer.  A great dance movie is predicated on the star doing the dancing, whether we are talking Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly or John Travolta and Patrick Swayze.  Jennifer Beals can fool us with a body double, but that is not going to work twice, as Julia Stiles discovered.  The proof of the pudding here is in the final credits, where we get to see a complete music video (&quot;directed&quot; by &quot;Honey Daniels&quot;) and we are all sitting in the theater saying, &quot;Yeah, we wanted to see more stuff like that!&quot;  A lot of people are going to enjoy this film, but most of those people are going to know that this could have been a lot better and that the fault here is not that of Alba but of Woodruff.  How ironic that the credits for this film show us how what had been good could have been great.pieces.

B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The test of a popular band is the second CD, and whether the band can create something fresh without straying too far. The Strokes' second album, &quot;Room on Fire,&quot; manages to achieve that, avoiding the feared sophomore slump after their debut &quot;Is This It.&quot;<br />There's a noticeable branch-out in several tracks, where it sounds like the Strokes are poking into new territory (such as the bouncy, slithering &quot;Reptilia&quot; and the smoother, melodious &quot;12:51&quot;), while sticking close to what made them famous to start with (the insanely catchy &quot;I Can't Win&quot; ).<br />Television, Cars and other influences surface briefly and smoothly in this album, never enough so that the influences seem slavish or imitative. Julian Casablancas's heavily-accented voice weaves in and out of the heavy guitar riffs, telling us of his unfortunate love life (poor guy) and how &quot;I wanna be forgotten!&quot; Often Casablancas lapses out altogether (like in &quot;Meet Me In The Bathroom&quot;), and the leaping guitar riffs get a chance to shine.<br />It doesn't burst in by surprise the way &quot;Is This It&quot; did, but &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is still appealing and a rollicking good listen. An appealing and memorable album that retro-rock fans should definitely check out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Britney's \\"Rumours\\". She has crafted a suberb, fun album, and for the first time, it contains no filler. Each song is a masterpiece in its own right, but when the songs are put together, they create a smooth, flowing album that is picture perfect in every way. It's candy for your ears. I love listening to it. The album may be criticized for being too sexy, but I find it more sensual than anything, and nowhere near as raunchy as Miss Aguilera. <br />Everyone, including non-fans, needs to buy this album. The best song is \\"Toxic\\", ITZ's second single. It's absolutely incredible.<br />Thank you, Britney, for hitting us one more time. :-)
B000065VB9|5.0|The other 5-Star reviews have said it all, really, I'm not sure what I could add.  There are not many rock recordings that qualify as &quot;art&quot; (and art endures, it is eternal) but this is one.  At less than $15.00, practically the cost of a movie ticket now, you really should get this un-named work.<br />What strikes me about this recording is that so many of the songs are about outsiders, social outcasts, failures, opponents of the regime, the Other and all that.  Intruders, assassins, citizens without their papers, psychiatric patients, angry people in tree tops, etc., populate these songs.<br />&quot;September, '77, Port Elizabeth, weather fine.  It was business as usual, in police room 619&quot;.<br />It's a dark scary world out there, and he's right.  It's only gotten scarier since 1980.<br />[Sidenote:  this recording always makes me think of John Lennon's first solo work &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; that came out in 1970 (compare the photo on the back of Lennon's Album with the front of this one), but whereas Lennons songs are introspective, Gabriel's are more outward looking.  Two great works of art however.]
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to confess that the first time I heared this album I felt horrible. I thought 'If I could turn back time I wouldn't buy this CD&quot;. But after 3 or 4 listenigs I started to like it. As I have read in another review on this site, this CD is really different from the music you've already heared from Britney, but in a way, it's still good. I especially like 'Brave new Girl' wich is an overdigitalized track, Britney's voice is like a robot's, but at the same time it always makes me happy. For overall, the songs could be very entertaining when you do your studies or drive a car, etc. So if you're a big fan of Britney (like me), buy this album. Altough I know Britney can sing much better than this.
6304414145|4.0|The main reason why this film was so good is mainly because of Gary Senise who is one of the best actors in modern films. Do you notice how his eyebrows are perfect for the vilain character he plays. The eyebrows make him look really mean and always pissed off. lol. He was also great in reindeer games with Charlize Theron and Ben Affleck. The other actors were great in Ransom, such as Liev Shreiber and Lili Taylor. The only flaw was the occasional overacting by Mel and Rene. And they could have upped a notch on the excitement level as far as grattiude when they got Sean back. After all they thought he was dead. But to find him alive again, is like a second chance kinda like a miracle. And all they did was hug him and get teary eyed with an I LOVE YOU. But when he was kidnapped they were hysterical and Rene threw up and screamed, and Mel looked like he was gonna jump off the roof when they thought the kidnapper shot Sean over the phone during the argument causing him a little fit of rage so he pretended to shoot him. The ending was fun and added some more tension and wonder. It was pretty clever to shoot the kidnappers and pretend to be the hero to save the boy and get the ransom at the same time and not get caught. Too bad Sean heard his voice and peed his pants. It gave him away obviously, and in the end the bad guys lose and no one got hurt!
B00005T7HG|4.0|I bought this movie because I had heard some of my colleagues at work talking about it. Like most movie depictions of real life events it's not entirely accurate but overall it was good movie. Well preformed, good casting (although they could've found someone else besides Antonio Banderas to play Che), and best of all I liked how they included footage of the real Eva Peron. However I also found the movie to be a bit long; over two hours. I suspect the intended audiance was not the general populas. I wouldn't recommend this movie for childern or anyone else with a short attention span.
B000006NPY|5.0|I have a very large collection of cd's. Out of all of them, this is my favorite. There have been many thimes I thought I listened to a cd better then this, such as when I bought Ok Computer by Radiohead or ( ) by Sigur Ros, but after a few days this cd just kept coming into my mind and it became my favorite all over again. Billy Corgan has written his most personal lyrics ever, along with sone of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. Crestfallen remains one of my favorite songs of all time, and most of the songs on this cd would rank among some of my favorite Pumpkins songs.<br />When I first put in this cd, which was 2 years from the time I have written this review, I had no idea what to expect. I had heard it was more mellow then MCATIS or Simese Dream, but I didm't care because it was songs like Disarm, Crush, Galapogos, To Forgive, In the Arms of Sleep, that made me love the Pumpkins above all other bands. But when I skimmed through the first minute of each song like I always do when I get a new cd, I was amazed at what I was hearing. No, it wasn't what I had expected. It was a whole lot more. That night I listened to the whole thing front to back and it instantly became my favorite cd ever, over Machina, which I had gotton a week before Adore. The songs were so much more then I had thought they'de be. I had figured they would be manily acoustic songs, which I would of loved, but there was a new instrument which I had knew nothing about. The synthesizer. It made you feel like you were floating in space, in songs like Appels and Oranjes, and Daphne Desends. Also, I absoutely loved the electronic drums, which most people hated. I love Jimmy Chamberlin, he is the best drummer of the 90's along with Matt Cameron, but the cd would not feel the same without the sound of the electronic drums.<br />This cd changed the way I listened to music. I would of never had the patience to listen to Radiohead or Sigur Ros or even attempt to listen to them if I hadn't heard this cd. It made me discover that music was more then a 4 piece band with a drummer, guitarist, bassist, and vocalist. Music was more then how good you can play a solo, how high your songs got on the charts, or how fast and heavy you can be. Music was about how the song made you feel inside. Buy this cd and let it take you to places you've never been.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|How do you follow an album that had four top five singles? How do you follow an album that sold twelve million copies world-wide? Let's admit it people- Pink's latest album, &quot;M!ssundaztood&quot; was such a huge sucess that it would be hard to expect too much of &quot;Try This&quot;. I didn't, and I must say I was pleasently surprised. This album is an in your face, kick [..] album- just like Miss. Pink herself.<BR>1. Trouble- This is a great song- maybe not the best choice for first single, but a great kick-off for the album. The bridge sounds sort of 60's though- it's good but doesn't seem to fit the beat of the rest of the song. The video is the best video I've seen in a long time. &quot;Trouble&quot; is a stiff at radio, but first singles aren't always an indication of how the album will do. For example, Christina Aguilera's &quot;Stripped&quot; is being reported as one of the top five best selling albums of 2003, but the catchy first single &quot;Dirrty&quot; was a huge flop. Grade- A.<br />2. God Is A DJ- This is a standout track. It's the second single, though it should have been the first. Off the wall chorus, and funny lines such as &quot;I've been the girl- middle finger in the air&quot; and &quot;God wants you to get on the floor and shake that a**&quot; lol. Grade- A+.<br />3. Last to Know- Very good, though is sort of a song that you would expect from Pink- very ordinary. The chorus gets stuck in my head all the time. This might be the third single but I hope it isn't. Grade- A- because it's still great.<br />4. Tonight's the Night- the sequal to &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; but a heck of a lot better. The line &quot;Gotta get the h*** outa Hollywood cause every day here's halloween&quot; is so true. Wonderful music. Grade- A.<br />5. Oh My God ft. Peaches- Oh my god I love this song!! (No joke intended). Peaches's rap is so hot. When I heard that Peaches was on the song, I was like &quot;Whoa this is gonna be X- rated&quot;, but it's actuallynot too raunchy. Grade- A+.<br />6. Catch Me While I'm Sleeping- This is a beautiful ballad. The only thing I dislike about it is that despite its 5:03 running time, the verses end around the 3 minute mark and we get a 2 minute repitition of the chorus. Grade- B+.<br />7. Wating For Love- Oh God, Pink's vocals are amazing! So sweet and not scratchy at all (not that I don't love her &quot;smoker&quot; voice) on the verses and b-sides, and then so powerful on the chorus... Wow. A standout track. Grade- A.<br />8. Save My Life- Everyone seems to love this song, and I much as I like the lyrics and the message, the music is...average, for lack of a better word. Poorest track on the disc. Grade- B.<br />9. Try Too Hard- This is an amazing song with a message that will shut that little &quot;female dog&quot; with a tie (er...Avril Lavigne) up. I love the chorus, and it's kind of cool how Pink altered the chorus at the end so the critics can't acuse her of &quot;calling other artists but not herself fake&quot;. Grade- A.<br />10. Humble Neighborhoods- The rap verses and the &quot;weeeeeee don't wanna go home&quot; is cool, but something about the chorus greatly disturbs me. Other than that cool song. Grade- A-.<br />11. Walk Away- An awesome song that might be a single for it is very radio friendly. It's sort of a poppish rock song, but that's ok. I love the end. Grade- A.<br />12. Unwind- Pink really likes Janis Joplin, and you can tell. It has a really funny line- &quot;My life is like a fairy tale that nobody believes in&quot;. The chorus is great. It's sad that the woman this song is about died at 27 though. Grade- A.<br />13. Love Song- THE BEST SONG ON THE CD. Oh my god I love it!!! It's so sweet and subtle. The lyrics and the melody are outstanding. It's shortness is part of its charm. The perfect album closer. Grade- A++++++!<br />14. Hooker- Whoa. A hilarious song about all of the trashy pop stars in today's music industry. Keep this one away from kids though- sheuses the f word about as much as she breathes in this song lol. Although I must admit that the line- &quot;You ain't nothing but a hooker, sell your f***ing soul&quot; is pretty funny. <br />In conclusion, &quot;Try This&quot; is a fantastic album that I would recomend to anyone searching for an amazing CD by a talented young lady.
B0000A36J5|3.0|I just bought my SEECGS version of the Two Towers. The TTTEE-DVD is very cool. The added scenes really explains a lot of the story, in spite of the theatrical version. However, the extra added DVD shows a Smeagol statue which is very very well done! The Smeagol you get with the package is not! Whereas its the same statue!! I believe this might be due to the fact that they were made in enormous amounts, but still. I don't like it!

B0000C2IXO|2.0|McG got his start making music videos and that's clearly evident in this movie which only has about thirty seconds of screen time with no songs playing in the background. Not only that, but the movie really isn't a movie at all, but is more like a bunch of comical music videos lightly stiched together through a semi-decent plot. Besides the babes, the only thing good about the movie is the plot. Unfortunately, due to poor acting, editing, writing, and directing the plot is buried beneath landfill of pop-cultural mediocrity.<br /><br />The movie goes something like this. There is a list that contains all the files for people in the witness protection program on two separate titanium rings. These rings are worn by two separate individuals who have very little communication with each other. Some one is out to get the rings and make a profit and the Angels are called in to find out who and stop them.<br /><br />Bill Murray passed as Bosley on this one (Bernie Mac fills in as his adopted brother) and it's easy to see why. It's difficult to believe that this movie actually passes as entertainment. I mean, I thought the first movie was bad, but this film makes the first CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie look like a cinematic masterpiece. It's so sad, too. The series was much more intelligent and entertaining than either of the movies have been. Not only that, this film had a decent plot and could have made a decent movie. Alas, it wasn't too be. Instead, all we get is a film full of pretentious people who think they are funny and worth watching.<br /><br />I would have given this film only one star, but the premise that is presented in the plot was enough to make me give it one better. I don't recommend anyone buying this and unless you're a huge film fan and have two hours worth wasting, I wouldn't recommend renting it either.

B0000C6JUK|5.0|Being well acquainted with Sleeping With Ghosts, I decided it was high time I took a look at the Special Edition.<br />It is definately worth it.  Not only do you get the brilliant CD that is Sleeping With Ghosts, but you also get a CD containing some excellent covers, including Running Up That Hill (Kate Bush), Where is My Mind (The Pixies), I Feel You (Depeche Mode) and arguably the best cover Placebo has done on the entire CD, Bigmouth Strikes Again (The Smiths).  There's something about Bigmouth Strikes Again that really suits Placebo, and Brian Molko's voice really fits in quite nicely into the vocal line. <br />Admittedly, the enjoyment of the covers CD comes with knowing some of the tracks, however I don't think it's necessary.<br />All in all, definately worth buying instead of Sleeping with Ghosts, because you can get so much more Placebo, and hear some interesting interpretations.
B000005AYM|5.0|To the people who never heard this album yall are missing out on one of the best albums of all time. From one track to another there is a different story told. Not one of Erykah's songs sounds horrible. Here's a breakdown of her songs:<br />1. ^Rimshot (Intro)-I love this intro. Usually, intros ain't worth listening to, but this one puts you into the mood to listen to the cd. \\"A rimshot, hey, diggy diggy!\\"<br />2. ^*On & On-My favorite song on the album. Everyone should have heard this song if you're a devoted E. Badu fan. It has a clear and meaningful message. The video really accents this song. I wish she would make a DVD of her music videos!<br />3. ^*Apple Tree-My second favorite song. In the beginning, Erykah says \\"Knowledge is ifinite so it's fell infinitly on me.\\" I love that. The apple tree represents her knowledge and the apples are the words that she gives you. Listen to this if you ever need advice.<br />4. ^*Other Side Of The Game-Lovely, just lovely. The script has been flipped on this track. She talks about having her baby and the chorus serves as the main theme of the song, \\"Watcha gon' do when they come looking for you\\"<br />5. Sometimes... [Mix #9]-A taste of what's to come.<br />6. ^*Next Lifetime-She finds her true love but can't be with him because she's \\"already someone's girl.\\" I like that fact that she lets her songs go past 5 minutes to get her points across.<br />7. Afro [Freestyle Skit]-\\"You need to pick yo' afro daddy, because it's flat on one side.\\" It sounds funny at first but after listening to it for a couple of times, it makes you think.<br />8. ^Certainly-This is also my favorite song (believe it, I have two of them on this album). No one can rearrange her and talks about when she turns her back, someone tries to slip her a \\"mickey\\". Also, no one can tell her the time. I love it that she goes high at the end of the song to say that. The beat sounds old school.<br />9. 4 Leaf Clover-A remake nicely done. She makes it sound like her own. It's hard to catch her, she's like a lepricaun.<br />10. No Love-The name of the track says it all. I nice blow-off your b/g friend song.<br />11. Drama-6min song of the drama in her life. The struggles she faces and how sick of it she is.<br />12. Sometimes...-Now here is the song. Sometimes she doesn't \\"love you anymore\\", then sometimes she's \\"in love with you.\\" She chants Ye Yo in the beginning and in the middle which translates to mean mother.<br />13. ^Certainly [Flipped It]-A hot remix of Certainly. Has a different hook which makes this remix stand out. She actually sings diffrently on here, not her same vocals on a different beat.<br />14. Rimshot (Outro)-Sounds similar to the intro but starts out with her saying \\"thank you\\". It's a little longer than the Intro version.<br />A well-rounded, complete album that doesn't leave you feeling like something was missing. This is a classic. It's worth every damn dime.<br />(*Single)(^Appears on her Live Album)

B000069HK2|5.0|This CD is truly amazing. I wish I could catagorize it for all of you who need it to be spelled out,but I can't.It really is a sound like no other. Of course you could compare the vocals,or the guitar,to something you've heard before,but you've never heard it together, definitly not like this. Every element of music including bert's voice just go perfectly together making you feel dumb for a minute like, why did'nt this happen years ago. If you think you know what you like, think again this CD will open parts of your brain that you did'nt even know existed. <br />To all the teen-magazine-reading kids who only like the band for the lead-singer and for the videos and what you hear on the radio please get a life!!!
B00008ADPF|5.0|I think this Album is awsome. I love the song Someday. and stuff
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Despite the transparent reviews from the &quot;I'm too cool to like a popular artist, especially a beautiful one&quot; crowd, this album is worthy of all the rave reviews and high praise. It's obvious that Ms.Keys took the time to make a meaningful album, sales be damned. If you want to find the one diamond among the rough, of all the albums out there today, pick up The Diary of Alicia Keys. Pure soul, pure heart, pure thought provoking lyrics that reach out to the listener.
0380002930|5.0|The writing is so beautiful and the story is just so gripping, it wont let go of you. Now I hate books, I don't liek readng them at all, you can see I only review music, but this is a must read for anyone, really, I didn't want to read it but somehow it's like after a couple of chapters you're in the black hole called watership down. Read fro yourself
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I think this album would have been even better, maybe even the Beatles' best had &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot; been replaced with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; (two songs introduced/worked on during the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions.)  Just my 2 cents.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Since I have already reviewed this, one of America's greatest cinematic masterpieces, I will urge any and all to purchase this excellent packaging and presentation of John Huston's finest fictional hour (his war-time documentaries are his truest masterpieces).<br />Besides containing a pristine and vibrant transfer which makes the gorgeous silver, rainy-grey, cloud-white and jet black cinematography vibrate with rich detail, Warner Brothers has outdone themselves and bookended this classic film with a treasure trove of fantastic extras. <br />While the commentary by author Eric Lax is only so-so, the documentaries are brilliant and illumanitive- especially the biographical feature which alone makes this package a must have. Featuring interviews with the avuncular Huston himself as well has film clips and wonderful insights from his family and co-workers, this superb documentary celebrates one of Hollywood's true characters. Huston was a type of figure never to be seen again.<br />The behind the scenes documentary about the dramatic story behind the making of the film, narrated by John Milius (I would have appreciated his commentary more!)proves almost as entertaining as the feature itself. Short Subjects, Cartoons and trailers as well as a fascinating radio broadcast from 1949 featuring Bogie and Walter Huston rounds out the extras which make this a most certain must have DVD for all film fans.<br />Money well spent!
B00005JKC3|4.0|I'd cite some of the negative reviews of this movie as exhibit A for why so many action movies these days are so shallow and pointless--apparently, that's what many moviegoers prefer.  If some of the naysayers had gotten their way, we'd have two solid hours of the Hulk destroying things: See Hulk smash cars--now buildings--now tanks--now helicopters--now monsters.  What did we miss?  National landmarks?  Check out King Kong and Godzilla if you didn't get your fill in that department.  No, Hulk isn't perfect; but what a pleasant surprise to see a comic-book flick that trys to offer a bit more than a token storyline and endless eye-candy special effects.  <br />Let's face it, folks, the Hulk isn't much of a conversationalist; he doesn't dish out the witty repartee with his enemies that Batman and Spiderman do.  No fancy utility belt or vehicles, either.  He's just a big green guy whose special power is his knack for reducing his surroundings to rubble.  You've got to fill in the gaps between those crushfests with something of substance or what you end up with is akin to watching another person play a video game.<br />The original comic-book storyline for the Hulk wasn't anything earthshattering.  But within the parameters they had to work with, the filmmakers managed to put together a decent story (with a few new twists) which is bolstered by some pretty respectable acting all around.  The fact that the movie builds up to the fun stuff by laying down foundational material is, to some, an unpardonable sin.  But unless you resort to flashbacks, how else do you to develop the story and characters enough that the audience cares one bit about what happens to them?  If your answer is, \\"Who cares?\\" see my first paragraph.<br />I enjoyed the comic-book-style split screens and wipes (which some people were put off by) and thought they were deftly applied.  The techniques weren't overused and were mostly relegated to transitions and non-action sequences where they provided a spot of visual gee-whiz during otherwise slow moments.<br />So, why not five stars?  While I did enjoy the movie, there was room for improvement.  <br />For starters, the big climax was, well, a bit anticlimactic.  The final fight seemed too short and hardly gave you a chance to appreciate the unique powers of the Hulk's adversary. (WARNING: spoiler coming in the next sentence) Also, how in the world could they choose an ending in which a no-name fighter jockey is the one who defeats the bad guy and saves the protagonist?  Isn't that Filmmaking 101 stuff?<br />Actor Eric Bana may have brought the \\"hunk\\" factor to the role of Bruce Banner, but I felt there was something missing from the part.  Banner's character seemed detached (which was fine), but I didn't get the sense there was great turmoil bubbling under the surface--just a lot of blank spots in his childhood memory bank.  He needed to portray more internal conflict and less blank confusion due to repressed memories.  <br />Even the Hulk himself seemed a little placid at times.  Once or twice he could have benefited from a transfusion of rage.  In fairness, this may be truer to Stan Lee's original vision than what I would have prefered.  Lee says in one of the featurettes that he was inspired, in part, by Frankenstein--not a rampaging monster, rather a creature who basically just wanted to be left alone but for the pesky villagers who kept harassing him.<br />The Hulk did look remarkably lifelike and shows off the state of the art in humanoid CGI work (which is still less than perfect).  But I don't understand why they put such a (relatively) whimpy chest on an otherwise massive character.  Criminy, he's the Hulk--give the guy some pecs to match the rest of his physique.  Oh, and his four-mile \\"hops\\" were even more physics defying than his ability to grow 15 feet tall yet still retain his Bruce-Banner-sized pants.  But, ok, this is the realm of comic books, so we'll give it to him.<br />Another minor quibble--I thought director Ang Lee's decision to don the black suit with polka dots used for the motion-capture filming was less inspired than the crew seemed to think in the making-of featurette.  It may have helped Lee capture the Hulk's more poignant moments, but it was less effective in some of the action sequences.  Lee, for all his enthusiasm, is no athlete, and--if you watch closely--it's evident in a couple of the scenes.  At times, the Hulk's movements looked, um, less than Hulk-Hoganesque.  Nothing too glaring, but Lee should have turned the suit over to a stuntman or pro wrestler for the action shots.  (Hey, we want our boy to look his best when he's out kickin' fanny.)<br />But on balance, Hulk delivers pretty solid entertainment for a comic-book film and is a worthy addition to the body of work born of Stan Lee's forty-year-old brainchild.  If you're looking for camp and non-stop action, go watch the Batman sequels.  If you want action at the expense of character development, go watch the first X-men movie.  But if you want a well-acted, intelligible storyline punctuated with some rather impressive visual effects, pull up a chair.  Three-and-a-half stars (rounded up to four).
0812550757|5.0|This is a very well written book which explores human social relationships with each other and with other cultures in depth. It begins a little slowly, having to establish the complex world within which everything takes place. This is not a simple book and not for kids. If you are young, read Ender's Game, not this. This book has nothing to do with Ender's Game except that the author felt he could make it a stronger book by using Ender. However, that does not make it a bad book. It is to be understood at a different level than Ender's Game was.... a higher level. Enjoy it if you can, but this book is not right for everyone.
0385512104|4.0|That book is the tale of a young boy, Christopher who suffers Dawn syndrome. I heard somebody talking about the story telled in this book is false as Asprenger syndrom doesn't produce such behaviour as the ones described in the book. But I think that's not the point. Mark Haddon gives us the portrayal of a &quot;not normal&quot; boy, of his ideas and links and connections he makes among them. The author writed the book as though it is written by Christopher. He tells about him discovering his courage by making a journey we would say incredibly easy, but wich is incredibly hard and scary for him.<BR>I definetly suggest this book to everyone.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I think enough time has passed, enough reviews have been written, and the verdict should now be delivered by the jury. No need to stand, you can enjoy this while sitting.<BR>   First of all, it would be prudent to gather the charges here and present them in a nutshell, so we can see if there's indeed truthfullness in them.<BR>   The Strokes are being charged by many a folk, for:<BR>-Being unoriginal<BR>-Shamelessly copying bands from 30 years ago (with Velvet        Underground being the obvious one)<br />-Making one song and then changing it slightly around to have a total of eleven<BR>-Being yet another concocted band of the music industry<BR>-Being 80% image, 15% marketing, 5% music<BR>-Doing what countless bands have done before in a mediocre way<BR>-Adding nothing new to their genre of music except 4 pairs of stoned-washed jeans<BR>-Meaningless lyrics<BR>-Sinking the rock ship further down the abyss<BR>-Being untalented musicians with connections<BR>-Being spectacularly overrated <br />Incredibly, all the above charges hold more than their fair share of truth and accuracy. And it doesnt even take too much of an experienced listener to attest to all this. Anyone with a general knowledge of music (especially rock, of course) can easily see the Strokes for what they are, and i think, the term that would best describe them would be : terribly unoriginal.<br />    Yes, there are those who would say &quot;hey, you can be unoriginal and still be good!&quot;. That's true and should be taken into consideration. But the Strokes, are not good either which, in turn, borders the edges of a musical crime. Which, in turn again, wouldnt be all that bad had it not been for all the media bombardment about the &quot;next big thing&quot;. This stinks with despair of course, because if they need to shove something so &quot;done before 10.000 better&quot; down our throats then rock as a scene must really be on its dying legs (i hope this proves to be wrong, but i'm not optimistic).<br />    This is actually what annoys me most about the Strokes. Not that they are simply very mediocre, but all the hype that surrounds them. And, while this may not be their fault (the hype part), by now I have developed giant defenses against things being shoved down my throat. Mostly like everyone else, i've been victimised like that in the past and have learned my lessons all too well to fall for such cheap gimmicks again.<BR>    I advise you to do the same. <BR>     In a note of further justice, i'll say this: it is obvious that not only at this point, but since decades now, a lot of copying has been occuring, and after all, musicians are always going to &quot;use&quot; formulas others used to express themselves. Interpol, for example, are a band of a myriad influences without being a mere carbon copy of others. But this is 2003, and with rock nearing half a century of intense history, anybody who just ruminates the past while offering nothing new should expect to be torched.<BR>   The sales numbers (for this or any other group) are to me totally besides the point. As the saying goes &quot;every minute a sucker is born&quot;, plus, you cant expect the younger audience not to fall for this if noone actually reveals to them that what the Strokes do is nothing more than rumination.<BR>   In the meantime, i think I'll settle in and wait for the &quot;next big thing&quot; which is yet to arrive. Something tells me it's gonna take quite a while.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I didn't think a perfect album would be the result from Christina Aguilera. Her voice cannot be described in its whole in words. The lyrics in every song are meaningful and have a bit of her spirit within them. Though her image is controversial, her musical style stays true as the songs vary from &quot;dirrty&quot; to &quot;the voice within&quot;. Nothing on this disk is bad, and I literally mean nothing. Anyone with mental capacity should give this album no less than a 4 star review. This will prove a timeless classic in years to come. She is definetly stripped of the public opinion and lives up to her taste. Nothing short of brilliant.
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd is socool i mean its like on of the best cds ever. it is so adicting and has cool lyrics and guitars. anyone who doesn't like this cd needs to listen to it again because it is impossible to hate this cd.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Honestly, it could be THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE and maybe &quot;will always be&quot;.   But unfortunately it has become a &quot;One of the greatest&quot;.  Just to be clear, I love the movie(s) - perfect realization of what you imagine when reading the novel, yet something is missing.  I didn't feel affected or get involved emotionally or shaken by any of the scenes, even by the so-called spectacular Helm's Deep battle.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Not your standard holiday fare of syrupy-sweet, overly sentimental tunes, but even so The Jethro Tull Christmas Album is uplifting and delightful from beginning to end. From the sophisticated arrangements of songs old and new, to the superb sound quality, to the clear-eyed and thoughtful lyrical content, this CD is utterly satisfying both as a taste of musical excellence and as a realistic expression of what Christmas seems to be nowadays: thoughtless, self-indulgent materialism alongside our highest spiritual hopes and aspirations. It rocks, but not too hard, it's jazzy and folksy, traditional and unconventional. Do yourself a favor and say &quot;Hey, Santa, pass us that CD, will ya?&quot;
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is a fabulous christmas album from Whitney Houston! Her voice is in great shape. I love to listen to every song, there is nothing to skip away. Everyone who wants to buy a great holiday album should definitely get One wish from Whitney! Its something very special about this album, you will love it too!

B00009TB5G|5.0|With The Fellowship of the Ring, I said that if you did not like the theatrical version, the extended DVD version would probably not change your mind.  I can not say the same for The Two Towers.<BR>Understanding that the middle film in a trilogy is difficult to make in any situation (with the possible exception of The Empire Strikes Back), I still left the theater somewhat confused and let down after seeing The Two Towers. This was no doubt due, at least in part, to my feeling the film fell short of the excellence of The Fellowship. From my recollection of the books, it seemed that characters did not behave as they should, and at the end of the film were not where they were supposed to be.<BR>However, after watching the extended DVD with it's many added scenes and very informative commentaries, so much is cleared up and &quot;justified&quot; that you are left with an almost completly different film.<BR>As with the first film in the trilogy, I would say that this DVD version seems made with fans of the book in mind. But beyond that, due to the massive improvements over the theater release, I would say that if you want The Two Towers in your DVD collection, this is the version you must have.
B00000IFP6|5.0|In light of such positive feedback of what I considered a sub-par review, I've decided to rewrite this and add some things that have recently come to light, namely comparisons that I've drawn to more recent recordings such as Paavo Jarvi's cycle with Bremen and Norrington's newer cycle with the SRSO, two cycles that are similar in scope to Zinman's.<br /><br />I arrived at this cycle years ago after I grew increasingly disgusted with my previous set - Karajan's renowned '63 cycle with Berlin, characterized by sluggish and grandiose interpretations of what I think should be turbulent, violent, breathless music. At the time, this set stood as the only modern instrument alternative to such traditional interpretations, and I had not yet discovered the period-instrument culture, so this cycle was a must for me, and still remains close to the top of my list.<br /><br />Zinman's cycle is sort of a hybrid of modern and period styles. A few specific points on this factor:<br />1) The instruments themselves are modern, as in Norrington's cycle (I think). Zinman would go on to use natural brass for his recordings of the overtures and the concertos, as well as his Schumann cycle, but not here. Jarvi's brass - standard modern horns paired with natural trumpets, are much more incisive and closer in sound to Zinman's later (improved, in my opinion) brass.<br />2) Zinman keeps vibrato in the strings from getting out of hand, while not \\"banning\\" it altogether as Norrington does. Jarvi steers a path between the two. All three approaches are fine, in my opinion.<br />3) You'll hear the horns muting (stopping) some of their notes in the natural horn style. This is interesting at some points, but it can get a little too buzzy for my tastes, and this interferes with the solo lines much more than it should. Norrington's modern horns play in the conventional style. Jarvi again steers a middle course: his horns mute only for coloristic effect, usually when they aren't in the foreground.<br/>4) Zinman's modern seating is a drawback for me. Norrington and Jarvi both use old-school antiphonal violin seating, and this is almost essential, in my opinion, especially for symphonies like the 4th that rely so much on those schizophrenic back-and-forth effects that were common up through Mahler's music and beyond.<br />5) Zinman reduces the quantity of strings, using combinations of about 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, or 14, 12, 10, 8, and 6, giving us a large chamber orchestra feel. Balances between the strings and winds are very good, and there is a strong bass presence. However, Jarvi's balances are even better, using an even smaller orchestra of 8 first violins down to 3 basses. Zinman keeps his brass heavily tamped down, while Norrington's entire cycle suffers from an annoyingly bombastic first trumpet. Jarvi allows his brass to shine through the texture, often to violent effect, without being overbearing.<br />6) Dynamics are observed uncompromisingly here, especially sudden differences between f and ff or p and pp. Phrasing tends to be very short and staccato, even down to the motoric 16th notes in the strings, which are played aggressively and spiccato. Most people mistakenly compare this to period style simply because it is different than normal, but period instrument performances are much smoother in articulation. Of the three, Zinman's phrasing and articulation seem to be the most brusque, but on the other hand, he shapes the melodic lines very carefully and thoughtfully.<br />7) Zinman adopts Beethoven's rapid metronome markings, often hitting them right on the nose (only the last movement of the Eroica is significantly under the marking). To many listeners he may seem too fast, but for me it is the main attraction of this set. Simply put, Beethoven was an ambitious man, and pushed his orchestras to their technical limits in every respect, including what they could do within a given tempo. Zinman's interpretational choices seem to encourage these faster tempi (or perhaps vice versa?), and they sound completely natural. Norrington's pacing by contrast often seems awkward and unsteady. Jarvi's pacing is excellent, but his fidelity to the metronome figures is questionable in a couple spots (Norrington actually makes some bizarre choices of his own).<br />8) One thing almost no one has mentioned so far (and something that also appears in the Schumann cycle) is that Zinman has his woodwinds ornament their solo lines, adding little turns and trills here and there, even extending a cadenza or two in the case of the 5th and the 7th symphonies (sorry guys, that stuff isn't in the new edition). This is more reminiscent of baroque practice, and although one could certainly make a case for it boosting the spontaneity of a live performance, I don't think it has its place on records, where such spur of the moment choices become permanent and lose their meaning (I'm reminded of the Buddhist phrase \\"ichi-go ichi-e\\"). Furthermore, it is misleading to advertise these recordings as the first to use the new Barenreiter edition and then insert your own stuff, as evidenced by the fact that almost no one here has brought it up yet. Most of the hundreds of editorial revisions are much less audible.<br /><br />The general consensus seems to be that Zinman fares best in places where a sense of gravitas isn't as much of a requirement. I agree with this, for the most part. His interpretation of the 5th symphony is just fine. However, his 3rd suffers from a lack of emotional weight. His 9th is surprisingly good, to my ears, but I'm missing the sense of grandeur that other versions provide. I think Symphony 7 is the weakest link here, not because it needs more weight, but because the orchestra sounds undernourished throughout, especially the horns.<br /><br />I like to mix and match various interpretations within a symphony when I'm listening to Beethoven (usually from these three sets, with some Abbado and Benjamin Zander thrown in the mix). Call meunsophisticated, but I'm not very keen on a singular \\"artist's vision\\". I sort of make my own up. That said, I have a clear preference for Jarvi's set when he does follow Beethoven's tempi. His ensemble seems more confident and more committed. Their sound quality, pacing, balance, attention to detail - it's all similar to Zinman's, just a little bit better. (Norrington is great too, but I can't get past that stupid first trumpet).<br /><br />All three of the aforementioned cycles are quite edgy, so if you're looking for a modern instrument cycle that is a bit less caffeinated, Abbado and Vanska both provide a beefier approach that doesn't sacrifice Zinman's accuracy. Abbado is more vigorous where Vanska tends to be more refined. They're sort of halfway between these three and the standard fare. I won't even touch on period instrument stuff here, as I've gone on long enough.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I'm going to start by echoing brutal_honesty (and a lot of other reviewers).  This is Audioslave, not Rage Against the Machine.  Hence the new name.  If you want to listen to RATM, put one of their CDs in your stereo and listen to it.  <br />No, Audioslave isn't &quot;political&quot; like RATM was.  In my opinion this is a good thing.  Although I love Rage and the fact that they weren't afraid to say what they thought, for this band to try to do the same would be a mistake.  Chris Cornell has never been political in his music - at least not in the &quot;in your face&quot; way that Zach de le Rocha and the rest of RATM was.  Personally, I'm not sure that its a style that would work for him.<br />Of course, saying that might suggest that I think that this is Chris Cornell's band.  It isn't; this is a collaboration between him and former members of Rage, with each element bringing something distinctive to the music.  This brings me to the second reason they shouldn't try to be political.  RATM created something that was, if not unique, then distinctly their own.  They had a message that made them stand out.  Trying to imitate them would simply be just that - an imitation. Likewise, I'm glad they didn't try to imitate Soundgarden's &quot;Black Sabbath meets Led Zepplin&quot; style.  Although I think that stylistically Audioslave is much closer to Soundgarden than Rage, I commend them for creating their own sound instead of trying to blatantly cash in on the sound of one of their parent bands.<br />This is a good album with only a couple of weak tracks (which I won't bother to list, because what constitutes a weak track is strictly a matter of opinion).  These lesser tracks and the fact that there's really nothing new or groundbreaking on the album is the reason it gets four stars instead of five, while the talent, passion and energy of the band is why it gets four stars instead of three.<br />On a purely personal note, I'm stunned by how many reviewers say that Chris Cornell has a terrible voice.  In my opinion, he has one of the most powerful, expressive voices in a long time.  Can he be a bit hard to listen to sometimes?  I don't think so, but I can see how some might say yes.  But a bad voice?  I don't think so.  A couple of people have even said that Zach de la Rocha has a better voice than Chris Cornell. I'd never tell anyone that their opinion is wrong.  I you don't like Chris' voice, fine.  Again, this is a matter of opinion.  However, I would say that their vocal styles are so different that they are difficult to compare.<br />Stop expecting Audioslave to be Rage Against the Machine (or Soundgarden).  Take the album for what it is - a solid effort that is definitely a cut above most of the rock music out there.  While not what I would call innovative, it is still one of the better CDs I've picked up in a long time.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a rare album where more than half the songs on a CD are excellent.<br />The vocals are better than average while the metal and other instrumentations are top notch. It's really a hybrid of metal and Sarah McLachlan without any of the mainstream pop garbage injected into it just to sell.<br />I suggest you listen to some of the samples or watch the movie &quot;Daredevil&quot; where it features &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;Immortal&quot;.
B00004T9AS|3.0|As others will tell you, this is far from Mike Oldfield's best album. Scansion and lyrics are occasionally tortured (see &quot;Holy&quot; for the former, as another reviewer has mentioned, the choruses of &quot;Far Country&quot; and &quot;Innocent&quot; for the latter), but there are bright points. Adrian Belew makes &quot;Holy&quot; work, and the bridge of &quot;Far Country&quot; is a delightful glimpse of what could have been as Oldfield and Belew trade guitar licks--not in the &quot;Look at me, I'm a virtuoso and can play really, really fast&quot; style of McLaughlin and de Lucia, but always tasteful and suited to the tranquil nature of the song. The religious allusions come thick and fast on this album, but my favorite track has to be &quot;Blue Night,&quot; IMHO featuring Oldfield's best lyric writing since &quot;Crime of Passion,&quot; fine guitar work, and Maggie O'Reilly's always excellent vocals.  Call it Oldfield's worst, but it's still worthwhile.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|When you leave a space of 6 years between studio recordings there is bound to be some amount of expectation on your new material.  This CD suffers heavily from the curse of 'its not as good as...', but if you listen closely it actually is as good as....<br />Afterglow seems a very reflective collection, laden with heavy emotion and this is no fault. Lyrically it is maybe not as challenging as its predecessors, but musically it is vivid and raw.  Stand out tracks are Fallen, Train Wreck and Time, although I would say 8 out of the 10 tracks are outstanding, a feat most albums would not manage.  Buy Fumbling Towards Ecstasy to be amazed, Surfacing to be moved and Afterglow to be touched.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'd like to thank Ambrose, Hanks and Spielberg for bringing Easy Company's story to us--it's a story that needed to be told.<br />I was ten years old when Easy Co. and other airborne units landed in France on D-Day. I remember my grandfather reading to me, the newspaper account of the heavy fighting our airborne troops were involved in. I'm 70 now and have never forgotten what these men did for our country. They were heros<br />Easy Company, I salute you!
B0000DD7NL|4.0|alright, the first thing that i'll say about Alicia Keys is that she is a wonderful singer and piano player, etc... and i love her vocal arrangements on both of her CD's but i think that this CD has some flaws (but not alot). On Songs like Karma, Dragon Days, You Dont Know My Name, When You Really Love Someone, If I Ain't Got You and Diary she burns it up. Karma has a catchy hook, Dragon Days is a nice arrangement, on her first singls from the CD You Dont Know My Name, she has also a nice arrangement and its nice how she incorparates things from the Music Video (like the phone convo) in the Album Version as well. When You Really Love Someone is a nice, mid tempo, beautiful lyrical song. If I Ain't Got You is a beautiful ballad [like] Diary, which reminds me in the very beginning of kind of a smooth jazz standard (especially how she says the lyrics in the very start) and then the song morphes into a beautiful ballad. And Tony! Toni! Tone`! and Keys is a great callabo.<br />Those six songs are excellent, but other songs like Heartburn, Wake Up, Slow Down, and So Simple aren't good. Heartburn is very repetative, Wake Up---that song is decent, but it drags in my opinion and its a bit boring. The Strings in the start is nice but the chorus behind her while she's singing the verses can get a little irratating. But Alicias vocal in that song is very good. Slow Down has nice piano, and is a nice ballad, just a little boring and not really that interesting. And the other one, So Simple...im appalled with this song. Alicia was known for not having a computer generated voice or usuing any of that techno stuff in her songs. This is song would have been a decent song because her vocals and voice in this song are great. But in the hook, you have this little, irratating, squeeky, completely computer generated, baby voice saying \\"It would be...it would be...so simple\\" and after the second verse it goes on and on. Now some people may think this is a nice touch. Which to them it could be, but its just that Alicia Keys was known for having her pure voice and no machine made stuff but then she comes out with this song which is a disapointment.<br />Now besides those 10 tunes, other tracks on the album you have are  Harlems Nocturne, If I Was Your Woman/Walk on By, feeling you-feeling me, samsonite man, and nobody not really. They're average. Theres nothing specificly special about them really. They're just there to average out the CD a little bit.<br />In the End, The Diary of Alicia Keys is a change from Songs in a Minor. A Drastic one. The Songs are more mature and the entire nature of the CD is much different. Its hard to explain, but if you close your eyes and listen to this CD and her old one, you'll see what im talking about and its not a bad one. Its a nice CD, not her complete best, but shes definately getting close. Its worth a buy, because good music never runs out of style. Thats why \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" Rates 4 out of 5.<br />Plus the DVD is great.

B00000JLWW|5.0|I thought that Titanic was a meaningful, touching, and powerful story about two young lovers who find each other on the ill-fated voyage of the Titanic. Though very predictable, the script, actors, and  made this film rise above it's cliched story and certain ending. The part that touched me the most, was how Jack saved Rose &quot;in every way that someone can be saved&quot;, as it says in the movie. He convinces her to not commit suicide when she thought that she'd never break free from her rich and meaningless society. He makes that journey the best three days of her life, and gives her a reason to go on living once he dies in the icey waters; to keep his memory alive. In the end, when she dies as an old lady, warm in her bed, it shows pictures sitting on the table by her bed. They are pictures of Rose going on to live the dream that she and Jack hoped to live together once the ship docked. Then you follow her spirit once she passes. It goes back to the Titanic, where Jack is waiting for her at the top of the grand staircase. It just makes tears spring to your eyes, no matter how hard you try to keep them away.

B00008PW2D|4.0|People are complaining about the price and lowereing the rating for this great show, Granted i agree this is too much to spend for only two discs, but will still buy it anyway to complete my collection, people should consider they have alrady forked over about one hundetred and fifty dollars for the the first four seasons. Just go with the flow and buy this, the show is almost over and i for one want to have complete series of the best telvision show since Seinfeld. I hope sony will release that one soon, it's about the only telvision show not on dvd.
0689829590|5.0|This book is the beautiful story of a dad who goes to all lengths for his daughter - he actually gets the moon for her!<BR>In typical \\"Carle fashion\\" this book expands (as the moon appears to do), the pages ascend ever higher (as the moon ascends in the sky).  As with Carle's other stories you don't just hear them and see them - you FEEL them.  I love the motion in this book. The tenderness of the gift from father to daughter and the representaion of the child's joy in playing with the moon. This story has a wonderful opening, fantastic struggle and beautiful ending. I especially enjoy how the moon itself is a character in the book.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The only thing I have to say is that this album is awesome.  I can't stop listening to it.  The album is good from beginning to end.  From &quot;Harlem's Nocture&quot; to &quot;Nobody Not Really&quot;, this album is hot.  The bonus cd is a great addition as well.  If you don't pick up this album, you will be missing out on something special.  God Bless Alicia Keys!!!

B000060P79|5.0|I love this CD. ^^ I'm the type who would buy a CD, listen to it once and then give it away because I usually end up liking one of the songs. Aside from the fact I lose a ton of money that way, I usually feel cheated. This isn't the case with this CD. I don't think I dislike any of the songs and when I get home from a stressful day at school, I pop this in my CD player and feel instantly better.<br />1. I'd Do Anything: Very fast pace and energetic. The lyrics are pretty sweet and pretty much anyone can relate. 5/5<BR>2.The Worst Day Ever: Basically any teenager's theme song.I play this whenever I'm having a bad day (which is pretty often) and it makes me feel better that a lot of people this way \\"... I feel like I'm living the worst day over and over again...\\" 5/5<BR>3. You Don't Mean Anything: Hmmm... some people hate this one, some people don't like it. It's not one of my top favorites and sometimes I skip this one. 4/5<BR>4. I'm Just A Kid: I had no clue who Simple Plan was and I heard this song on the radio. I think I can pretty much gurantee you've heard this song before. This starts out pretty slow and quiet and suddenly it gets faster and a bit louder. Elementary kids and middle school kids will like this 4/5<BR>5.When I'm With You: I don't really like this song as much as the others because it's somewhat lacking... it's still decent. 4/5<BR>6.Meet You There: Starts out pretty soft and it sounds really wistful. I don't particularly favor this one much because the tune is OK but after hearing it a couple of times... this doesn't hold my attention. 3/5<BR>7.Addicted: This has to be one of my all time favorites. It's about breakups and how you just can't forget the person even when the person isn't interested. The tune is really catchy, \\"I'm a ...(or addict--whatever you prefer), I'm addicted to you...\\". 5/5<BR>8.My Alien: This is the type that grows with time. When I first heard it I just blinked a couple of times and went on with the next song. The line thatfreaked me out most was \\"She has two arms to hold me, four legs to wrap around me...\\" Yeah. That pretty much says it, eh? My friends love it and I like it now too. I love the line \\"Please take me to your leader... tell her I will surrender...\\" ^-^ Pierre can sing a lot higher than I can. 4/5 (because of the \\"..four legs to wrap around me\\" line. O.o)<BR>9. God Must Hate Me:I don't think I've ever skipped this song, ever. This is my all time favorite. One of my friends' can't listen to it because her parents are strict Christians and they think it's offending. I just find this hilarious and not offending at all (well, I'm an atheist but aside from that). It's something anyone in school can relate to. \\"Last night I forgot to study for this test...\\" Although instead of \\"I'm stuck in hell\\" I thought it was \\"F***ing hell\\". Listen carefully ^^' 5/5<BR>10.I Won't Be There: This one doesn't strike me much. I like it though. The tune is nice and it's catchy. 5/5<br />11.One Day: One of the slower songs. This is perfect for any teenager like me ^^ It expresses the urge to turn eighteen and want to experience freedom. 5/5<BR>12.Perfect: I don't think anyone cannot relate to this, otherwise this song wouldn't be so popular. I think everyone has this problem; you want to make your parent(s) proud but you want to do something or you are something your parent(s) don't like. Really sad but beautiful. 5/5<BR>13. Grow Up: Heh, ever get tell you should act your age or grow up? Well, this song's message is \\"I promise I won't change [...] I don't want to be told to grow up. 4/5<BR>14. Christmas List: Perfect around Holiday season like now.Heh, it's not great but this isn't bad either. I find that it expresses exactly how I feel around this time of year. 4/5<br />Anyway, this is one really good CD. You should definitely buy it.
B000001OAA|5.0|Let's be realistic. Most of the time when you buy a normal popular album, from songs you heard and liked on the radio, you are lucky if you like one or two additional songs. That is the case with the preponderance of albums I have so purchased, the usual two or three good songs, plus one or two more better than average songs (if you're lucky)and then mediocrity (also known as filler). Let's call this \\"The rule of the hit song / album\\"<br />This is probably why the music industry sales are down. Buyers are getting fed up, paying upwards of $14 to get a hit and one or two more songs (like three lemons, maybe two cherries). You tend to feel like you were ripped off. Conversely, There are exceptions to our \\"rule\\", when you buy the rare bird, where you like a majority of the songs, Voila, you hit the jackpot (three bars!). And when you get the really rare bird, where you like all the songs, you hit the big one (Three sevens!!!)<br />Garbage, is such a rarity. I have a few other rarities as well and I may discuss them in the future but for now lets talk about Shirley Manson and Garbage<br />I became a Garbage fan quite by accident. Of course I'd heard their hit single \\"Stupid Girl\\" but that isn't what interested me. It was the remarkable song they performed on the excellent sound track to Romeo and Juliette called #1 Crush. WOW!!! What a unique sound and Shirley Manson, what a voice, no not spectacular but neither was the music. Manson's voice was sultry, sexy and oh so cynical, it fit the music, which is kind of a bluesy, brooding, alternative grunge, perfectly.<br />I was hooked so I went out and bought Garbage, Version 2, a pretty good album in it's own right. So I decided a rare bird deserves another crack and off I went for Garbage S/T, which was even better (though slightly)and here we are.<br />If I have a favorite song \\"As Heaven is Wide\\" is it, though there are 5 other 5 star songs and nothing below 4 stars!<br />\\"As Heaven Is Wide\\"<br />\\"Nothing that you say will release you /Nothing that you pray would forgive you /Nothing's what your words mean to me /Something that you did will destroy me /Something that you said will stay with me /Long after you're dead and gone<br />If flesh could crawl /My skin would fall /From off my bones /And run away from here<br />As far from God /As heaven is wide /As far from God /As angels can fly\\"<br />All Garbage's music has a slow to medium alternative rock tempo and kind of a dark melancholy feel. One of the best Alternative - pop albums of 1995. To me it has a semi - gothic feel as well.<br /><br />While this music is not for everyone (it is a little depressing) it is certainly an essential album for those who like a grungey catchy semi - gothic feel to their music and especially for those who like female fronted rock/metal and since so many good songs are on one album it's also a great value.<br />Band Members<br />Shirley Manson, vocals<br />Butch Vig, percussion<br />Steve Marker, guitar/bass<br />Duke Erikson, Keyboard/guitar/bassay will release you /Nothing that you pray would forgive you /Nothing's what your words mean to me /Something that you did will destroy me /Something that you said will stay with me /Long after you're dead and gone <br />If flesh could crawl /My skin would fall /From off my bones /And run away from here <br />As far from God /As heaven is wide /As far from God /As angels can fly\\"<br />All Garbage's music has a slow to medium alternative rock tempo and kind of a dark melancholy feel.

0783229526|5.0|I know this movie got hammered by the critics, but I absolutely love it. So many great lines. For humor, and for pure pondering. Johnny and Benicio putting in just spectacular performances. Even their simple gestures and body motion kill me.<BR>The set design was ludicrous (this is a good thing), amazing visuals, some priceless cameos (Sven and the highway cop), and near-flawless direction by Terry.<BR>You'll either love it or hate it. I think it's hard to find an in-between.<br />Say nothing to noone!
B00005JMFO|4.0|Like other reviewers, there were parts of this movie I absolutely loved.  But like the Christmas cookie plate, there were just too many sweet choices, and I was left at the end of the film with a tummy-ache.  This could have been a lovely family film (or at least one I could take my mother to), EXCEPT for a plot line about a couple who meet while filming a porno movie.  Ok, it was humorous at times, as they carried on regular conversion while in the most provacative of poses.  But the story is a minor one, doesn't advance the plot or message, and makes it impossible for anyone to take their teen children to. Which is too bad, because there is a poignant story about a middle-school age boy who has a crush on the most popular girl at school.  At any rate, I still liked it, especially since I had Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Alan Rickman, all in one movie!!  Hugh Grant is looking even better these days, with a few wrinkles on his face.  Colin Firth turns in a lovely performance as a bumbling writer.  Alan Rickman is a potentially unfaithful husband, and I don't know if it was writing or directing, but something was missing with it.  Nevertheless, just listening to his wonderful, resonant voice is worth the price of admission.  Go see this one with your girl-buddies, but not your mom.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail To The Thief is not only extremely varied in its musical styles, but also in its level of success in creating memorable songs.  Songs like &quot;Go To Sleep&quot;, &quot;There There&quot;, &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, and &quot;A Punchup At A Wedding&quot; are amazing, memorable, and original.  In these tracks, they blend their electronic style along with Greenwood's unique guitar riffs perfectly.  The layered guitars, creative rhythms, and atmospheric noises all excellently work together.  A full album of songs of this caliber would be a 6 star rating in my book.  But, as much as I love those tracks, there are some real awful ones on here.  &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, and &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; are three I cannot even listen to anymore, whether it be for some overdone beeps, annoying claps, or just pure lack of anything musically appealing.  Other standouts include &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot; and &quot;Where I End And You Begin&quot;, which showcase Yorke's vocal ability quite nicely.  The remaining tracks are average, but very listenable unlike the three I mentioned before.  When Hail To The Thief is good, it's VERY good, but when it's bad, it's VERY bad.  Overall, it's an entertaining listen, but having to skip a few tracks, (which I never have to do for The Bends or OK Computer), makes me have to give it a 4.
0385509456|5.0|I hardly ever recommend a modern novel to everybody, preferring to stay in the realms of 'classic' fiction, but I can unequivocally say that everybody should read this novel. It showed me that autistic people have much in common with &quot;normal&quot; people, and that they might be more normal than us. I was moved by this book: the autistic boy's observations of the world around him, untainted by cynicism, were like looking in a mirror for the first time and seeing that, no, all is not well with the world. Even so, the book is not depressing; rather, it is revelatory; nor is it preachy for the cause of autism. By showing that autism is a human condition, Mr. Haddon has done the human condition a favor.
B000092ZYX|1.0|It gives me no pleasure to say that this record is damning evidence that Radiohead really isn't a great band anymore! <br />The End
B00005JKC3|1.0|Horrible movie, trailers sure can make a movie look good.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It is so nice to see a band that is actually daring to be different. Its also nice to see a really beautiful rock album. The whole album tells stories of the twelve step program. It is a very three dimentional CD. The reviews are true though. Listen to the CD 3-4 times before passing any judgement on it... the first time I listened to it I wasn't all that impressed... after the 3rd time I had concert tickets.
B00008NRL8|5.0|...Gotan Project awesome I discovered them listening to KUT public radio in Austin, in Eclecticos the morning music program. The CD is just great. It has the flavor of Tango with that modern contemporary twist but more importantly with the Urban feeling of Buenos Aires, everytime I listen to it in my long car commute I feel there at home in B.A....the same that when I listen to Piazzola.It's the future of Tango and it is the revancha....
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This is a great movie. The theme flows through from 1st to 2nd films and for those following the true story line and not just looking at the action scenes, it is all there. Think of it as like reading a book (in this case a film script) and you will see the movie at a depth others might not have done. Sure there are some scenes which drag a little bit, but ask yourselves the question: why have the directors left this bit in &amp; this long: what exactly are they trying to convey to me, beyond the obvious. Overall, just sit back and enjoy the ride. After all, you're living in a Matrix right now. What is real and what is not? In this world you have only made your own reality by what you believe is in your environment. But is it real: that is the question the Matrix is posing. Or are you just playing out a computer programme set by God?
B000008LOU|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys turned up again following their first adventure together, sadly minus one member and with a rather misleading album title.  But even without Orbison, it's still an enjoyable piece of work (though I wonder why they didn't invite someone else into the fold).  It gets off to a very rocking start with &quot;She's My Baby&quot;, which is sure to give you a start if you were expecting something a little more laid back, as I was when I moved on to Vol. 3.  But it's a great song, once you're into it.  Unfortunately, I don't like this album quite as much as the first.  While there wasn't a single song on the first release that I disliked, I've never liked &quot;You Took My Breath Away&quot;, which is here, and I really doubt that that is ever going to change.  &quot;Where Were You Last Night&quot; doesn't do a lot for me either, so that counts against this album a little two.  But as I would be inclined to give this album a 4.5 and can't, I'll still go ahead and give Vol. 3 a five star rating.  With a couple of low spots aside, this is still a highly enjoyable album that has a lot to offer the listener.  It's still worth the money, but if you have a choice of just this album or the first and not both, I'd definitely go with the first.<br />Dylan and Petty really seem to Dominate the songs here... something of a disappointment for me when first I heard this, because I was more familiar with George Harrison and Jeff Lynne when I gave it a chance.  In the time since I've managed to branch out a little bit and give Petty and his Heartbreakers a few tries on their own, so this is not really a bad thing at all (and one day, I'll do the same for Dylan.  Right now I know &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; and &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, thanks to the magic of radio, but that's it).  Just depends on who you know best and want to hear the most; whether this should count against the album or not is completely relative.  That said, Petty particularly impressed mewith his tune, &quot;A Cool Dry Place&quot;.  Great lyrics... very surreal (sort of the heir to &quot;Margarita&quot; from the first release, while still sounding completley different).<br />My favorite songs, specifically, would be &quot;Devil's Been Busy&quot; (for George's sitar work... I'm glad they worked that into the sound at some point), &quot;Poor House&quot; (great hillbilly song, with some totally out of place guitar showing up between verses, courtesy of George, I'm guessing, though I don't know for sure), and &quot;New Blue Moon&quot; (very smooth, calm, and laid-back... great lyrics too).  <br />And of course, finally, who can forget &quot;Wilbury Twist&quot;, a song that's so much fun and so enjoyable that I decided to mention it in it's very own paragraph.  Kids, don't try this at home.  If there were some way to graft this song onto the first Wilburys album, than the poor souls unable to buy both could still live without being deprived of this little two-minute masterpiece.  Definitely a requirement for any Wilburys listener.<br />I'll just wrap up by saying that even though I didn't like it as much, &quot;The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 3&quot; is a heck of a lot of fun, in spite of a couple of easily-skippable low spots, and that you'll definitely not be sorry if you decide to pick it up.  It's really something of a disappointment that we never heard any more from them, though a similar sound is definitely to be be heard on the albums the individual members all released about this time (specifically, Lynne's own stuff, together with the records Lynne produced for both George and Petty.  If you want more, check a few of them out).<br />Happy listening.<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
B000002GFC|5.0|Sorry folks but this is NOT the very best of Cream. Heresy you say? No way. Sure it contains all the classics like Sunshine and White Room but those are all studio recordings. The Cream playing in a studio is like a caged tiger, totally subdued. It needs to be free in order to be in all its glory. The Cream accomplishes this on their live stuff. The lone live track Crossroads only gives a hint to the limits Cream achieved and that song has been a staple of Classic Rock stations like WNEW-FM New York for decades. If you want to hear Cream at their best you need to get &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; and listen to &quot;Spoonful&quot;. From just after the break at about the 2:48 mark to about 7:30 you will go from zero to warp drive. The Cream is not about glamor glitter or snazzy pop production. It's about playing full tilt. Ginger Baker, the Drummer, collapsed on several occasions after concerts due to his ferocious play.  Unfortunately live recordings in the 60's wasn't an important item (until Cream and Hendrix made it so) so there aren't many quality live recordings on tape. Jack Bruce, Bassist, said their best was never recorded. Another live tune that is a must hear is &quot;I'm So Glad&quot; on the &quot;Goodbye Cream&quot; CD. This one is none stop mania, after Jack Bruce's bass solo Clapton joins in and all hell breaks loose for another several minutes. It comes to an end suddenly as if rehearsed, amazing. Live Cream and Live Cream vol 2 offer other classics. The ending of Stepping Out is nothing short of the second coming of Jesus done all by Eric Clapton assisted by Ginger. If Clapton is God here he arrives in full splendor. The songs are long and lots of it tedious to be honest but the best parts must be heard. I edited those parts to make it easier to get to. For instance NSU on the Live Cream CD go to the 6 minute mark and play it to the end. The impact is much greater when edited. Much feeling is lost listening through the whole tune. Play it loud for maximum effect. Feel the power and the glory.
B000008LOU|5.0|Tacked onto the end of my copy of this album, as a bonus track, is an extra song: \\"Nobody's Child\\".  Typically, I leave bonus tracks out of the equation, but as I accidentally somehow posted my review for this album twice, I thought I'd take advantage of the situation and spend a moment review the song on its own.  Recorded to raise money for orphanages in Rumania, \\"Nobody's\\" serves as kind of a down-beat way to close the album, especially after the energetic fun of \\"Wilbury Twist\\" (I understand that \\"Nobody's\\" was released on its own as a single).  Though it's a definite change of pace from the song that came before, it's a very nice little tune... sweet harmonica, very sad vocals, and a definite pseudo-country laid-back style to the music.  It was sweet of the Wilburys to put this song together, especially considering their reasons for doing it, and I'm happy it was included on the CD I purchased (I'm uncertain if it is on all of them or not, the ones available that is).  The four Wilburys share lead vocals, trading lines one at a time starting with Tom Petty, giving each one of them a chance to do their stuff.  <br />Very good, but a definite change in tone.<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
B0000067L2|5.0|I remember the days this album appeared on the charts. The Beatles owned the charts and here's this group Cream with this &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; album that kept being on top of the charts. I was quite young and a little underage for the kind of music these guys put out. Bubble gum music, top 40, WABC in New York was the music I was accustomed to. So here's this new group and the song Sunshine of Your Love that was played a thousand times and you couldn't get it out of your head. Little did I know that this would be my favorite band of all time. I mean this is the Mickey Mantle of Rock Bands. In Sgt Pepper style if any of you are old enough to remember those glorious years this album has some sort of theme. The tracks seem to flow from one through the other seemlessly. Most of the tracks are strong and even the weak ones can be laughed with and not at. Which group would have the guts to do &quot;Mother's Lament&quot;? They poke fun at themselves by asking &quot;Do You Want To Do It Again&quot;? One of my favorites is &quot;Dance The Night Away&quot; which is nothing like the Van Halen song by the same title. This album put Cream on the map and rightfully so. The Album cover itself should be a collectors item. Can I get an original?
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Wow, I did not see this coming at all.  \\"Mer de Noms,\\" A Perfect Circle's freshman release, was a nice but unoriginal compilation of over-produced eighties-type metal that had the benefit of Maynard James Keenan on vocals.  \\"Thirteenth Step,\\" however, sounds like a different band altogether.  In this time of bubble-gum pop and hip hop and punk-metal, I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to hear such a quiet and beautiful rock record.  You'll be amazed not only by the notes played but by the stunning silence in between.  Soft guitars and mournful sounds and Keenan's moving voice all weave and build to bright explosions of power and emotion.  Yes, it rocks, but the foreplay is long and deliciously intense.  It's a brave band that can take composing as seriously as what is on display here--and can take the listener seriously enough to take the ride with them.  If you enjoy avant-garde rock, do not miss this one.
B000089RVX|1.0|There is a glaring problem with this disc. On track 2, the band enlisted the &quot;assistance&quot; of some moron (the singer from 12 Stones, from what I hear) to belch some idiotic rap from the gaping hole in his face, just under the chorus. This turns what would otherwise be a beautiful song into an intolerable, revolting mess. You cannot imagine just how damaging this pinhead's contribution is - you will spend the rest of time the disc plays plotting your revenge against this dimwitted fool. There is a single out there without this a-hole's &quot;contribution&quot; - I suggest you get a copy of that and burn yourself an unsullied version of this disc.
B00005AUBA|5.0|Rock Action is WAY too short of an album (only six full-length tunes and two ambient interludes), but the quality of the songs themselves makes Rock Action worthwhile. The album begins with &quot;Sine Wave,&quot; an epic drone the builds into a symphony of distorted drums and guitar noise. &quot;Take Me Somewhere Nice&quot; is everything Come On Die Young wanted to be, but couldn't. A slow, subdued track with a gorgeous string section with almost whispered vocals, &quot;Take Me Somewhere Nice&quot; takes the quiet tone C.O.D.Y. embodied, and fine tunes it into brilliance. &quot;Dial: Revenge&quot; is a strange tune for Mogwai, a three-minute pop tune that at the same time isn't a pop tune: dark, clean guitar with strings and welsh lyrics from the lead singer of Super Furry Animals. &quot;You Don't Know  Jesus&quot; is probably the closest Mogwai gets to their loud Young Team days; the track is great loud crescendo Mogwai epic that was lacking from Come On Die Young. &quot;2 Rights Make 1 Wrong&quot; is easily the record's highpoint, a two-part epic that begins as an orchestral post-rock tune and ends in beautiful electronic ambience. The last section is expertly pulled off, starting with glitchy beats, banjo, and guitar and ending with bells and a wall of layered voices. It's one of Mogwai's best tunes, if not the best (try to find a live version of this track to hear Stuart transform the second half into a wall of beautiful guitar noise). Rock Action might seem disappointing at first due to its short length, but it will grow on you thanks to a strong set of tunes. While the loud days of Young Team seem behind them in some ways, Rock Action takes the quiet mood of Come On Die Young and makes it ten times better.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Thank you Mr. Tarantino for the joyride this movie is.<BR>I began laughing as soon as I read the &quot;Old Klingon Proverb&quot; instead of &quot;Old Arabian Proverb&quot;. <BR>The music is great , even if only to let the younger generations to get acquainted to the mastery of Al Hirt.<BR>You are a true genius.

B000084T18|4.0|Number one, 50 cent was shot in the mouth, which is why he slurs  some of his words.  Number two, rap music is generally a representation of the time in which it was created. Many of the old heads scream if you want real Rap music then look to the past, well the reason there is not much rap which is on the level  that is was back then is because times have changed. 50 cents album reflects todays attitudes,  anything you say about his album could be said about the young people who listen to it and the media such as Mtv and radio  stations that promote it.  So take this album on face value its like a piece of audable candy. Is this album going to raise the level of consciousnes in the world  today? No, but tracks like In Da Club  did raise more then a few girls to the dance floor and that goes a long way with this hip hop head.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller wrote, co-directed and worked in a movie that is as empty and devoid of content as the industry it portrays, which could perhaps have been the very point. The vein of the movie is very AustinPowers-like, although the jury is still out  on which ones are funnier.<br />The premise of Zoolander is a rip -- a super model called Zoolander (Stiller) with IQ equivalent to his shoe-size finds himself at a cross-roads in life when he has a contender challenge his leadership position (Wilson). This makes him a good candidate to be hired as an assassin.<br />Makes for a fabulous ground to poke some fun at fashion and advertising industries, and there's a bevy of barbs that produce a handful of genuinely funny moments.  Stiller makes more faces in this one flick than he must have made in his entire career, and its hilarious!<br />If you watch the flick after a Merchant Ivory or Michael Mann item, you'll be disappointed. It's light-hearted fun and in general I believe it succeeds.  The pace of the movie is good overall, although on average the first half has more genuine laughs than the second, the latter getting exceedingly unbelievable and situational in content.<br />Yet, a pretty interesting rental for some light fun. Would I want to own this? I wonder.
1878424319|4.0|This book has been on the best-seller list for years because it has a simple message.  If you follow the four points, your life can only get better.  One of the four agreements is &quot;Be Your Best.&quot;  Personally, I think Optimal Thinking--How to Be Your Best Self is the absolute best and only book on the planet to show us how to be our best.  We need Optimal Thinking to be and do our best and bring out the best in others.  Buy both of these books.  You will get your money's worth.
B00000IQC8|4.0|After you slide the DVD into the player, your initial sentiment is a setback. The entire movie is in B&amp;W. I am not quite sure why, because it's made in 1994 (shoestring budget perhaps?) -- but I bet you'll get past that initial disappointment in less than 5 minutes.<br />Clerks is witty, sharply and cleverly written, with energetically laid-back performances. It's structured as vignettes, or screen cuts if you will, from the lives of two retail clerks -- one a general store and the other a video rental -- and the moments spent in their day to day life, the oddball customers they frequently deal with, the doozy way they themselves handle their customers etc.<br />I have seldom seen a movie that takes so little situational mess or physical activity to be so funny. This is must-watch material. Don't go expecting a specific plot though, this is more like a candid camera peep into the shop next door.
B000002U82|3.0|I first heard this soon after moving to the States in the '70s.  I had really liked the early Pink Floyd -- See Emily Play, Saucerful of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother -- but my first reaction on hearing this album was that they'd sold out and dumbed down to satisfy American tastes.  After their early years on the progressive vanguard with groups like the Soft Machine and King Crimson this was really their first commercial album, and although very slick and beautifully engineered, the creative, experimental, essential Englishness of the early work had gone.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|This is the first review ive ever written mostly because this is the firts album ive felt this strongly twords. This was Joe Strummer's last stand as an artist before he died.

B00005RHGK|3.0|I am not much of a scary movie fan, but this is one of the better ones I have seen to a point. Some scenes totally grossed me out, while others left me hiding my eyes in front of my face. I think the plot itself is original, but man...the two main characters are total idiots!!! I'm not going to write a long boring summary, but I will say the ending of the movie still gives me chills and leaves me with nightmares. Also, I couldn'r really say that the plot was predictable...but the characters were. In my opinion, if you see something scary or freaky happen in front of you...you don't just stand there...you get the heck out as soon as possible!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is without question the best record they've ever done. Full sonic assault. I'm going out on a limb here, and saying that this may be the best record released in the past 5 years - by anyone. I got the same feeling listening to this CD as I did when I first listened to LaSexorcisto 10 years ago, and Operation Mindcrime 15 years ago - that this is a once in a decade album. Sonics are impeccable, though I wish these guys would have released this on DVD audio, also. If you don't buy another recording this year, buy this one. Peace.
B00013F35I|5.0|I just don't understand it... all these complaints about the &quot;crappy&quot; sound... Dunno if the Region 2 DVD is massively different (doubt it), but I've watched it and there's nothing wrong with the sound. I nearly didn't buy it, because of all the moaning going on here, and I bet others will decide against it, thinking that it's going to sound like someone under water outside the concert hall recording it. This may not be the greatest sounding DVD ever, but unless you're a DVD nerd (which I think some here are...), then you'll have a great evening watching this and it's well worth the price (which was pretty cheap in England)
B00013F35I|2.0|i am very disapointed with this release it was and probably is sony / columbia told him like billy joel lets make a big marketing thing  and throw out what ever crap you want  to bruce on dvd and he said what about this crap  screw the fans
B000002NFM|5.0|Prodigy's \\"The Fat of the Land\\" is one of the best hardcore techno albums recorded.  Their combination of guitar rock, rap, club dance, and sampling gives this album some of the most unique techno sounds.  Such quality rightfully made them the first rave band to make mainstream in the US.  Prodigy has inspired many dance/electronica acts since the release.  Its edgy lyrics and edgy beats keeps every listener anxiously awaiting for what'll happen next, regardless of who's singing lead vocals.  Every beat keeps many on the dance floor.  Such controversy, especially on \\"Smack My B**** Up\\", keeps this album interesting.  Their top 40 hit single \\"Firestarter\\" capitalizes the theme.  After six years of release, \\"The Fat of the Land\\" continues its hardhitting impact.  This is the ultimate album for the ultimate techno fan.  Even many non-techno fans will enjoy this.  Those who love it, which surely many will, should watch for their new album to be released in 2004.

0553213105|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only picked this up after watching the latest excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's now-ubiquitous 'Pride and Prejudice'.<br />Let me preface this review by saying that this is a novel like no other - it's Little Women with Declaritive Sentences, it's Gone With The Wind without the Overstatement. The story of the five Bennett sisters in their quest to make good marriages is as entertaining as it is relevant, and Austen's acerbic and subtle humour still shine today.<br />Eliza Bennett has a problem. She is the only independant sister in a family of five girls, ruled by a weatherbeaten Father and a hyperactive Mother. She wishes to marry for love, and love alone, but times are hard, and if she does not marry for money, she will be poor, as her father's estate is entailed away to his only nephew, the connsumately hideous Clergyman, Mr. Collins. She meets and falls in immediate Hate with the snobbish, upper-class Mr. Darcy, and through a series of mishaps, revelations and balls, she discovers that he is not the man she first suspected him to be.<br />Austen shows an almost unnatural intelligence with her prose. She is the definitive social commentator, and slips her jokes and judgements into her writing with such subtlety, that you forget she's doing it at all. Unlike Louisa M. Alcott's heavy-handed Christian-Morals littered about 'Little Women', Austen's morals are of a markedly more subtle nature. Truly ahead of her time, and an early feminist, her writing advocates independance for women, and shows clearly the faults and idiosyncrasies of men and silly women - a refreshing change for the period. Even today, her caustic protrayals of Mrs. Bennett, a woman as mercenary in her dealings with marriage as she is socially embarrassing, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, a wealthy, if somewhat inbred, dowager, and Mr. Collins, a greasy and truly venal human being, ring true as vivid and relevant descriptions of how to be an Idiot. The opposite can besaid of her central character, Elizabeth Bennett. Clearly a semi-autobiographical heroine, Austen has created in Eliza an independant and intelligent heroine, but tempers this with several character flaws (the most notable being the titular 'Pride') to produce a young woman of believable depth and character.<br />Her plot is long-winded and drawn-out, but, thanks to Austen's wonderful gift for making characters interesting as well as whole, it never once loses pace; instead, it becomes a joy to read. Her Cast Of Thousands each have a distinct part to play in uniting Elizabeth with her true love, and however small that part, Austen ensures they do it with memorable gusto.<br />All in all, I urge everyone to read this novel. However, I think it's best read after seeing the TV adaptations, because while good, they cannot even begin to show the depth and intelligence of this novel. You'll appreciate Austen all the more after 'Pride and Prejudice'.
B00000DRXW|5.0|20 some years later and I still remember the first night I heard this CD for the first time, like it was yesterday. And after 20 years I still get goose-bumps every time I listen to this CD. Anyone who loves guitar has to have this CD. Now whenever I hear that somebody loves guitar I put on this CD and wait for their jaw to drop. The technical skill of any one of the three of these gentleman is amazing. But how they play together and play off each other is mind blowing! Guitar lovers prepare for 40 minutes of heaven.
B000088E6D|4.0|Although I am not crazy about the songs/arrangements &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;How Do You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; being included in this otherwise impeccable offering, I am truly impressed.<br />First, I have to say that I am shocked more people aren't raving about the musical arrangements and musicians backing him. This is what impressed me first and foremost while I was driving home from the post office listening to it for the first time. I had to crank it up even more. The musicians were hawt.<br />Second, Michael's voice is very nice. I can only imagine it blossoming even further as he develops as an artist. The tonality and the range were right on target. However, I felt like a few songs were lacking the raw emotion and passion needed by a &quot;crooner&quot; to give these songs the depth that would make it truly a &quot;5&quot; song. <br />I have recommended this cd to quite a few people.
B00006G8G1|5.0|I have &quot;discovered&quot; Iron Maiden this year. Heard only a few songs over the years and was generally unmoved. However, having reacquainted myself with them I am duly impressed.<br />The Rock in Rio DVD is not perfect, with, as mentioned earlier, sometimes dizzying changes in camera angles. Have to give Steve Harris credit though, he does give everyone a fair exposure, and you really don't mind the changes.<br />To me, a live performance is where the rubber hits the road. No studio magic, overdubs or computer tracking. You either have it nailed or you perish. Sure, sometimes live performance recording is lacking in sound or video perfection, but do you expect that when you see someone live?<br />The musicianship of Maiden is top notch. Not just an average metal band. Complicated and difficult tempos, tasteful key changes, great lead guitar spread equally between Janick Gers and Dave Murray, with Adrian Smith laying down the crunching bottom end with deafening riffs. Steve Harris is a little annoying with his constant &quot;foot on the monitor&quot; poses and lip synching of Bruce Dickinsons singing, but, cut Steve some slack, he is the main songwriter of this band and displays some credible talent in this aspect. He wrote 70 songs after all.<br />Bruce Dickinson doesn't falter an inch. His pipes are clean and crisp with good energy. Nico McBrain is great, laying down the drum lines which bring the other players together to create some memorable songs, ie. &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot;. You try playing that song on your guitar, bass or drums. ha. not!<br />The best things I like about Iron Maiden is that they are my age, and they can rock better than the talent that are dotting the rock/metal scene these days. No comparisons. (Well, Metallica is coming back to their roots).<br />I find myself collecting DVDs now that display the ever- disappearing talent from the groups of the 60's through the 80's. Clapton, Stevie Ray, Deep Purple, Queen, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath. Zepplin,  and now, Maiden.<br />Yeah, I know, its from my era, but really, where is the talent now compared to the bands from that time period?<br />Sum 41? Blink 182? Linkin Park?..... I don't think so.<br />Rock on Iron Maiden, and thanks!ath. Zepplin,  and now, Maiden.<BR>Yeah, I know, its from my era, but really, where is the talent now compared to the bands from that time period? <BR>Sum 41? Blink 182? Linkin Park?..... I don't think so.<br />Rock on Iron Maiden, and thanks!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I really love it! I just saw Erykah play live yesterday. She is so amazing...
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys you have done it again. This CD is just as good, wait it's better than her first. She has grown into such a wonderful artist and her music truly shows it. I can't explain how much I love it, I just do. Everyone else on here can't be wrong, if you don't own it you're missing out!<BR>Some of my favs: Karma, Heartburn, If I Was Your Woman/Walk on By, You Don't Know my Name, Diary.. oh heck the whole album. :)
B000002NHN|5.0|About 5 years ago I also heard the song &quot;The Mummer's Dance,&quot; play on a local radio station.  After that I began a pursuit to find out who the artist was, and when I was 16 I finally bought this album (I am now 21).  Even after listening to it over and over countless times throughout the years I've had it, I still love it, and listen to it often still, along with many of Loreena's other albums and various selections I enjoy.  In this album you'll find an excellent blend of the Celtic and Middle Eastern cultures, as the artist loves to travel and write her songs from her inspirations influenced by what she sees and hears on her journey.  Other albums from her such as &quot;The Mask and Mirror,&quot; feature more of the Middle East and Spain, while &quot;Elemental,&quot; among others carry sounds from Ireland, Scotland, and England.  In one of her Christmas albums &quot;To Drive the Cold Winter Away,&quot; the recording of the album was actually done in a monastery (I forget the location.)  But no matter the album, or the locale, Loreena Mckennitt brings with her sounds of the world traveled over....
B0000AMJED|5.0|I have nothing but good comments about 2 Fast 2 Furious. It was much better than the last &quot;Furious&quot; movie. Cliffhangers came around every corner, death surrendered to no one, and the cars were completely &quot;tricked-out.&quot; Even I, a major tech person, loved this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a DVD for a keeper.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania and her bandmates look and sound fantastic! They make such an excellent ensemble and their performance in this concert is worth every penny. What a performer! What a dvd! Shania moves around a lot So there is a lot of action to see. From moving around on stage with the band to making her way down into the audience. Shania knows how to pull a crowd into the show So even if you weren't there you'll definitely get the full concert experience. The editing could have been better. The sound quality is good especially if you listen to this dvd with headphones on. For the diehard fan a must!
0385504209|1.0|Could Dan Brown use more adjectives?  I thought I would throw the book across the room if he used &quot;famous&quot; one more time.  His writing style read more like a freshman college student's first attempt at creative writing than an author published several times over.<br />The only intriguing part of the novel was the historical description of the Holy Grail mystery.  The &quot;suspense&quot; part of the book was so transparent, I was many steps beyond the purportedly brilliant scholars every inch of the way.  I found this book very difficult to continue to read, but was forced to only because it was a selection for our book club.  I wouldn't read another of his books.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain's DVD makes the perfect holiday gift. Shania is a high-energy, high-quality performer. Now, everyone can appreciate her. Get this DVD!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|You can't go wrong by buying Shania Twain's Up Live in Chicago DVD. Everyone is sure to enjoy Shania's Up-beat songs. Fans of all ages can appreciate her undeniable talent and charisma. Shania goes out of her way to reach her fans, and with this DVD, you'll feel like she's singing to you right there in your living room.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd would make a great holiday gift, it has shania singing most all her hits, at least the biggest ones and a lot of new songs off her cd UP.  Her energy is awesome, it gets you pumped and going you won't be dissapointed if you order this item.
0375703861|5.0|I loved this book, it was funny, heartwarming, and wonderfully inventive.  Zadie Smith has this amazing way of creating very distinct and interesting characters, with surprizingly vibrant lives.  I especially like the way she can take a mundane detail (like a man recieving letters from someone he barely even knows) and make it mystical.  I think that everyone who loves books should read this one, it is absolutely lovely.
0385504209|1.0|Short chapters (about 100), twists and turns, cliffhangers and one dimensional characters in a plot that winds around a premise so artificially taut that eventually you feel like you have been catapulted  back in time to a black and white Hardy Boys movie matinee. Cheap thrills, mystery, intrigue...but none of it comes together in any satisfactory fashion. Save your money.
B000068PQ0|5.0|2002 brought the Year of Yoshimi to the Lips and more critical accolades. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots takes a look at what it means to be human in our current mechanized age and our relation, man and machine, to the universe. Though a much lighter and optimistic release than The Soft Bulletin, it remains nonetheless prescient in our world. Yoshimi opens with \\"Fight Test\\" with Lips' frontman Wayne Coyne examining what is worth fighting for, and how far should we take things in this life. The contrast between the lyrical content and traditional pop structure of this song with the electronic noises interspersed throughout speaks to this dichotomy of living in the mechanized age as it questions what we should do for ourselves, and what we should have others, be they machines or humans, do for us. Of course, I've always felt that \\"Fight Test\\" and its singsong melody was ironically a banjo away from being a classic country tune. \\"One More Robot/Symphony 3000-21\\" looks at the human/machine contrast more directly with it's chorus, \\"One more robot learns to be / Something more than a machine / When it tries the way it does / Makes it seem like it can love.\\" Guided along by a hypnotic bass line melody, various vocal effects continue this throughout the song sounding as if it is a love song to the robot itself from its human creator closing with rather heavenly synth keyboard and harp effects. Humanity has become infatuated with our creations, their gifts, and ability to mimic human life. \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1\\" continues in the singsong vein of \\"Fight Test.\\" Beginning with an almost start-stop variation on the track's melody, here we have humanity taking the robots head-on. Personified as humanity, Yoshimi's decided that we are worth fighting for \\"so she's taking lots of vitamins / cause she knows that it'd be tragic if those evil robots win.\\" The mechanization of \\"One More Robot\\"'s bass line has been replaced with a simple guitar strum, a deep kick drum,and more pointed synth effects. The instrumental \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 2\\" follows with Yoshimi's screams dominating the bulk of the track following the falling bass notes of the melody. She struggles to make it through all the background noise and voices getting in the way of her attempts to make it to the fore mix of the track. Is Yoshimi victorious? Has she lost the race for the prize? Have we lost to our own \\"evil-natured robots programmed to destroy us?\\" <br />\\"In the Morning of the Magicians\\" may hold the answer to those questions, or does it? Opening up in a sleepy haze questioning \\"what is love and what is hate / the calculations error,\\" the track slowly builds as the \\"dawn began to break\\" with Yoshimi surrendering to the universe \\"too powerful to master.\\" It seems we have been defeated by our own devices. \\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell\\" reveals that humanity has in fact defeated itself in hopes that these machines would love us as Coyne sings \\"I was wanting you to love me / But your love it never came / All the other love around me / Was just wasting all away.\\" We've gotten so focused on our struggle with becoming more \\"advanced\\" by increasing the mechanization and automation of society, that we lost all sight, touch, and love, of each other. The realization of this loss and the increasing distance comes into focus with \\"Are You a Hypnotist??\\" as we realize \\"I am a stranger now amongst all the recognized / What is this? / Are you some kind of hypnotist??\\" We've become hypnotized by our creations, our machines, and our ability to create these beasts that we've darkened what is truly important, each other, with \\"the sun eclipse behind the cloud.\\" \\"It's Summertime (Throbbing Orange Pallbearers)\\" recognizes the sadness of this event, with its strange mix of musical optimism and malaise, as we're left only seeing a \\"self-reflected inner sadness\\" as the throbbing orange pallbearers rise and fall with the day. \\"Do You Realize??\\" opens with a digitally altered voice and one of the most simplest and stunning lyrics in all of pop music: \\"Do you realize / That you have the most beautiful face??\\" Apparently humanity has won, we felt the loss of our brother in the previous two tracks and we're all just part of the universe's big master plan, the machines, us, all of us, and how infinitely small we are in comparison to that which is beyond our comprehension. The booming gong, slightly echoed guitar, and airy vocals create an otherworldly effect showing our relationship to the universe. Despite this realization of our minute scale to the grand scheme of things, there is still hope and \\"everyone you know someday will die / and instead of saying all of your goodbyes / let them know you realize that life goes fast / it's hard to make the good things last / you realize the sun doesn't go down / it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round.\\" \\"All We Have Is Now\\" shows the effects of this postrealization and teaches us how we should act, \\"you and me were never meant to be part of the future / all we have is now / all we've ever had was now,\\" and with that, we've come to terms that we should live for today, live for ourselves, live for each other, live for love. Tomorrow might never come, don't worry about improving the machines for coming generations, don't worry about improving tomorrow; improve yourself for today. Closing the disc is the instrumental (and Grammy-winning) \\"Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)\\" as we glide along above looking back on it all, the trumpets blare with pride and joy of our newfound love for ourselves, each other, and the world.<br />Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is one of the masterpieces of our time and a work that while the songs themselves are instantly hummable, the grand themes of take a little longer to enjoy. Perhaps it might take a universe of time to achieve full comprehension of Yoshimi's aims, but we don't have that time, we've got forty-seven and one-half minutes, so we must do with it what we can.
B00002MZ12|4.0|I just downloaded this off  Itunes (hey, it's cheaper and no shipping).  The tracks I've listened to are just phenomenal -- the quality of the acoustics is really high and audience noise is at a minimum (which is why some live discs just bother me -- if I can't even hear the song because of 1000s of screaming fans, why bother?).  The cover of 'king of pain' is worth the price of admission alone.  And 'uninvited' sounds better than ever - it remains, for me, her best song.  Needless to say, Alanis's voice is as emotion-drenched as ever and she acquits herself well in a live setting.<br />No THANK YOU PERU (err, hon, it's Brazil) debacles.<br />If you like her, you won't be disappointed.  If she's not your favorite, this might suprise you.  Try it.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I once considered myself a serious McLachlan fan, thoroughly enjoying such albums as Solance, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Rareties, B-sides, and Other stuff.  However, I cannot express the disappointment of her latest effort, Afterglow.  Clearly an afterglow is all that is left of her once unique and creative songwriting. I can not even force myself to listen to the album even once through completely.  Sarah seems utterly dull on this album and lacks emotion as well as any creativity with her lyrics.  Additionally, the string arrangements are shallow and do not compliment the music or McLachlan's beautiful voice.  It's such a shame.  Do yourself a favor and buy Leona Naess's latest self-titled CD instead.
0393057658|5.0|I am not a baseball fan nor am I much of a sports fan at all, but I loved this book.  I review mainly business books and the business principles of this book are well stated, easy to understand and truly innovative.  If you are in a field that tracks statistics (especially the non-profit world) this book will make you think!  But be careful, it will also make you question!  Moneyball gets you outside the box (scores) of baseball and if you are a decent interpreter it will help you get out the box in your profession.  Highly recommended!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This album is the same Britney as we have known since she emerged in '99. Lyrics that are as deep as a kiddie-pool, and not to mention, she sings through her nose worse than any artist I've heard. The songs on this album are pretty good, I must admit. I have heard better though.<br />Parents are to be warned to not let their kids hear a few songs on this CD. The most risque ones are &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; and &quot;Touch of My Hand.&quot; Who writes a song about masturbating anyway? It's already been done before, Brit. :)<br />I gave this album 4 stars. The music is good for driving in your car down the road, or to set a certain mood, but nothing that will ever earn rave reviews. Maybe Britney needs to get a new vocal coach, because she really needs to learn how to sing. Her voice is incomparable to Kelly Clarkson and Christina Aguilera...<br />If you're curious, or just a fan, buy it, you'll be happy, especially if you're really into the whole POP scene. :D
B0000C0FJB|1.0|The sound quality is so bad, it could easily be taken for a bootleg made with a hand-held casette recorder.  The music is muddied by stadium reverb and crowd noise.  It is often difficult to make out the vocals or any particular instrument at any given time.  I think even die hard Rush fans will be disappointed.  There is some novelty to owning a bootleg, even if the sound quality is poor, but an official release?  Give me a break.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|As soon I as have received my DVD, I started watching it. And I could hardly stop doing it... It is really a wonderful DVD from the package itself to its contents. Definitely a masterpiece to all George's fans throughtout the world. I have watched both DVDs 1 and 2 entirely and enjoyed so much.<br />There is NO weak point in the show - from the Indian music session to George's great songs beatifully performed by his long time pals like Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and many many others. Tom Petty was astonishedly great, Billy Preston was playing with great joy and happiness (as always), Anoushka Shankar (Ravi Shankar's daughter) played wonderfully the sitar solo in the beautiful song &quot;Your Eyes&quot;, and Joe Brown was divine in &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams&quot; - it was the final number and as he was singing, what seemed to be yellow and red petals were falling down from Albert Hall's roof throughtout the theater.<br />Monty Pytton has also a hilarious performance - even my kids have watched it over and over again...<br />Other highlights: Horse to the Water - as far as I know, the last song composed and recorded by George (with his son Dhani) for Jools Holland CD. It seems it was the first time this (beautiful) song was presented in a live performance. Unfortunetely this is the only song in the entire show which is not included in the Concert for George CD (God knows why!!).<br />After many many years another old friend showed up to play in a couple of songs: Klaus Voormann... But hardly noticed because he was positioned behind several other guitarists on the stage.<br />Certainly this one now is one of my favorite DVDs and one of my favorite shows as well. Worth every penny, cent or whatever money you are dealing with.
0784011710|4.0|If you want to see why many people think that Meryl Streep is the greatest film actress on the planet, this is the film to see. The scene where she recalls her 'choice' is absolutely astonishing. It is very difficult to watch, in the same way of  the Russian Roulette scene in the rier hut in 'The Deer Hunter'. I rate 'Sophie' as a 4, only because it is so intense and really only suited for adults.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Coldplay: Live 2003 is a premise I really like. It's a live CD that also comes with a DVD of the same set (with five extra tracks).<br />If you haven't heard of Coldplay or just don't know too much about them, this isn't a bad album to get as it features the best stuff off their last two albums. However, you'd probably be better served getting &quot;Parachutes&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; first.<br />If you are a fan of Coldplay, there isn't really much I can say. Either you feel you want to have a concert DVD or you don't. And that's really the way you should look at it. The price is worth it for the concert DVD alone. The CD is just bonus so you can listen to the concert in places where you may not have a DVD player available (in the car, CD walkman, etc..)<br />The fact remains that Coldplay is one of the best bands to come out in recent times, and this DVD/CD set has some of their best stuff in a well performed and nicely produced live set.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is one Fantasistic CD by the Beatles. It is one CD that you will feel glad that you bought it. The songs are: Get Back, Dig A Pony, For You Blue, The Long and Winding Road, Two of Us, I've Got A Feeling, One After 909, Don't Let Me Down, I Me Mine, Across the Universe, and Let It Be. My favorite song is Don't Let Me Down. Since Phil Spector is in trouble for murder, I guess whoever thought of doing this was very smart. The songs Dig A Pony, I've Got A Feeling, One After 909, and Don't Let Me Down were recorded in the famous rooftop jam. This album also comes with a bonus disc &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; with jams of Can You Dig it?, Don't Let me Down, Sun King, Every Little Thing, Get Back, and much more. This will be one CD that you will want to listen to again and again.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney is an artisits that does what she has to do to sell albums, sorry for her not being like Christina Aguilera by being naked on her cover and singing about depressing subjects. Britney's album is great it makes you move when you listen to her song. This album is the best one she put out so far and YOU SHOULD BUY cause your NOT WASTING YOUR MONEY as others said you would. This album has catchy songs and their more techno and clubby. So for all you haters out there get a new hobbie and get over Britney. Shes here to stay.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I always wondered why the extended versions of the movies were never shown in theaters.  I'm certain die-hard fans of Lord of the Rings would have been willing to sit through the three plus hours.  You're definitely getting your money's worth.  But it wouldn't have been logistically possible to do so in time and understandably so.  The extras on Disc 3 and 4 has several interviews from cast and crew showing the time-intensive detail put into making the Two Towers.  They were literally making changes within a couple of weeks of their due date.  Clearly, the Two Towers was much more difficult to finalize than Fellowship of the Ring.  Nonetheless, the hard work was well worth the effort, and these DVDs has made me appreciate the challenges of film-making. I applaud Peter Jackson's ingenuity in keeping the focus with these movies and successfully forging them into the most cohesive epic story ever put on film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Thanks to ITZ i'm now a major Britney Spears fan.Alot of reviews term Brit to be nothing but a bimbo who's fifteen minutes of fame somehow got prolonged but i thought we were reviewing the album and not the artist as a person???!!!So what if she wears little pieces of so-called clothing and lap dances on the stage?At least she's a good entertainer.So what if she doesn't have a voice like Christina Aguilera,style like Jennifer Aniston and a personality like Jessica Simpson?She is who she is and we can't expect her to be someone else.Many other entertainers do worse stuff than she does but they seldom get blasted by the public the way she does.When i pay for a CD or a concert i don't give a damn what the artist does ,i pay for the music/entertainment.I personally cannot do better than she does so i wouldn't diss her and most people dissing her fail to give her a chance and &quot;actually listen&quot; to her music.In The Zone is a very good effort by Britney,she's experimented with different genres of music to come up with something fun and enjoyable for people who are party lovers and can relate to her tracks.It's true that this album is not for preteens/teens,it's for more mature people and although the songs have no real morals they're great in fair perspective.I am a music lover who listens to everything from heavy metal to hiphop and oldies.I'm open minded and i can handle this type of music.I'm also 16 years old and i find no problem with her songs.I think that Toxic,MATM (remix),Showdown,The hook up,Shadow,Everytime and Breathe on me are very cool tracks.All of the songs are potential singles and they're like candy to your ears.I would definitely recommend this CD to people who have flexible mentalites and are fed up with slow boring songs and ready for something new.Two thumbs up to Britney!
B000089RVX|5.0|This band shows incredible promise and I am happy to see that they are getting recognition.  The male-female duet suggests a classical style of music: exactly the way I like it.  Most of the pop/metal bands I enjoy have heavy classical influences:  how else could I justify liking both Evanescence and Megadeth? :-)<br />Other female rock vocalists I like are Liesje Sadonius (Hooverphonic's first album), Mari Anne Braeden (Green Apple Quickstep) and Sara McLachlan.  In some ways Amy Lee's voice sounds similar: sweet, mellow and vulnerable.  <br />Hopefully Evanescence will be able to follow up with more great albums.  Other bands with sudden fame could never come close to their debuts like Dishwalla and 3 Doors Down.  Evanescance has a good range.  The music flows from dark, quiet piano and vocal pieces like Hello and My Immortal to the all-out rock of Going Under and Bring Me To Life, and everything in between like Taking Over Me and My Last Breath.  <br />If all goes well they will realize the advantage they have of exploring all of these styles and they won't fall into the trap of choosing to play only pop or only rock.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The In The Zone Cd Totally Rules! Britney Is Gonna Be Around For Along Time Thank God! For Britney What More Could Anyone Ask For She's Hot!

B00006RU5B|5.0|I'm showing my age a little bit here, but for a good cause:  I can't get into rap, and to me the new metal sounds like chords and growling.  Godsmack is OK.  Metallica is trying to win their old fans with St. Anger -- but forgot to include guitar solos.  Pearl Jam is falling into an awful abyss with Vedder's mic turned up trying to sound like Neil Young and Gossard pounding the strings as if he would rather be somewhere else.    It's a dark reminder that Mad Season was long ago, Temple of the Dog even farther back.  Tool is still kicking around, but there are some long breathers between releases.  Slayer and Anthrax are keeping the pulse...  Mostly I miss Soundgarden.    Rare and brilliant gems appear here and there in time, like Audioslave.  These efforts make the drive to work bearable.  They give you something to talk about with your friends.  They smooth over bad new releases that leave you feeling ripped off.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Listening to his voice is just pure bliss.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|&quot;Thirteenth Step,&quot; I know &quot;Mer de Noms,&quot; and you are no &quot;Mer de Noms.&quot;<br />Historically 2nd albums are usually an artist's worst.  While I hope there will be another, I also hope that this proves to be their worst.  This album wanders aimlessly.
B00009TB5G|5.0|In the tradition of Aliens and Godfather II, many would say that Jackson's &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the next contender for a sequel that surpasses the original.  As great as &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is, TTT is an even closer adaptation to Tolkien's book, and comes out as abetter film.  The battle sequence at Helm's Deep rivals that of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, which is amazing considering that most of it is computer-generated.<br />As for the DVD, the Platinum Series Special Extended Edition is the best buy, for all fans. For only an additional $8, this DVD is loaded with extras not contained on the original Widescreen edition. The commentaries alone make the extended version a must-have, and when you add in the 43 extra minutes of footage and all of the other bonuses fatured on this disc, it comes to one of the best DVD buys of any film.  It's almost as if the producers had a roadmap for this DVD when crating the film and looked for things to add to it while they were creating Jackson's masterpiece.
B000031XCR|4.0|What? Of course she is! Everyone and their dog knows this. If you don't think so, I suggest you take one listen to the first track, The Power Of Love. If that doesn't convince you, try one of the biggest songs in history, My Heart Will Go On. Celine is undisputedly awesome and this CD compiles her hits- well, some of them. There are some notables missing like Tell Him, All By Myself and a few more. And my favorite oldy-but-goody Where Does My Heart Beat Now is not on here. I definitely could've done without I'm Your Angel with that non-talented, freaky, no good, gasbag R.Kelly. That dude is a disgrace to Celine and anyone who comes within five miles of him. Of course, she wouldn't have done anything with the jerk if we knew then what we know now. I like this CD but I don't understand why they left out some of her most important hits but included mediocre songs like If You Asked Me To and Love Can Move Mountains. And, I have to say, the new(they were new then)songs aren't that hot. She should've released a full length greatest hits with only a couple of the new ones, like All The Way with Frank Sinatra. That one's pretty good. But don't get me wrong, this CD is still great.
B00005BL2A|4.0|i listened to DM for over 15 years<BR>when this one was released i ignored it and just listened to the singles <BR>then one day i decided to just go ahead and buy it to complete my DM discography....<BR>i listend to the cd a few times and i was not concentrating on it , just letting it play in the back ground as i was playing video games<BR>then last night i went for a drive and played the cd in the car<BR>..it was very dark, which is the beat atmosphere for DM<BR>WOW this is good stuff<BR>lyricaly it is good.....but then martin wrote everything there...still i emjoyed the words, the music, the production..the whole thing<BR>i am not stuck in viaolator<BR>i am a believer in DM and they still rock and amazing band<BR>i recomend live in paris DVD with this cd
B000002C4J|4.0|My Heart Will Go On- need I say more? This CD is amazing like you'd expect a Celine CD to be. Some of the songs are a bit weak but the majority of them are wonderful. My favorite Celine song ever is included on this disc, To Love You More. Oh my God. If you haven't heard this one, you've got to pick up this disc or the single. It is also available on All The Way: A Decade Of Song but it isn't as good because it is edited. Celine's vocals are out of this world on there. Then again, her vocals are out of this world on most of her songs- but especially on To Love You More. Another favorite of mine is Immortality, her collaboration with the legendary Bee Gees. It is so beautiful. After repeated listenings, Miles To Go (Before I Sleep)eventually became one of my faves. It took me five years to start liking the hit duet with Babs(whom I don't get at all) Tell Him. And I still only like the last minute of it. Why don't I get Barbara Streisand? Well, for one thing, if Celine had've been around back when she started she wouldn't have had a prayer of being successful. Her singing erks me, she can't act- and the fact that she is one of those dreadful liberal Hollywood elites doesn't help. The Reason starts the CD on a bad note. Don't like it at all. There is the R&amp;B/semi hip-hop laden track Treat Her Like A Lady, which I really liked at first but has now began to sound silly. Come on, Celine isn't a R&amp;B singer and if she were chances are I wouldn't like her. Us is an extremely powerful song that escaped my ear forever and then I finally began to listen to it. It's great. There are some other okay songs but those are the standouts. Like I said at the top, this CD has My Heart Will Go On, one of the best songs ever recorded. Buy this CD, not the Titanic soundtrack! If you're a Celine fan you know you ought to have this CD, so buy it now... And if you aren't yet a Celine fan- where have you been? Come on- best singer in the world isn't enough to convince ya? Let's Talk About Love is a must have!out Love is a must have!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I love Soundgarden, I love Rage. Audioslave is the best of both worlds. It took me a few listens to get adjusted to the new sound, but the album keeps getting better every time I listen to it. There isn't a single filler song here. I find that the best bands take more than one listen to appreciate. Heck, I didn't like Soundgarden and Rage when I first heard them, but now they are two of my favorite bands ever. Chris Cornell has one of the most expressive voices I ever heard. To really appreciate the greatness that is Audioslave, you need to put their CD in a good stereo system and crank it up loud!
B000002BHE|4.0|Celine Dion makes music like no one else can. This is the CD that spawned the number one hit Because You Loved Me- and if that isn't enough to make you want to buy this, I don't know what is. That is an incredible song and so are the other thirteen. Other hits such as All By Myself(amazing) and It's All Coming Back To Me Now also contribute to the vitality of this disc. Two other great songs that I just can't get enough of are Make You Happy and Call The Man. Call The Man is an awesome faith song and it's not one of those crazy yell-at-the-top-of-your-lungs gospel things either. Her vocals are amazing on this one as with the entire CD. I mean, what else is there to say? Everything Celine Dion makes is worth buying.
B000065VA1|4.0|&quot;So&quot; is the most upbeat and optimistic-sounding of all of Peter Gabriel's albums--Genesis included--and contains his most commercial set of songs, so it's no wonder why it remains the overwhelming favorite among critics and listeners to this day.<BR>For those who are attracted to PG's darker, artier works, however, &quot;So&quot; may sound like a heavily manicured piece of pop fluff, drowned in (to these ears) dated 80s production values<BR>and featuring some songs (&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;Big Time&quot;) so far removed from Gabriel's actual musical style that this is probably as close as he came to the term &quot;sell-out&quot;.<br />Nonetheless, Gabriel's genius is such that the album does not emerge as a total washout.  &quot;Red Rain&quot; is a graceful, richly melodic track that anchors the beginning of the album, while both &quot;Mercy Street&quot; and &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; are quiet, haunting and infused with world-music touches (&quot;Mercy Street&quot; remains one of my favorite songs, actually).  The production on these is simpler and therefore less grating than on such light confections as &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, which aren't terrible (who can deny the catchiness of either tune?) but the 80s dance-pop sound captured here simply does not remind one of the &quot;real&quot; Gabriel captured on &quot;The Lamb&quot;, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; or &quot;Passion&quot;; ironically, their popularity is so overwhelming that most fans continue to primarily identify him with these two tracks (FWIW, the extended 7-minute version of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is superior to the album cut).  Elsewhere, we have the uplifting ballad &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; (one of the better cuts and again very popular, although I'll take &quot;Blood Of Eden&quot; over this any day), more 80s dance hits like &quot;Big Time&quot; and <BR>a reject from the abandoned &quot;Mozo&quot; concept, &quot;That Voice Again&quot;. <BR>Overall, &quot;So&quot; remains a must-purchase, if only to hear what the fuss is about.  Nearly every song has achieved popularity, which to some makes it a very consistent album.  But for those fans who want the darker, edgier, stuff, only &quot;Red Rain&quot;, &quot;Mercy Street&quot; and &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; will satisfy this time around.  &quot;Us&quot; would mark a superior mix of his commercial and artistic sides, with that &quot;big 80s&quot; production (the headache-inducing drum machines, dance rhythms and metallic reverb) muffled or absent.
0060245867|5.0|This is a SUPER book for your toddler.  The illustrations are so vivid and endearing!  The story is all about a helpful little boy that tries to please a mouse that wants to eat a cookie.  This leads to one thing after another (moms will totally understand this concept) and by the end of the book, the little boy is so exhausted helping the mouse he's ready to collapse.  I loved this book as much as my son did and we read this off and on for several years - a perfect snuggle up book before bed!
0790729369|2.0|Here we find Clint Eastwood playing Robert Kincaid, a National Geographic photographer who is taking pictures of covered bridges in Iowa. He meets Franchesca, a housewife who is bored out of her mind while her family is away at the county fair. The two have a 4-day affair that is supposed have you pull out your hankerchiefs and sob your eyes out. I was trying to keep my eyes open! <br />I never was a fan of love stories, and this movie also tries to send a message that true love only happens once in a lifetime, and it doesn't involve marriage. I don't like the fact that this movie portrays an affair as being more sacred then marriage. I can understand that Franchesca was bored and needed a change, but don't you think she went a little too far?<br />The movie drags, REALLY drags! The opening sequence with her children going through her personal files is so slow that you keep forgetting why you are watching this movie. Most of the scenes are long and very tiring. The rest of the movie yields much of the same, and only the change between scenes keeps you from dosing off. I have been to Iowa, and I agree that the scenery is nice and peaceful, but maybe too peaceful.<br />Clint Eastwood does fill in a good role as Kincaid, and I can understand if he was trying to open up to a new audience, that being women. This movie does show us the Romeo side of Dirty Harry I guess. There is nothing wrong with trying something new, but I hope Eastwood never does anything like this again.
B00009TB5G|5.0|As in the case of the Fellowiship of the Ring, the Two Towers is equally, if not more, AMAZING! A sure must for all! Well done Peter Jackson!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is a story told from the point of view of a shockingly self-obsessed girl who finds her poor li'l ol' self stranded in Tokyo Japan. Her hatred for women is shown to us (through her first-person eyes) as a parade of moderately retarded bimbos and an occasional prostitute, punctuated by a sweetheart of a man who is, of course, the victim of yet another bitchy woman. Even this sweetheart (played by Bill Murray) is portrayed as virtuous in precisely only those instances where his interests intersect with the interests of our neglected Princess.<br />Our poor protagonist has a husband who, like the other women in the movie, is written to be stupid, cardboard, insensitive and prone to inexplicable fits of protracted misunderstanding. Our Princess is also written to have a degree in philosophy and a penchant for knitting - both tokens of *depth* as prop-ish as the hotel wallpaper only more contrived and not as pretty. The racist elements of the movie are shown against the backdrop of a hip soundtrack. The soundtrack wins, giving the audience the moral permission to laugh without feeling boorish.<br />Long, tedious shots of the winsome girl staring out her hotel window at the sprawling city - which to her is merely a mosaic painted on the window of her hotel/prison - mean to give us a sense of her emotional despair. The cure, Gobs of Attention, is disguised in more palatable forms for ticketholders. Even a trip to the Buddhist temple doesn't move her. Hadn't anyone warned her that monks don't fawn? But the requisite Gobs of Attention eventually come from Murray and this almost makes Princess happy.<br />Of course this dismal story is told from the perspective of the dismal Princess - consequently, the retarded bimbo, cardboard boyfriend, me-so-hoe-nee prostitute, bucktoothed Japanese folk and all the rest of her projections are submitted as \\"givens\\" in the screenplay. Her self-obsession is absent from her self-awareness and is therefore absent from the surface of the script, and so forth. What we get is a view of the world from \\"behind the eyes\\" of a Spoiled Snot who doesn't realize that's what she's letting us see. The view? Pretty damned lonely. We're supposed to blame this on her various projections. Some moviegoers actually do. They're the ones who click \\"NO\\" on Was-This-Review-Helpful?<br />By the time Princess receives her panacea, the audience has been bludgeoned into submission and says \\"Thank you sir\\" for a spoonful of some mighty thin gruel. Tears and cheers are finally milked from the teenage girls. Then the credits roll.<br />Bill Murray is outstanding, nonetheless.<br />Ms. Copolla uses this movie to show us how she would like us to see her - which is different from how she sees herself - which is also different from how she actually IS.script, and so forth.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This collection delivers a pretty good explanation as to why the Beatles sold over 1 billion records to date!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|First of all, her new cd is great! and EVERY SONG on this cd is good. Its way better than all her other cd's, its a new britney sound its up-tempo but quiet which makes it amazing. I could put this cd to put me to sleep or to cram on at a party, yes its that good!. Well this album has done well for a reason and its simply she's made a perfect album and her best, and i'm not even a fan of her old stuff, i just liked this cd.
B00005JMF6|1.0|I have been a fan of all Dark Castle Productions past films. I couldn't wait to see this one and I wish I had.  The film had a poor script.  The acting from most EVERYONE involved surly was not top notch, although Mr. Downey DID pull his own weight.  I left when the film was over, and wish I would have seen ELF instead.  I want my money back.

B000002NC4|5.0|Combines some of the best parts of Sonic Youth (one crucial band that I don't think has been mentioned in these reviews but is no doubt an influence), Pavement, Frank Black and/or Bossanova-era Pixies, Elephant 6 stuff, and My Bloody Valentine into their own breed of sound. THey sound closest to Pavement, but one thing these guys have that Pavement never quite ventured into is that all the songs are long, thought-out epics with hook after hook of beautiful guitar melodies. Lyrically, Martsch seems very bitter and/or introspective, at times very cynical. Anyway, this is an awesome cd that I think any fan of the above-named bands would enjoy.
6304696566|5.0|John Wayne plays the anti-hero Ethan Edwards who returns undefeated and unrepentant three years after the defeat of the Confederacy to the family ranch in Texas.  Soon after his arrival the ranch is raided by Commanches, the family murdered and Ethans young niece is kidnapped.  The rest of the movie portrays Ethans five-year quest for his niece. <br />In a real sense, Ethans search for his niece is reminisence of  Melvilles Moby Dick.  The relentless pursuit of the white whale represents not only Ahabs vengeance against the animal for taking his leg, but also an attempt to pursue and defeat the God who allowed this misfortune to happen.   Thus, Ahab abandons all reason in his monomaniacal thirst for revenge.  The chase becomes more than a whaling story for in killing Moby Dick Ahab is avenging himself against God; but in the end Ahab and his crew perishes before the White God.   Compare this to Ethans monomaniacal pursuit to kill Scarface, the chief who lead the raiding party that killed Ethans family and to rescue his niece.  Ethan abandons reason and gives into blind hatred- shooting the eyes out of a dead Indian, taking parting shots at retreating Indians when everyone else has stopped firing, killing the buffalo so Indian families will starve and threatening to kill his own niece who has been defiled by the Indians. This is more than a search and rescue mission- it is Ethans attempt to come to grips with the defeat of the Confederacy, to gain victory where he has only known defeat.  It is more than a story of vengeance.  It is a story of a man facing his prejudice and blind hatred of the Indians. Ethan does not directly battle God, but he battles the inner demons that plague him. In the end, unlike Ahab, he finds redemption.  He rescues his niece and as the family enters the home to celebrate the reunion, Ethan turns and leaves.  He is alone, but he is at peace with himself.
B000002MZ9|4.0|8 years later, this CD holds up brilliantly. Young was certainly intoxicated by the breath of fresh, extremely competent and challenging musicianship that Pearl Jam offered him, much as he was by the power trio of the FREEDOM CD. How much Crazy Horse can one man take? In any case, as a band, not just a leader with a pack of bungling sidekicks, Young and Pearl Jam deliver one of the best CDs of his career. There are some truly great numbers here: \\"Peace and Love\\", \\"I'm the Ocean\\" (which would resurface on GREENDALE as \\"Be the Rain\\"), \\"Throw Your Hatred Down\\" (which resonates more profoundly given the current geo-political crises) are absolutely classic Young songs on a level with \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"Powderfinger\\". The throwaway cut here is \\"Downtown,\\" which at the time was the \\"hit.\\" He needs to lay off anything that might even suggest Danny Whitten.<BR>The rest is amazing stuff and seems to suggest that in the effort to somehow validate ourselves via the fetishization fans embrace for rock stars, or for that matter any icon of the cult of personality, we lose sight of what is so precious about our own lives, become tranfixed and mesmerized by the glittering lights bouncing off the mirror ball. Extend that to a national scope and it becomes a pandemic of nationalistic narcissism, which of course begets the cultural wars fed by isolationist persecution complexes.Well, maybe I'm reading a bit into this. Truth is, there was a time Young could inspire you to think. Anyway, for those who just want to rock and roll, this will do it for you. Young would find additional inspiration in his return to Crazy Horse, although his return to CSN would actual deaden his focus. The guy who eschewed the pop stardom of HARVEST, would somehow seek it out at the end of the nineties. At this point, though, Neil was firing on all burners and this is a great, great testament to a songwriter justifying his reputation.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|An extraordinary concert - musically, sonically, and visually. I started it at 11pm on the night of the blizzard, thinking I'd just start it, watch the best bits, and continue the next day.  But I couldn't stop watching. This is a concert for the ages.<br />First, for those of us who have never adapted to the MTV geenration's style of quick cuts and multiple angles, it's a pleasure to see camerawork with long slow cuts, intelligently placed. You get a &quot;you are there&quot; experience. From the musicans' point of view on stage, through extraordinary &quot;overview&quot; shots of this gorgeous hall. Sonically, the mix is sensational. If you see/hear this concert projected in a &quot;home theater&quot; environment with a fine 5.1 system you will be very, very pleased. Every instrument is clearly placed, there is a rock solid bass, vocals are up front, close your eyes and you can still &quot;see it&quot;. But you really need to see the visual images of these guys to appreciate the music they made. For many of us, these are our contemporary rock heroes. And for many, there is no hiding the years that have passed.<br />It opens with Eric Clapton's noble introduction (apparantly edited to omit his mistaken reference to &quot;George's wife Dhani&quot; the latter being his son. (Paul McC. later reminded him of his mistake on stage - tacky Sir Paul, very tacky.  This too, has been editted out) An aged Ravi Shanker  - looking very much like the village wise man in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom - opens the concert along with his daughter, seque-ing into a beautiful &quot;The Inner Light&quot; sung by Jeff Lyne. Beautiful. The suite of indian music composed for the occasion sets the tone nicely.  And it reminds us that it was George Harrision who first brought &quot;World Music&quot; into the rock/pop scene.<br />Sam Brown (Joe Brown's daughter) does an absolutely scorching version of Horse To The Water Joe Brown - unknown to most of us stateside fans - a British musician and George ukelale mentor, seems an odd choice to sing Here Comes The Sun, but does the song proud. His closing uke sing-a-long I'll See You In My Dreams will bring tears to your eyes (especially when you see the falling flower petals which accompany it on the DVD)  Ringo  is in fine voice but just a wee bit TOO jovial, thin as a rail, 60s velveteen jacket, constant peace signs, and bouncing and conducting.  Maybe it was nerves.  Everyone else is superb - particularly the magisterial Billy Preston, Eric clapton, and of course, &quot;Our Jeff&quot; Lynn. Gary Brooker's name may elude some of you, but as soon as he begins singing  Old Brown Shoe, you'll probably place the voice - think A Whiter Shade of Pale. Add Jim Keltner, Klaus Voorman (!) on bass, and the incredible one-of-a-kind Ray Cooper on persussion (if you've never seen Ray Cooper live and in action - you're in fora real treat!)  - well, it's a killer band.  All play it straight - solid musicianship on the soundtrack to our lives. It's really great stuff. This one's a keeper.

I am very excited !
B0000E6I1J|5.0|First - Frank Sinatra was always perceived as rather hyperbolic about the song Something (\\"one of the greatest love songs ever written\\"). I'd suggest that it is the performance of Something contained in this DVD/CD that proves Sinatra right. In what has since become a McCartney concert staple, the song begins innocuously enough with McCartney on ukelele, but moments later the full band, with strings, comes in perfectly reproducing The Beatles sound and arrangement. It is literally, a hair raising moment. Hearing it again, one wonders if this recording was The Beatles single greatest pop song song. Heresy, I know - but I do mean it. Utterly simple in lyrical structure, melodically both beautiful and inevitable, and majesterial in arrangement. Frank Sinatra's claim about the song finally seems true.<br /><br />Second, Bob Dylan was invited to play but couldn't make it due to long standing schedule conflicts...this has been noted on Dylan sites. As for the concert itself, this is a great, well recorded disc. Purchase it AFTER seeing the concert on DVD. You need to see the visual images of these folks. Sam Brown (Joe Brown's daughter) did an absolutely scorching version of Horse To The Water in the concert - a pity it couldn't have fit onto the CD \\"due to timing\\". Joe Brown - unknown to most of us stateside fans - a British musician and George ukelale mentor, seems an odd choice to sing Here Comes The Sun, but does the song proud. His closing uke sing-a-long I'll See You In My Dreams will bring tears to your eyes (especially when you see the falling flower petals which accompany it on the DVD) While I disagree with the \\"preening McCartney comments\\" ((he's pretty dignified actually) no one seems to comment on Ringo who is in fine voice but just a wee bit TOO jovial. Everyone else is superb - particularly the magisterial Billy Preston, Eric clapton, and of course, \\"Our Jeff\\" Lynn. Gary Brooker's name may elude some of you, but as soon as he begins singing  Old Brown Shoe, you'll probably place the voice - think A Whiter Shade of Pale. Add Jim Keltner, Klauss Voorman (!) on bass, and the incredible one-of-a-kind Ray Cooper on persussion - well, it's a killer band.  All play it straight - solid musicianship on the soundtrack to our lives. It's really great stuff.  But make sure you watch it too!you'll probably place the voice - think A Whiter Shade of Pale.

B00005JMTQ|5.0|This is Jack Nicholson at his best! It is laughter all the way through, but take a kleenex because you'll be laughing so hard,<BR>you'll cry!<BR>Who'd-a-thunk it with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton?!

B00008J4P5|4.0|I liked this album. The guitar playing is raw, the drumming is loud, the vocals are delightfully abrasive, and the bass is, of course, missing. But The White Stripes have a way of making you not miss that latter. The first few times through &quot;Elephant&quot; is a great listen. The songs are catchy and energetic with enough gritty production to trick you into thinking that &quot;Elphant&quot; is as indie as they come. <br />The problems with &quot;Elephant&quot; is two-fold. The first is, upon multiple listens, it's easy to tell that the album lacks much cohesion. The transition between songs like You've Got Your Hand in Her Pocket and Ball and Biscuit; and Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine and It's True that We Love One Another are questionable. <br />The second is that there isn't much on Elephant that I haven't heard before on previous albums. Elephant might be an elaboration upon their previous work, but it's definitely not a progression. Not that that is a bad thing. Elephant is a very accessible album, perhaps making it good for new fans of the Stripes. Elephant is also most things a good rock album should be: raw and energetic and powerful, and one can only hope that this album will be the gateway that leads many pop and nu-metal fans into the realm of real rock.
B000000W5B|4.0|Indeed!   But after Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Ya-Ya's, Sticky Fingers, and Exile...what the **** COULD they do to follow all THAT up?  Well, despite all the naysayers, this is a FINE, fine piece of music, and, yeah, I am prejudiced, because Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman were still members and Ian Stewart was still there.  OK, that being said, let's look at some of the songs:  I gotta admit, I was a mite...leary of the first track, &quot;Dancing With Mr. D,&quot; because I said, &quot;Uh-oh, Anita's got Keef into this satan **** too heavily.&quot;  And, OF course, Keef, played right INTO that accusation by playing one of the most stink-finger guitar intros ever to open the album.  It wasn't until some years later that I was...enlightened to the fact that the whole album was a sort of &quot;in joke&quot; about Mick fooling around with Angela, David Bowie's wife.  I mean, dig: what's the big hit of the album? Yup, &quot;Angie.&quot;  Musically now, &quot;Dancing&quot; has an amazing bass line, and I can't ascertain whether it's Bill Wyman or Mick Taylor playing it.  Keef's obviously not on the next track, &quot;100 Years Ago,&quot; but, for once, despite his absence, it's a great track.  Billy Preston was - and still IS - a magnificant keyboard player.  Keef, however, DOES show up on the next song, &quot;Comin' Down Again&quot; - fact is, he sings one of his all too rare lead vocals on it.  &quot;Heartbreaker/Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo&quot; is a STOMPER, with some rather grim lyrics about overdosing.  About ten years later, Bryan Adams would rip the chord progression off for &quot;Take Me Back,&quot; which was about the best thing HE ever did. (check it out!) &quot;Angie&quot; was beautiful, yeah - and it made a GREAT video with Keef about to fall over his guitar! - but I'm like Mick, I tend to want to get &quot;love songs&quot; over &amp; out of the way quickly.  &quot;Silver Train&quot; is a track they'd written for Johnny Winter, and truth is, neither of them did it worth a durn, except Mick Taylor displays just WHY the Stones were at their peak while he was with them.  As a slide guitar player, he is one of the best, EVER.  &quot;Hide Your Love&quot; is another stomper, this time with Mick playing piano. The next two tracks, despite differing titles, &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;Can You Hear The Music,&quot; are basically the same song.  BUT THEY SAVED THE VERY BEST FOR LAST!  I'm certain everybody, by now, has heard about Mick &quot;just stamping his little feet, he was so mad&quot; with Ahmet Ertegun about having to rather...&quot;sanitize&quot; the song title.  Just as well, WE knew what he was talking about. And once you hear that &quot;Keef's channeling Chuck Berry&quot; intro with Mick whining &quot;Baby, Ah ben' so sad since you been gawn,&quot; you know you and the Stones are back on terra firma.  Ian Stewart, of course, shines, and, despite the fact that the results were sorta anti-climatic, I'm grateful that the CD cleans up that bit of sludge toward the end of the second verse.  &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot; - well, what else were you listening to at the time?
B00000HYXB|5.0|When I first listened to Blind Guardian I was in complete shock. There was not even one slightly bad song. When I heard Mirror Mirror, i was amazed by the harmony in both guitars and singing. And the same thing for Noldor(Dead Winter Reigns). If you are looking for Fast, Power Metal verses and Melodic Chorus', This cd is definatly what you want.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I watched this movie last night, and i never even thought of leaving the couch.  Not only is it funny, but keeps you interested the whole time.  I've heard of this movie and i was so interested in watching it.  I wasn't prepared for it to be so kinky and raunchy, but it's in all good humor and the love they both share for their strange affection, just makes you fall inlove with the characters.  It's really, really good and i truly recommend it to the young adults!
B000000OQF|4.0|Although Guns N' Roses are now looked upon in a different light now than in 1987, thanks to lead singer Axl Rose's nosedive into becoming a passive-aggressive, arrogant, self-centered, and childish ego monster, there was a time when the band made great music together.  Along with now-legendary guitarist Slash, Izzy Stradlin (guitar), Duff McKagen (bass), and original drummer Steve Adler, GN'R gave late-'80s hard rock a much-needed punch in the gut with their blistering debut album APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION.  Though it's not quite the classic that many repute it to be, it still stands head and shoulders above any of the mindless, faceless &quot;hair rock&quot; that was going on around that era.  If you looked at their pictures, GN'R looked just like another hair band, but their music was much more real, rawer, and in your face than those groups.  This sounds like something Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones would do in the '70s, not Poison or Ratt.<br />Everybody knows the singles &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Paradise City,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot; since they helped launch the album to multi-platinum mega-success.  Out of these three songs, &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot; still holds up the best and sounds great even today.  The same can't be said for the former two; too much radio airplay and MTV rotation have damaged those songs in my opinion.  What makes APPETITE a great record are the obscure album tracks.  My favorite song is &quot;My Michelle,&quot; a scorching riff monster that starts out very pretty like a Led Zeppelin tune but quickly turns into a menacing tale of a girl from the wrong side of the tracks.  Other riff-heavy and relentless rockers include the paranoid &quot;Out ta Get Me,&quot; the bluesy shuffle &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; (about a drug dealer), the very catchy and melodic &quot;Think About You,&quot; and the fierce closer &quot;Rocket Queen.&quot;<br />This album is definitely one to bang your head to since every songrocks hard from beginning to end, but it's not entirely great.  &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; &quot;You're Crazy,&quot; and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; are juvenile tunes that should've been scraped (ironically, the acoustic version of &quot;You're Crazy&quot; is surprisingly better), and &quot;Nightrain&quot; goes on for far too long, even for a 4 minute song.  Kudos though for producer Mike Clink and his mixing team, for which the album sounds raw and rugged like a '70s record, and not overly polished like most of the rock records were at the time.<br />Though not a perfect album, APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION did indeed bring the true essence back to rock &amp; roll and purified it for the next generation up until a certain point.  On a sidenote, Slash, Duff McKagen, and second GNR drummer Matt Sorum recently reunited this year and have teamed up with former STP frontman Scott Weiland to form a new band called Velvet Revolver.  They released their first song &quot;Set Me Free&quot; on the HULK soundtrack and will release their debut in 2004.  Be on the lookout for that.  Can't say the same for Axl, who's probably wallowing in his past.  Oh well...
B0000DD7NL|5.0|She's done it again, the amazing Alicia Keys never ceases to amaze me. Her sophmore album &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; is nothing short than incredible! You can definetly tell that she has matured and her voice is stronger.<BR>1.)Harlem's Nocturne: This is a good intro to the album and the next song.<BR>2.)Karma: A very hip, up beat song that gets you moving.<BR>3.)Heartburn: She worked with Timbaland on this one, and I have to say, the finishing product is satisfying. It's very old school and jazzy.<BR>4.)If I Was Your Woman: I like this remake, it took me a little while to get use to it, but I love the way she put her owm spin on it and made it her own.<BR>5.)You Don't Know My Name: Of course the amazing single. This is very old school too, but it's catchy and addictive.<BR>6.)If I Ain't Got You: I love this song, makes you think about relationships, and what's important to some people in a relationship.<BR>7.)Diary: This is an incredible track. The piano work in this song is very nice. I love the lyrics and the message. I think this is going to be a favorite for a lot of fans.<BR>8.)Dragon Days: Okay I admit that even me (one of her biggest fans) wasn't blown out of the water by this song. I like it, don't get me wrong, it just took me a little while for it to grow on me. I like the dark feel though.<BR>9.)Wake Up: I think I'd have to say that this is probably my favorite song. I love the old school, bluesy feel. Her voice in this song is stunning and strong.<BR>10.)So Simple: Another one of my favorites. It's taking her away from her style a little bit and I like that. I wouldn't expect a song like this from her, but it works. It's good and I LOVE the chorus.<BR>11.)When You Really Love Someone: This song reminds me so much of &quot;A Women's Worth.&quot; It's the same message. This song is youthful and powerful. The piano work is good in this one too.<BR>12.)Feeling U, Feeling Me: Wow, that's all there is too it. This is an amazing interlude. I love it.It's one of those &quot;put you in the mood&quot; songs. It introduces the next song really well too. This is a GREAT one.<BR>13.)Slow Down: I really like this song, this is probably another one of my favorites. The message is incredible and the vibe is different. We need a song like this out today.<BR>14.)Samsonite Man: Yeah, I don't know about this one. I'm not really feeling this song. I like it and I'll listen to it, but I definetly don't think it's the best song in the world. I reminds me of &quot;Mr.Man.&quot;<BR>15.)Nobody Not Really: A nice change. I enjoyed this, even though it's just an interlude. It's a good way to end the album.<BR>Ms.Keys has definetly out done herself this time. This is one of those albums that you just have to sit and listen through it. You can't rush this album, you can't just skim through the numbers and hope for something that's gonna catch your ear, because that's not going to work. Just sit and listen to the melodies and the lyrics, it's an incredible album.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has come and preformed her best show yet with an excellent group of old and new songs for all to enjoy. The songs are fun and happy and ballots with love songs. They are the best she has done and she has done her old songs even better. You must see this DVD and when you do you will then have to have the DVD to watch over and over again. Take the time to watch and enjoy this DVD and then buy a couple extra copies for family and friends.
B0000E6I1J|1.0|I saw an advertisement for this on television and decided to look into it. What a complete waste of time. Nothing but second-rate 'note for note' covers. Hey! I'm a Beatles freak but, this is trash! I was given a CDr of this and threw it in the garbage!<br />George's worse solo album is better than this travesty! Do yourself a favor and run away from this as fast as you can!
B00008J4P5|5.0|A lot of folks have noted that rock and roll is in a bit of decline.  Fewer and fewer truly great bands have made their appearance in recent years, and for every Radiohead or Wilco or Thea Gilmore or Strokes or Hives there are literally hundreds of bands that either sound derivative, uninspired, or forgettable.  At times, I have worried if rock and roll was something that belonged more to the fifties, sixties, seventies, and eighties than to the present and future.<br />But then, when I am feeling despondent about the future of rock and roll, a band like White Stripes comes along and unpacks a passel of songs that don't sound entirely like anything else that has been done in rock, and yet sounds as vital, energized, and irreverent as anything else that has come along.  On a total pernicious level, one could compare them with the Carpenters.  Well, both were brother-sister bands.  In the one, the sister played drums and sang, while the brother wrote the songs, sang back up, and played piano, while in the new band the sister plays drums and sings, and the brother writes the songs, sings, and plays devastating guitar.  Well, OK, the Carpenters's music defines &quot;suck&quot; and the White Stripes play blistering rock, but I still love the bizarre parallel.<br />The White Stripes are definitely rock minimalists, in the purest sense of having minimal instrumentation.  But truth be told there is nothing terribly minimal about their sound.  How such a small band generates so much sound is really remarkable.<br />I liked this album so much I went back and sampled some of their earlier albums, and found them to be nearly a fine, in particular WHITE BLOOD CELLS and DE STIJL.  With three very good albums behind them, they have to be accounted one of the very best bands in the world.<br />And at least temporarily, my hope in the future of rock and roll is bolstered.

0679428895|4.0|Robert Harris has perhaps achieved the impossible: he has turned a civil engineer into a sexy, swashbuckling hero. For that reason alone, he deserves four stars.<br />Marcus Attilius, is the new \\"Aquarius\\", the engineer in charge of the aqueducts, in the Bay of Naples circa AD 79. He comes from a family of honest engineers who have helped make the Aqueducts of the Roman Empire, the engineering marvel of their times. The description of these aqueducts and their structures is actually fascinating.<br />However, Attilius has a lot more to think about than how to build the next aqueduct. His predecessor mysteriously disappeared, he has had a run-in with the former slave who now runs Pompeii in the manner of Tony Soprano, he has fallen in love with this individual's daughter, and the water in many places has slowed to a drip. And we're not even getting into the fact that Vesuvius will erupt in a day or two.<br />Harris writes a thriller that is both fast-paced (Attilius traveling all over the area in a matter of hours) and SLOW-paced (to his credit, he makes you feel the excruciating pain as the lava dried second by second by second on individuals). He mixes true historic figures-Pliny the Elder, the Admiral/Poet, who wrote about Pompeii before he too was killed in the disaster-and fictional characters. <br />I would recommend this book to those who enjoy the historical thriller genre and don't demand too much (e.g., fully developed characters). It's a great read.
B000001EHS|5.0|This is a greatest hits album, not a &quot;best of&quot; album.  For its worth, it is an excellent introduction to the band.  Of course, if one is merely a casual fan, then this would be suitable.  I would encourage those casual fans to dwelve more into their two major classics so they could get an idea of what Leppard was in their prime.  From that point onwards they can go their respective ways in reaching out to On Through the Night and X.<br />Regardless, it is strictly a greatest hits compilation.  Some Adrenalize singles (Tonight, Heaven Is, Stand Up, Make Love like a Man) are in fact missing, but that does not add up to much.  The singles represented here are better than those mentioned tracks. In any case, they can be listened to by buying the whole Adrenalize album.  <br />It is a fine package, although if they want to release a true best of, then I'd expect them to release a minimum of two cds for a compilation. That would go along the lines of what the Scorpions did with their Mercury release.  And believe me, Def Leppard have enough solid album tracks and singles to even put up a three cd compilation.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I have to admit I was not a huge fan of Alicias debut, except for Fallin. Her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys is a brilliant follow up that is a lot more funky and a little more soulful. Whereas her debut had mostly filler songs, this one has a ton of potential hits. Her soaring voice is in fine form as she belts out the ballads You Don't Know My Name and Slow Down. However, the best tracks on the album are her uptempo tracks. The opening track Karma is brilliant, and should be the next single. It's got a funky groove and a fiery vocal performance. Heartburn is very retro funk, and So Simple is Alicias first real venture into Hip-Pop. The only qualms I have about the cd, which are very minor, is that If I Ain't Got You is almost identical to Christina Aguilers Impossible, which Alicia wrote, right down to the and vocal gymnastics. When You Really Love Someone is also identical to Fallin. To me it's the exact same song, with different lyrics. With that said, though the songs are still strong. Overall, a remarkable second album which proves Alicia is only going to get better and better.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Despite what some people have been saying, about &quot;Room On Fire&quot; being either a duplicate of &quot;Is This It?&quot; or a rip off of The Cars' second album (which is probably a more reasonable accusation) I still think this album is a perfect follow-up to the first.  &quot;Is This It?&quot; introduced us to The Strokes, showed us what they were about, and gave us a great line-up of tunes that natuarally attracted a certin audiance.  &quot;Room On Fire&quot; is now exactly what was needed for those die hard Strokes fans.  It sounded enough like the first to please and keep the same fans, and added a certin artistic touch to bring in a whole new group of people.  With the exception of &quot;12:51&quot; which was to me a little too beyond that classic Strokes sound, and in fact my least favorite song on the album (so don't be turned away from buying the CD if this is the only song you heard), each song brings a new, yet familiar sound to their list of amazing tunes.  I say if you liked &quot;Is This It?&quot;, get &quot;Room On Fire&quot;, and if you didn't, still, buy the new one, you just might be pleasanly surprised.
1410102033|5.0|It's always good to know and recognize the roots of fascism so that you can nip it early.  We have with this book a historical model that we can use to recognize such charismatic maniacs we when encounter them.
0375701427|3.0|I started this book with very high hopes - I'd only read one other Roth, the short and highly sarcastic \\"The Breast,\\" and I had heard that in recent years he'd turned more sober and objective.  To me this meant Roth was coming of age, a voice expressing a fuller range of our hopes, fears, loves and angers.<br />Much of \\"American Pastoral\\" satisfied this desire.  Book one (of three) is a 100-or-so page, somewhat tedious prologue, where Roth's alter ego Nathan Zuckerman intruduces the main character and creates a setting to present his secret story.  With book two, it settles into a wonderful exploration of inner and outer lives.  This central section, and most of book three, is beautifully written and reads effortlessly, making the first part feel worthwhile.  By combining real world places (hint - it helps a lot to know New Jersey) and politics, with fictional characters whose lives embody the times and themes, Roth puts us directly into the drama of the story.<br />This sounds like a cliché; but through lengthy description, we learn by stages about the conflicts inside the main character.  Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov, a handsome, Jewish industrialist and high school athletic hero who marries Dawn Dwyer, Miss New Jersey of 1949, and whose vigor and generosity of spirit bring him success in business and to a life in the affluent (and WASPish) Jersey countryside, suffers a tragic fall when his radical daughter Merry goes berserk with one murderous bombing, and then others.  As she begins a life on the run, he and Dawn endure recrimination and only-partial recovery.  We watch Swede in a journey through his past and his present, an apparently peaceful man who learns to accommodate the real world by devising his own reality.  This seems the central theme, just how we are to construct a world that we want to live in.  His traditional, Jewish father, and his angry brother, are respectively full of shame and hatred for the daughter, but Swede, who still wants to know what went wrong, is frozen - first in denial, later in incomprehension.<br />In the reading, we come to identify the people and the many facets of their predicament.  Yet in the end, the plot is dropped, and that's where it failed as a narrative.  American Pastoral ends symbolically and inconclusively.  We never learned Merry's ultimate fate, what happened to Swede's marriage, or even the real identity of Rita Cohen, the vicious young woman who may or may not have been Merry's accomplice.  I know it's a novel of ideas, but a book that goes to such trouble to develop characters and establish plot, should keep its promise and resolve the plot.  It made me wonder Why Roth went on at such length, in so many sections.  Why tell us the whole background to Swede and his family, and their latest heartbreaks, and then not finish the story?  If the point was simply to illustrate clashing symbols and themes, it could have been done much more economically.<br />American Pastoral won the Pulitzer Prize, I think largely on the strength of its exposition.  Much of it reads like an essay we'd want to write ourselves, from our very heart and soul, exploring our own tensions, flowing and unfolding with nervous honesty.  I wish those Pulitzer people cared more about story-telling, since this is how the greatest writers, Dickens, Melville, Twain, Nabokov, and others, truly touch our lives.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna has graced my life in some interesting ways and this is one of them. I was never a huge Madonna fan, just an undercover one, one of my best friends had this CD and she made me listen it to it during our long bus rides to our &quot;in the boonies&quot; middle school, and sure enough I fell in love with this album and three years later I bought it.<BR>It's a very poetic album, lush and sophisticated and it hits some grounds that only Madonna could reach. <BR>The album starts with the major hit, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; I remember this song, even though I was four when it came out, it has that gospel tinged feel to it with some pretty strong lyrics, it feels like Madonna has had the holy ghost! lol <BR>&quot;Express Yourself&quot;, my personal fave, Madonna has described as her Sly and The Family Stone tribute song. She channels some major funk with this song and the lyrics are great for singing at the top of your lungs. The Purple One (Prince) appears on &quot;Love Song&quot;, it's pretty quirky (duh! It's Prince!) but it's lacking something, probably my least favorite song on here, still it's Prince &amp; Madonna what more could you ask for? The remains of a broken marriage are evident on &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; a very dancy, soft rock song that sounds a little to happy for a &quot;breakup song&quot; but it still gets you moving.<BR>&quot;Promise To Try&quot;, everytime I hear this song I think of my grandmother, I find this song comforting, Madonna does a wonderful job singing with only a piano backing her up, though she didn't have a wonderful, Whitney like voice she still made this song special. I love &quot;Cherish&quot; it's such a beautiful song, lush, poppy and happy. It has a bit of 50's doo woop flavor to it and it's a great song to blast on a sunny day. &quot;Dear Jessie&quot; is pretty odd for Madonna to do, it sounds psycadelic and &quot;pink elephants and lemonade&quot;? What famous pop singer talks about that kinda stuff? Madonna of course. A very enchanting song, the music video is cute too, it features Madonna as a cartoon fairy. On a serious note,&quot;Oh, Father&quot; is another special Madonna song, it's haunting with a sense of hurt and betryal. It really touches you to know what it felt like for Madonna being abused by her father. Another song that Madonna doesn't have to belt out, the words carry her through. &quot;Keep It Together&quot; has a jazzy/blusey feel too it with a strong message, staying together with family is important. It's not totally dancable but it livens up things. &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; is another beautiful song, Madonna, like on &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, samples some Latin flavors to this song. I love the litte horn and guitar parts in the song. Beautifully done Madonna. &quot;Act of Contriction&quot; is just a little &quot;remix&quot; of &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; with Madonna praying and then screaming at the end, don't get it much...lol<BR>This is one of Madonna's shining moments, it hits alot of ground and proves that Madonna had something to offer, more than just frilly dresses and boy toy belts. This is one album to own and &quot;cherish&quot; for life. A true masterpiece.
0385504209|5.0|You may not agree with the premise of this book, but it is fascinating! Besides being a fast=paced mystery, it is a short course in art history as well as the various legends of the Holy Grail. It was absolutely the best book I've read this year.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|If you are a fan of hi-tech action films and love great chase scenes - \\"The Italian Job\\" is for you! Make a double batch of popcorn and settle in for a rollicking movie ride! The producers could have lost the script and speaking parts altogether - the action alone, along with the wicked sound track, would make many folks very happy. This tongue-in-cheek, super burglary, double-cross, murder, revenge thriller includes the grandmother and the mother of all chase scenes. There's a wild boat ride through the canals of Venice, and even wilder car chases, with the grand finale roaring through a Los Angeles train station, into tunnels, down stairs, with a wind-up duel between a Mini-Cooper and a helicopter. Charlize Theron looks svelte and sexy behind the wheel! If you are looking for a more cerebral film, then I'd advise you to rent something on the quieter side.<br />Donald Sutherland is terrific in a cameo as John Bridger, the sage guru among a band of hi-tech thieves plotting to steal millions in gold bullion from a safe in beautiful Venice. (Great photography!!) Bridger's protege, the outfit's mastermind, Charlie Croker, (played by Mark Wahlberg), along with his team, pull-off the heist without a hitch. After a spectacular get-away, the group drinks to success and future plans as wealthy men against the backdrop of the Swiss Alps. Then in the first twist, and there are more twists, turns, hitches and hikes in this one than in any amusement park ride, the evil-doing, back-stabbing, amoral Steve, (Ed Norton), turns on his fellow thieves. He heists the heist, murdering Bridger, and he believes, the rest of his mates.<br />Fast-forward one year and we find Bridger's daughter Stella, (Charlize Theron), a professional safe and vault technician (read safecracker), still mourning her Dad. Enter Dad's favorite sidekick, Charlie Croker, who proposes a plan for revenge to Stella. She buys in, along with old team members Napster, (Seth Green, who steals scene after scene), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), and Left Ear (Mos Def) - very funny characters, all! They trek out to LA, where Steve has a new alias, high-end digs, guard dogs and body guards galore...and the GOLD! And they plan their ultimate payback!<br />I am not going to critique the acting or direction - I don't think this is what the film is about. There is nothing deep or meaningful here. It's just FUN! I am not a fan of action films. Chases, car and other, minimal acting and small plots are not my style - and I liked this movie! So, go know!? I'll take a chance and recommend this, even for highbrows. \\"The Italian Job\\" is entertainment that rocks!<br />JANAome Rob (Jason Statham), and Left Ear (Mos Def) - very funny characters, all!

0792833201|3.0|I remember how scared this movie makes me 15 years ago. I just rewatch it and well,now, it became with time an average movie. For sure, the FX were certainly fantastic for this period, but these days with all the technologies, everything is quite laughable and anyway not very scary ! The story is still a good one. The soundtrack has certainly been choosen by Speilberg who's also the producer. What I will keep in mind, is the direction by TOBE HOOPER (a curiosity) and the everlasting angel face of Carol Anne :)
6302491940|4.0|A double feature was recently offered on cable TV that allowed me to view \\"The Italian Job\\" twice - the 1969 version with Michael Caine and the 2003 version. The two films have little in common except a gold bullion robbery, 4 million dollars worth in 1969, and 27 million in 2003, to allow for the decreasing value of the dollar and bigger and better ways to spend it! I enjoyed the 2003 thriller but the older film is really an excellent comedy. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to see it, because I missed it, and lots of laughs, the first time around.<br />\\"The Italian Job\\" (1969) is a campy caper packed with 1960s nostalgia. There are enough gadgets and girls in this film to make even James Bond content, although Bond would never work with the bumbling, quirky characters that Michael Caine, called Charlie Croker here, is forced to deal with. The film opens with a choreographed hit by the Italian Mafia. The choreography could have been done for the June Taylor Dancers. It's a riot! Anyway, Roger Beckerman, a brilliant thief, is murdered because he had masterminded a potential heist to take place in Turin, Italy, involving millions of dollars of Chinese gold bullion. Beckerman leaves a tape for Charlie Croker, who has just been released from a British prison. The video tape, to be viewed in the event of Beckerman's death, explains the entire caper and offers Charlie the opportunity to do the job. Charlie gets the funding for the project from Mr. Bridger, played by a wonderfully comic Noel Coward. Bridger is an inmate of the prison where Charlie had spent the last few years and he rules the UK underworld like a king, from his jail cell, with guards and inmates paying him homage. Croker fights off the advances of gorgeous blondes with one hand while he uses the other to whip into shape his motley crew of screwball bandits.<br />The dialogue is hilarious at times, especially when the team of thieves, who seem to have a collective IQ of 75, go at each other like recalcitrant adolescent schoolboys. Croker who occasionally is forced to step out of his role as master-thief to play schoolmaster, yells at his men during a particularly delicate operation, \\"Get yourselves sorted out and shut-up! No one talks anymore except me!\\" During a meeting with the Mafia leader who threatens to kill Croker and his men if they pull-off the job, Charlie responds, \\"You will be making a grave error if you kill us. There are one-quarter million Italians in Britain and they will be made to suffer. Every restaurant, cafe, ice cream parlor, gambling den and nightclub in London, Liverpool and Glasgow will be smashed. Mr. Bridger will drive them into the sea!\\"<br />This film is pure fun with the mother of all car chases as the grand finale. Not to be missed!<br />JANAalcitrant adolescent schoolboys.

B000069AUI|5.0|Simply put, this album is one of the very best. Let me try to write a broad review covering all there is to it.<br />1) Radiohead? No. I love both the bands. Both are exceptionally talented. Both have plenty of songs to put any other rock band to shame. A Rush.. is to Coldplay as OK computer to Radiohead. Though not as diverse as the music on OK.. this album delivers equal punch.<br />2) Best songs: To me are 1) Clocks 2) Politik 3) God put a smile upon your face 4)THe warning sign....<br />3) Brit rock? Well yes.. but not the kind of you expect. Just clocks and Politik will make you \\"shiver\\" :) Coldplay is a great example of a diverse band that re-invents itself with every album, only to get better!<br />4) Who should buy this? If you are a music fan who likes to buy the very best, then this album should be on your shelves!
B00005LB50|4.0|Whenever I pay 50+ bucks for an exhaustive box set, I feel obligated to look at the purchase with a far more discerning critical eye than standard 14 dollar CD purchase. It's hard to be forgiving when the retail price is so high. That being said, this 4 CD collection will be the best sounding Buffalo Springfield you will ever hear. Neil Young was the right person to supervise the remastering of this project and he has done a great service to fans who have patiently waited for years the remastering to be completed. Perfectionism may be a pain in the posterior, but at the end of the day, you have Neil Young to thank for the cleaning the collection of Springfield's master tapes. The master tapes were probably in pretty bad condition after 35 years on someone's shelf and remastering them was time consuming, labor intensive process.<br />Here's my complaint. The actual chronology may be correct but there is a confusing mix of demos, remixes, outakes and unreleased songs that destroy the continuity of the original three albums. &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Springfield, Again&quot; and &quot;Last Time Around&quot; are the holy grail of our youth and should not be tampered with by anyone, even Neil Young. The order of the songs on those albums are so firmly imprinted in my subconscious mind that each time I hear a song out of order, I break out in a cold sweat, begin screaming, &quot;Revisionist history!!!&quot;, before the enevitable grand mal seizure strikes. We're talking about sacred ground here, Neil!!!<br />It would have been far better to present the first three Buffalo Springfied albums in separate jewel cases with the orginal order of songs and the original artwork, than parking a jumbled mess of demos on the same CDs as the final takes. A seperate CD of demos and outtakes would have been fine, or even putting the session outtakes and demos at the end of each original album. The format of this box set probably makes sense to Neil Young and the rest of Buffalo Springfield, but there is a baffling clutter of &quot;not ready for prime time&quot; material on the first three CDs. If there is a rhyme or reason to all this discontinuity, it's well kept secret from Buffalo Springfield fans.<br />The only one I can listen is the fourth CD which presents the &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; in the exact chrnological order of the original albums, but repeating most of the studio cuts that have already been presented in the previous three CDs...Huh??? For some inexplicable reason, &quot;Last Time Around&quot; isn't entirely presented. Or is it? I'm confused by this gorgeous mess of Buffalo Springfield material in such a bizzare format...Hmmmm.... maybe I did take one hit too many of that speckled acid at Woodstock.est of Buffalo Springfield, but there is a baffling clutter of &quot;not ready for prime time&quot; material on the first three CDs.

The author Alice Seboid focus on how life can be easily taken away in just a matter of seconds.  &quot;Never take life for granted,&quot; is what Alice Seboid is trying to explain in her novel, The Lovely Bones.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in love, hope, tears, and happiness.  Susie Salmon plays an excellent character in The Lovely Bones.  It's as almost as Susie Salmon exist in reality and all that you can  ever feel is pain from her disappearance. Once you read The Lovely Bones, you'll be sure to re-read it once more, it's a book that you can't seem to ever forget in your life.  It will touch you in many ways that are unexplainable.

B000002AGE|5.0|It has been fashionable to belittle fusion jazz as a precursor to the mind numbing smooth jazz that has found such a big audience among aging baby boomers. How quickly we forget that the Weather Report was a port of entry to the world of jazz for many of us. Sure; I would have stumbled onto Monk, Coltrane, Miles and the other jazz greats sooner or later, but the music of the Weather Report was a fast track course in learning to appreciate the masters of bop and early jazz. There was a time when the music of the Weather Report was highly controversial in both the jazz community and rock community. Jazz critics called fusion &quot;revisionist&quot; and uncomprehending rock fans walked out of Weather Report concerts branding their music as &quot;unlistenable&quot;. I recall a show in 1973 where at least half of the clueless concert goers walked out of a show opened by Fairport Convention. If you set aside your misgivings about the jazz fusion movement, you will be able to appreciate how well the music of 1977's &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; has aged over the years. Pound for pound, and ounce for ounce this best crew ever assembled to play under the banner of the Weather Report. There are other crucial albums by Weather Report but this is the one that we will all remember them by.

B000002L68|5.0|The soundtrack to \\"Purple Rain,\\" from start to finish, is a masterpiece. The songs are about love, God, sex and trust, just the way Prince intended it. I watched the movie tonight and cried like I do every time I see it, but the music is really what hits you straight in the heart. From \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" to the title track, each song is absolute perfection, especially when you hear those wailing, soaring guitar solos Prince incorporates in \\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Computer Blue,\\" \\"Darling Nikki,\\" \\"When Doves Cry,\\" and of course, \\"Let's Go Crazy.\\" Let's face it, Prince is a genius and no album will ever top \\"Purple Rain.\\"
B0000DJZA5|5.0|of the Get Back bootleg LP from way back. For those who remember, Get Back had the Let it Be songs stripped of their wall of sound. Naked sounds like that album with the sound brought to studio level quality. This is a very welcome addition to The Beatles discography and now represents a more listenable follow on to the White album. The anthologies were fun, but did The Beatles really want those recordings memorialized in CD? I very much doubt it. I'll go so far as to say that Naked is the best Beatles release since Let It Be.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Those who actually listened to the lyrics will agree with me when I say that she shouldnt try it again. She has other artists singing with her on her album because she can't rely on her own talent. She is insecure because she knows that she can only prance around in her underwear for so long before people get over her. Putting loads of sex in her music to get people's attention isn't particularly original.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I just put the &quot;oh no&quot; to get you to read my review. The Diary of Alicia Keys is one of the most soulful albums I've heard in a long time (except for Salt by Lizz Wright,this sister can sing). The only thing is that generally all the songs are about love. Songs in A minor has different subjects such a Girl Power ( A woman's Worth), the hardship of living (The Life), and (The Caged Bird). Still, I guess most of her hits on that album were about love anyway. So if your looking for a CD that's going to stay in your disc changer more than a week don't waste your time trying to bootleg this CD just buy &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys.&quot;
0385504209|1.0|Where to start?<br />Well first of all, for all those \\"intellectuals\\" that think that Dan Brown has DICOVERED something, think again.  This book has been written in various different forms by other people preceeding Dan Brown (Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln; The Goddess in the Gospels: Reclaiming the Sacred Feminine and The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail, both by Margaret Starbird, and The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets by Barbara G. Walker).  This in not to say that his crap is true, on the other hand, his references will show that his points are invalid.  The references used for this book do not cite source documents from Jesus' time.  Instead, the only real mention of the Mary Magdalene scenario is a kiss in the gnostic gospel of Philip, and a mention in the gnostic gospel of Mary.  Both of which were rejected by the early Church fathers very early after the death of Christ (200 a.d.).  Any research on the Church fathers will show that the canon of the bible surfased long before Constantine, and never contained anything about Jesus being married!  Was it a \\"cover up?\\"  Well, considering that the actual bible has been historically documented only decades after Jesus' death, while the gnostic gospels sprouted up hundreds of years after that, proves that they are likely false.  If you have the desire to read this book, just remember that you cant believe everything you read.  You owe it to yourself to research Dan Brown's claims before falsely accepting them.<br />\\"It is just fiction.\\"  This has been heard before, and is quite ridiculous in that Dan Brown himself tells his reader that it is not all fiction.  Although, I do agree that even the \\"facts\\" in this book are fiction, it is important not to blow this off as a meaningless fictional plot that has no intention of criticizing Christianity.<br />To my surprise, Dan Brown has \\"discovered\\" that the Catholic Church killed five million women as witches.  This is ridiculous, the actual number is historically estimated between 30,000 to 50,000 victims.  Not all were executed by the Church, not all were women, and not all were burned.<br />Perhaps the paintings of Leonardo are more appealing, in that Dan Brown has surely uncovered something there?  Refer to the following from Crisis Magazine (Sandra Miesel. \\"Dismantling The Da Vinci Code.\\" Crisis (September 2003):<br />\\"Brown's revisionist interpretations of da Vinci are as distorted as the rest of his information. He claims to have first run across these views \\"while I was studying art history in Seville,\\" but they correspond point for point to material in The Templar Revelation. A writer who sees a pointed finger as a throat-cutting gesture, who says the Madonna of the Rocks was painted for nuns instead of a lay confraternity of men, who claims that da Vinci received \\"hundreds of lucrative Vatican commissions\\" (actually, it was just one...and it was never executed) is simply unreliable.<br />He presents the Mona Lisa as an androgynous self-portrait when it's widely known to portray a real woman, Madonna Lisa, wife of Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo. The name is certainly not - as Brown claims - a mocking anagram of two Egyptian fertility deities Amon and L'Isa (Italian for Isis). How did he miss the theory, propounded by the authors of The Templar Revelation, that the Shroud of Turin is a photographed self-portrait of da Vinci?<br />Much of Brown's argument centers around da Vinci's Last Supper, a painting the author considers a coded message that reveals the truth about Jesus and the Grail. Brown points to the lack of a central chalice on the table as proof that the Grail isn't a material vessel. But da Vinci's painting specifically dramatizes the moment when Jesus warns, \\"One of you will betray me\\" (John 13:21). There is no Institution Narrative in St. John's Gospel. The Eucharist is not shown there. And the person sitting next to Jesus is not Mary Magdalene (as Brown claims) but St. John, portrayed as the usual effeminate da Vinci youth, comparable to his St. John the Baptist. Jesus is in the exact center of the painting, with two pyramidal groups of three apostles on each side. Although da Vinci was a spiritually troubled homosexual, Brown's contention that he coded his paintings with anti-Christian messages simply can't be sustained.\\"<br />It is impossible for me to point out every amount of falseness in this book, however I urge anyone to research it and find out for yourself.  Remember, ignorance is the opposite of intellegence.  One reason so many \\"intellectuals\\" are buying into this crap, is that it makes them feel more intelligent than the \\"sheep\\" that buy into religious doctrine!  It would be surprising if anyone could obtain the amount of knowledge in one life time that a religion has gained over the course of 2000 or more years!Jesus is not Mary Magdalene (as Brown claims) but St. John, portrayed as the usual effeminate da Vinci youth, comparable to his St. John the Baptist.

The guitar sounds in this album are fantastic. They change rhythm and the beats to keep you in tune,,I never got bored listening..not yet anyway. Well the stereotype I had on this band has vanished. I was brought up listening to Paula Abdul, Milli Vanilli, New Kids On the Block, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg, and the ignorance continued until 1998. Then I started listening to real music..and this gem of an album has saved my spirits. Cheers to The CLASH!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The first album by APC was interesting and showed much promise from MJK's OTHER band, but it pales in comparison to this, their latest work.  This album retains the atmospheric hard rock of the debut, but is more textured and intricate, showing Maynard's continuous devotion to progressive rock.  Save for two &quot;interlude&quot; tracks, all of the songs have complex structures, compelling but cryptic lyrics, and exotic touches.  A truly landmark recording-I never guessed that APC had an album like this in them.  The Package, The Noose, and Pet are the standouts, and The Nurse Who Loved Me is an interesting divergance from their normal sound.  Be sure to see them live if you can-I just did and was amazed.<br />I find claims that this album is a step down from Mer De Noms laughable-this album is in every way an improvement over its predecessor.  I attribute such talk to fairweather metal/goth fans who arent open-minded enough to accept that this is better because it is more subtle and less accessible.  Similar sentiments were expressed over Lateralis, which was the best album Tool ever released.<br />In short, a masterpiece that will probably only be recognized as such by a select few.

The album starts off with 5 years which after one listen u just cant get it out of your head ...the fast rock nos are great as well and the ending Rock and Roll Suicide is just an amazing ending to an amazing album.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|When I first heard that &quot;Train of Thought&quot; was going to be a metal album I groaned. Just what the world needs is more metal, right? However after listening to it a few times I have to admit this stuff is not only good, it's great! As usual Dream Theater pull off another great feat of song crafting and instrumental vituosity. I'd give this five stars but I took one off for the brief bad rapping by Labrie and the occassional &quot;nu-metal&quot; sound ( As you guessed I'm not a nu-metal fan ). That's just nit picking however. This album rocks and I highly recommend picking up a copy right away. By the way, DO NOT download this album! Keep DT and other great prog bands alive and purchase your copy. These bands work hard for us fans and depend on that money to keep making music. Go buy it now and enjoy it!
B000002AGN|5.0|While I'm definitely a newbie to the jazz genre, I know greatness when I hear it, and The Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out definitely fits that description. Released in 1959, a pivotal year for jazz, alongside gems like Giant Steps, Kind Of Blue, and Mingus Ah Um, Time Out rids jazz of fixed 4/4 and 3/4 time and incorporates exotic rhythms used in a totally accessible and catchy way. Both students of musical theory and casual listeners can get into this West Coast jazz album with equal enjoyment.<br />The opening track Blue Rondo A La Turk clearly shows this. Its in 9/8, in the style of Turkish folk music. Upbeat and catchy, this is a classic composition that's been covered and reintrepreted eight ways till Sunday. Ditto Take Five, a number done in 5/4 and featuring both a wonderfully slinky sax line and a Joe Morello drum solo. Other tracks do not fail to enchant either--Strange Meadowlark is an elegant slow composition driven by Dave's fine piano playing, Kalthy's Waltz is a complex yet compulsively listenable piece done in quick waltz time, while Everybody's Jumpin' and Pick Up Sticks are 6/8 compositions that close the album on a high note.<br />The band, while not being ultra-talented, definitely works great as a cohesive unit. Dave Brubeck's piano gives the music its backbone, drummer Joe Morello and bassist Eugene Wright supply the swingin' rhythms, and Paul Desmond does a fine job on alto sax.<br />All in all, I'd say Time Out is the ideal place for the jazz newbie, not Miles' Kind Of Blue (which is beyond doubt a great album but not the greatest choice for a novice, contrary to popular belief). It swings, it grooves, and it appeals to both the diehard jazz musician and the uninitiated. Highest recommendation.
0525457585|4.0|I don't have much to say about this book, but I would defineately suggest it to anyone. There are many parallels between Atreyu and Christ. And something else for all you Bible scholars out there, I picked up on a lot of parallels between the Childlike Empress and the God the Father. This is especially evident when Falkor tells Atreyu about her on their way to The Ivory Tower. I enjoy the first half of the book most and my favorite part is when Atreyu and Ygramul hear Bastian's voice in the Land of the Dead Mountains. Overall I am disappointed that this often gets labeled as a children's fantasy book, because it can be read on a level that only critical thinking adults can understand.
B000002UA5|3.0|Ummagumma is a very unique Pink Floyd entry, and an overlooked one. It was released in 1969, in the height of their experimental period following the departure of madcap genius Syd Barrett. The Roger Waters-led band had yet to find its voice, and the acid-drenched muse of Syd hadn't quite left the building yet. In other words, Dark Side Of The Moon this is NOT. This is a lot closer to the works of Zappa and avante-garde composers than to their more conventional later work.<br />The live disk is conventional enough. Recorded during the Saucerful Of Secrets era, there's some great trippy, spaced-out jamming to be found here. Particularly of note is a loud, scary reworking of Careful With That Axe Eugene that opens up with a terrifying scream by Roger, and a version of Astronomy Domine with David Gilmour on vocals.<br />The studio disk, however, is a lot more daunting, random, and WEIRD. It is split between the four band members, with Gilmour, Mason, and Wright making long multi-part suites. The Narrow Way is a Gilmour piece with some very heavy, dirty proto-Black Sabbath guitarwork. Sysyphus sees Wright banging away on his keyboards  and making some really strange sound effects, and The Grand Visier's Garden Party is a Mason piece featuring layers upon layers of looped drums in an annoying collage of sorts, sometimes with a flute showing up. Waters gives us perhaps the best song on here with the sublimely atmospheric and laidback Grandchester Meadows.<br />Following that is one of the freakiest songs ever: Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Dwelling Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict. Yes, that's the actual title. And yes, it features an insane, incoherent Scotsman rambling over the sounds of many animal squeaks and sound effects that is both hilarious and inexplicably frightening. Worlds apart from the dour, dark Waters compositions of later Floyd, this should be played for friends at high volume just to see the looks on their faces.<br />Yep, a totally different Floyd this is, and it's not for everyone, especially not newbies. Buy their '70s albums (Meddle through The Wall) first before you even consider this, and even then proceed with caution. The band itself doesn't have a very high opinion of Ummagumma (or Atom Heart Mother for that matter), but fans of Zappa, Mr. Bungle, and other weird and isoteric bands should give this a look. After all, even if the studio material scares you, there's still a decent live album and a cool poster to be had.ally different Floyd this is, and it's not for everyone, especially not newbies.

B00006879E|5.0|I've loved this CD from the moment I bought it and played it for the first time driving in my car. There is just something compelling about Adam Levine's voice and it goes perfectly with the rock beats that are heard throughout this album.<BR>i'd say my favourite song would have to be Through With You, although each and every song is great -from the edgy Harder To Breathe, to the balladic She Will Be Loved.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Along with Lara Croft: Tombraider 2, this is the worst sequel I've ever seen.  Luckily I bought the DVD used or I would really be upset.  As a chick I am all for chicks kicking men's butts in films, but Full Throttle was insulting to women, blacks and anyone with sense. <br />I would love to explain the plot, but it was so overshadowed it didn't seem to matter. The action sequences were lame, boring and predictable. They did the same flips, turns and giggles they did in the first film. The only difference was that that film had a decent plot and was entertaining. Full Throttle is a full disappointment to the T. It was obvious that the directors and writers ran out of anything original. They relied on half-naked women, a desperate Demi Moore and an ignorant black character played by Bernie Mac who wasn't shown but a few times in the film.<br />Unless you're a teenage boy with raging hormones, don't waste your time with this.  Fans of the first one will be terribly dissapointed in this mess of a sequel. The filmmakers should have quit while they were ahead.  I just hope there is not going to be another one. Full Throttle sort of bombed at the box office ( proving that you need more than trashy-dressed women to make a bad movie work ).  Hopefully the bombing will  keep them from making a third sequel. We can only pray!  This film is just plain insulting to women and was obviously made for a cheap buck.  I feel sorry for all the actors because they deserved a better film follow-up to the 2000 hit. I mostly feel sorry for Demi Moore.  This horrid film was supposed to be her comeback role.  Well, she didn't quite make it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wasn't too enthusiastic from the promos, but once I started watching I was hooked.  This in my opinion is the greatest SCI-FI series ever written and produced and thats saying a lot because I am very critical.  I am a huge sci-fi fan and I have to say that FireFly is in a class all its own.  Its too bad the hammer heads in charge at Fox really messed up by cancelling this show.  <br />Scott Eguires
B00003CXXM|4.0|Feel like a little &quot; Matt attack &quot;?  You'll definitely enjoy this film. I found the plot compelling and the acting incredibly realistic.  I enjoy Matt Damon but usually hate these types of films. I bought the DVD because I heard such great reviews about the movie. This is the typical I-don't-know-who-I-am film with some decent twists.  This is for Matt Damon fans any time, any place. The Bourne Identity is the only film I've seen in the last five years that is worthy of a sequel. Hint to film makers...we'd like to see more of Bourne!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore's Wagnerian finish to his &quot;LOTR&quot; opus is another astonishing achievement in film scoring, one that is best demonstrated by Track 4: &quot;The White Tree.&quot; Have you heard a more rousing musical cue since the first time &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; blared out of your speakers? Shore's grand statement of the Gondorian theme here, backed by soaring harmonies, is perhaps the finest moment of the trilogy. If the film of &quot;Return of the King&quot; is anywhere near as good as its music, then we are all in for quite an emotional experience.
B00005JLRT|2.0|What a disappointment. Let me tell you that I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and that I think TNG is the core of the whole Star Trek universe. I've seen every TNG episode several times and loved the series for its philosophy, its actors, and its emotional factor.<br />Yet with Nemesis, everything is destroyed. You know, Generations was very good. First Contact was excellent. Insurrection was not so bad after all. But entry #10 is a disgrace for the franchise, battling with &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; and &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; for the title &quot;Worst Trek Movie Ever&quot;.<br />Dear Lord, Star Trek isn't about space battles, evil aliens and blowing things up. It's about exploration of space and mankind, carried by good dialogue, good ideas, and good acting. Unfortunately, the people at Paramount don't seem to share that view.<br />They promised us a &quot;Generation's Final Journey&quot;; a final journey for our beloved characters - Fine. The opening scene at the wedding even is quite touching. However, after this, everything wents downhill very fast. The boring and senseless Data subplot begins (Lore, anyone?), totally disregarding the emotion chip from Generations and First Contact. Worf's role has been reduced to that of a clown, getting sick of Romulan Ale and being concerned of showing up nude at a Betazed wedding. This character's main attributes used to be honor, valor, justice, and a constant struggle between Human and Klingon culture. Not so in Nemesis.<br />Worf? Wait a second... Worf? What is doing there anyway? Didn't the people at Paramount watch the ending of DS9? Why is Worf suddenly back on the Enterprise? Geez, that's the opposite of character development, really. In First Contact, Worf's appearance didn't feel forced at all. It was logical for him to fight there with the Defiant and being beamed aboard the Enterprise. In Nemesis, we don't even get to hear an explanation (I know, I should be grateful for this, since the explanation would have been hilarious anyway.)<br />Beverly, Riker and Geordi get nothing to do throughout the rest of the film. At least Deanna gets more screen time this time. As for Picard, his role is saved only by Stewart's brilliant acting, though Stewart obviously has a hard time fighting against the awful script. And THIS was the last time I've seen my beloved characters? Not how I had once pictured it. What a way to kill of my TNG crew.<br />The plot is essentially... well, boring. What do they fight for anyway? It all bodes down to killing the villain. Boy, they had the Romulans and did nothing with them. Instead, they invent another new redundant alien race. How imaginative. Besides, what about the Romulans from the series? They don't even mention Sela or Tomalak. Another huge disappointment for the fans.<br />In my phantasy, I picture an alternate Star Trek 10... The true ending of a generation, involving Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and Vulcans. Perhaps a fight for peace in the quadrant, a fight for Earth, for Starfleet and the Federation. A new era of Star Trek. Something revolutionary. Important roles for every member of the cast. Much nostalgy, cameos for Sela, O'Brien, Ro Laren, and Pulaski perhaps? Continuity with the TV epsiodes and previous movies, Worf being Klingon ambassador, Data having emotions, and so on. A big epos combined with something imagantive and groundbreaking... like the invention of Warp 10 or anything. *sigh* Unfortunately, this is all just a dream now, and it won't happen anymore. Nemesis has absolutely nothing of what I just tried to describe. Nothing. It leaves you with such an empty feel in your stomache you almost want to cry.<br />I give it the second star only because non-fans will probably like the movie a bit more, because the special effects are good, because of the DVD extras, and because Goldsmith's score is very nice as well (albeit a bit repetitive, isn't it?). Actually, I'd like to remove 1/2 stars for the infamous dune buggy scene(in which Picard consciously violates the Prime Directive for no obvious reason), but Amazon only allows full stars, so...<br />If only they could undo this dreadful movie falsely titled &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Can we just say it never happened, please?
B00001ODGR|5.0|I saw seven shows on the 1996 tour including this one.  While this one isn't the one that touched me most (saw the concert in Peoria the day after Johnny Panozzo's funeral and cried the whole time), this was a really great way to close an exciting year.  1996 was the year the surviving original members of Styx (Dennis DeYoung, Chuck Panozzo, and James &quot;JY&quot; Young) reunited along with long-time member Tommy Shaw and newcomer Todd Sucherman.  They had a lot to prove to their fans and they succeeded.  They still look good, rock hard, and work together to produce the music I grew up on.  Yes, I'm a big fan, but this show with this lineup is a must-see.
B00000DC4A|4.0|Bryan Adams popularity was already going down hill before this release, this cd just helped it along.  Not that this is a bad cd, it's not, but it's not a good cd either.  Everything about this cd is ok.  Nothing stands out, makes you want to go back and listen to again and again.  Nothing makes you want to turn it off either in middle of the cd or a song, like 18 TILL I DIE did with the song I WANT TO BE YOUR UNDERWEAR.  But without a song to catch you, it justs slips right thru the cracks and gets put back on the shelf.
B000089RVX|3.0|To be fair, this isn't my type of music. I like distortion as much as the next guy, but the metal edge was never really my thing. Something about this has me hooked, though, and the only thing that keeps me from giving it a fourth star is that the lyrics are pretty one-note: Amy's angry, but not too angry, because God is with her. <br />Amy Lee has a jaw-dropping voice, and that's not contestable. Throw in some vibrato and it's operatic. Joyously, she knows that she should use that voice instead of screaming like a stuck pig like so many other singers in this genre. She tends to sing at full volume all the time, whether or not we're at a high point in the song. I wish she used just a little bit more restraint in this regard, but if it were my debut album I'd want to show the world what I can do, too.<br />Ben Moody is a passable guitarist, whacking out the normal battery of drop-D power chords and wah-wah solos. I get the feel, though, that he's much more important to this band as a composer and a macho foil for Lee's siren songs.<br />What really makes this album is the production. This isn't widescreen, it's imax. The opening phrases of &quot;Going Under&quot; didn't make me especially hopeful, but the swaggering, stomping chorus hit about a minute in and the first thing I could thing was &quot;wow, there are guitars everywhere.&quot; Strings, synthesizers, and even some plaintive piano setting off the distortion-from-sea-to-shining-sea riffs: this is a masterpiece of production.<br />Oh, and about that piano: let's have more of it next time. The two piano ballads hiding in the later tracks take the listener completely off-guard and make the guitar blasts seem both excessive and ever more powerful. There's some seriously good composition going on here, and some intense interplay between instruments. These guys are good, and they have enormous potential. Maybe I'm hesitant to give this four stars because I'm leaving room for a better second album and a masterpiecethird.
B000002GOZ|3.0|Bryan Adams' MTV UNPLUGGED cd is from the tv series of the same name.  Although he is &quot;unplugged&quot; rest of the band at times is not.  Atruly acoustic set this is not, and makes for a big disappointment.  His choice of songs is not the greatest either.  Alot of his big hits are left off, and lesser know songs are put in.  Just like any concert you go to, you want to hear the hits, so if your after that, like I was, this may not be your cup of tea.
B00005NWM3|2.0|I heard from some acquaintances of mine how good this album is.  I decided it was time to hear it for myself and downloaded it.  Hoestly people, this album is really nothing special.  The only two songs worth replaying are &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;Too Bad&quot;.  I used to like &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; before radio stations everywhere overplayed it to death!  The rest of the songs are just mediocre, repetitive rock songs with nothing special about them.  Maybe I would like some of these new alternative rock bands if they actually had some substance!!
B0000667RO|4.0|This greatest hits collection picks up were the last hits collection, SO FAR SO GOOD, left off.  SO FAR.. covered Bryan during his bigger cds, and ALL.. in his lesser days, that maybe why the new collection carries five songs off the first collection.  ALL.. may cover the lesser selling cds, but they were still descent to good cds, and deserve a place in Adams history along side the bigger selling cds.  There is stil plenty to listen too, and plenty of boyhood songs to crank up, though done reaches the heights of SUMMER OF 69, &amp; EVERTHING I DO, so that maybe the reason they included on this collection, instead of going more into depth on the latter cds.  Still a good listen.

Even includes a new song, that sounds like it belongs on this cd, PLEASE FORGIVE.  Bryan plays smart and only includes one song off the INTO THE FIRE cd, and none off is first cd, a wise move.  A good place to start for anyone wanting to start a Bryan Adams collection.
B000088E6D|5.0|What an impressive choice of music and better still, what an impressive voice. I read many reviews before making my purchase, and see that I'm not alone in my appreciation for this gentleman's talents.<BR>It is a FANTASTIC CD - a MUST HAVE!
B000002GJS|5.0|1991's WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS is atoss up for Adams best cd, the other being RECKLESS.  After his very boring and under performing INTO THE FIRE, Adams needed to return to his fun sounding music of CUTS LIKE A KNIFE &amp; RECKLESS.  Breaking from long time producer B.C., Adams brought on super producer Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lang.  This was a wise move, since ever thing Mutt touches turns out stellar, and his touch is shown here.  Plenty of hits on this cd, including my favorite Adams song EVERYTHING I DO (I DO IT FOR YOU), THOUGHT I DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, ALL I WANT IS YOU, CAN'T STOP THIS THING WE STARTED, DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS, &amp; THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER TONIGHT.  even the non hits are good.  DON'T DROP THE BOMB ON ME is really the only weak song on the whole sit.
B0000DD7NL|2.0|Clive Davis is Good at finding Material for Artists He works with.you can tell He Pre-dated the Cult-Classic Film \\"The Idol-Maker\\".Alicia Keys is Vastly Overrated&Creates Soul Muzak Re-Makes&patches at best.Yeah She can Play but still ain't wrote One Original Song yet.Vocally She ain't gonna Scare Christina anytime soon nor Beyonce.some of the Material here is cool but when you hear what Monica is doing with Missy&also Ashanti's \\"Rain On Me\\" what exactly Seperates Alicia Keys from them but Her Piano Playing? Alicia has followed Mariah Carey&Mary J.BLiege's Blue-Print at taking Older Cuts&Re-dressing them up.Ak is trying to reach the depth that Lauyrn Hill had but it's not coming out Natural but Her&Clive have a Formula that works.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|If someone would have told me that this cd was going to be great after I heard Songs in A minor I would have told them they were liars.  But, let me tell you Alicia has made a liar out of me.  From her hit debut song,You dont know my name, to the last song on the CD this is a hit.  I am sorry that this CD was not her first because it is truly what a debut CD should entails.<br />You really get a sense of who the artist is and you get a chance to travel down memory lane.  If I had to say what my favorite song is on the CD outside of the first track I would say it is a tie between Diary featuring Tone!ToneToni and Wake Up!!!<br />My recommendation to anyone who is having second thoughts because they really felt that her first CD was mediocre and should have been much better...THIS IS THE ONE FOR U!!!!!!  Purchase it today and u will be in love with it before the CD ends!!!!!  GREAT JOB, ALICIA!!!!
B00004S6GL|5.0|A lot of fans like to dog this album.  I have a theory for why this is.<br />It's not that the album is bad, at all, but that it's not the Elliott that THEY want Elliott to be.  They fell in love with the man behind either/or, or the self-titled, or (gasp) the barely audible Roman Candle.  They swoon for the quietness, the starkness, the nakedness, bitterness, intimacy.  They think &quot;hi-fi&quot; is a four-letter word, not to mention &quot;production&quot;, and dare I even say it, &quot;pop.&quot;<br />They were willing to accept XO as a temporary stray from the purity of their vision for his career.  In their forgiving state of mind, the music was able to seep into their brains and they saw its brilliance.  Hence, XO = good.  And, surely Elliott will get back on track next time.<br />Figure 8 comes along and dashes their hopes.  Their beloved tortured soulmate actually knows his way around modern expensive studio technology - AND HE LIKES IT!!!  Traitor!<br />Man, I love E.S. and E/O as much as anyone.  Love em.  Love em love em love em.  But I'm one of those who believe that Elliott broke through into an altogether new plane of genius with XO.  And Figure 8 is absolutely a worthy continuation of the path he was on.<br />Put it this way - if I'm taking ten to the desert island, XO is in the bag for sure.  Figure 8 will be really, really hard to leave out.  The others, I'll miss a hell of a lot.
038572179X|1.0|I was anxious to read this book, as I love books about the second world war. Plus, this book had received so many accolades.<br />Well, what a major disappointment. This is no masterpiece, or what can even be considered a good book. Part I is so slow, that you are ready to fall asleep by the time the \\"big event\\" occurs. Also, while there is a main character, 13 year old Briony, we are given too many points of view. I kept thinking, come on, can we get on with the story.<br />Now, we have a young man accused of rape, witnessed by a 13 girl. Well, we never know if the woman was actually raped. She never gives her side of the story. And what happened at the trial? Duh, there is no trial. Nada, zilch. Because, then part II opens, and rather than picking up where we left off--with Robbie being taken away, accused of a crime--we are suddenly in the middle of the British retreat at Dunkirk. Page after page of battle descriptions. For what purpose? I began skipping and skipping, hoping to find the story. It seemed odd that part II would center around what was a very minor character, and completely leave out every single detail of his trial and how he ended up in prison. All we know is that he was in prison for the crime that Briony accused him of, and now he's free.<br />Then part III, we meet up again with Briony, who is just as unlikeable as she was in part I. Part III was probably the best of the lot, but you still haven't a clue as to what actually happened. Since when does a person go to prison on the basis of the testimony of a 13 year old girl--who wasn't even the victim!<br />The ending is about as ridiculous as it gets. We are supposed to believe that this whole story we just finished reading is really just a novel that Briony wrote. That's the \\"Clever\\" twist of it. All I can say is that I'm thankful I borrowed it from the library.<br />This is one of those books that is so full of itself, that it pretends to be great and monumentous, but in fact, is very poorly down. This is so much missing, and much of it is so cliche. It makes so much of the great crime, but the crime really isn't all that great because as far as I know, England does have a trial system. A person goes to prison after being put on trial, and not because an obnoxious 13 year old girl says so. We are never told anything at all about how Robbie ended up in prison, or if anyone defended him, or what the victim herself had to say. <br />I felt nothing for any of the characters, except for Briony, who I disliked intensely. This book is just a pompous work where the author writes pages of descriptions that go nowhere, tell you nothing, and leave you wondering when the story will begin.
B000059QYB|4.0|I started to get interested in Billy Idol when I first  heard &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; and &quot;White Wedding&quot; on the radio. I decided to buy his CD specificlly for those two songs, and I atomatically fell in love with it. I found that this CD contains just about every single that Billy Idol made. It contains &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; and &quot;White Wedding,&quot; which are two of his most popular singles. There's also &quot;Mony Mony,&quot; one of Idol's number one hits. Along with those three, there is also &quot;Cradle of Love&quot; which was Idol's first golden single. From his old band, Generation X, there is &quot;Dancing with Myself,&quot; one of my personal favorite songs. A couple songs that I don't really like are &quot;Eyes Without A Face,&quot; a very slow and boring song, which apparently some people liked. Another praticular &quot;bad&quot; song on this CD would be &quot;Hot In The City,&quot; which I don't know why he released into a single. Other than those two, all the songs combine the great voice, lyrics, and guitar that Billy Idol used to make all of the songs popular. I'd say that this CD is mainly for Billy Idol fans, but I think that people who have never even heard of Billy Idol would like this CD also. &quot;The Greatest Hits of Billy Idol&quot; makes a nice Christmas Gift.
B00009V7RF|2.0|I got this cd while I was just looking around the store.When I saw that &quot;Shut Up&quot;,my favorite new song on the radio was on it.I knew I wanted it.After getting to my car I put it in and was in love with &quot;Shut Up&quot;,after it I started back at track 1 and worked down the line to see if any of the songs stood out and few did.Of the few were,&quot;Hey Mama&quot;, &quot;Hands Up&quot;, and &quot;Smells Like Funk&quot;.But aside from these tracks I never have liked any.I'm not saying not to buy this album, I'm saying listen to samples from the net, or borrow a friend's copy, just try it before you buy it.I am still happy with getting this,just so I could have &quot;Shut Up&quot;<br />By the way, &quot;Hey Mama&quot; is in a t.v. ad for iPod.<br />  &quot;Shut Up&quot; is in an ad for XM Radio.
B000002WYT|5.0|This album shows Dave Matthews Band at some of their best.  Crash, Under the Table and Dreaming, and Before These Crowded Streets are the very best DMB albums.  Crash has amazing musical content, with wide varieties, changing from the suspenseful Two Step, to the mellow, quiet Let You Down.  The album-title song, Crash Into Me, was a massive music hit.  If you want a great Dave Matthews Band album, Crash is one to buy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I LOVE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!!!! BOOKS, MOVIES, GIMME WHATEVER. MMMMMMMMM
B000003TAR|5.0|I'm not really a big fan of Nirvana- I realize all of their innovations towards modern alternative rock,, but still, I feel that they are very ridiculously over rated and were not nearly as good of a band as 90% of the world thinks they are. However,, I still do really like this cd a lot... I mean yea, &quot;Nevermind&quot; is a landmark in the history of rock music, but like I said,, way over rated.. I feel that this was Nirvana's best work ever. I have always loved &quot;Rape Me&quot; and &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; way better than &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;- you can only hear that song so many times... This is also probably Nirvana's most punk-ish album, whereas Nirvana were the most punk-influenced of all the Seattle bands<br />This is a good album that remains a 90s alternative classic, but still, for the early 90s Seattle sound I'll take Alice in Chains or Soundgarden over them any day
B00005T30L|5.0|i was very impressed by the director's works...his other film was crumb which i also enjoyed greatly...<br />this movie is very fun to watch and every scene has some little interesting detail in it you don't necessarily realize in the beginning that it makes watching the movie again feel like a new experience...<br />i don't know why i like it so much...maybe cuz i had a depressing teenage years and i guess in reality, we are all teenagers still in some ways...it's not only about being teenagers but fed up with the conformist nature of our society...everyone has become culturally conditioned to become puppets and think...<br />and the enid character is so unique, attractive, and interesting in so many ways...although i saw an interview with the actress and now she looks exactly like those skinny lifeless hollywood models the movie rebels against...i guess that's what hollywood has become...
B000002N2P|5.0|Green Day were pretty much the first band I liked- of course who COULDNT get addicted to them back in 94-95?? They were pretty much the soundtrack to my youth. Well I've kind of lost interest in them now- Not just because their new stuff is total crap, but just because that well,, I really don't like 'pop-punk' at all.. Now of course I realize that Green Day are NOT pop-punk in the vein of garbage like Blink 182, New Found Glory, or The Ataris.. I mean THOSE bands are boy bands with guitars! But still... u know... <br />Anyway, I do feel that this is Green Day's best work ever- Dookie is a classic, no doubt about that,, but u know,, u can only listen to &quot;Basket Case&quot; and &quot;When I Come Around&quot; so many times... This is Green Day's distinctive sound without all the mainstream hype... Also this might be Green Day's darkest and heaviest album ever.. If you listen to Dookie and then listen to this one you can really hear a difference, not just with being heavier, but the lyrics...<br />If I could take one track off of here, it would probably be &quot;Brain Stew&quot;- it's just one of the big over-hyped hits that you can only listen to so many times...<br />I really could care less about Green Day now, but this is still a great album, for great memories of the 90s and great to turn up loud for fun :)<br />A nice cd to slap Blink 182, New Found Glory, and Good Charlotte in the face with :)
B00008H2LB|5.0|OK....when I first heard this album, it was just ok, but now after listening to it over and over, I LOVE IT!

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Anytime Maynard is involved in anything it's bound to be great, and this is exactly that. The last time I enjoyed nearly every song on an album was Lateralus and this is pretty close to being as good.  And for everyone that hasn't discovered Maynard and his many faces I suggest you listen real closely when you put this cd in, and maybe you'll understand something that nobody else does
0553582445|2.0|One damn thing after another happens to Fitz, fifteen years after the end of his previous adventures.  Neat low-tech survival details followed by romance-novel gushiness seemingly designed to pre-empt the slash writers, some court intrigue, action scene, action scene, character self-torture, action scene.  Dangers pile further and further on Fitz, but the whole thing is past-tense, so you know something amazingly convenient is going to get ratcheted in place just in time....    On the plus side, you no longer want to throttle the main character for his endless tortured internal conflicts---there's a _new_ character who's _worse_.  Also, what could have been a simple Good Guys/Bad Guys scenario is nicely complicated (here's a hint: what if ACT UP turned really nasty).    If you have a lot of free time, this is less of a waste of it than your second hour of web surfing, but more than your first.

B000089RVX|1.0|Is it just me or does this girl's voice go right through your head? I've heard other people say she's got such a wonderful voice, but whenever I hear it I have to turn it off. It is so whiny, I can't stand it....
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I bought this album just because I wanted to hear the tribute to Layne Staley ghost track on disc 2. I started listening to the album, and now I can't take it out of my cd player. I was a little disappointed with most of the PJ albums after Ten, but this one is not disappointing at all to me. Disc 1 has more energetic songs than disc 2. The songs on disc 2 seem more emotional and soft. My favorite songs from disc two are &quot;Other Side&quot;, &quot;Fatal&quot;, &quot;Footsteps&quot;, &quot;Bee girl&quot;, &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, and of course the ghost track. Disc one was great too, and I like the following songs the most: &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, &quot;Black, Red, Yellow&quot;, &quot;Gremmie Out of Control&quot;, and &quot;Hold On&quot;. If you are a Pearl Jam fan or even a fan of Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Audioslave, or Soundgarden, than you should definitely buy this album because it has a great grunge sound to it like the albums released in the early 90's.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan has always been an artist who conveys complexity with simplicity, and \\"Afterglow\\" is a sparkling example of this precept.<br />While \\"Afterglow\\" does not pack the punch of Sarah's 1994 breakthrough release titled \\"Fumbling Through Ecstasy\\", which kicked off with the amazing \\"Possession\\", \\"Afterglow\\" is as touching and thoughtful as her best work. This release has received mixed reviews and while everyone's opinion should be respected, I think that some reviewers are being a little harsh as most of Sarah's work takes time to sink in. \\"Possession\\", while an AMAZING song, is the exception and not the rule in Sarah's approach to music but I too wish there were an equivalent punch here.<br />On this release Sarah's voice sounds as beautiful as ever and there is something so soothing to Sarah's music that it warms my soul and reminds me of the person who introduced me to Sarah. Thanks Curtis! Some reviewers have expressed the belief that all the songs sound the same and other were bored while others compare it to a diary of a high school girl, but I found this release to be quite cohesive and reflects the thoughts of a grown woman. One could argue that Sarah is not breaking any new ground with this release, but I still recommend it.<br />A lesser artist would have abandoned her amazing producer, included guest rapper/hip hop artists, and would have posed in a sexually provocative manner on the cover of this release. Sarah follows her own path and does not believe in making changes for the sake of change. If you are a Sarah fan and appreciate her subtlety, I highly recommed this release as long as you don't expect something vastly different from her previous efforts. My current favorites are \\"Fallen\\", \\"Stupid\\", \\"Time\\", and \\"Dirty Little Secret\\".
B0000CEB4V|5.0|My buddy Bob &amp; I have been doing a once or twice a year get togethers to watch Beatles video (mostly bootlegs) for over 20 years.  We love George and the Carl Perkins Rockabilly session is a real fave.  We were 6th row for Paul in Atlanta in May '02.  We are serious.  The concert for George is great.  It's not the party that say Paul at the Cavern is, but it is great.  We always loved obscure Beatles like &quot;I Need You&quot; from Help.  Remember in the movie that scene at somewhere like Stonehenge with the military thing going on when he sings that song?  Tom Petty doing it is a real &quot;crank it&quot; moment for us.  The photography is beautiful and the music is fun.  Get started with this and later wear it out with &quot;Carl Perkins; A Rockabilly Session,&quot; from 1985.  It's the happiest George on video there is.  This 2 dvd set is both the theatrical release with interviews and the entire show.  Watch them both, but don't be surprised when the &quot;entire show&quot; version becomes your favorite.  Buying this DVD is a good investment in your mental health.  Enjoy!
B00004RJ71|5.0|Blood in Blood out is the greatest gangster movie of all time.  whoever didn't like this movie is crazy. Damian chapa did a great job as miklo.  This movie is hands down the greatest ever!
B00003ZKSP|5.0|okay first off lets get one thing strait....even though mushroom head used masks first that dosnt mean slipknot is stealing the idea from them, i mean there were other bands that used make-up before mushroom head. okay back on topic, this cd does kick ass it was like nothing else out there when it came out. a warning to everyone, if you dont like nu-metal then i wouldnt recomend this cd for you, but everyone else needs to get this cd it is unbelivable, the cd has so much energy in its songs its amazing. about the bonus tracks though even though they are all good i cant help but realize that the song despise is alot like the song purity(the cd purity is on is REALLY hard to find) exept some of the lyrics are changed.<br />anyway im sorry i couldnt write a better reveiw then this....i guess you will just have to trust me and get the cd
B000065V1V|5.0|Like an unfamiliar friend, Heathen's haunting sedition invites you into wanting to be more than just acquainted. After the first listen, the CD player was set to repeat as Heathen cycled four times, and then you're hopelessly hooked. This is not an easy accomplishment, yet David commands this ability so easily.  Though each track stands on its own, this is a package, each song a member of the family and shouldn't be orphaned.  This is such a seductively rich package, why would you want to listen to anything else once this disc starts?  All the superlatives have been said already and they're all not only appropriate, but there's certainly more that haven't even been invented yet for David.  In my 44 years, I have regarded The Beatles as the Paradigm of modern popular music recording artists; a gift.  \\"Musical Artist\\" is a title thrown around much too loosely these days.  David is not one to be ranked.  An artist simply is, and David is a gem to the world in this respect as well.  Will nothing slow this man's musical momentum down?  When I think of Bowie's \\"Pin-Ups\\" album and it's tribute to other band's great music, Heathen is a tribute unto himself, yet at the same time reveals a freshness that is unlike anything done prior.  This is modern music writing done the way it used to be, while continuously exploring new frontiers.  Everything you have ever enjoyed in Bowie's work from day one to present is here.  This is the best greatest hits album Bowie never did!   This man is so clever and has such ingenuity that while listening, you hear so many different shades of things by other people that might have done but never did, all the while sounding like no one but himself.  On \\"Slip Away\\" you are weaved through a time capsule that meshes Space Oddity meeting Procul Harum with a momentary smack of John Lennon's Jealous Guy.  This is not a musical comparison, just an eerie journey that visits emotional musical souls of the past.  \\"Everyone Says `Hi'\\" is so simplisticallyrich with charm that you just want to...hug someone!  It so prolifically captures the sincerest desire of reunification from the separation of a loved one that it bring tears and hopeful happiness all at the same time.  The opening track, \\"Sunday\\" opens with such power and emotion and from then on you begin a musical journey that you have no desire to return from until all too soon, the disc closes.  \\"Heathen (the rays)\\" is an ethereal closer.  A song of searching and enigmatic plea, which is very emotional, as all great closers are.  This CD is a real roller coaster that just glides you into each dynamic incline, dip and bend.  Top radio plays?  Unfortunately not, though as these capricious masterpieces deserve the attention of every proclaimed \\"music lover\\", only those fortunate enough to have the mind for genuine proficiency in classic/contemporary rock will be privileged enough to find this out.  David's musical genius, similar in a completely different way to the poignant cleverness of Roger Waters, commands a perfect work here.  If you are a follower of David's music, this is a must have.  If you are a self-proclaimed Bowie fan and find this any less than irresistible, I can't even imagine what you've been listening to all these years.  It's not Ziggy Stardust, it's not Hunky Dory, it's not Alladin Sane, Station To Station, Young Americans, Tin Machine, etc.  It's every single one of them.  As a bonus, Bowie manages to include the best stuff that even Peter Gabriel and Adrian Belew haven't done yet!  David's voice has never been better.  Never.  From delicate urgency to raw authority, David has never been in better control, of everything.  I shouldn't make absolutes here, and Bowie is as hard as it gets considering his enormously wonderful harvest of masterpieces, but if I could only have one...this is it.  This guy has never looked, or sounded better and is at the top of his game.  At this rate it's hard to conceive what he can do with another 30 years, but my guess is he will \\"Never Let You Down\\".
B0000DD7NL|5.0|After listening to Fallin' once, I became a huge Alicia Keys fan.  And then, after listening to Songs in A Minor I became an even huger fan.  I have to admit that I was worried about Alicia suffering that sophomore jinx, but after listening to Diary, I shouldn't have been.  Alicia has done a wonderful job of living up to the high standards of Songs. while the whole album is great, it's really the first 6 songs that really stand out: Karma (a lil hip hop flava to it), Heartburn (an addictive disco piece produced by Timbaland that is EXCELLENT!), If I Was Your Woman (a Gladys Knight remake with an urban beat), You Don't Know My Name (first single), If I Ain't Got You (a beautiful soulful song), and Diary (a very sweet, melodic song.)  All the rest of the songs are nice too, just not stand out songs like these first six.  Anyway, this album will definitely not disappoint you if you like listening to good music.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The extra footage in this edition of The Two Towers goes a long way towards improving the film adaptation of this book.  I was especially glad to see the fleshing out of Faramir because it shows you why he wanted to bring the Ring to his father so badly, and his parting conversation with Frodo and Sam in the sewer below Osgiliath further redeemed his character.  It was also nice to see Sean Bean again as Boromir briefly in flashback.
0316779237|3.0|On the Friday after Thanksgiving 2003, a news report circulated telling us of a woman trampled nearly to death during a mad rush in an early morning sale at her local Wal-Mart.  Underneath her bruised and broken body was discovered a sad cardboard box containing an ultra-cheap DVD player, which the store managers kindly put on hold for her.<br />The above story is something that isn't a million miles away from the non-fiction Christmas stories told in HOLIDAYS ON ICE.  All these stories have the ring of truth about them even (as in the anecdote I mentioned above) if one suspects that the facts may have been somewhat embellished.  It's their inherent believability that makes them funny.  But once David Sedaris moves towards outright fiction, his stories are less successful.  It feels as though he is constantly trying to outdo himself, making the stories more and more outrageous for fear that the mundane may not be as funny as the shocking.<br />In any case, here are some quick comments on each of the five essays that make up this short collection:<br />\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" -- David Sedaris entertains us with his stories of working a terrible job as one of Santa's elves in a Macy's department store.  This is the highlight of the collection - a very funny piece indeed.  People are funny to Sedaris.  From the utterly bizarre people who take on the role of Santa and his elves to the equally strange people who show up to wander through SantaLand, all of them provide us with many laughs.<br />\\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends And Family!!!\\" -- Not one of the more successful efforts in this collection.  Oh, the initial idea is amusing enough, but the execution leaves much to be desired.  In short, this is a parody of one of those over the top generic Christmas letters than some people will mail out to everyone they know in an attempt to compress an entire year's worth of news into a single newsletter-sized message.  The essay is funnier when it's mocking the little things that go into these communications (the overuse of multiple explanation points, the disturbingly flowery language), but less funny when it tries to tell it's story.<br />\\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" -- The story of the Sedaris family taking in a lady of the evening.  This essay is rather short, and ends up feeling more sweet than funny (though it's definitely amusing).  <br />\\"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\\" -- An even shorter essay than the previous offering, but it is hilarious.  Yes, one of the more annoying things about the holidays is being dragged to the inevitable children's production of some Christmas themed story.  Or, to be more specific, an adult directing a group of unenthusiastic children in a horribly boring play.  Sedaris perfectly captures the deep, deep horror that each self-aware member of the audience will experience if forced to attend one of these ghastly affairs. <br />\\"Based Upon a True Story\\" -- Yikes.  I didn't care for this one at all.  An amoral television producer comes to a small town on Christmas to ask permission for the filming of a Based On A True Story TV Movie.  This might have been much more amusing had Sedaris not beaten us over the head with his satire.<br />\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" -- Again, a fictional story, and, again, not as successful as the true-life memoirs.  This details the escalation that two families undergo in their attempt to become the biggest present-giver in the neighborhood.  Sedaris abandons any attempt of subtlety and instead goes for over-the-top laughs.<br />As you may have gathered, all of the stories in this small collection revolve around the holidays, and there's a lot of comedy fruit to be harvested from that time of year.  But for as many as he successfully picks, he bludgeons others to pulp.  It was a short collection so even the uninteresting pieces don't drag on for too long.  HOLIDAYS ON ICE makes for a handy antidote to anyone feeling overwhelmed by the \\"holiday cheer\\" that comes around without fail every year at this time.

B00005JMFO|5.0|This movie was thoroughly enjoyable.  I thought it was not only funny but heartwarming.  The opening and closing scenes at the airport of all the people hugging - reminded me of how much we love each other and how underplayed it is.  This is a movie I would watch again - it made me smile and feel good.

B0000931OG|5.0|There's something I don't quite understand about this album. Until May of this year, Blur was one of the most respected bands  among indie music fans. This album came out, everyone praised it, and then a couple of weeks later it was forgotten about. I'm not sure why any band would actually lose recognition after releasing their defining statement. <br />To be fair, Blur isn't just any band. Along with Radiohead, they are one of the few groups I know that refuses to make the same album twice. Everything they release is brilliant but different enough to draw in new fans and drive away long-timers. <br />I started liking Blur after 13, (even though I bought \\"Blur\\" based on Song 2.) Even having bought the enitre bands catalogue ,including side projects, I still never saw an album this diverse and brilliant coming. The album leads off with its best song in which Damon proclaims \\"I aint got nothing to be scared of\\" I cannot think of another band that it is more true for. Damon has attempted just about everything there is and has always come out on top so what does he have to be scared of?
B000002UYZ|2.0|I love the Beatles. I love every song on this collection. What bothers me is the fact that there is slightly more than 65 minutes worth of music in this collection and it is released as a double cd with double cd PRICES! This entire collection would fit nicely on a single disc. I feel the record companies (EMI and Capital)are taking advantage of Beatle fans by overpricing this item. Buy it used and save some money!
B0000019PA|5.0|So pitchforkmedia.com just released their top 100 albums of the ninetees just a couple of weeks ago and all tredy indie-kids like myself who need help thinking on their own (haha just kidding) wet their pants with anticipation across the country. I think that the biggest surprise was that this claimed the honor of being called the fourth best album of the nineties. Good? yes. Brilliant? Probably. Essential? without a doubt. Fourth best of the nineties? That's pushing it a little bit. This album is fantastic nonetheless. <br />Drawing comparisons with this album is insanely difficult becuase it doesn't really resemble anything ever recorded. This was extremely out of the blue and wound up being an inspiration for some of the best bands working tody. (Deffinately check out Castaways and Cutouts and Her Majesty... by the Decembrists) Acoustic-Punk-Folk? Fuzzedout-Manic-Pop? Whatever you call it, its good. Fourth best of the 90's good, no, but really damn good, deffinately.
0375759174|3.0|More lighthearted and less polished than Austen's other novels, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is the chronicle of its heroine's adventures in turn-of-the-nineteenth-century British genteel society.  Catherine, of marriageable age and reasonably attractive and well bred, goes on holiday to Bath, where she meets the gentlemanly Mr. Tilney and befriends the fickle Isabelle and her callow brother John.  Her adventures in Bath and, later, in the home of her new acquaintances comprise the plot of Austen's mocking tale.<br />As usual, Austen is mocking the meeting-and-mating customs of then-contemporary Britain.  But she is also mocking the gothic novels of the day: Catherine, influenced by the lowbrow literature she reads, is forever attributing dark motives to her acquaintances and skeletons to their closets.  &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is unusual among Austen's works in that it attacks not only the society in which its heroine operates, but the heroine herself.  Catherine is easily manipulated and slow to learn from her mistakes, and she bumbles into her eventual happy ending completely by accident, none the wiser for her troubles.  And Austen makes clear, at the book's opening, that she does not wish to attack the novelists who write the books from which Catherine derives many of her false ideas: the error is Catherine's misapplication of the stories' lessons.<br />Although it was not published until after its author's death, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is clearly a first novel.  Its tone is different from the main body of Austen's work, and its quality is lower.  While a pleasant read, the book is not particularly compelling and would probably be most enjoyable for Austen aficionados seeking a comprehensive study of her work.
0380789035|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and I had a hard time putting it down. It made me think a lot about the nature of divinity, about the place of the old gods in the modern world (though I was disappointed not to see any of mine in the book), and about what kinds of things Americans seem to \\"worship\\" nowadays. The conversations I've had based on this book were quite interesting. So maybe as a novel it's not the best ever (though it's quite good), but as a starting point for pondering and conversation, it's superb.<br />(Plus, Odin's conversation with the \\"Pagan\\" in the coffee shop was quite familiar to me, and good for a laugh.)
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let me start by saying Let it Be was never one of my favorite Beatles albums. I had never purchased it before last week. I am much more a Revolver, Rubber Soul and White Album fan. This remaster has really improved my opinion of this album. The sound is greatly improved over Phil Spectors &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; tweaking of the recording. This is definitely very stripped down and sounds like you are sitting in the studio. I have never been fond of some of the songs Paul McCartney did ( esp When I'm 64, Martha,My Dear, Obladi oblada,etc) but The Long and Winding Road without the orchestration is WONDERFUL! The get down rock and roll tracks such as 1 after 909, I, Me, Mine, etc. are little changed. The second disc would probably be enjoyed more by the Beatles fans who really enjoyed the Anthology series, because the guys are talking between themselves more than playing any songs. If you already own Let it Be and are happy with it, this may NOT be something for you to purchase. If you don't own Let It Be, or are unhappy with it this would, in my humble opinion be well worth the purchase. It is a much better sounding recording.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album showcases the best of Britney.  People may say they liked her better back with Oops i did it again and &quot;baby one more time&quot;, back when she wasnt writing her own music, causing contreversey, and defining herself as an artist.  Face it, the new Britney packs a serious blow into the pop music scene which is now all &quot;I love you this....&quot; and all fairytale love.  Britney shows herself at her MOST creative shes ever been.<br />No matter what people have to say about her, shes defining herself with this album.  Shes not another Stacie Orrico, Beyonce, Ashanti, pop product who just sings about cheesy love and being so happy all the time.., she cares about her musics direction.  The sad things is she is getting chastised for trying to make a change in style, which is a sad thing if thats what this has come to.  Britney fans and Anti fans know that this album will spark intrest, and everyone knows that this shows she has more creative power then any other female artist now.

B0000CFW87|4.0|I am a die-hard Groban fan, but I must beg to differ with the vast majority of the reviewers here and say that Josh's voice just isn't as powerful as it was on the first album - or even in Concert, or even when he sang with Streisand in the latter's Duets.  I wonder if it's because of the overproduction of the songs, but I've listened to the CD many, many times, and his voice just doesn't sound as powerful and deep as it was in his previous works (honestly, I think his voice is going the route of Charlotte Church in &quot;The Prayer&quot;, which would be an awful shame).  I don't know if it's the problem of the producer or if Josh has just tired his voice too much, but that voice, though still vastly superior to most, just doesn't have the same &quot;punch&quot; as it did.  I truly hope Josh will find his voice back on his next album.

0385504209|5.0|Although I rarely read or review fiction, this book leaped into my consciousness, in part because I just reviewed a book on the Vatican and its use of spies as well as its vulnerability to spies from Italy and Germany, among others, and because I am very interested in the concepts of both institutional corruption vis a vis historical myths, and the alleged infallibility of the pope.  More recently, I have taken an interest in religious subversion of national governments and policies, and strongly recommend Stephen Mumford's &quot;The Life &amp; Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U. S. Population Policy&quot;, which is still available from Amazon via the used book channels.<br />The Da Vinci Code is most interesting, not because of its bashing of Opus Dei, but because it addresses what may be the core injustice in Catholicism (I was raised a Jesuit Catholic in Colombia, with roots in Spain): the concealment of the normal sexuality of Jesus, his marriage, and the fact that until the mid-1800's, the Church did not dare to claim that the Pope was infallible, and that all that preceded that claim was based merely on a man's prophecies.  Jesus, in other words, can not lay any greater claim to our faith than Mohammed.<br />Most relevant to me, as I consider the need for elevating women to positions of power because they are more intuitive, more integrative, and less confrontational than men, was the book's discussion of the origins of paganism (not satanic at all, but rather worshiping Mother Earth and specifically the human female mothers from whom life obviously emerged) and the manner in which the Catholic Church deliberately set out to slander Mary Magdalene, making her out to be a whore rather than the spouse of Jesus (from whom issue came), and murdering five million women in a witch-hunt and global psychological operations against women that has been mirrored by Islam in many ways, and that must, if we are to survive, be reversed by thoughtful people willing to think for themselves.<br />This book, riveting in every way, suggested to me that we the people need to doubt the integrity and intentions of all our institutions, but especially the Catholic Church; and that we need to reverse the centuries of discrimination against women, restore the matriarchal roots of society, and again begin to respect the natural relationship between ourselves and the Earth that we have defiled precisely because we have allowed men to abuse women, and corporations to assume legal manly personalities abusive of governments and the tax-payer.<br />This is a revolutionary book.  If it causes you to question authority and re-think your relationships, you cannot have made a better purchase.rsed by thoughtful people willing to think for themselves.<br />This book, riveting in every way, suggested to me that we the people need to doubt the integrity and intentions of all our institutions, but especially the Catholic Church; and that we need to reverse the centuries of discrimination against women, restore the matriarchal roots of society, and again begin to respect the natural relationship between ourselves and the Earth that we have defiled precisely because we have allowed men to abuse women, and corporations to assume legal manly personalities abusive of governments and the tax-payer.<br />This is a revolutionary book.

Some may consider it the least impressive of the pixar films but it's still worth watching.
B000001FS3|5.0|Many avid listeners to the Irish rock band will agree that this album contains a little bit of everything that U2 has to offer. Love, Religion, Drugs, Politics, and all around good music.<br />Inspired by Bono's mission trip in Ethiopia, &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; is possibly the most popular, being about wanting to escape to a place where the complications and worries of world, or specifically, the claustrophobia of Dublin, don't matter.<br />&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; can be interpreted in different ways. Depending on how you look at it, it's a pop song either about a relationship with another person, or one with God in which a person gives devotion, but wants more.<br />&quot;With Or Without You&quot; can also be a romantic ballet, or one of religion. One with a good beat, and very well-delivered lyrics.<br />&quot;Bullet The Blue Sky,&quot; being about Bono's experiences in Salvador and America's involvent in Central America, is an emotional hard rock song that changes rhythmically throughout this recording and has never been played the same.<br />&quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; starts out calmly with a strumming guitar and piano and lyrics about a couple using heroine to escape the life they cannot change, and the excitement builds up just as the drug gives them new eyes.<br />&quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; is a sort of slow folk song, which goes along with the hard working day of a miner and the pressure of the British miners strikes that lost them their jobs.<br />&quot;In God's Country&quot; is song about Irish immigrants putting their life at risk to seek a new one in America and hopefully escape religious persecution. A well-written ubpeat ode to the American Dream.<br />&quot;Trip Through Your Wires,&quot; like &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; and &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; was heavily infuenced by American music and delivers a love song with a harmonica, keyboard, and a catchy tune.<br />&quot;OneTree Hill&quot; remains my personal favorate for its harmoneous intrumentals and it's perfectly written lyrics about an unjust loss of a friend (Greg Carroll and Victor Jara in this case), which almost anyone can relate to.<br />&quot;Exit&quot; starts out almost in scilence about a religious man, and builds up with intense druming, singing, and quitars as the man grows dangerous and remorseful from his guilt, and commits suicide.<br />&quot;Mothers of the disapeared&quot; ends the album with another emotional ode to happenings in Salvador, this time to the mothers who never found their children after losing them to the Pinocet regime, which Bono believed was backed by the Reagan Administration. The end of the song bleeds perfectly into the beginning of the first.
B00006879E|5.0|SONGS ABOUT JANE is sure to become a classic pop/rock album.Released way back in the summer of 2002 its about time fans and radio stations alike have finally taken notice to this great album. The first single HARDER TO BREATHE, was just a tip of the iceberg and if you like variety, you have found the right album. The second single, THIS LOVE,  blends pop, with rock and dance and is a song that you cant help singing and dancing along with. There are also ballads to choose from as well and I would look for either MUST GET OUT or SHE WILL BE LOVED to be possible single choices sometime in the near future.<br />Other standout tracks on the album include SUNDAY MORNING, THROUGH WITH YOU & THE SUN with each track on the album sounding distinctly differant.<br />There are definate R & B/funk influences all over this album and will all of the rap songs and R & B ballads taking over the pop charts these days, it is very refreshing to hear a group like Maroon 5 and songs like HARDER TO BREATHE and THIS LOVE getting significant play at radio.<br />Buy this album today and be prepared to sing and dance all day and make sure you catch them live when they come to a town near you.
B00005JM9C|5.0|This movie was awesome! It is one of those movies I will buy and watch over and over and over again. The dancing was awesome. And the overall story-line was good what with the kids and dancing and all. This movie was great. Of course, all of this is just my opinion, you may think this movie is horrible, but I loved it and thought it was great and that is all there is to it.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|When I first listened to it I was diappointed in three things:<BR>1.  It's only ~40 minutes<BR>2.  It is simply not as good as FTE, Surfacing or Solace and it's very differnt.<BR>3.  The bulk of the album is chorus.<br />It grows on you after a while, but it is very different than her other albums.  It needs to be appreciated separate from every thing else she has done. My advice is buy it, and listen with an open mind.  Don't expect to hear her best album though.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I am, and always will be, a BIG Beatles fan.  I have followed them since I was born.  I remember being so sad when George and Patti divorced, then even more sad when Patty and Eric divorced.  And to see Eric singing &quot;Something&quot;--wow.  If I were Patty, I would have cried.  I sat alone in my living room watching this DVD, and I kept having to repeat everything, because it was so GREAT!  You can't top Billy Preston, he was really great.  And I really enjoyed Jools Holland and Joe Brown.  I was greatly surprised that Tom Hanks was on the DVD!  I highly recommend this DVD--it's really wonderful, and the performances are probably some of the best you'll ever see!
B00005JMFO|4.0|Richard Curtis, co-creator of Blackadder and sole creator of Notting Hill, Four Weddings and the Vicar of Dibley, has reverted almost to the sketch format with which he started his theatrical career -- back in Oxford 1979 with the 'Inferiors' Revue. Could he really not devise a single story with sufficient depth to last 100+ minutes? Is this why he now says he won't be writing any more romantic comedies?<br />Many film critics have asked whether he was wise to both write and direct this film of vaguely interlinked stories. Although he has many friends, Curtis perhaps had too much power in this production, which made it difficult for others to warn him of the potential errors he faced.<br />The main problem with this film is that it has no message. It is an unashamedly feel-good movie which uses all the usual Curtis devices -- climactic car journeys, declarations of marriage before big crowds, up-tempo pop, casual swearing by upper-middle-class, up-market house interiors etc etc -- to manipulate the audience's emotions into leaving the cinema having had a good time. If anyone else is like my wife and I, you may have had plenty of discussions afterwards trying to unravel why things happened -- e.g. \\"Surely that bar scene in the American mid-west was just a fantasy dreamt by the guy as he flew over to the US?\\". But aside from discussions about the existence of deleted scenes and who was the best actor, there is no sense of having learnt anything or of having been changed by seeing the movie. Indeed, the injection of so many up-and-coming British comedy stars (e.g. Marcus Brigstocke) leaves one with the queasy feeling akin to having seen a Carry On film in the 1960s.<br />Richard Curtis writes the lifestyle he knows: most of his characters work in the media, they all seem to live in sumptuously decorated but homely dwellings, and many of them are ex-university.<br />This film is certainly inferior to Notting Hill and Four Weddings. But Emma Thompson is truly excellent in her role as the Prime Minister's sister and slighted wife of the media executive played by Alan Rickman. Rowan Atkinson is again disappointing in a tiny cameo role -- frankly the only characters he does well are English nerds (Bean) and authority figures (e.g. the later Blackadders and the roll-calling schoolmaster), but he does these outstandingly well. Hugh Grant increasingly looks like a one-trick pony when he plays the PM without gravitas.<br />Probably the greatest problem for this movie is that Martine McCutcheon is not a particularly beautiful woman. It's hard to think of someone who could play a better tea-lady than her, but there is no real chemistry between her and Grant.<br />I found the school Nativity play scene slightly incredible, in that all these characters with up-market jobs should send their children to a state primary school. Here Curtis is deviating from his own experience, as a product of the public school system, and I find it disingenuous for him to suggest that his characters would all decide differently from what he has himself done and put their children through the state education system. Maybe he's a Labour luvvie when it's convenient.<br />But there are many great moments in this film, such as Hugh Grant knocking on doors in the dodgy end of Wandsworth, Colin Firth proposing to the wrong sister in Portugal, Bill Nighy hamming up a rehash of the Robert Palmer 'Addicted to Love' video, Nighy addressing his interviewee as 'Ant or Dec' etc etc.<br />Go see this movie. You may be disappointed, but you'll still enjoy yourself.in her role as the Prime Minister's sister and slighted wife of the media executive played by Alan Rickman.

6304973187|5.0|My seventh graders are reading Romeo and Juliet, and another teacher suggested I use this video to help reinforce the text. I absolutely fell in love with the movie when I first got it. Though it uses Shakespeare's language, which is challenging for my ESL students, the modern dress and situations help them relate to the text. The movie begins with the punk-like Montague boys encountering the Capulets in a gas station. A gun fight and explosion result. My students loved the action! The movie is similar enough to movies they have seen for entertainment, that it really draws them in. The directorial choices Luhrmann made help keep the kids interested. Mercutio - a big black man in drag at the the Capulet masquerade - awes them. I recommend this movie to teachers of literature and to people who love an attractive movie with an awesome soundtrack.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a GREAT movie for all ages.  It's is very funny and entertaining.  I think it is the best Disney Movie that has ever been released.  I highly suggested buying this movie.
6304233639|5.0|Like watching the Empire State Buliding explode and watching the people of NYC run for their lives to escape a massive wall of fire. Also, watching the shadow of the mother ship spreading over the World Trade Center(and at the dawn of the next day when the destruction of NYC, you can see that the Twin Towers are still standing and they are on fire near the upper floors).<BR>I saw this in the movie theater and to this day I still remember the hissing and grumbling that occured when the White House is destroyed.<BR>I liked the pro-American, we will never surrender, will fight to the death to protect this land theme.
0156027321|5.0|I speed read but this book forced me to slow down and savor.<BR>This is not the kind of book I'd normally be attracted to.  I need dialogue, emotional insight, relationships with people, something that's going to make me change the way I experience the regulars in my life.  Pi gave me something else.  His descriptions of the ocean, the fish, the sky, the tiger, changed the way I look at the physical world.  His book literally woke up my eyes.  Whenever I feel my eyes are getting tired or unable to recognize beauty -- this is the book I will return to.
B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie was a big disappointment.  I was hoping for an entertaining flick, lots of action and fighting, etc. but instead it was kind of slow and tried to fill in way too much back story.  Really we just want a story, don't we?, when we watch one of these comic book character driven movies, not the whole history.<br />The computer effects were good and there are a couple of decent action scenes, in fact, if it means anything, my 2 and a half year old saw the \\"green monster\\" on the cover of the dvd and asked to see it.  So I showed her the part of the movie from the previews, where the Hulk fights the tanks and helicopters.  She made me replay it about 10 times, so I guess that's an endorsement of that sequence, too bad the rest of the movie couldn't keep up.
B00013F35I|4.0|OK, so the sound is shoddy periodically.........the camera work is good, but not as good as NYC.......as for those who also received the defective disc #2....I called SONY and got a replacement in one week. It arrived with a paid envelope to mail them the bad disk back......it also came with a letter of apology...all in all, can't complain about the service or about the show for the asking price. Buy it....it won't hurt.
B000002V07|3.0|I bought this CD for one song only. If you liked Fade into You so much and were willing to pay the price then buy it.<BR>The rest of the CD like another reviewer said was an acquired taste. I couldn't make myself to listen through the entire CD.
B0000024SN|4.0|Sound of Silence es el primer disco clsico del do, un bien elaborado trabajo para 1966, ao en que ya comienzan a suceder cosas relevantes en Estados Unidos en lo que respecta al pop ms meldico y barroco (Beach Boys, Association). No hay mejor manera de comenzar todo que con Sound of Silence, un clsico absoluto no slo de su poca sino de la historia del rock, y tampoco hay mejor forma de despedirse que con I Am a Rock, otra excelente obra maestra. Entre medio hay tambin momentos de alta calidad.

0156027321|5.0|You start reading the book about the life of a little Indian boy Pi and the story behind his name..India ..and the influence of the foreign occupation .. then you are taken into a different place with a different insight .. you go back to Pi and his parents and their zoo..then a big change in the story and you are in the middle of the ocean with Pi and his animals.. seems like any other story but the ending is what the story is all about.. it is so shocking and for me it is unbelieveable although &quot;it had no animals&quot; ..<br />It is true that we take life for granted and that with the rush of everyday life you forget about what really counts and what life is all about .. do we really have to go through all that misery to realize where we are and why?!!<br />I read a quote that said something about believing in God and for me Life of Pi made me believe more and made me realize how blessed I am just to be here and to enjoy and cherish every moment..<br />Martel is great .. simple language .. subtle meanings and deep insights .. I could relate to the way of life in that part of the world and understand his base and the person Pi became..<br />Enjoy
B00005JM0B|2.0|The first one was ground breaking and put Arnold in the perfect role.  It was worth seeing again and again.  The second one took a risk, and it paid off big.  Great flick.<br />Then somebody had to push it.  It's not that this movie wasn't entertaining and doesn't have some great special effects, but it just doesn't work.  It doesn't flow.  It was a big let down from the previous two films.<br />Is it worth owning?  I guess for those that are totally into the series it is.  I'm not in a big hurry to even see the film again, which is a shame, because the first two were so well done.  A mild recommendation.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|just a great, great show. Sound is great, picture is great, packaging is stellar. Tom Petty doing &quot;I Need You&quot; is one of the many highlights......the only thing that the show was missing was Bob Dylan.....
B00005JLTN|3.0|While everyone has their own thoughts on the movie, the one thing that everyone will find aggrevating is the audio on this DVD.  All of the speech is 1/2 the volume as the SFX and Music, so either you are being blasted by bangs, booms, and punches, or you can't hear anyone speak.
B00003CXDB|4.0|In \\"Wall Street\\" everything moves around the money. The main motivation of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) and Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is getting as much money as they can, no limits, no boundaries. Director Oliver Stone managed to capture on-screen the `80s decade perfectly.<br />\\"Wall Street\\" is a very good movie thanks to the script, the direction, the dialogues, and above all the performances of the lead actors Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen, all of them gave an outstanding performance, specially Michael Douglas in the role that got him an Academy Award.<br />As usual, Oliver Stone created a very personal movie, he co-wrote the screenplay and dedicated the story to his father, a former stockholder. But Stone didn't exclude the audience because the movie presents the fascinating and complex world in Wall Street, and also the movie shows very human feelings such as the ambition, the greed, the envy, the revenge and the personal integrity.<br />The DVD doesn't include a lot of extra material, but the features that does include are quite good: an audio commentary by Oliver Stone, very valuable, of course, theatrical trailers and a very interesting \\"Making Of Wall Street\\" documentary, with interviews and commentaries by the cast and the production crew of the movie. \\"Wall Street\\" is a very interesting and entertaining movie, very recommendable.
B000002RXS|5.0|Everyone, please get thie recording. From top to bottom, it's superb. Ms. Callas is truly nasty as the heroine, and she makes you love her for it!! Her tenor, Don Jose' is beautiful, to say the least. Micaela is just what she's supposed to be, a pretty voice to counterbalance that of the mezzo. And the orchestra ... I can't even decribe what a thrill it is listening to this disc on headphones! It's like you're in the recording studio with them.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I never got into comic books, well except for a brief period when I was about 11, and so I really had no expectations when the first X-Men came out, other than I was hoping to see a good fast action flick.  I liked the first movie, but I think this one did it one better.<br />The action and fight scenes were good, the story flowed well and the interaction between all the players was pretty good, considering there were so many different characters, this was no easy feat.  I won't rehash the story or plot, I just wanted to add my two cents that for those that don't follow comic book super hero's, but like bigger than life sci-fi fantasy type action movies, this one's a winner.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film is deeply beautiful, with wonderful performances from the cast. All fathers should aspire to this level of love and devotion.
0393307050|5.0|I bought \\"Master and Commander\\" after reading the reviews of the movie (which I haven't seen yet) - which all took time out to talk about the books.  I'm now down to the 10th book in the series of 20, and I can't believe I never discovered Patrick O'Brian before.  These novels are quite extraordinary - they paint a picture of a world and a time and a way of life that is gone - physically harsh and brutally disciplined, but emotionally intense - where you might die or lose a limb as a routine part of your job - the job you started, incidentally, when you were perhaps 9 years old.  <br />Although each of the books stands alone perfectly well, they are actually a continuous narrative of the lives of two men. Aubrey and Maturin are the sailor and the scientist-cum-ship's-surgeon-cum-intelligence-agent, an unlikely but utterly convincing friendship. Aubrey is a traditional and very successful and capable naval commander with no social or political guile, and with a large talent for getting himself into difficulties when not at sea.  Maturin is brilliant physician, a more complex and astute character, and more politically savvy, but he will never graduate from \\"landlubber\\" status in the navy.<br />The battles, the environment - and the language - are all authentic.  And yes, that does make the books heavy going to start with - but you can ignore the naval jargon, just as Maturin himself does. (After a while you may find yourself using it, to the bemusement of your friends and family.) And if you've ever wondered \\"what did people do to fend off boredom before television, movies and corporate sport\\", this series leaves you thinking that maybe the world was a more interesting, engrossing, and intimate place before our engagement with it became so \\"virtual\\".
B000000JO3|5.0|definitely one of the best hardcore/punk cds. not one bad thing about this cd. the lyrics tackle issues such as religion, dating, straight edge, and lost friendships. a great introduction to the punk/hardcore scene. best songs are: filler, out of step, straight edge, and look back and laugh.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|...<br />I saw it as the story of a trouble youth told in a way lashing out at society. For example, all of Donnie's acts of arson are done because Frank tells him to, but he only sees Frank when he's whacked out on his meds. (much like how ritilin is dished out to any and every \\"trouble-maker\\" in grade school.) <br />Interpret the ending as you see fit. Was it all just in Donnie's mind? Look at the jet engine being hauled away and notice the strange red swirl, almost as if it were dreamt up. Buy the DVD I guess, maybe the commentary can shed some light on the matter. (I think the matter would best be left up to individual interpretation. Movies like Donnie Darko force you to THINK. ... I guess I have to make my own mold\\")<br />...
B00009RDG9|2.0|I found this movie to be a clich&eacute; through and through.  It was predictable and pretty boring.  The cat and mouse was just tired and rehashed.  Tommy Lee Jones is much older than Del Toro, so while he was believable as a teacher, it was beyond belief that he could hunt him down and fight him as if he was just a young athletic himself.<br />There isn't much dialogue in the film, at least not much that matters much.  There aren't any good twists or surprises.  There are other cat and mouse movies, Cliffhanger and Shoot to Kill, two examples that are set in the woods, that are much more exciting and offer more plot twists and more developed characters.<br />Not much of a recommendation here.  Certainly one to rent if you need to see it, I can't imagine seeing this twice.
0385504209|1.0|So this is the publishing event of the year?  I never thought I'd agree with Harold Bloom and all those other literary snobs, but this is a sad commentary on the American reader.  This book fails on almost every level.  First, the writing: simply horrible - honestly I can't remember reading such wretched prose.  It's written at the eighth grade level.  Yes, it moves along quickly, but that's only because each chapter is about 800 words.  People have been coming up to me and trying to pass off the information they gleaned from this book as historical fact - folks, it's not true!  Brown has done just enough research to pull the wool over your eyes, but if you approach a real scholar of church history, ancient history, or art history they will double over laughing that you bought this tripe.  Please, please before you decide this is the best book you've ever read try some non-bestsellers, maybe even a classic, like The World According to Garp by Irving, the Fifth Head of Cerberus by Wolfe, Peace Like a River by Enger or the Blind Assassain by Atwood.  Those are great books. This is a thinly sketched outline for the next brainless hollywood blockbuster.

A MASTERPIECE!!!!, I only know 4 albums that are masterpieces and defenetly this one goes to that group as one of the top. Her voice is better than ever, her style is simply superb, her songwriting is way much better and her music's simply amazing! If you like music at all, you will love it, I assure you! You will never regret! NEVER! So get your a** out of your chair and go and buy Alicia's new album, and you have my word is an instant classic!, you will absolutely love it!!!!<BR>Good work Alicia!!!! keep the good work!! And all the luck in the world, cos you know girl, you deserve it!<br />The Diary Of Alicia Keys--10 stars out of 5 simply a masterpiece!
0792164903|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I had not had the luck to see it in the theatre, but after renting it I had to buy my own copy. Tim Burton does a fantastic job of creating a dark mood. Even the photography has muted colors, which adds to the atmosphere of the movie. Johnny Depp's character, Ichabod Crane is a quirky and amusing. The best is Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. I could not think of anyone better to play this part. Overall, this is a horror movie that actually has horror, not just blood and gore, not to mention a believable plot, which most horrors fall short on.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I just realised that didn't write a review, but rather my opinion in a previous &quot;review&quot;. Sorry 'bout that. Well, in one word, The Two Towers Extended DVD is: Brilliant - No need for further explanation:).
0380789035|2.0|Surprised, that is, that this book has been met with such critical acclaim.  I found the characters, especially Shadow, to be wafer-thin, and plot holes abound, many of which have been pointed out by previous reviewers.  The writing is pedestrian, without much spark, and never did I reread a section for the simply enjoyment of well-crafted prose.  It wasn't a bad read; it was just very average, and I certainly don't think its worthy of the accolades heaped upon it.  Perhaps my luke-warm response was in part due to the fact that I read Meiville's fantastic Perdido Street Station immediately prior to this.  The ideas in American Gods are tired and recycled, folks, not incredibly imaginative - if you want to be blown away by a writer's imagination, try China Meiville.  My theory as to why this book has met with such success: the sci-fi community is always looking for those authors it feels can accomplish two things 1. impart literary respectibility to the genre and 2. reach a wide audience.  Gaimain is the current anointed one, so he's going to keep piling up the awards until everyone realizes the mainstream literary community still just doesn't give a damn.
B000067IZ3|5.0|This is a movie with starpower and sustance, but it commits the same mistakes with consistency troughout the movie. If you can look beyond them, great, some of us can't.<br />mistake 1: the only cast member that does not produce the spanish language with a thick american accent was Salma Hayek. Everyone else, From Del Toro to the little characters is a Culprit of mangling the language into an East L.A. version of it.<br />mistake 2: All scenes in cars in the Mexico side have all the actors \\"buckled up\\" when in Mexico the bucke up law just passed in 2008, In fact buckling up is considered for sissies by the macho military/policial culture.<br />Thoper Grace's performance was a surprise, the kid did break out of his tv personna.
B00006690G|5.0|When I first heard this album I was surprised, I felt that he hadn't moved up from Marshall Mathers LP, I felt there wasn't that much of the raw anger, as there were no songs like Kim on there. Yet listening back on Marshall Mathers LP to the Eminem Show you realise that Eminem has grown musically, the ryhmes, the way he spits and the content are much more mature then before. The issues are even realer,that the anger is there just more on an hidden layer. In my eyes this album is excellent! Not only has he moved on with his lyrics he's beats are incredible as is his content and lyrics. Many of the songs are heartfelt, yet there is still some of the jokey songs that Eminem is well known for. I can relate to this album and see his pain with the whole pistol whipping incident. An excellent album for those fans and non fans! <BR>Not only is he buff but he is talented! Buy The Album!!
B0000A36J5|5.0|I can't understand why some people are forever complaining about the changes made in the Lord of the Rings movies. I mean for heaven's sake. You try making a 1000 page book into 3 movies of 3 hours or less! I think Peter Jackson did a fantastic job.<br />I have read the books a thousand times and I am amazed at the brilliancy of Tolkien's writing. But I am a hunderd percent sure that he would still like the movies. <br />I agree that there are some stuff (like the elves at Helm's Deep and Aragorn's tumble down the cliff after the battle with the Wargs) that is not at all in the book. But that could simply be to make it more watcheble and intriguing (not that I'm saying Tolkien's original work is NOT Intriguing) or any other logical reason that I wouldn't know since I didn't ask Peter Jackson himself. <br />I am however sure that very few movies that are adaptations from books are made precisely like the book, down to the last letter.<br />That's just my opinion.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|The five stars is for Hoffman's acting and the story.  The only thing good about the special edition is that its priced reasonably, probably because there is no specials. The previous release, that is now out of print, contained both full screen and widescreen format to view.  I guess for the Special edition you should have a special TV, like a widescreen 40inch plasma screen and call it theatre. ($3,000) No thanks just wanted to see a good movie on my standard telivision that is 20inch $174.00.

B00005RFVL|5.0|Like several recent US posters, I first heard of Robbie Williams in the credits of \\"Finding Nemo\\" as I loved his cover of \\"Beyond the Sea\\". Went to Amazon.com and found this record, but lo and behold--because it's an import and not widely available in the USA--it's $30! <br />Then I found the Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall DVD, which is based upon the same album (the concert was used to promote the upcoming CD), with the same songs, except it's live versus being recorded in the Capitol Studios in Hollywood. (Go figure, this CD was recorded in LA, but imported back from the UK at twice US CD rates.) Additionally you have the DVD video and the \\"tribute to Vegas and the Rat Pack show\\".<br />If the $30 doesn't bother you, you prefer the CD without the DVD show [which includes two \\"F\\" words between songs and Vegas style show girls (no nudity, but a little risque--blazers without bras or shirts underneath)] I highly recommend this CD. But you MIGHT want to read further on Amazon.com in the DVD section for the many fabulous reviews of the DVD and get that instead.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|i've just finished watching the new versions of the first, third and fourth films (i've seen the special edition of the second before), and i'd like to let potential buyers know what to expect.  the new version of the first film is by far the best of them all.  the third, however, uses footage where the sound could not be recovered completely intact, so subtitles kick in when the dialogue becomes difficult to understand (you can turn the subtitles off, though).  the third probably contains the most new footage of the four films--probably more than the other three put together.  the new version of the fourth film has a perplexing sequence where the guy in the motorized wheelchair thing gets a knife stuck in his thigh, removes it, and throws it back at ron perlman's character.  call (winona r.) then removes the knife from wheelchair's thigh (again?) and breaks off the blade??!!  huh?  anyway, at the very least you get the director's cut of alien, the special edition of aliens, and the theatrical releases of all four (in case the problems with the new versions of the last two bother you a lot).  plus over 2 whole days worth of bonus material, which i haven't yet had the time to peruse.  all in all, an excellent set and an inexpensive one at that.
076790592X|4.0|After hearing much raved reviews for this novel, I decided to give it a whirl. It turns out, this novel was one of the most inspirational novels I have ever read. Morrie Schwartz, an elderly man dying from Lou Gherig's Disease, is reunited with an old, close student of his. Morrie wakes Mitch up from his monotonous, meaningless life. Morrie teaches him lessons about life and living, as he reaches his last days. Every Tuesday Mitch makes the journey to Morrie's watching him wither away more with every visit as they discuss love, spirituality, happiness, and the other essentials in life. If you are looking for an inspiration, Mitch's story of his Tuesday's spent with Morrie is a great place to start. This book gets my recommendation.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|After reading X-Men comics as a kid, playing the video games as an adolescent, and watching the cartoon as a teenager, I finally get what I've been waiting for.  WOLVERINE STABS PEOPLE WITH HIS CLAWS!!!!  Ummm, oh, yeah the cameos by Jubilee, Colossus, and Kitty are kinda cool too.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My nieces and nephew are crazy about this movie and, after putting it on one night a few months back to get one of them to sleep, I became hooked. (I've since bought a copy for myself.)<br />This movie is definitely for both children and adults.  I'm FAR from being a prude but it's refreshing to be able to watch a movie without having to worry about every other word being a curse word, some guy's a** filling the screen, or some woman's breasts falling out of her too tight top.  Once in a while, you just want to be able to sit down and enjoy a show without having to explain the sexual overtones.<br />It takes talent to be able to use your voice in the way that Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and the other actors and actresses in this movie did.  To me, doing voice work takes more out of you than being seen on the screen.<br />On the DVD version, be sure to check out the short film, \\"Mike's New Car.\\"  Hilarious.<br />Pixar did a fantastic job with the animation.  I'm sure it took forever to put this movie together and three cheers from someone who is appreciative of their hard work.<br />I don't understand how anyone can attack this movie, or any kids movie for that matter.  The line about the content not being real enough got tiresome a real long time ago.<br />Kids need to daydream once in a while.  They don't need to deal with \\"reality\\" 24/7.  That's an adult's job.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater's new album is definitely their heaviest since \\"Awake\\", if not ever.  It's mostly good, and I like it better than their last album, \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\".  It's less experimental, and a more straight-forward sounding metal album.  Though this does have the odd time signatures and crazy instrumental sections we've come to expect from Dream Theater.  <br />\\"As I Am\\" is a catchy, fairly simple metal song, with a main riff that sounds a bit like Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\".  It grew on me, but it's probably the weakest song on the album, and the solo adds nothing to it really, in my opinion.  \\"This Dying Soul\\" is much better.  Heavy, 7 String guitar riffs drive it, much like it's predecessor, \\"The Glass Prison\\".  \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" has some beautiful melodies in the verse, and a loud, Pantera-esque chorus.  The instrumental section is also the best on the album, reminding me of \\"Awake\\" and \\"Change of Seasons\\" (That's a good thing, as I prefer the older albums by far to the newer ones.)  \\"Honor Thy Father\\" isn't bad, the chorus has a badass, Black Label Society-ish metal riff that I like.  \\"Vacant\\" is beautiful, and it leads into the instrumental \\"Stream of Conciousness\\", which is pretty awesome as well.  The main riff somewhat brings to mind \\"Orion\\" by Metallica.  This is the longest and one of the more complex DT instrumentals, featuring loads of time changes and key changes, and lots of soloing.  \\"In The Name of God\\" is the 14 minute epic that closes the album, and it's a great song.  There's a good mix of good melodies and heavy riffs, and the instrumental section has some pretty sick playing by everyone.  The piano outro is pretty nice too.<br />There's pros and cons to the heavier, more aggressive sound on this album.  There's definitely a lack of great melodies, especially during the instrumental sections, which instead of interesting melodic lines, they are pretty much just going up and down scales.  At ridiculous speeds, no doubt, butit's just not as interesting, at least not to me.  Also, John Petrucci used to be able to balance shredding with great melodies and compose some amazing solos (\\"Under a Glass Moon\\" for example, or \\"Scarred\\".)  Here, he mainly just shreds, which is cool, but limiting.  <br />On the other hand, the aggressive sound is pretty cool.  A lot of the riffs are quite awesome.  \\"This Dying Soul\\", \\"Honor Thy Father\\" and \\"In The Name of God\\" all have some ass-kicking heavy riffs, reminiscent of Pantera or early Metallica...A cool thing, in my book.<br />The only lyrics that really impressed me on here were John Petrucci's \\"Endless Sacrifice\\", which describes well the pain of a rockstar living away from his family.  Along with the nice melody in the verse and the cool Maiden-esque part at the end, it's very touching.  &quot;Vacant&quot; is also moving put together with the music.<br />So, it's not nearly my favorite DT album (that would be \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Awake\\"), but it's definitely worth buying if you're a fan.  I wouldn't really recommend starting with this album though, check out the aforementioned two first.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This really is an incredible film.  The action is well shot and used liberally to great effect, the characters are well developed, and the plot reaches a climax, which lasts for about an hour.  The first time I saw this I was on the edge of my seat in the theater, no joke.
B0000251W5|3.0|I was 10 when this album came out, my brother and I put the c.d. on, we thought, wow, what a good rocker album.  As i grew older, i realised what a difference in sound from SSOASS to no prayer.  In fact, i heard that the change in sound was the reason (or at least one of) that adrian smith (guitarist----for non fans) had left the band.  I guess that is my greatest complaint with this album.  the sound is not good at all.  with SSOASS, maiden hit their peak with that beautiful sound and on this album, first song we see is holy smoke.  ok song but the sound sounds real sloppy.  I do like quite a few songs on this album and i still don't understand why maiden refuse to play some songs from this album.  give it a chance, it is definately not ssoass part 2.  sound is different and writing is different too but it is a solid rocker album
B000089RVX|3.0|She has a grrrreat voice and the music is good...but the lyrics...suck<BR>Its almost as if she's...trying to sound depressed.<BR>Kinda artificial words. But its still decent music I guess.
B00000JMOJ|4.0|A great sci-fi flick with toned down 80's effects by today's standards, but the storyline and characters are what makes this worth watching.  That and of course Arnold's great lines like &quot;He had to split&quot;...&quot;Wanna lift?&quot;
B0000DIXDR|4.0|You love the movie and have seen it a few times, right?  Hear about a sequel? Well, that's exactly the reason behind this new DVD, to promote Havana Nights making you remember all that was great about the movie in the first place.<br />So why get this Ultimate Eidiotn on DVD? Why, for the extras of course!  Besides being a totally Remastered edition with enhanced sound and visuals, try experiencing the movie with a personal intro by baby herself: Jennifer Grey.  Then learn tons about the movie with the trivia track that provides funny, entertaining and \\"interesting\\" bits of info.  Also you have more commentary tracks that you could have anticipated with Feature Length commentary by the writer/coproducer, another commentary where coreographer, her assistant, cinematographer, costume designer and production designer all drop in their two cents to share every detail of the dance moves to the wardrobe selection.<BR>There is a third commentary track by others involved in the production.<br />But if instead of several hours to watch the movie with their commentary tracks all you got is a few minutes to enjoy additional stuff, try the original Jennifer Grey screen test... yes, the audition she did before selected to star in the movie!  To satisfy your curiosity, there is an interview with Jennifer and the production team.  <br />But the most important things, IMHO, are the exclusive sneak peek of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, to satisfy your curiosity about the \\"sequel\\" which is only a new and different movie with a similar story line and the same title.  Plus, three music videos: Hungry Eyes, She's Like the Wind, (I've Had) The Time of My Life.<br />For Patrick Swayze fans, unfortunately, there is nothing new of him here... besides the aforementioned music video.
B000024Y9L|2.0|I reviewed X factor by saying that it was a solid overall album.<BR>When x factor came out originally, it was 1995 and i didn't originally like it (still missing bruce).  So when virtual XI came out, there was a hope for optimism (as is the case with every maiden album).  however, nothing disappointed me more than when i heard the first two minutes of angel and the gambler.  I hope i don't insult anybody but songs are too long, boring and repetative.  In angel in the gambler, he says &quot;Don't you think i'm a saviour&quot; like 65 times or something.  and there are other songs that are repetative like this.<BR>What I like, the clansman and futureal and the guitar solo's.  some of the best solo's i've heard.  but overall, it is a forgetable album. Don't get me wrong, the reason i don't like it is not because blaze is the singer, i just find that maiden was trying too hard to be maiden.  i would give it a 1.5/5.  Tour for that album was quite good though.
B00007K08H|4.0|I can't agree that this is the &quot;most charming movie ever made,&quot; but it is one of the most beautiful. If you watch it, pay attention to the photography. Nearly every frame is a watercolor painting come to life, even the most mundane scenes.<br />Take, for instance, the snippet where Amelie encounters the man playing the record player in the subway. Look at the colors, and how even the buttons on the man's coat echoes the peas in the painting behind him. Look, too, at the colors in the concierge's apartment and in the park -- everywhere! It is a feast for the eyes!<br />The colors and compositions are astounding, and the acting -- right down to the most minor characters -- is superb. Yet, I found the characterization and plot somewhat empty. It's all very cute and all, with Amelie going around trying to &quot;fix&quot; up people's lives, but it drags on way too long and ultimately ends on a rather meaningless note.<br />It's more than mere eye candy -- but less than a truly fulfilling film.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Before the discerning listener reads another word of this review, he or she should probably be apprised of this inescapable fact:  I adore the film &quot;Love Actually.&quot;  I have seen it 8 times.  I shall rouse myself from my mid-Sunday torpor and see it again - today - in precisely 2.5 hours.  This will probably color my review; for this, I plead wholly, unabashedly guilty.  <br />Anyone who believes that the best song the vastly underrated Troggs ever wrote and recorded was &quot;Wild Thing&quot; will be set right by the opening scenes of this marvelous film.  Ah, yes....the Troggs.  &quot;Love is All Around&quot; was, indeed, the apex of the British group's all-too-brief career - and this song was and is so delicious that not even a ghastly remake by an aging, embittered, ex-heroin-addict pop star named Billie Mack can dampen its luminosity.  My only criticism of this soundtrack CD is the fact that the original Troggs version isn't included.  But, my goodness...I withstood Yoko Ono's befouling of the White Album back in 1968 (when I was a mere babe of 10), so I can withstand anything, right?<br />Right.<br />Bill Nighy's portrayal of Mack is so hilarious, poignant, and ultimately triumphant that his bastardization of this song is one of the CD's high points.  Every listen to this remake harkens back to the film - and a million laughs provided by Nighy's uproarious portrayal.<br />The CD's other revelation is the stunning debut of 11-year-old Olivia Olson.  Belting out &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot; with all the joy, innocence and unfettered charm of an angel, Olson proves a marvel - without the self-conscious vocal histrionics of Mariah Carey.<br />Honorable mention also goes to Joni Mitchell's remake of her own &quot;Both Sides Now.&quot;  I first heard this song decades ago as a child of nine, and was, even then, struck by the purity and clarity of her voice.  Now, for this soundtrack, she adds layers of depth and wisdom to her performance, and it isused as a perfect complement to the film.  <br />Finally, Lyndon David Hall's interpretation of John Lennon's timeless classic &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; harkens back to those jingle-jangle, hopeful and glorious days in the mid-sixties when so many of us believed that love could save us all.  Of course, most of us have learned that life is sometimes more complicated than that:  sometimes abject anger is justified (especially post-9/11); love must be tempered by responsibility and selflessness, even at the cost of great personal sacrifice.  <br />But the miracle of &quot;Love Actually&quot; and its superlative soundtrack is that they don't get weighed down by platitudes, but they lift one's heart to the highest of heavens with their optimism and joyous embrace of love's possibilities for us all.  For bona fide film and music buffs like myself, that's about all one can ask for these days.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Leiji Matsumoto has masterfully crafted an indictment of pop stardom and what fame really means. Using the DAFT PUNK album &quot;Discovery&quot; as a brilliant musical backdrop, Leiji takes you on a sci-fi trip of stardom, fall from grace, loss, and the eventual recapturing of the soul.<br />The ending of this movie will leave you in tears of joy and redemption.<br />This is a masterwork, and a masterpiece.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Beautiful voice what more can i say and the songs are so relaxing and i oculd just sit and listen to the cd for hours Josh voice is sooo soothing. It's wonderful.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I love this album! It's so good! Her vocals definately grow on this album. I especially love ''Karma,'' ''So Simple,'' ''When You Really Love Someone'' and ''Dragon Days.''<BR>''If I Ain't Got You'' &amp; ''Diary'' are also 2 beautiful songs! The rest of the album is great too! You'll love it!!!
B00005JKMQ|5.0|I saw Ali at the theatre and went even ahead and bought the DVD. The reason is simple, this movie is GREAT. I am 25 years old and so was not borne when Ali was at his prime, but everyone who was told me that Ali was the greatest. When I saw this movie I knew why. Ali is much more than an outstanding boxer; he is a hero and an inspiration to the oppressed, the poor, and the mistreated. Ali's life personifies integrity, and the price one has to pay for the courage and privilege of living with integrity. This movie really focuses on the crux of what makes Ali a phenomenon.<BR>The soundtrack is breathtaking and Will Smith is darn lucky to play in this movie; his best role ever.<BR>There is a problem with the DVD though. Under \\"Scene Selection\\", Ali's fight against Frazier is termed \\"Ali vs. Frazier II\\". That's incorrect because the one shown is actually \\"Ali vs. Frazier I\\".<BR>Another problem with the DVD is that it doesn't show how the movie was made.

0451191153|5.0|After reading Atlas Shrugged I was a bit hesitant about reading The Fountainhead. I should have not hesitated. I literally could not put this book down. While the language is somewhat stillted and archaic, the characters are interesting, well developed, complex and conflicted. All the elements needed to produce an interesting story.<BR>The story concerns several people:<br />Howard Roark: A man of absolute principles. A genius at his work, and unbending in his desire to do it &quot;HIS WAY.&quot;<br />Peter Keating: Just the opposite. No scruples, and a third rate architect.<br />Dominique: A Puzzle. Always seems to do the opposite of what she really wants.<br />Ellsworth Twohey: An intellectual snob. Out to rule the world because the &quot;masses&quot; need him.<br />Gail Wayland: Publisher. A tortured confused man. In many ways more the center of the story.<br />The story is basically about the triumph of genius against the lowest common denominator of society and the battle against mediocrity and committee rule.<br />Each character is explored in depth and made interesting.<BR>If you were put off by Atlas Shrugged, you should read this, they are very different.<BR>I highly recommend this.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|By now everyone knows who Ellen Ripley is - Sigourney Weaver.  Actually she's the heroine of this 4 film - 8 disc phenomenon called &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;.  This box set includes all four films in the series in revamped, modified, remastered and re-edited editions. Why? - primarily because number three and four in the series could really use the help - I'm assuming, but hey, it's a pretty good guess.  <BR>PLOT of all four films: A survivor of an alien attack - Ellen Ripley, goes back for more and more punishment against a really nasty looking aggressor from outer space that by the last installment looks more like a finger puppet reject from Jim Henson's muppet lab.  Okay, enough criticism on the special effects.  Seriously, though; my advice to anyone who wants the original masterpiece from Ridley Scott and James Cameron's brilliant sequel; wait till January when the films will be made available separately.  <BR>TRANSFERS: Near pristine.  &quot;Alien&quot; - the first film, is the real stand out.  Color balancing is superb. Flesh tones are richly textured. Blacks are black. The haze and related age artifacts are practically non-existant. Film grain has been greatly reduced over the previous issued DVD. The audio has been masterfully updated. &quot;Aliens&quot; - same transfer as before; Cameron didn't really see the need to update it.  Near pristine. All of the above criteria apply. &quot;Alien 3&quot; Pristine transfer - sorry excuse for a sequel - even in this re-edited form. &quot;Alien Ressurection&quot; - I'm going to sleep, just thinking about it. All of the above criteria apply to these transfers as well.<BR>EXTRAS: I'm not even going to bother. Suffice it to say, that if you invest in this box set you will possess the largest compendium of useless information available to mankind on a digital format.  While the documentaries are a fantastic bonus, much of the material featured there is repeated in other &quot;extras&quot;.  There's also a lot of junketmaterial that really doesn't enhance your movie going experience so much as it indoctrinates you into believing part &quot;4&quot; is the greatest horror/sci-fi of all time. Yeah, right!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: Wait for parts one and two to become available on their own.  They're the only ones worth owning.
0783229321|5.0|First of all, it should be known that I had an ancient VHS taped recording of the complete movie from the days of Delta Tao Chi, and I had watched this classic since I was a wee teenager. That out of the way, any unabashed Nat'l Lampoon-o-phile will certainly tell you that this movie is a classic, of the sort like Blazing Saddles and NL's Vacation series that should be force-fed to students and people alike; and that this DVD should get a boot stuck up its ass, for the sizeable amount of Universal crap that is shoved down your throat barely leaves any room to tolerate the rest of the movie, which luckily enough is of high enough caliber to keep the DVD from being crushed by enraged fists. A medium-to-high quality DVD audience should be able to either stand up and mutter expletives while heading to the head (and come back well with enough time until movie begins), or press that useful FF button and click it enough until Scarface gets the detention of his life in the Breakfast club.<BR>If you like a DVD which gives you time to get some brewskies or drop a load, then you will enjoy a movie which all can enjoy.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Is that what she calls maturity??? It's the same over produced CRAP, and no SUBSTANCE WHATSOEVER...I was expecting to be shocked like when I listened to Aguilera's Stripped, but hell no...It's the same Britney.
B00007KWHN|4.0|Listen. This beautiful music pre-dates the keyboard theatrics with Wakeman...it's my fave.<br />The guitar solos come to life on &quot;Disgrace&quot;. The piano tinkles on &quot;Venture&quot;. The drumming is magnificent.<br />Great after a hard day's work.<br />Goes with Lark's Tongues by KC (same drummer on both) as wonderful mood pieces. Buy it.
0767830555|3.0|Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) has a big problem - and not just one. He's a seemingly ordinary New York cabbie who?s stalking one woman, Betsy (Cybil Shepard) while playing savior to another, Iris (Jodie Foster). But ol' Trav' is just a few coins short of a full meter, a neurotic oversight that will allow him to turn vigilante, threaten the political reelection campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) and blow away Iris?s pimp/drug dealer (Harvey Keitel). Suffice it to say, \\"Taxi Driver\\" is not your feel good movie of the summer. It is a cinematic snapshot of 70s pop culture gone horribly awry, with its crack and whore infested streets, its unstable social setting for easy scores and cheap sex, and a seething underbelly of corruption and dismal isolation as its acrid palette for moral decay. Travis? slow spiral into becoming the loner with a purpose is predicated upon warping the old adage and precedent that one man can make a difference. But when that one man is touched by his own sexual and financial inadequacies, his psychotic inability to bond with another human being and his self delusion - that he is on par with a deity, above the rest of humanity and the law ? then the difference he can make is between destroying himself and bringing about the next apocalypse. <BR>Martin Scorsese directs adeptly enough, drawing the viewer into this dark world of unsettling realities. The irony of the ending seems somewhat strained and rather a bit like the happy ending tack on associated with conventional Hollywood wisdom, but there is the frightening prospect that with a return to normalcy, Travis? alter ego is, like many a volcano, merely dormant, not dead, and destined to erupt in the future. <BR>     <BR>The transfer from Columbia is a rather disappointing remastering effort. There are moments when the color is bold, if dated, and moments when fine detail is generally realized to good effect. But the bulk of this video presentation is riddled with excessive grain ? both film and digital, a barrage of compression artifacts, a lot of aliasing, some tiling, and a considerable amount of edge enhancement. Night scenes break apart with pixelization and exhibit a very muddy color scheme. There's plenty of age related dirt and grit to further detract from your viewing experience. The audio has been remastered - but just barely - with low to no bass and a really screechy high end that betrays the original mono elements. Extras include a 70 minute making of documentary with interviews featuring the director and principle cast, a photo montage, still gallery, theatrical trailer and storyboard sequences.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I picked up this CD when it came out, after hearing Hey Baby.  For at least the first 6 months that I had it, I never made it past track 6- because I couldn't wait to hear the first 6 songs again. I keep it in my walkman and listen to it often for long power walks.  It is fun to listen to, has the beat to get you through the workouts!  It is a movitator.  I love every song on it.
B00005JKC3|3.0|&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; is the big budget, CGI, wasteful remake of the television show starring Lou Ferrigno that, of course, was based on the huge green guy in DC comics.  Here we get none of the television series depth of character development or interesting narrative.  Instead its a CGI festival, practically from the word GO and its dismal, dismal dismal.  One has the experience of being hurled into a none-too-friendly arcade game and with just about as much detachment as watching a box of cornflakes grow mold. Oh well, at least they're both green!<BR>TRANSFER: Fairly decent, though the CGI effects look even more artifical than they did on the big screen.  The desaturated color scheme is nicely balanced.  Texture on Mr. Green is accurate in close ups but tends to get a bit soft around the edges as the hulk goes into tearing up things. Blacks are black. Contrast and shadow delineation is effectively rendered. The audio is 5.1 and explosive - did you expect anything less?<BR>EXTRAS: They're there but I have to fess up - after a film as bad as this, I just didn't care!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: The hulk should have been cast from the ever growing aray of steroid-abusing bodybuilders that tend to resemble him more and more.  Venice Beach is where the producers should start looking for their follow up sequel, not behind the keyboard of a computer geek with dreams of tossing his computer out the window!
078322804X|5.0|This movie still has me in stitches after all these years.  I love the musical numbers with Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin.  The chase scenes are an all time classic, right up there with &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot;.  It's a classic comedy that was not appreciated when it came out the first time in 1980, but it grew as a cult classic!
B000003S2K|5.0|This is a very beautiful album of minimal musics. Listening to it while driving around the city at night makes for a wonderful audio/visual experiance, with the streetlights sliding slowly toward you, slipping over the dashboard and into the back of your head. The pianos have a crystaline presence that is accentuated by breathy, luminescent vocal loops in some places and icey, synthetic resonances in others. Liminal and cerebral; a must!
B0000DD7NL|4.0|The second release from Alicia Keys is a satisfying effort. The thrilling first single &quot;You don't know my name&quot; is a dreamy ballad with gorgeous background vocals and string arrangements. Her wonderful keyboard and piano playing are all through this release and cannot be denied. <br />The cd starts off with the blazing &quot;Karma&quot;, a song where the singer/songwriter finds herself being pursued by a lover who wanted nothing to do with her before. &quot;Heartburn&quot; is a pumping stutter-step slice of soul produced by TIMBALAND. Alicia must have been listening to JAMES BROWN with this one in mind. This is out of character for her but a welcolmed change of pace none the less. <br />Alicia works a remake of the GLADYS KNIGHT classic &quot;If i was your woman&quot; that is mixed to ISAAC HAYES's classic reading of &quot;Walk on by&quot;. A good combination. Other standouts are the confrontational &quot;Samsonite Man&quot;, the standard ballad &quot;If i aint got you&quot; (Which is a #1 song waiting to happen), also &quot;Wake Up&quot; and &quot;When you really love somebody&quot;<br />The instrumental &quot;Feeling you, Feeling me&quot; is a beautiful coloration of musical genius by a young talent determined to be mentioned with the greats like ARETHA FRANKLIN, ROBERTA FLACK, STEVIE WONDER, NINA SIMONE and DONNY HATHAWAY. KEY'S is behind the times just as much as she is with them, and that is nothing bad at all!
B0000666DW|5.0|This CD is one of the smartest purchases I have ever made, this band has so much RAW TALENT. This CD to me was not a just a crushing, heavy, technical album, but this album took me into a euphoric bliss. The drummer is so f*cking good, if he wasnt in this band, it would just be a good CD, but with him this CD is excellent. This CD goes beyond words for me and i suggest that you buy it, you will not be disappointed... In my opinion, all of the tracks are good. Just go out and buy this album now.
B000000XB9|5.0|The song &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; is my favorite. As poignant today as in the past, the lyrics are powerfull and say alot. John Fogarty is a guitar Master and a visionary in many ways..<br />even today. This CD say it all..
B000002KBH|5.0|The Grateful Dead have made many, many albums but this has got to be the best and essential album.  If you are interested in listening to the Grateful Dead at all buy this album immediately.<BR>American Beauty shows the Grateful Dead's transition from psychadelia rock to more of a folk-country rock.  The songs here are smooth, calming, and really a pleasure to listen to.  The band members work as a whole on this album and each songs is a standout track.  While none of the songs contain the Dead's trademark &quot;live jamming&quot;, alot of these songs are live favorites.  The song &quot;Ripple&quot; off of this album is my personal favorite Grateful Dead song.  Fans of all genres of rock (or any music really) will enjoy this classic album.  Top Picks:  Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil, Ripple
B000088E6D|5.0|I saw this guy on TV the other night, and immediately ordered the CD.  I love it.  I love this kind of music, and he does it well.  Good luck, Mr. Buble!
B00004Z400|5.0|This is the album that got the Deftones away from their Korn comparasions. It is by far the best album the Deftones ever wrote, I liked Deftones-Deftones and the others but this was a lot better in my opinion. First of all, it contained some or the best vocals Chino's ever did, and the best guitar work by Stephen. You don't need 7 strings to be heavy, Elite and Korea proved that. The Deftones also brought a DJ/keyboardist to their band, adding new sounds and soundscapes.<br />Back to School 5/5 sounds like old-school Deftones, and the cd would not be as good without it.<br />Feticeria 5/5 this is one of my favorite Deftones songs, also contains some good lyrics about fantasizing about kidnapping.<br />Digital Bath 100/100 one of my all time favorite songs, best performance Chino has ever done on vocals, best song as a band. If not for the new keyboardist, this song would not sound the same<br />Elite 4/5 heaviest song the Deftones wrote, cool screaming with the distorted vocal<br />RX Queen 4/5 cool sound they get with the guitar, creepy lyrics<br />Street Carp 5/5 awesome song. Very heavy.<br />Teenager 5/5 a new sound for the Deftones, acoustic guitar. <BR>Couldn't have sounded better. Also, brings the keyboards to the front.<br />Knife Prty. 4/5 Great song, great lyrics, one og the best the Deftones ever did, but the high-pitched screaming gets to me a little after a while.<br />Korea 5/5 KICK A-S SONG. the bridge is killer.<br />Passenger 5/5 Maynard, Chino, singing the same song, 2 best vocalists in metal. How can it get any better than this?<br />Change 5/5 not my choice for first single, (I would of gone with Korea) but great song none-the-less.<br />Pink Maggit 5/5 great closer. I love how it goes to Back to School in the end.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Britney's best CD yet. She has truly grown up on this album. I am so glad she decided to stop making bubblegum pop and go for a more edgy sound. People who didn't like the old Britney love the new Britney. This CD is worth getting no matter how old you are.
6302424887|3.0|Not to say that MacBeth SHOULD'NT be portrayed as a dark and bloody tale (because it is one of the most dreary of Shakespeare's popular tragedies), but it seemed that Polanski took the graphic nature of this play to an unnecessary violent and graphic extreme. There is an usual amount of unnecessary nudity in this movie-- Lady MacBeth's washing of her hands scene, the scene with the witches, and the scene with the young boy in MacDuff's home. The violence at the beginning of the play, as well as the fate of MacBeth, is quite gory. <br />The movie dialogue, the setting, and the acting are all exemplary, however. The visual scenery set in a dreary castle and backdrop of Wales brings forth the true mood that is effective for the play's premise. MacBeth comes to life as a tragic hero; we see the transformation of someone in power becoming more ambitious as the movie progresses after his meeting with the witches (and learning of the three prophecies). Certainly the delusion of MacBeth and guilt of his conscience are eminent with Polanski's usage of special effects (the ghost of Duncan, the dagger he sees in front of him). MacBeth's frame of mind and digression are depicted in his thoughts in the form of asides and soliloquies. <br />The film is an illustration of how ambition and want of power can lead to the downfall of individual or individuals, and this message is heard loud and clear in Polanski's version.  <br />Not a bad version, but it could have been \\"gored\\" down a little.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I write this with the knowlage that since damn near 1200 people have already reviewed this cd, no one will proably ever read this. Still after browsing through all the half witted one star reviews I felt the need to speak out. Nobody is demanding that you like this band. Many feel that Radiohead are the second musical coming(and I would be the first to agree) others do not. That's fine. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. However, it seems to me that many of these one star reviews were more focused on a primal dislike of the fans of Radiohead and not aimed towards the accual music itself. To these people I say: get over your issues in some other forum (start a club, write a book, maybe attend some meetings) if you have something constructive to say, by all means, say it. I'm sure there are some vaild points on why one would not like this album or this band and even though I feel strongly in favor of Radiohead I must admit in is unfair to expect all reviews to reflect my love of this band. Still if your only writing this dim witted reviews to be cheeky, please stop. The affect comes off as childish and stupid. That said, I feel better.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Ok its sad to admit it.. but yes i did get her CD... I've never bought one before and I heard a little.  I listen to it through and its not horrible.  I completely agree that her voice isnt great at all.  But this Cd is catchy and very different from her others, i guess not so pop-ish.  I know as a fact if she wanted to sing she can... not mariah carey sing... but its not this bad... she just does this wierd thing when she records... its like she supresses it and tries to whine a little bit too much. but any ways.. its different and despite track 2 being bad... the rest is decent... and its not the southern rap crap or 50 cent that are all over airwaves now.  I guess i just wanted sumthing a little different... If you want someone who can really sing go buy Alicia Keys new Cd or even check out MYA's moodring.  Monica is pretty good too.  This Britney  is different and better than the last ones... its more mature... sexier and not too pop-ish... give it a listen... i dont normally like this stuff but hey ...
0743424425|5.0|King scares at his best in The Shining. The book starts off kind of slow explaining the past and why Jack, Wendy and Danny are going to live in the Overlook hotel all winter. But as soon as Jack trims the hedge animals you cannot put the book down. Literally! I'm not your usual reader, I spend at most 3 hours a week reading but while reading this book I was spending every evening reading for at least two hours! I urge...no I demand any King fan who hasn't read this to READ IT! And anyone who loves the horror genre to read this book too (especially if you think you can't be scared from a book). This is by far (IMO) Stephen King's best and scariest book. Period.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow this album is quite amazing. Very strong music and great vocals from Britney. The best thing about this album is it sounds so muture and not bubblegum pop like her past albums. Her voice is very strong and powerful in this album. This is her 4th studio album with Jive Records. All the songs on this album are great and fast paced. The best song by far on this album is &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;. She really has matured as a musical artist since her &quot;Hit Me baby One More Time&quot; days. She is a great and talented singer and I hope all you people go out and buy this album, it is a smash!!! g2g Peace Out!!!
B00005JM0B|1.0|Terminator 1 = THE BEST MOVIE EVER!<BR>Terminator 2 = Okay, it's pretty good<BR>Terminator 3 = Are you sure this isn't a parody?
0812589041|5.0|I'll make this short. This is an awesome book about human emotion, leadership, isolation, friendship, and a very amazing book in terms of awesome story, amazingly well writen and described, and a great insight on human behavior. It is a Sci-Fi book, but I think anyone would like it. It is just amazingly well writen and descriptive.<br />It starts with a six year old boy, Ender, being sent to battle school to learn to be commander of teh fleets against a third alien envasion of the 'buggers.'<br />He goes through greuling training, trying to make friends, being isolated, hated, and minipulated. It is a great story, and awesome book, it can't be partly explained in all it's majesty, I cannot begin to describe how great this book is. So Read it!
B0000035E7|5.0|For those so-called Nirvana fans that love Nevermind and didn't really like In Utero that much don't buy this. Stick with your poppy alternative Nevermind. This is what grunge is supposed to sound like. Sloppy, raw, and an album cut for $600.
B00005JM0B|4.0|You have to give Arnold credit---as he ages, he does so gracefully and although the lines and wrinkles on his face are noticeable, he manages to have a pretty buff body for a California governor.  Director Jonathan Mostow, who gave us \\"Breakdown\\" sets the pace extremely well in this no-nonsense, shoot em up, bang em up thriller.  Beautiful Kristina Lokken is a formidable foe for Arnie in this one, and she evinces both the menace and heartlessness of this killing machine sent back from the future to try and kill good old John Connor (Nick Stahl, this time).  Claire Danes as a pretty veterinarian assistant gets hooked into the fray, and it's non-stop action from there on.  Although this is an excellently done movie (the effects are mind-boggling), it may be time to retire this series, as it seems Connor is at the point in the movie where it all started a century ago!!!  But undeniably a butt-kicker!
B000089RVX|1.0|I heard someone say these guys were Christians, but they look like gothlics...oh well it's not the image that matters (rappers have yet to figure that out) it's the music. And this music sucks. Period.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|As an owner of the previous 'Alien Legacy' collection I was a bit skeptical of this collection. No secret studios have turned DVD re-releases into a virtual cottage industry. In a lot of re-releases (X-Men 1.5) for instances its nothing  but a crude attempt to make money off fans. But this one - like the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition - is worth the price. <br />The Director's Cut of Alien and Aliens are a bit excessive. I think both are examples in directors fiddling with fairly perfect versions of their work. The most fascinating is the work print cut of Alien3 which gives hint to a much, much better film that could have been made (and I am one of the few that defends Alien3 as a flawed bit of genuis). <br />Alien: Resurrection is of course worthless. I've never watched it once when it came with my Legacy collection, and I doubt it will get much attention from me this time around.<br />The extras are really great if you are one of the very few people that utilizes the extras features. The sound mixes are immaculate (much better than the least release) and the transfers look great. The Alien Legacy set didn't look bad except for the transfer of Aliens which had a ton of artifacts and other bugs with it. Those are gone in Quadrilogy. Much improved.<br />My only real compliant is that Fox pushes Alien: Resurrection into an otherwise perfect set of films much the way the Godfather movies include Godfather, Part 3 because it is doubtful anyone would buy it.<br />A last thought: I hope George Lucas follows the lead of the Alien Quadrilogy, and includes both the original cuts and Special Edition of his Star Wars trilogy next year.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I absolutley love this CD!  I listen to it all the time!  This CD is for anyone who likes to dance their butts off.  It is also for anyone who didn't care for Britney in the past.  For example, I made my Anti-Britney friend listen to the CD while we were on our way downtown and now she owns it herself.  She was suprised at how awesome the sound and beats were.  This is definetly a more grown up Britney but I guess you can compare her to wine, only gets better with time!
0060531053|5.0|This is where you start (and I started) when learning the basics of homebrewing. It is an essential first step and offers simple step by step guidance along with more advanced considerations.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a great album. Though some tracks are ones that sounds like you would listen to them at 4 AM and some are just plain boring. But the majority of this album is very well put together by the lyrics, music and vocals. She is really clever to put 20 tracks on this album, if it was 13 (the average put on albums these days) she really would have had to put on the best of the best on this album if I was her and had to put on 13 tracks I would choose these:<br />1.Stripped Intro (01)<br />2.Fighter<br />3.Infatuation<br />4.Beautiful<br />5.Soar<br />6.Dirrty<br />7.Can't Hold us Down (Feat. Lil' Kim)<br />8.I'm OK<br />9.Keep On Signin'My Song<br />10.The Voice Within<br />11.Walk Away<br />12.Make Over<br />13.Stripped Interlude (2)<br />So yeah Though \\"Make Over\\" sounds nearly identical to \\"Overload\\" by Sugababes these 13 songs are the best by far! All the rest are somewhat boring. She has definitley grown alot since \\"Christina Aguilera\\" her debut album which was very very bubblegum pop which dealt with innocent high school crushes. Now she is signing about her abuse growing up (I'm OK), not worrying about what other people think of you and your appearance(Beautiful), Fighting back at your partner who chaeted on you (Fighter), Saying ladies can be like men and ladies CAN rule (Can't Hold Us Down), also she makes inspirational songs (Soar and The Voice Within), and being downright DIRRTY!! (Dirrty) This is definitley a 100% change from her debut album this is definitley one good effort even though some songs sound ripped off (sorry!)
B000000OQF|5.0|This CD Guns and Roses Appetite For Destruction is one of my favorites. I am not a huge metal fan or hard rock fan but this kind of music is kick ass to rock out on the guitar and play some of slashes licks. I am more into classic rock like Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan but who do you think was one of slashes idols?Jimi Hendrix. Slash's style was sweet it was differnt some songs on here to me are no good just dont fit the album but then theres songs that do. I love Paradise City and Sweet Child O' Mine. These two songs are my favorites on the CD I also like in a way Welcome To The Jungle. For the rest of the album I would have rated it a 3 but for three good songs on this hard rock group I give them 5. I can not say anymore but a must have for any guitarist if your not then dont buy this album go with something else to fit your type. Keep in mind this CD was listed in the new Rolling Stone 500 greatest albums of all time it must be great. ENJOY!!!!!!!!
B00005N7Z1|4.0|Eclectic (some would say eccentric) Dutch director Paul Verhoeven broke into the U.S. market in a very big way with his ROBOCOP (1987), which is not so much an action film as a high-energy adrenaline rush.  Its futurism is two-fold; it is a work of futuristic sci-fi but, even more significantly, when it was released in 1987, it heralded the future of action films: bigger, badder, faster, ultra-violent and extremely well-written.  Boasting a killer script by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier, ROBOCOP manages to be intelligent, cynical, metaphorical, bleak, allegorical, nihilistic, bloody, stoic, emotional and very funny--often in the same scene.<br />It is also extremely well-acted.  Peter Weller brings a lot of subtlety to his doomed Officer Alex Murphy, while veteran blond actress Nancy Allen (previously known for her varied roles in some of the best '70's and early-'80's films by Brian De Palma, to whom she had been married during that period of time) brings a lot of strength as well as sensitivity to her Officer Anne Lewis.  But most memorable are the bad guys: Ronny Cox as Dick Jones, the cold-blooded Senior VP of OCP. Miguel Ferrer as the smarmy young exec Bob Morton, who tries to knock Jones off his perch. Lastly, and undoubtably most memorable, is Kurtwood Smith as the ultra-violent gang leader Clarence Boddicker.  Among the most sadistic villains in film history, Clarence Boddicker is two parts creepy and three parts bada$$; a supervillain beyond compare to most others portrayed in movies. Kurtwood Smith, now known to the younger two generations as Red Foreman in the wonderfully funny series \\"That '70's Show,\\" plays Clarence Boddicker so well--vulgar language & all--that it's absolutely shocking to revisit him in this role after having gotten to know him over the past five years as a TV dad, even one as gruff as his Red Foreman.<br />I decline to summarize the plot of ROBOCOP, since so many reviewers have already done so.  Besides, most of you reading this have most likely already seen it at least once. Let's face it, ROBOCOP ushered in a new era for film; afterwards we got other Verhoeven mega-hits such as TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS.  Other filmmakers inevitably tried to copy him, such as Robert Longo with the mega-bomb JOHNNY MNEMONIC (which should be retitled JOHNNY MORONIC); the fact is, nobody can do futuristic sci-fi like Paul Verhoeven.  Of course, let's not forget that Verhoeven himself was probably influenced to some extent by James Cameron, who had set the original cyborg gold standard with his 1984 classic THE TERMINATOR. However, ROBOCOP is unique--its dark humor and cynicism sets it completely apart in style from THE TERMINATOR. (Both are great films, and any comparisons between the two are tantamount to comparing apples with oranges.)<br />I give this DVD four stars because it only contains the film and original theatrical trailer, plus ads for the remastered DVD versions of three films, including CARRIE.  That's it.  In order to get the extras the this film demands, I will need to purchase the Critierion Collection DVD, which has extensive commentary by Verhoeven and a few others, plus storyboards, a \\"making-of\\" video, etc. But for now, this plain-jane DVD will have to do. Too bad, because ROBOCOP is anything but plain-jane.  Even by today's standards, it kicks major you-know-what!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000092ZYX|5.0|I just bought this album today and have listened to it two times through. I was blown away. I know critics will say that Radiohead could do anything and people would eat it up, but that's because almost everything they do is pure gold! Hail to the Thief is a haunting, sometimes disturbing, dark album that has deep songs as well as some catchy ones. Highlights inclde 2+2=5 (best track on the album), Where I End and You Begin, and Myxomatosis. I definitely recommend it.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me at the work this man can do.  I have never been unhappy with one of his scores, and this one is no exception.  As the first soundtrack I have immediately wanted to buy right out of the theater since Gladiator, this has already made its way to the top of my list, followed by the above Gladiator.  Music as well done and as emotional as this proves why Zimmer is my all time favorite composer and why he most assuredly deserves a best score and best composer Academy nod for this.<br />A Must Get for any Zimmer Fan!
0783117523|5.0|I saw this movie about 10 years ago on HBO, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. This is definetly one of the best movies I have ever seen, i highly recommend it. Don't go another week without seeing this.
B00009TB5G|5.0|True Jackson did alter parts of the story. But either way, he did make a GREAT movie. If anything I think the changes, (i.e. Faramir's character, as well as the Ents, make much more drama in the movie). Remember, not everyone that saw these movies had read the books, we are talking about most of the globe....
B00006F2TV|5.0|Honestly, I didn't expect to like this film.  I'm from the original Spider-Man generation.  My roommate in college was a comic geek, and I was inundated  by the life and times of...  Spidey wasn't my favorite (I was more a Dr. Strange type), but he was a regular visitor.  As such, I have an entire set of preconceptions about what he would sound like and how he would act.<br />So my first reaction when Tobey Maquire showed up on the screen was that this was going to be a very tiresome film.  While I changed my mind about the film as it went on, I'm still not happy with Maguire's presentation.  It feels overplayed to me, and stiffer than even Peter Parker's early shyness would justify.  Its not so much bad acting as it is that this Spider-Man doesn't match up to the voice in my head when I was reading the comics.<br />In contrast, most of the other characters are dead on.  Especially the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons - who was perfect).  At some point, though, the quality of the film overwhelms any quibbles about an individual acting flaw, and the viewer simply forgets that this modern Spidey isn't a perfect reflection of the past.  It captures the spirit, and some of the wow factor of becoming and being a superhero while maintaining a near-perfect, comic book atmosphere.<br />Spidey has always been one of the most human and accessible of the pulp do-gooders.  He has problems, makes mistakes, and learns as he goes along.  The film emphasizes this in a way that gives Peter Parker and his alter ego a vivid reality the Batman or Superman never quite achieved in their own films.  Maguire captures this struggle well, even if he isn't my perfect Spider-Man.<br />This two DVD package has enough extra stuff to keep you busy for a day or two.  Lots of history, outtakes, and interviews at an attractive price.  I was very pleased with it, and I'm sure you will be too.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|For some reason I have the feeling that the tracks of the trilogy's soundtrack will be known for a long time to come. Just as John Williams is still known for his Star Wars music, Howard Shore will most likely be known for the LOTR soundtrack. I think that this will be the epic motion picture music of our generation (those born early 80s)
0060005424|4.0|Older readers may be put off by the marketing which puts this fine book in the young adult market, but they shouldn't be. It's strongly written and compelling by any standards and is no more of a children's book than Lord of the Rings.<br />I didn't find Lirael quite as strong as Sabriel, hence the four stars rather than five. But I'm still going to read the follow-up book as soon as I can.
B000000WCA|5.0|This album, is the Spice Girl's debut album, yes, the one that launched them off to MULTI-MULTI-MULTI-MULTI PLATINUM status!  <BR>  This album was released February 4, 1997 in the U.S., but released a bit before in the U.K.  This album consides of 5 out 10 #1 hit singles.  Thats a lot, hardly any singer/band/group has ever accomplished having half of their debut album's singles<BR>go to #1, or have all their singles released hit #1....we'll....the Spice Girls did just that, and become a great<BR>role model to everyone by simply not caring and to teach all to be proud and be who you are, and forget about what the public and others think of you.  So, it would only be right for me to give you a review on all their singles released!  Right?!<br />1) Wannabe: Summer 1996.  The one that started it all!  <BR>            Excellent song!<BR>2) Say You'll Be There: Fall 1996.  A great hit.<BR>3) 2 Become 1: The Spice Girl's 1st Christmas hit!  Excellent<BR>               Love song!<BR>4) Mama/Who Do You Think You Are: Released at the same time for<BR>                                  Charity.  Great songs.<BR>                                  Mama= great love/thank you<BR>                                  track to MOMS!!!! ;-)<BR>                                  Who Do You Think You Are=<BR>                                  GREAT DANCE TRACK!<br />    All in all, this is a great album.  One of my top 5 favorites ever, so far.  I only wish music would be like it was in in the 90's, 2000, and 2001.  Music, now, has gone sour....EXTREMELY SOUR, and any album with great taste like it was in the years I mention, only go gold or platinum once.  :-(<BR>But, It will return again....and so will the Spice Girls with Ginger!!!!<br />My love to all upset fans and music lovers w/ taste<br />-&quot;Billy Billz&quot; the Pisces
B00005MM01|5.0|Been listening to this set since its inception, and remain a proponent that this is a unique work, perhaps the most representive embodiment of the &quot;flower child&quot; sentimentality, which has been regarded as passe. Not so. Don't know of any other that relieves stress, and evokes Nature (and its many metaphors to the ocean) with such effectiveness, especially the acoustic sets of the &quot;For Little Ones&quot; tracks. Excellent CD!
B000000WFF|5.0|This is the Spice Girls second album, that was released November 4, 1997.  Selling more that 10 million albums, this is another great album.<BR>   When I got &quot;Spice&quot;, their debut, I thought it was a great album and had to have been my favorite....ever!  For your information, &quot;Spice&quot; sold a whoping 22 million copies!  <BR>    &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, is better in my opinion!  Like &quot;Spice&quot;, it contains 10 songs.  Half of the songs on both albums hit #1.  This album is also classified as a soundtrack, to their huge worldwide blockbuster, &quot;Spiceworld&quot;.  This album has a lot of flavor, from great #1 ballads like &quot;Viva Forever&quot; and their 2nd Christmas hit &quot;Too Much&quot;, to their #1 3-D hit, &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and the #1 hit for Pepsi, &quot;Move Over&quot;, this album is definately something for everyone.  Anyone, but punk rockers will enjoy this album.  It has something for everyone.  <BR>     The Spice Girls fought off their critics by not caring, and that is what made them....THEMSELVES!  The hits on this album consist of five #1 chart toppers, including the U.K.'s Pepsi song and their 2nd Christmas hit!  A review for their five #1 hits is below.<br />1) Spice Up Your Life: Fall 1997.  Them for their hit movie,<BR>                       &quot;Spiceworld&quot;<BR>2) Too Much: Winter 1997.  Their 2nd Christmas hit.<BR>3) Move Over: Released Winter 1997 into 1998.  The U.K.'s million<BR>              dollar Pepsi song.<BR>4) Stop: Spring 1998.  Only single that didn't hit #1 in it's<BR>         first week, but went to #1 the second week!<BR>5) Viva Forever: This song, in a way, was dedicated to Ginger<BR>                 Spice, Geri Halliwell, after her departure.<BR>                 She, went on as a solo artist and continued<BR>                 to do great!<br />    All in all, this is a great album and I would advise anyone who does not own it, to go out and buy it immediately!<br />-Pisces
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie shows the relationship of the soldiers from BT to the last part POINTS, Winters summarizes it at the end perfectly, from all the battles they have fought, D-Day taking out that gun, taking Carentan, Market Garden even though that failed, To Bastogne, that image stays in my mind, how they got through that, every time I go in the woods when it snows I get reminded of Bastonge, this movie really changes you yourself as you watch it, you get a different picture about the war and what these soldiers went through, it touched my life, all history buffs should watch this movie, best war movie ever.
0385508417|5.0|This is the cutest book. I am getting a copy for everyone! It is so entertaining and a quick, enjoyable read.
0060922583|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I did not even mind the slightly warped logic that Talbot's theory is based on, and which goes something like this: paranormal event X could be explained IF (and only IF) the universe is a holographic one.  The weird thing now is that he presents material as if he was drawing conclusions from the evidence - e.g. he claims that things (like pieces of glass/ashes) could materialize out of thin air -and at times used to.<br />This brings someone with a sceptical mind (which shouldn't be illegal) to ask himself a serious question: what if there is neither a holographic universe NOR a paranormal event (those pieces of glass, for example, being the evidence)? What then? A more objective approach would be to draw the conclusion from the evidence, not build the evidence around a foreordained conclusion (or the other way around? I'm confused...).<br />But he presents \\"evidence\\" not only in form of annecdotial reports which can be impossbily verified by the reader (did glass materialize?), but also beefs things up with personal experiences that must be taken at face-value. The stories become more and more unbelievable (to the sceptic mind) towards the end of the book. Regardless of the fact that in order to believe in any of this one would have to make up ones mind in what to believe first (holographic universe vs. the specific paranormal events described in this book), this work is a tantalizing read that has caused me to get interested in quantum mechanics, which would have been a laughable idea two months ago....And: I especially agree with the author as he states that the \\"Big Bang\\"-theory and theory of relativity by Einstein have never been verified (this being impossible) but are nevertheless accepted to be facts or truths by the scientific community, leave alone the public. Therefore, it should be possible to think in all sorts of directions as one pleases, without being discriminated against by anyone for not delivering the ultimate proof.And certain things certainly should be subjected to more research. I just don't believe in glass materializing, as I know I mentioned before.
B000005RMY|5.0|One word best describes this early material: Raw.  If you have only heard the polished club songs on Floodland, then be warned! Some Girls Wander might be quite a surprise (like if you have Never seen a certain someone without their makeup on, and then one day...)<br />But SoM is beautiful underneath their studio production, in their unique way, of course; Some Girls Wander shows off this natural beauty...the minimalism is wherein the beauty lies.<br />I remember La Nausee [amazing club that was in Montreal] playing at least one song from Floodland pretty much every night in 1991, but even as black and foggy as that club was, they rarely played the songs now found on Some Girls Wander.  Why?  Well, most of these songs just aren't...clubby.<br />But So What!  Most of the goth kids I knew in the States were too young to get into the cool clubs, which were (and probably still are) few and far between to begin with -- so the poor devils would console themselves by listening to these Sisters songs on scratchy vinyl in the wee hours of the night.<br />THIS IS THE REAL STUFF; these songs were some of the seeds of the Goth movement, and while ya can't dance to many of them, they immortalized Goth -- so give 'em credit where it's due.
630326669X|2.0|At the time this film was made, Godard's reputation was as a great avant-garde artist while the Stones were mere pop singers.  Thirty-odd years on, the roles are reversed.  It can be seen that the Stones created something lasting while Godard's contributions to this movie are cinematically amateurish and politically primitive.  Unfortunately Godard wasn't enough of an artist to appreciate the material he had, and so he keeps cutting away from the Stones to add various undergraduate-level film tricks.  The net result is increased appreciation for the professionalism and discipline of the boys -- well, of Jagger, Richards, Wyman and Watts (Brian Jones is a silent, stoned presence playing inaudible rhythm guitar) -- because it contrasts so strongly with the lack of professionalism and discipline in the film itself.
B000002KGT|5.0|Just buy it--all that needs to be said.
B000022TSH|4.0|Chinatown is a great story that moves along at a fairy good pace but does stall in parts. The real reason for seeing this film is Polanskis masterpiece direction of noir 30s LA and Jack Nicholsons wise-ass and wonderfully mouthy P.I.<br />The story is pretty complexed and you will have to stay awake for a lot of it or else it will pass you by because there are lots of plot twists and turns. I had to go back a few scenes now and again to figure out what was going on. Overall it is great entertainment and the dialogue is pretty snappy and on que. You will like and although I would love to give this film full marks it is prolonged in parts and these scenes do break the momentum of the movie.<br />Good stuff all the same..
0151008116|1.0|I had problems getting into this book from the very start.  I thought that the author jumped around so much that he could not complete a thought at all.  He averaged a new chapter every three pages which really broke up the flow of the book.  The only reason that I finished this book is because I am in a book club and we are going to discuss it.
B00005JMFO|3.0|I just saw this film in the cinema and yeah it is one of those films that everybody who is in the festive spirits will enjoy at the time but that is all really. It is nothing memorable, just sort of a 2 hour xmas time filler to get ya in the mood.<br />The premise is simple. Various persons each have a crisis love situation around xmas time and then eventually it tries to all come together. There is a lot of diversity in the various stories and it is very moochy, kissy, awww---shucks, kind of stuff. So take your girl to see it and I am sure she will be happy for the next few hours after it, but the film does lash on a bit with the whole emotion of love sort of premise that it is born out from.<br />The scenes with the aging old rocker are worth the admission fee alone. Just do not go in expecting a grade A comedy and you will enjoy your two hours.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Even though I have been a music fan for 40 yrs, and a collector of concert DVD's--I have never been moved to write a review,until now.  Even though I own what I believe to be some of the top concert videos of all time (Eagles-Hell Freezes Over, Bonnie Raitt-Road Tested, Fleetwood Mac-The Dance, Dan Fogleberg-Live, Eric Clapton-Live in Hyde Park, etc.)--the Concert for George clearly tops them.  It is magical to see Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney singing together on &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;While my Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; with Ringo Starr playing the drums and George's son Dhani on stage--not to mention Clapton's outstanding guitar solo on the latter.  You can feel the love and passion on stage in all the performances.  Don't overlook the jaw-dropping performance of Ravi Shankar's daughter on sitar in the opening number and the great performance of Sam Brown singing the last song George wrote &quot;Lead a Horse to Water&quot;--where has England been hiding her??  (It is a crime that this song was cut from the CD version). The theatrical version of the DVD is interesting with its interspersed interviews but the full concert video is the gold standard.  If you can keep a dry eye during the last 30 minutes of the full concert video then you need to have someone take your pulse!  Again, pure magic and a great Xmas gift to a friend who is a musicphile!
B000002BQK|5.0|Before Mariah relesed this album, she was considered a balladeer who occasionnaly did some up-tempo songs.  She'd delved into R'n B before (&quot;Fantasy&quot;), but never on the great scale she did here.  &quot;Honey&quot;, the first single from the album, was an example of this shift. The material here was more sensual and heavy than we'd seen before. The ballads, especially &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;My All&quot;, were just as good as the ones that she'd sang before.  Other tracks such as &quot;Fourth of July&quot; and &quot;Outside&quot; were similar to previous material.  However, songs such as &quot;The Roof&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; were totally new and different. Unfortunately, this album's sales were only half as much as those of &quot;Daydream&quot;. This album also featured more collaborations (a sign of things to come), on songs such as &quot;Breakdown&quot; and Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;.  The album's R 'n B feel may have turned many off to Mariah, but I suggest they go back and take a look at this album.  It took me five years to like &quot;Honey&quot;, but I consider this album to be as good as &quot;Music Box&quot; or &quot;Daydream&quot;. It's not as mainstream as the previous two, but it's worth the buy for the artistic statement displayed here.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie, or at least in my top 5 favorites. It's such a great heartwarming and fun film. The scenery is quite beautiful, the acting is fantastic, and Johnny Depp is just hot. It's quite a feel-good movie that will have you smiling at the end. Some say it's predictable, but I can name about 50,000 other movies that are WAY more predictable than this one(say, all Julia Roberts films). Great great film, Juliet Binoche is excellent as is Depp and Judi Dench.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I've been waiting for I don't know how long for her sophomore album! It's worth the wait. Every song shines on here. I can't distinguish which album is better, they both are strong. This is what real music lovers are looking for. It's not pop yall, this is R&B! You can tell that she put effort into her songs on here. She has a talent for writing and she can play the piano. I'm pleased that she kept her piano playin' on the songs. It's something unique that many others can't do. Her first single takes me back to the good ol' days of real singing and not so many add-libs and doubles to accent her voice. Here are the songs:<br />1. Harlem's Nocturne-The intro! It's starts off with a piano playin' then here comes Alicia. She welcome's you back to her world.<br />2. Karma-A powerful song that speaks yall! When I first heard this song, I had to repeat it over again.<br />3. Heartburn-OOOOOH! Damn! Well, you know I love this song. She goes to the doctor and tells her to \\"count to 5 Alicia\\".<br />4. If I Was Your Woman (Walk On By)-Addictive! The hot @$$ songs just don't stop.<br />5. You Don't Know My Name-Everyone knows this song. An old school song that makes me happy that Alicia has come back in a big way. I love the part when she calls Michael on the phone. Many artists wouldn't do that! Superb!<br />6. If I Ain't Got You-\\"Some people want it all, but I don't want nothin' at all\\". She isn't greedy and stuck up. She has no need for material possessions. She just wants your love. That's the way it should be.<br />7. Diary-She is just great. Toni Tony Tone is on here. He comes in at the end but still. She \\"won't tell your secrets.\\"<br />8. Dragon Days-This song has a hidden pun. The days \\"drag on\\". It feels like the day will never end.<br />9. Wake Up-I love this song. She tells you that we need to wakw up.<br />10. So Simple-Alicia makes these singing sound so simple. She is just WOW!<br />11. When You Really Love Someone-This reminds me of Songs In A Minor.<br />12. Feeling You, Feeling Me-A nice interlude before getting to the end.<br />13. Slow Down-Great Song<br />14. Samsonite Man-Pack your stuff and leave<br />15. Nobody Not Really-The outro basically, could have a been a full length track!<br />I hope she makes at least 6 of these songs singles because they are all worthy of it and deserve to be played all around the world.
B00000ADG2|5.0|\\"Miseducation...\\" shows artists of R&B - Soul/Hip-Hop what a real album is. Undeniably 1998's Grammy winner Album of The Year. (Back when the Grammys recognised GOOD music - unlike the nominies of 2003-4.)
B00006ZCFH|5.0|What do you expect? It's an EP. It's not supposed to be mind-blowing like her last 3 (Yeah, THREE) cds! It's a great cd to listen to. I wouldn't have kept this cd if it wasn't worth it. Just think of it as she has taken a well deserved break and has given us something new to listen to without creating an LP. Aside from that, this is a great cd to listen to. When you include the two imported songs, Love of My Life(11) and Hollywood(12), it makes this an LP. So if you think this is too short, pay the extra 10 dollars and get an import. Others say a couple of the tracks are too long! Just skip them! She probably did that to keep the MP3 file hella long and to keep people from burning her EP, so stop bi***ing! Here's an overviw of her cd:<br />1. The World Keeps Turnin' (Intro)-A verse from On & On is what is being said along this 1min 30sec track.<br />2. Bump It-The first \\"extended song\\" on the cd. The first half is her singing and doing what she does best. The second part is the \\"instrumental\\" part that is great to listen to. At first, you might think \\"what the hell is this?\\" After a second listen, you'll be like \\"that's tight!\\"<br />3. Back In The Day (Puff)-\\"Back in the day when things were cool!\\" That is so true. With all the $h*t that has come up as being R&B it's scary at times. At the end, she is smoking a J sayin she hope the dog don't bark when she come home.<br />4. I Want You-Another \\"extended song\\". I loved this song when I first heard it. It has three parts: the first is the intro of her sayin \\"I want you\\", the second is the \\"song\\", and the third is a cool @$$ guitar solo. It may shock some of yall, but I wish the guitar solo was longer. Just when it's getting good, it fades into track 05.<br />5. Woo-This song has a fat beat. It's too short though. It shoulda been longer and they should have taken out track 06. I like the flute in the middle. If you pay attention, a verse in this song is from her song \\"Sometimes\\" on Baduizm.<br />6. The Grind-Way too short. I think of it as an interlude and that's what saves this cd all 5 stars.<br />7. Danger-I love it! I'm pleased this is a single. It's upbeat, loud, and very hard to understand. I like that. That part at the beginning from Other Side Of The Game is perfect for this song 'cuz it plays the hook.<br />8. Think Twice-Right when track 07 ends here comes my favorite song. It has an old school beat with a hot sax. \\"Your love is like fire and ice!\\"<br />9. Love of My Life Worldwide-An excellent remix. Set to \\"Funk You Up\\" beat, which she says in one of her verses. I like this better than the regular. This has more flavor and better lyrics. I'm not a fan of Common so that might be my problem, I don't know. I like Queen Latifah and Angie Stone's rap on here.<br />10. The World Keeps Turnin' (Outro)-Basically the intro repeated. Has a long @$$ silence in the middle.<br />11. Love of My Life-IMPORT ONLY! This is the unremixed version. It's sounds great but the remix is better. Off the Brown Sugar soundtrack<br />12. Hollywood-IMPORT ONLY! This song is so great. Her vocal talent really shines on this song. The beat is perfect. I don't know why this wasn't included on the US Retail. It is off of the Bamboozled Soundtrack though.<br />This is a must have for a devoted E. Badu fan. It's not as expensive as an LP, so that's compensation. It's a fun, loose album and still worthy of praise.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie rocks.  I have seen it almost 10 times and it has never gotten boring.  It is so funny!  It is great for kids and adults.  My parents even liked it!
0156027321|2.0|Maybe I am thick, but this book certainly did not make me believe in God.  Nor did it engage me enough to take another read to try and figure it out.  For me, if a book needs a lot of figuring out, it better be a good read.  I liked the way that the author slowly layered information about the adult Pi with the young Pi's history.  Once he was adrift, tho, I was lulled by the rocking of the lifeboat and searched for a story that was either there or not.  When I was done, I just didn't care anymore.<br />All said, I must applaud the copy on the jacket which got me to pick up the book.  That was as compelling it got.
B00006B1HH|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The songs are so fun to sing a long to.  There is not even ONE boring part in Grease.  The Beauty School Drop Out part is kind of weird though HeHe.  I would really recommend this movie to any one is likes musicals or likes Oliva Newton-John and John Trovolta (sp).
B00008OLYN|4.0|This is a good album, but you should know that it contains zero death metal! Yes, it may seem shallow to not buy an album because it isn't death metal, but I'm sure some people would rather buy one of their metal albums if they knew in advance. This is a very mellow album and is entirely acoustic (except for a few notes here or there).<br />If you are looking for something heavy, then for God's sake get another Opeth album. If you're open minded and want to hear whatever they put out then this album is for you.<br />Like I said: Good album, but no metal.
B000000JO3|3.0|I own this cd cause a friend told me they were just amazing...I disagree.  I listened to it for awhile, tried to let it grow on me, but it just doesnt work...I'm not sure why.  Neither does Fugazi for that matter.<BR>Everyone I know who likes Straight-Edge or Hardcore worships this band except for me...and then they get offended when I let them know this, but it is my opinion that these guys (and Fugazi) are over-rated.  Download some before you buy it anyway, to make sure you're not wasting money as I did...<br />(To Fred Durst's Numba One Fan - You're my fooking hero dude.  I was falling out of my chair laughing as I read your reviews...my face is sore now:)
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is excellent, the quadrilogy set is much better than the legacy set was,it has much better picture quality.
B00008NRL8|5.0|I had heard Gotan Project previously sampled on NPR and I thought it might be an interesting cd to purchase, but I never thought it would be this good! I love it. I really like ambient and low-key music right now, and this really fits my mood. It is not so upbeat that it makes you nervous and overly excited, but it is great to just chill out to, and is also great background music because tango is inherantly sexy. Each song on this cd has its own taste and flare, and honestly I don't think I can even pull a favorite from this album because they are all favorites! The bonus disc has the video for Santa Maria, which is really cool and sexy! This album is a must have for any music listener!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|i just want to say, the diary of alicia keys is off the hook. i recommend it 100%. the song &quot;diary&quot; featuring tony toni tone is one of the best songs along with the rest of course. it was vocally presented so well. also, the remake of &quot;walk on by&quot; is a great song. i also love the track &quot;if i aint got you&quot; its hot. the whole album is bananas, everyone should go get it!
B00005JMFO|5.0|A nicely constructed combination of love stories and an appealing selection and use of music as in the director's previous works. The different story tracks are easy to follow and and although somewhat predictable, they each do present their own surprises. <BR>Yes, as in almost every film, there are a few moments that may disturb some, but, most importantly, recalling my impressions makes me feel pleasant and isn't that what a night-at-the-movies is all about.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This concert will make you sing and feel memories. What a great gathering of musicians brought together to honor George Harrison. The musicians putting on this concert and the songs of George Harrison are a tribute to what is great in life.<BR>OK, its a great concert. One of the best you will ever see!!! The vibes of the concert are what remembrance, joy and fun are all about. Cheers!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|its clear that half the people who have rated this album HAVE NOT listened to it entirely. I was surprised by the vocals she bursts out on this disk. Pretty impressive. Maturity proves the right path for Britney musically. Way to go. For all these 1 star reviewers... you can go to MTV.com and waste your time with all the other p-pul who hate Britney, but yet spend so much of their time talking about her. It's really sad. Anyway, this cd is actually really good. Impressive for Britney.
B00008ADPF|5.0|NICKELBACK IS A COOL BAND. THE LONG ROAD IS A GOOD FOLLOW-UP DISC TO SILVER SIDE UP.
0140177396|2.0|I have just finished reading Of Mice and Men for my 10th grade Honors English class.  Set during the Depression, Of Mice and Men spans four days and follows the lives of George and Lennie.  Lennie is mentally retarded, acts like a child, and is innocent.  At the same time, he doesn't know his own strength.  He likes to pet mice, but ends up killing them by accident.  George travels with Lennie, has always looked out for him, and protects him whenever he gets into trouble.  They both share a dream that many people held during the Depression: owning their own farm, and knowing what tomorrow will hold.<br />What is so depressing is the way that the weak are treated in this story.  Every man is for himself, and no one cares about anyone else, especially the weak.  For instance, Candy's dog was shot because it was old and it stank, even though it was very special to Candy.  After the only thing he had was shot, Candy began to think this might happen to him when he gets too old to work, so he took up George and Lennie's dream of owning a farm.<br />This book is very sad because dreams are presented as foolish fantasies that will never happen.  George, Lennie, and Candy never do get to have the farm and the rabbits they wanted.  Curley's wife, evil and selfish as she is, tempted Lennie into doing yet another bad thing.  This lead to Lennie having to escape and being chased down in the end.  Lennie thought George was his friend and trusted him so much, but George kills him at the end of the novel and walks off with Slim.  Lennie is so nice.  He shouldn't have been killed.  In this novel, the weak are seen as a nuisance to society who must be exterminated.  Of Mice and Men hints that the only was to survive is to be mean and ruthless.  The weak should not be looked upon this way.  We should try to help them, not get rid of them.  Everyone already has enough troubles in his or her life.  Why read such a depressing book?
B00005AQE8|4.0|I'm actually editing my review, first edit. A week ago I got this CD and I wrote a 2-star review saying that the CD was bad because of its simple beats (that's why I haven't gotten helpful votes). So, during this week, I started to listen to every song in this CD again, checking the lyrics and... now, I really like it. I don't know how it happened, but I do change a lot in opinions, and this CD is now awesome for me. I ain't editing this review to win helpful votes, but because I now like it and I think people who didn't like this CD in the first listening could like it after listening to it more. Now I totally agree with the 5-star reviews out there: this is one of the best rap CDs ever, 2Pac is awesome, really.<BR>There are lots of great songs like \\"Holla At Me\\", \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\", \\"Life Goes On\\", \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug\\", just to name a few. Since this CD has 2 discs, you'll have fun for a lot of time. <BR>2Pac is one of the greatest rappers ever, if not the best. Is he alive? Well, there are some things in this CD that might make you wonder if he really is, but, anyways, you should listen All Eyez On Me. Physically dead or not, he'll always remain alive in our hearts, pens and papers.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Forget the image of the band.  If you just listen to the music you can instantly see why this band is loved so much.  It is true what they say: &quot;This is exactly what rock needed.&quot;<br />In a time when rap-rock is becoming popular, when so-called &quot;rock bands&quot; offer nothing but ballads, pop-punk bands only write silly love songs, and a dj is now an official member of the band...  The Strokes DO come to the rescue.<br />It is a good idea to MAKE it cool to not have a dj, and to not write ballads.<br />For the reviews putting down the drumming on this album: The drumming is to add to the sound, not to show off.  Although the White Stripes are held in such high regard with their very very SIMPLE drumming.  AC/DC never had a drum fill either btw.  It is nice that in this album he actually bought a cymbal.<br />The low-fi vocals bring back a sound of the 60's.  It definitely adds to the music.<br />Just to clear up some misconceptions...<br />Listen to this album and feel what rock should be like.  I don't think I'm alone in feeling that a change was needed.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|...<br />In conjunction with true music afficianados and connaisseurs worldwide, we have developed this test in the event the casual   music-listening public at-large attempts to submit fraudulently favorable reviews on over-rated, over-hyped, undertalented \\"musicans\\" -- and I use that term loosely -- in an effort to further their cause, waste your hard-earned money, and throw more garbage into the wasteland that is today's music charts!<br />Had this been an actual emergency, the legitimate, keeping-it-real review you're about to read would have been followed by recommendations for CD's that feature true artists with true talents.<br />That said, I must admit I fell for the 'You Don't Know My Name' video hook, line, and sinker.  She sucker-punched me on that one, had me thinking she actually had promise and potential.  What was I thinking?<br />As a measure of self-preservation, I protected myself and didn't even buy the CD; instead, I listened/previewed it on a listening station at a local music store the same day it came out.  To make a long story short, as quickly as I put the headphones on I took them off again.  And now that I really think about it, it was the old-skool feel of 'You Don't Know My Name'-- not her singing -- that had so attracted me to that song initially.<br />Clearly she hasn't trained her \\"instrument\\" enough and as a result her vocal quality struggles throughout the music on this CD, oftentimes cracking and just sounding in general as if she had laryngitis when she recorded it.  It is sub-standard at best.  Her talents on the piano are nothing that you couldn't find among any typical student at any typical performing arts high school throughout mainstream America.<br />You don't have to take my word for it, just look at the reviews that have been submitted and witness how they jump from one extreme to the other.  True artists don't have this problem because EVERYONE EVERYWHERE unanimously agrees on the quality of music they output.  If everyone would just keep it real instead of jumping on popularity bandwagaons, you'd get a much clearer sense of just how less-than-average Alicia Keys is.  How is someone supposed to make an informed decision on whether to purchase this CD when so many people insist on keeping it so NOT real!?...
0393307050|3.0|Having read An Eye of the Fleet and Mr Midshipman Hornblower, I was looking forward to the start of the O'Brian series.  I started to read this book and struggled to get through the 1st 3-4 chapters.  The 1st reason for my problem was that the nautical terms and discriptions of the ship were very difficult.  There is no list of terms in this book which would be very helpful.  My second problem with the beginning of this book was there is no action until you get to around chapter 5.  I almost gave up finishing the book during the 1st 3-4 chapters about 4 to 5 times.  After getting through this tough time, the story starts to improve and is pretty good.  I found this book tough to read.  I would not recommend this book to younger kids.  For younger readers (and older ones too), I would sugest Mr Midshipman Hornblower or An Eye of the Fleet.  I do not plan to continue this series any time soon.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|My 5 year old niece wanted this, so I bought it for her. She doesn't even like it, prefering to listen to Oops! I Did It Again. This garbage is so generic, to be laughable. Britney's vocals (never her strong suit) are poorer than ever. I did like her first two cd's, but the last two are plain bad-this one worse then the last. And Britney needs to get over trying to become some kind of party animal in her lyrics. These lyrics, as well as her interviews, just make her seem sad and shallow.
0312243022|5.0|&quot;The Hours : A Novel&quot; is truly a mesmerizing and emotional story.  The movie does not do it justice, and I enjoyed the movie.  The characters are intriguing and I just wanted to sit down and talk with each one of them and perhaps live a day within their life.  This literary work is a true page turner and is full of depth.  A fantastic read - I recommend!
B000002J09|5.0|Although it is heavily overplayed, &quot;IV&quot; is possibly Led Zeppelin?s finest effort.  It is a near perfect straight-through listen, and the playing is excellent from all the members of the band.  Robert Plant has never sung better, John Paul Jones displays his multi-talents in full swing, Jimmy Page has rarely played his guitar as well, and John Bonham has never sounded so *loud*.  But there is a difference between playing great and playing great songs.  Fortunately, Led Zeppelin does both with conviction, confidence, and authority.  ?Black Dog?, ?Rock and Roll? and ?Misty Mountain Hop? showcase the band?s signature raunchy sound, ?The Battle of Evermore? is a prime example of their mastery of English folk, and ?Going to California? is a showcase for Page?s excellent guitar playing and Plant?s fantastic voice.  ?When The Levee Breaks? is probably the heaviest thing they had recorded to date.  But the highlight of the album is the marvelous ?Stairway to Heaven?.  Its unforgettable chord progression, perfect production, and masterful build-up make it an amazing listen.  No wonder it is their most well-known song.  Indeed, ?IV? is probably their most well-known album.  It may be overplayed, but only because it?s so great.<BR>~ John Ballantyne
B000002J0B|5.0|I am a huge fan of Led Zeppelin and HOTH just barely beats out Physical Graphitti as my favorite led zeppelin.  Every song on here is as good as the next and it is next to impossible to pick favorite songs.  This CD has the big hits such as &quot;Over the hills and far away&quot; and &quot;No Quarter&quot; which are two fantastic songs, but it also has the great hits of Dancing Days, The Song remains the same, and the ocean.  Just an overall knock out cd that will forever be in my CD player.
0060254920|5.0|I couldn't believe it when I learned I was married to a man who never heard of jungle book, robin hood, Hansel and Gretel or any other type of children's book. I immediately registered my complaint with his mother who told me, \\"He couldn't sit still to listen to a book -ever.\\" But then my husband told me of his favorite book \\"where the wild things are\\" a book I didn't know existed. We found a copy of the book and enjoyed it for years before our children were born. This book is a favorite of our children and mine and still remains 'Daddy's favorite book.'
B00004TH6O|5.0|Having bought Songs for the deaf and loving it, i bought this on a whim not knowing what to expect.  Well i was pleasently surprised at how amazing it was. I thought it blew SFTD out of the water.  From the humorous &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; to the haunting &quot;Better Living Though Chemistry&quot;(My favorite Queens song ever) to the anger filled &quot;Tension Head&quot; (apparently a slam song against Ozzfest), every song is fantastic.  Mark Lanegan appears on some songs , and &quot;In the Fade&quot; is another amazing song, having Lanegan sing.  Overall it is just a top notch album, and if you like Queens of the Stone Age, especially the guitar and bass playing, i suggest you go check out Kyuss.
0670451495|4.0|This is a nice tale of a family of ducks finding their place in the world. We have the hard back version and the \\"book on tape\\" and both of my children like it. Nice to pair with The Trumpet of the Swan as part of this book is also set in Boston.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I thought this album was fantastic.  To start off i don't remeber the last time i payed for a double cd with 30 songs in total for under 23$ Canadian new.  But back to the CD, this is full of great song after great song.  Some of the highlights for me include Sad, Don't gimme no lip,Hold On, Fatal and Otherside, but i like all the other tracks almost equally.  When i first heard of a b sides and rareities album, i thought i would have heard most of the songs before, but i had only actually heard 5 (yellow ledbetter, footsteps, dirty frank, otherside, and last kiss), and i think only 8 of them have actually been released(but don't quote me on that).  Overall this is an amazing album and any pearl jam fan will want to pick it up.
0920668372|5.0|In the excitement of expecting our first child my husband and I bought this book. The first time we read it we were nearly in tears.<br />In the story the mother has a new baby and sings to him a beautiful song about her love. Then as the child grows during the day he gets into typical mischief in accordance with his age - 2 years old, young boy, teenager. Still, at night while he is sleeping she sings her lovely song.<br />The boy grows like all boys do and moves away. Still the mother loves him (in the book this is demonstrated by her continuing to sing to him at night) - apparently some reviews don't know the meaning of the word \\"metaphor\\". Nonetheless the mother's love is with her son wherever he goes.<br />As time passes the mother grows old and her son demonstrates his love with his version of the same song. <br />The last part of the book is even more touching as it demonstrates how the mother's love of her son is then passed down from him to the next generation.<br />I sing all the verses in this book when I read it to my children. They seem to like this book most between the ages of 2 and 4.  However adults and even teenagers have told me \\"the way you read that makes me want to cry.\\" I assure you it is not my voicing of the words, but the words themselves that are full of emotion.<br />When I give this book to a parent I advise them to \\"sing\\" the parts written as song. I've yet to meet anyone who didn't love this book.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I saw APC at lollapalooza before 13th Step was released.  They played The Outsider, Pet, The Package, and Weak and Powerless.  I was blown away when i heard those songs and couldn't wait to get the album and hear the rest.  I was not dissapointed at all, every song is a winner on here, and i especially like the songs named above(minus W &amp; P because i have heard it too much), and the noose, and blue.  Maynard never dissapoints me and i can't wait until the next APC/Tool/Maynard related CD.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|After seeing the first three installments of the 'Scary Movie' series, I would have to say this is my favorite. The acting was good, not great... but hey, they're all young kids. One of my favorite characters, Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri), I though was hesterically funny. Some of the jokes I though were a little stupid, but most had me laughing on the floor. If you want a good laugh then go out and buy it!
B000021XR5|5.0|This is a fantastic STP album and a must have for any die hard fan.  Its annoying that fans think that STP \\"lost it\\" after purple, but if they had kept putting out CD's like Core and Purple, they would be criticized for putting out the same kind of album over and over again.  I find that as soon as a band puts out 2 albums, people don't like any after that usually because its either the same repetative drivel or its not the same ol band (but of course this isn't the case for all bands).  But back to the CD, this is one of my fave STP's with songs like Atlanta, Sex and Violence, and Down, it is an overall amazing CD with not one bad.  Say what you want about STP, but they are a band who tried to take their music in different directions and realizing that their wasn't much more that they could do, they broke up (unfortunatly).  STP will live on forever, that is until the day the Scott Weiland kills himself with drugs.
B00005JLYW|3.0|Like many other sequels, it was good, but just not quite as entertaining as the first. Jam packed with cameos... the second installment brings you loads of action. I didn't think the story line was that great, just ok... and some of the jokes I though to be cheesy, some hesterically funny. The acting was good, and it was a great come-back role for Demi Moore. I say, if you liked the first, go out and buy it!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I'm not a fan of britney, but i do know when my ears are being vocally assaulted, and this CD does it. Even though britney is still the generic musician she was, this CD isn't as annoying as the others. So I'll rate all the songs i've heard (which is all of them, but 1).<br />1. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna) - 2/5. bad song, she sounds horrible, madonna doesn't help any. <BR>2. (I Got That) Boom Boom (featuring Ying Yang Twins) - I'm not sure who is dumber, Britney for singing this trash, or the Ying Yang Twins for rapping on it. Needless to say, the Ying Yang Twins do nothing to help this song, and the only reason why i'm not giving it a 0 is because the beat isn't bad - 1/5<BR>3. Showdown  - Maybe she wrote this in Jamaica. It sounds like a reggae song gone bad, and the lyrics is what makes this song suck. 1.5/5. <BR>4. Breathe On Me - This song is an example of britney being a tease. She claims to be innocent, yet writes this trash. Bad song, bad beat, even worse lyrics. 0/5<BR>5. Early Mornin'  -  It sounds like heavy breathing more than singing. Again, lyrics are horrible. Beat is decent, so it gets a 1.5/5.<BR>6. Toxic  - This song i really like. All you britney fans should be happy this replaced &quot;Boom Boom&quot; as her next single, because this is the only song people will really like. I'm not a fan of her singing, but the lyrics aren't as bad as the others, &amp; the beat is amazing. 4/5.<BR>7. Outrageous - Typical Britney.<BR>8. Touch of My Hand - We all know what this song is really about. 0/5.<BR>9. The Hook Up - I'm not impressed. 1/5.<BR>10. Shadow - Haven't heard it.<BR>11. Brave New Girl - Britney sounds so computerized, it's sick. 0/5.         <BR>12. Everytime - Slow. Shows off a little better vocal skills, but my ears still hurt afterwards. 2/5.<BR>13. Me Against the Music (RMX) - Decent remix to a bad song. 2/5.<br />Save your money, and buy Stripped. It's way better, and your ears will thank you.
B00005JM02|3.0|My husband took our 3 1/2 year old son to see this movie in the theater when it came out.  Our son actually made it almost all the way to the end of the  movie, but many other parents had to leave early with their kids, and my husband had to \\"talk down\\" our son a few times to calm him down.  This is not a mellow movie for young children.  True, there's no major violence, swear words or sex, but it's INTENSE.  The movie starts with Nemo's mother and siblings being eaten.  Then he gets captured and his father goes looking for him, encountering lots of danger along the way.  It's very emotionally scary for a young child.  My husband said lots and lots of young children were screaming and crying in the theater.  I later saw the movie on dvd and liked it personally.  It's well done, and funny.  That being said, if you have a preschooler, it might be better to wait on this one.
B000002MP2|5.0|This Cd is probably one of Green Day's finest albums besides Insomniac. It was one of the first Green Day albums i got and i loved it!!! If your a fan of Green Day you should seriously consider getting this album.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I absolutely adore this set of twelve episodes of Fawlty Towers! I'm a much younger fan and was given this as a present, so hats off to the cast for enticing younger viewers (innapropriate language aside)!. Basil Fawlty runs a hotel with his bossy wife, college student waitress, a waiter from Barcelona and a handful of other guests and acquantainces. Everything goes wrong for Basil-and you'll just have to watch. This is for anyone who loves comedy!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I simply cannot live without this cd!!!!  I literally play it over and over.  Many people say that there isn't enough music on the cd, since the cd is 45 min. long, and the movie was 2 1/2 hours.  If you listen to the cd all the way through, you can't tell where each song begins and ends.  I think the cd is one complete song, with 15 movements, instead of 15 different songs.  Compare it to the movie, and all of the music is there.  The only music that's missing is from the scenes when the pirates capture Elizabeth at Port Royal in the governor's home, and when Will Turner and Jack Sparrow fight the Royal British Navy to save Jack from the gallows.  Keep in mind that the producers manipulate the songs as many times as they need for each scene.  For instance, the well known haunting music for the entrance of the Black Pearl, only shows up twice on the cd, but was played over and over in the movie.  So, with the exception of those 2 scences, all the music is there.  In any case, the cd is absolutly amazing.  I'd recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.  You won't be able to take it off of your cd player!!!
B00005JM02|4.0|Although the endearing Disney comedy &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; offers nothing in terms of breakthrough, it's a sure bet for spending nice 100 minutes. The tale about fish (and other animal) world pitted against intruding humans in the quest for the lost orange-white clown-fish called Nemo highlights family and friendship values, and as such is a perfect family fun. Beautiful colours and animation, nice music and even occasional hints at human culture may have even more morose viewers smiling every once in a while. Don't expect anything deep, but this is cute and pure film fun, free of anything violent and controversial, yes, it's also for your little ones.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Best movie ever, in my opinion.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I'm no fan of George Clooney, but in this movie he was awesome!  And don't be fooled by the title- I thought it was a Shakespearean movie, but it's actually set in the Deep South in the 1920s or so.<br />The Coen brothers' screenplay is genius, flawlessly combining elements of Homer's Odyssey and the history of the Deep South (I especially liked &quot;servant of the little man&quot; and &quot;who made the color guard colored?&quot;).  The three main characters- Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro- are all very good and extremely different.  The movie is full of hilarity from beginning to end, straddling the line between fantasy and reality without ever becoming ludicrous.  Half the fun consists of how gross all the characters look/act (but in a funny way), as well as the strange pronunciations (you might want to turn on subtitles in order to understand some of the dialogue).  The other half lies in the absolutely brilliant screenplay, filled with unexpected twists and turns at every juncture.<br />Today's comedies are so often full of either cheap, lowbrow gags or overly dark humor.  This movie has neither, and furthermore contains a number of wonderful historical and mythical references- glued together by stunning performances from all actors involved.  I've watched this movie again and again, and it never loses its charm.  Some of the later scenes involving Holly Hunter (as the nasty ex-wife) are not particularly funny and, in my opinion, inferior to the rest of the piece.  Nevertheless, this picture is the best comedy I have ever seen.  See it now if you haven't already!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I have to disagree with Mr. Lamb's review.  There is quite a bit more involved than just \\"more bass,\\" as Lamb seems to erroneously think.  The \\"Naked\\" part of the album title is, of course, a reference to the fact that Phil Spector's original flourishes have been completely banished from the songs here.    Does this make the songs better?  That's a tough call.  I say no, not really.  Phil Spector ended up with miles of rough tapes of poorly-recorded takes to sift through and try to salvage.  Sure, he overdid things a bit in places but he also actually improved things, too.  \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" now sounds a bit lacking in the middle section, without the string buildup.  There just isn't enough polish on the original raw recording to make an effective section there, and it sounds a bit empty and unfinished -- which is why Spector added what he did in the first place.    The album is billed as \\"Let It Be the way the Beatles intended.\\"  Really?  Which Beatle?  Paul, that's who.  I'd bet that John Lennon wouldn't have approved of this reworking of the album.    Let It Be is actually the only Beatles album that could withstand this sort of treatment without incurring a huge backlash from Beatles fans.  Imagine if Paul had decided, \\"You know what?  All these years, I never really liked the way my bass isn't pumped up enough in Fixing A Hole -- and She's Leaving Home really never needed all of those strings.  Oh yeah, and I was always kind of embarrassed by that clarinet part in When I'm Sixty-Four.  Time to fix those up the way 'The Beatles originally intended!'\\"    You know what would happen next.  The outcry would be enormous -- He's tampering with a classic!  The only reason that Let It Be isn't incurring the same sort of backlash for this reworking of it in Paul's image (and only Paul's, no one else's) is that Let It Be wasn't one of the great Beatles albums in the first place.  It was a cobbled-together \\"album,\\" and it had some flaws.    I generally don't likeany remastering, reworking, remixing or re-anything done to Beatles albums.  The Anthology series was interesting, because it included original outtakes and early versions.  That's different.  But when you start taking the actual final releases and then dink around with them to make them sound \\"better,\\" then I have a problem with that.    This one isn't quite as egregious as the other recent efforts.  Yellow Submarine was atrocious in its sterilization of the songs, sucking all of the sparkle out of them and many times putting the emphasis on the wrong elements.  One example of this was the song \\"Yellow Submarine\\" itself.  For some stupid reason, it was remixed to keep Ringo's voice way up in front at all times -- so John Lennon's spoken echoing of the verses at the end (\\"In our yellow...submarine!  Ha-hey!\\") never gains volume, and is barely noticeable.  This is a travesty.  Beatles 1 similarly sucked the blood out of the songs, mixing them into extremely sterile-sounding stereo versions that lack warmth and punch.  And even George Harrison's new \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" with the colorized cover of the B&W portrait, sounds cleaner but lifeless compared to the old \\"muddied sound\\" original.    There is something just indefinable but essential about the way the originals sound, and in my opinion you really can't improve on them.  It's the reason that my old 45 record of \\"Shapes Of Things\\" by the Yardbirds, scratches and all, sounds better than my CD copy of it.  It's why the mono version of \\"Pet Sounds\\" by the Beach Boys is still superior to the reworked stereo version on the Pet Sounds box set.  This stuff really doesn't NEED studio tweaking.  I mean, they're not consistently included in critics' lists of the greatest albums of all time because they sounded \\"bad\\" or \\"wrong\\" to begin with...you know?    For long-time Let It Be fans that want to pick this album up as curiosity...sure, go ahead.  That's what I did.  Just don't expect a revelation, and don't expect to beconverted from your original copy.  And if you are buying Let It Be for the first time -- don't buy this one!  Get the original.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|ok the basic idea behind donnie darko is that he can see the future. his friend frank is a future image of him who talks to him throughout the movie and is just really disturbing.  frank to me is what donnie sees the future through, because it was him who originally saved him from the engine.  although he isnt real, he is a part of donnie and his appearance is symbolic of the future because its franks final destination.  since after the engine crashed into donnies room and he didnt die, his mom, sister, girlfriend, and frank die because of him and his teacher loses her job.  i think is only donnies world that is coming to an end because he is going to get caught for arsen, flooding the school, and murdering frank.  finally at the end it flashes back to where hes sleeping, and since he just saw the future he knows that he has to die.<br />im not so sure about the end of the world thing but i stand by the fact that the whole thing is him seeing into the future and being presented with a choice of living that out or dying for the good of everyone

B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is a mix of Drama and action, all mixed up together alright, this is a very good show, keeps your adrenaline pumped up. The season 1 dvd has some quality stuff, some episodes are so so, but overal it's a very good season.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers Special Extended version has a lot of scenes that provides character development.  There are scenes with more background information about Aragorn, an explanation by Gandalf why Merry and Pippen are with the Ents and has a scene where there's a understanding why Faramir acts like a Boromir replica.  There are so much more but others have done good job describing the scenes.  The commentaries with the director and actors are also good too.  Jackson explains why he deleted those scenes (they are good reasons too).  He also explains why he made Faramir so different from the books and why he placed the Elves in the Helm's Deep.  People who hated those 2 additions in the first place would understand why Jackson made the change.  The actors tells stories about what happened during \\"that day of filming\\" and is quite enjoyable.  For the special features, there is a 30 minute Gollum thing where they show Andy Serkis auditioning, what Gollum originally looked like and a more in-depth look of what Andy Serkis and the animators had to go through.  Just seeing that long hard process made me glad that they won the Oscars for special effects.  There is also an in-depth look on the Battle of Helm's Deep which they talk about how long they filmed it and what the stunt people as Uruk-Hai goes through.  Truly a great set to own!  If you're going to rent, make sure you have a lot of time because those special features and commentaries are worth to watch/listen too.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the only production that has actually changed the way I live and think.  This series is by far the most outstanding thing I've ever seen, period.  This includes Big Screen, and television productions.<BR>Band of Brothers is a must see for everyone.  This series will bring sorrow, joy and pride to every American.  I give HBO two thumbs up on this one.
0380789035|5.0|Sad to say, but this is the first book I read by Neil Gaiman.I thought that it was a purely magical journey.  Even through the parts that seemed slow moving, like when Shadow and Wednesday are seperated, there was some spark of magic in the air.  It was at those moments that it seemed you were Shadow looking into a world you forgot that existed.  I also found myself constantly looking up the names of the characters to figure out who they really were: some were obvious and others required a bit of work, not to mention the forgettable god that still eludes me.  American Gods is a riddle which probably can be answered in nearly infinite ways.  Its kinda like watching the Matrix movies the first time and scratching your head wondering what just happened.  Worth reading several more times and maybe taking a couple of notes and smacking yourself for not catching some of the obvious clues to certain gods.  Read and enjoy.  Though I warn you that there are some graphic bits in there that might sneak up on you.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Redemption can only succeed if the past doesn't haunt the redeemed. Clint Eastwood stars as former outlaw Will Munny. Munny has changed his ways after meeting a woman who literally helped him turn his life around. Now she's gone and he's a struggling farmer with two small children desperate for money to fuel his last chance at staying honest and straight.<br />Munny decides along with his former partner (a marvelously understated Morgan Freeman)and a young kid to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute for a $1000.00 bounty. The only thing standing between him and the money is Little Bill (Gene Hackman who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting actor)a brutal Sheriff. Munny doesn't know it but he's caught an express train to hell as the cold blooded killer he was comes to the fore again.<br />Unforgiven is as much about the inability to escape our past as it is about the violence and bloodshed that was later glossed over in the westerns of the 30's and 40's. Munny realizes that killing is a nasty business for both the killer and his victim. Despite his years of hard work and the saving grace of his wife, Munny could easily tip over into the abyss of alcholism and cruelty that dominated his youth. It's a marvelous portrayal and Eastwood, arguably, deserved the Best Acting Oscar as much as the directing and Best Picture Oscars.<br />This new 10th Anniversary edition has been digitally remastered and looks beautiful. The opening sequence is a good example of the care taken in the transfer. The smoke from Munny's house during sunset snakes gently against the bright orange sky. Eastwood and his collaborators (writer David Webb Peoples who also wrote Blade Runner and the underrated film science fiction adventure Solider with Kurt Russell)have fashioned a morality play as much about the present as it is about the past.<br />The cast is filled with Eastwood regulars but two particular performances shine aside from Eastwood and Freeman--Gene Hackman as the sadistic and brutal Little Bill and the late Richard Harris in a glorified cameo as gunfighting legend English Bob. Harris plays Bob as a dandy with a pistol until Bob encounters Little Bill. We then discover how much of his legend is myth designed to gloss over a nasty reputation and dishonorable actions.<br />The extras included are very good as well. There's a documentary called Eastwood on Eastwood which ran on one of the cable channels.  As a performer we get glimpses of Eastwood in early supporting roles (from his first movie the horrible horror film Revenge of the Creature with John Agar)to the television role that gave him enough fame to jump to Leone's A Fistful of Dollars in Rawhide. The clips provide a good summation of Eastwood's performing style over the years. It's also a canny if slightly self serving assessment on Eastwood's themes as a director and smart observations about the true quality of his uneven body of work as a director.<br />There's also an episode of Maverick featuring James Garner where Eastwood plays a character that could have been Munny when he was younger. He plays a cocky young gunfighter with an attitude (although Munny was much nastier based on comments from the characters in the film. Consider his portrayal a G rated version of Munny). It's a beautiful transfer of a classic black and white episode from television's Golden Age. When will Maverick and some of these classic westerns finally make the jump to DVD?<br />There's also a feature commentary by Time film critic Richard Schickel (although I would have much preferred Eastwood). A new featurette about the making of the film as well as the original featurette on the making of the film.<br />If you're not interested in the extras and the nearly pristine transfer doesn't appeal to you, the single disc earlier edition of Unforgiven looks very good as well athough nowhere near as sharp as this one. It's about half the cost and might be a good place to start if you haven't seen the film and are unsure about purchasing it.e unsure about purchasing it.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This cd was awesome.  The selection of music is fabulous.  I have absolutely no complaints with it at all.  Perfect for driving down the road on long trips or even city driving.  Fleetwood Mac fans will simply love it, and non Fleetwood Mac fans will become Fleetwood Mac fans once you've heard this cd.  Rock on.
B000066NW0|5.0|Please ignore all the negative reviews from juveniles who obviously do not own this album and who are more concerned about image than about music. As a person whose musical tastes encompass very diverse genres (Punk included), I think that this is an excellent and infectious CD. I bought this CD for my 5 year old daughter last Christmas, and after listening to it with her several times, I realized what a gem this is. I lent it to one of my good friends, who is also into harder music like Hum, Janes Addiction, etc., and he admitted that the songwriting and lyrics are exceptional, especially from someone as young as Avril Lavigne. He ended up keeping it and I bought a new copy. :) (By the way, she did write or cowrite the songs on her album, contrary to what other reviewers have claimed.) <br />I found this album is mostly upbeat and happy, and I think it would be a great asset to anyone's music collection. (I put it right next to my 3 Joy Division CDs for good measure.) For those of you who decide to buy this CD, look for the play on words in \\"Things I'll Never Say\\". The song is sweet but not as innocent as it seems. :)
B00009TB5G|3.0|If loving Tolkien's books makes me a whining &quot;purist&quot; so be it.  If disliking the dumbing-down of the books to appeal to a mass audience makes me a &quot;purist&quot; so be it.<BR>If disagreeing with Peter Jackson's vision of the books makes me a &quot;purist&quot; so be it.<br />There are many changes one can make in translating a book to film and some of Jackson's are very appealing and workable.  However, many of them radically change the story for the worse.  Would you change the story or the ending of Romeo and Juliet?  Or The Ten Commandments?  I don't think so.  <br />The films work, however, in SPITE of all that because enough of Tolkien's original story and characters shine through.  And for the millions of us who have read the books, we are grateful at least that these beautiful and timeless stories were brought to life and have encouraged so many others to read them too.  <br />So, I am proud to be a &quot;purist&quot; who enjoys both the books and the films but nevertheless would have preferred the films to more accurately reflect Tolkien's vision.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I just love Josh Groban. I think he's so relaxing and enjoyable to list to. I liked his first self titled cd and wasn't disapointed with this album either.  hope in the future he come's out with more music.
6305513406|1.0|I love this show and have all the episodes on tape from Columbia House...but I can't bring myself to buy these dvds. Yes I want them badly, but TWO episodes per disc?????? I'll wait till they bring them out in complete seasons, or when ever I hit the lottery.
0064471837|4.0|Sabriel is truely a great book, and I loved every word of it. I liked it so much that dispite homework, I finished it in one day.<br />Sabriel is about a young girl with the power to bring back the dead to life and to death. She started her adventure in the old kingdom when she realized her father was trapped in death. Equiped with seven bells, and her father, Abhorsen,'s sword, she set on a epic journey that you'll never forget.<br />Despite the wonderful laguage and plot, the character sounds unreal. Sabriel, in school, sounds like a all perfect student with a first,second, third, or fifth in everything, which is unlikely. Touchstone, the last of the royal family, sounds too much unlike one.  All he think about is serving. And then, suddenly, this innocent young half-prince went into the bathtub with a maid! That's really weird.
6304698623|5.0|A Little Princess is a wonderful remake of the Shirley Temple version, and far better in my opinion!  The story and how it unfolds gradually builds up tension so that you can never take your eyes off of it.  The music and soundtrack are superb, enhancing the ever-present mystery and imagination.  I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie again and again.

B0000W3YIS|5.0|Britney definitely changed from her last album, and ut was a change she needed. This album rocks!! the first time I heard it I thought it was awful, but as I listened to it again I started to like it!! This is definitely britney's best album. <br />Toxic is the best song of all the album!!!
B00005MAM2|3.0|Ok the DVD is great wipes the floor with the VHS version but some of the diolouge changed and the voice overs are different but in a way it wasn't needed all they had to do was transfer the old VHS movie to the DVD without re-releasing to movie in theaters in 2001, so I liked the old VHS version better but this is a good start for anybody just begining to enter into the world of Japanese Animation enjoy.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this DVD after the award nominations were announced. I've never been a &quot;fan&quot; of japanimation, and this film has changed my outlook. The characters are stilted and over-stylish as compared to American classic animation, but the characterizations are superb. The story pulls you in and the moral of the story hits home. Following Chihiro's adventures leads to understandings about yourself - what more could you want from a film. And the DVD extras are better than most. You won't be disapointed.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|I love Michael Mann and almost all his other movies. His class as a director is obvious in Ali too, the visual play at work is phenomenal, but the movie is too long and winding a potrait of what could have been an interesting character. We hit that spot with a press conference sequence, and perhaps a couple of bouts or so, but overall the movie is a bore.<br />To begin, Will Smith is a top actor and you can see him doing his best here, but ultimately one wonder if he was the right man to bring the kind of pizzazz and intensity that Denzel Washington carried in The Hurricane. And to think that Ali is a more prominent boxer.<br />When one watches a biopic, it would be reasonable to want to come out of the theatre having some clarity on how the person's life progressed, what his personality was like and so on. Instead, I left with a feeling of &quot;What just happened&quot;. The film lacks a smooth narrative, we patch and cut from one place to another. Jamie Foxx lends some of the human drama to the movie, but unfortunately at times when it was least required.<br />I happened to see the documentary &quot;When we were kings&quot; recently, and for boxing fans that is a must-watch for the last bout between Foreman and Ali. That pretty much sums up my regard for this lacklustre movie from an otherwise magnum director.
B00005JLTN|3.0|While Keanu Reeves definetly fits the part as Neo just as in the first, the rest of the film was a bit of a quack. Sure, the action was good but the plot was a little to tampered with, and the sex scene was a horrible attrocity. The only decent bit of feminimity was when the lovely Monica Bellucci showed up halfway thru and had a make out session with Neo in front of Trinity. I laughed then and only then. The action scenes were definetly enjoyable but I would much rather have the clean script of the Origional Matrix back instead of this one. Peace Out
B000063JDE|3.0|I adore the way in which Lynch leads you into his own microcosm, each screen is more intriguing than the previous and you become involved with the characters. Blue Velvet is no exception: a simple town boy is intrigued by a woman, and following his curiosity gets drawn into her web, only to inadvertently uncover dark mysteries.  We take this genuinely and often weirdly funny walk with him, a walk that'll cling to your thoughts long after the credits have rolled.<br />I don't idolize Lynch as many reviewers do (although I admired his work in The Straight Story) and I believe he has too often pursued weirdness for the sake of weirdness. But at his best he has produced marvels of film making. Blue Velvet is one of the latter as it doozily exposes the hidden dark underbelly of small towns, and of people that are seldom what they seem on the surface.<br />More than one viewing of this film is probably necessary if you really want to get it. The first time round, I ended up thinking that this was simply a noir-ish attempt at vulgar violence. The second viewing actually made me see some of the things Lynch wanted us to see without the shock factor.<br />Even so, this one may not be for everyone, but a must for Lynch fans.
B000099T2L|4.0|I was definitely not disappointed with Beyonce's first solo effort. Each track is beautifully sung with energy and passion. Stand out tracks are Crazy in Love, Signs, Naughty girl, Me Myself and I and Baby Boy. The only song that I could have done without was Speechless, but all the rest are great! She brings something fresh and innovative to the music scene, which was much needed.I think that her next effort will iron out the tiny and sporadic problems with this album and will be a far superior effort..cant wait!
B00007AJF8|3.0|Let's get the praise over with first.<br />This unconventional movie starts with a very intriguing notion, brilliantly surreal and off-centre, basically something very different from mainstream cinema but still playful and fun. It rakes up some thoughtful issues --<br />(1) The real sexual desires buried deep in human minds;<br />(2) The need of ordinary folk to want to be someone else, someone more *seemingly* glamorous than themselves;<br />(3) The expressiveness of the puppeting medium; some of the puppeteer sequences are simply breathtaking;<br />(4) The swiftness with which people would pounce on the weakness of other humans to start making money;<br />(5) In parts, the jerk-a-tear statement about animal bondage;<br />(6) And tying in all these loose sub-ends, the ultimate notion of freedom and love of self, etc etc.<br />All that is well and dandy, and this is easily one of the most creative movies out of Hollywood in recent times.<br />However, having just watched it a second time I must say it's a bit of an empty shell once you get beyond the surprise factor. I didn't laugh, I smirked the odd time, and certainly my heart wasn't warmed - it's a very cold movie really, nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly one that will merit lasting affection.<br />It's a strange mixture really, because there is some sort of pretension to art at times, yet at others the characters and the emotions are paper-thin. Yet we're supposed somehow to be affected by these characters despite the fact that the film mocks and satirises them at every opportunity - the difference between this and the Coens is that they love even their most repellent characters and it rubs off on you!<br />In the end my reaction to this is the same as to the Naked Gun or one of those broad hit-and-miss comedies - it's the same schtick. Towards the fourth quarter of the movie, I was just hoping it could all be put to an end soon.<br />The director's interview on the DVD is funnier in two minutes than the rest of the film put together.rest of the film put together.
B000002U8G|5.0|I like Echoes better than anything else they did.  This was their last flawed and creative album before they cast their lot with the FM playlist and put out the brilliantly engineered and produced Dark Side of the Moon.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|I couldn't get enough of this movie (have seen it 5 times already), so I just HAD to have the soundtrack.  Some tracks immediately brought me back to certain scenes in the movie, others were more subtle.  I didn't place them until I saw the movie the second or third time.  <br />Kelly Clarkson's &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot; is wonderful!  I've hit reply on the CD player hundreds of times.<br />It's also great to have &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot; and &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; included on the soundtrack--highlights of both the movie and the CD.<br />One obvious omission from the soundtrack, however, (both the US and UK versions) is &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; by the Bay City Rollers.  That song was part of a very poignant scene in the movie (at the funeral of Daniel's wife) and it also segued into the next scene as it was played at the wedding reception of Peter &amp; Juliet while they were dancing.  If that had been included this soundtrack would have been complete.  <br />So while I enjoy the CD, some songs more than others, it always leaves me wanting just a little bit more.
B000000W6F|5.0|..this album shows it. &quot;Gish&quot; was released in 1991, and sadly, was eclipsed by the release of Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; knocking the Pumpkins back a bit. But that surely didn't stop the band, as they went on to relase such amazing works as &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; and &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; in later years. &quot;Gish&quot; is an power assault on the ears, nice crunchy guitars, with haunting vocals by Billy Corgan, and one track (&quot;Daydream&quot;) featuring the bassist, D'Arcy on lead vocals. The band proved to be both experimental and unique, tying in hardcore rockers like &quot;Siva&quot; with the soft gently, trippy sound of songs like &quot;Snail&quot; and &quot;Crush&quot;. Here, the Pumpkins perfect their loud-soft dynamic, especially on songs like &quot;Rhinocerous&quot; (great flanger effect on the guitar here) and of course &quot;Daydream&quot; which even features, yes, a cello! &quot;I Am One&quot; has the best drum intro, proving Jimmy Chamberlain a drum god, while &quot;Siva&quot; the first single, shows Billy and James' amazing chemistry and guitarwork. &quot;Rhinocerous&quot; is a slow rocker, that builds up in the middle, one of my all time favorites - was released as the second single for this album and was also featured on the E.P. &quot;Lull&quot; issued in 1992. &quot;Bury Me&quot; is just awesome, if not trippy at times.. and there are some really awesome guitar licks in this song right before the end where Billy sings &quot;She will bury me&quot;. &quot;Crush&quot; is another favorite, which begins with a scale on the bass, a slow, trippy, beautiful song. &quot;Suffer&quot; another rocker with lines like &quot;All that you suffer is all that you are&quot; and &quot;too late to recover piece of mind/too late to recover me&quot; - the song takes a turn in the middle and just.. simply rocks, I can't even describe it, the song just emits an aura, a feeling. &quot;Snail&quot; and &quot;Tristessa&quot; are 2 of my favorite tracks. &quot;Window Paine&quot; is a slow song, that probably is my least favorite on the album- &quot;window paine around my heart&quot; Billy sings. Its just too slow for my tastes, but sort of reminds me of &quot;Silverf***&quot; on Siamese Dream in some ways, its just an odd sort of song. The closing track &quot;Daydream&quot; is a sad song lyrically, but musically sounds happy. &quot;my daydream screams bitter til the end.../the love i shared true, selfish to the heart/my heart my sacred heart&quot; - D'Arcy sings. D'Arcy adds a really nice touch to this song, the original demos had Billy on vocals. But, Billy still chimes in at the end of the song theres a small bit called &quot;I'm Going Crazy&quot; in which Billy sings &quot;I'm going crazy/I don't want your feelings..&quot;. All in all an amazing debut from a band that would go on to create greater things. This album is a must get for any pumpkins fan, and its great to see how the pumpkins began. Musically, this album is a triumph and really shows the talent of the band.
B00005JMD3|5.0|I thought this was the best movie i have ever seen. I have been waiting for this movie to come out on video so I can see it again. I highly recomend this to you and your kids. It has a great plot that everyone can understand. Spend the money to rent or purchase the movie. [...]
B00005Y228|5.0|In 2002, \\"Fever\\" marked a rightful comeback for Kylie Minogue after thirteen years out of the US spotlight.  Most tracks were produced by Cathy Dennis.  Every track has highly catchy dance beats in their own way.  Some contain techno, some contain pop, some contain club dance.  But all have high quality.  The Grammy-nominated tracks \\"Love At First Sight\\" and \\"Come Into My World\\" capitalize the dance floor attraction.  As the music, Kylie's performing is wonderful.  Her combination of sexuality and bubble gum pop add special flavors to her tracks.  Every track answers why she's equally as popular as Madonna in Europe and Australia.  \\"Fever\\" is the ultimate album for those looking to dance.  Many will highly enjoy this.  This album proves that she came back to stay.<br />After the final track \\"Burning Up\\", do not press \\"stop\\" immediately.  There are two bonus tracks that became smash hits a few years ago in Europe and Australia: \\"Boy\\" and \\"Butterfly\\".  Both are equally as enjoyable as the remaining twelve tracks.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is the worst CD ever ok,i just want to cry, this woman is really beautiful but she can't sing at all. Everytime it's a decent song but whit her voice sounds really awful. THIS IS GARBAGE, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD, BUY GOOD MUSIC LIKE DIDO, CHRISTINA AGUILERA, MARIAH CAREY, TONI BRAXTON, ALICIA KEYS, BUT PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BRTINEY.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|Let me tell you all something. The only R&amp;B I consider worth my time and listening to are the kind that possess a sense of musicianship and quality which is a MUST. These days its so rare to find or listen to really decent, GOOD R&amp;B music without all that artifical/computerized crap. I mean come on, who doesn't want to pop in a cd 10 years from now and REALLY listen to a song that recaptures that old feeling, memory, or even a great worthwhile message that you can't help but, feel it tingle and awaken your senses from within? Anyways, I never heard of Alicia Keys before because I seriously thought there was no use to listening to radio's R&amp;B because it sounds like trash to me most of the time. Until, a friend of mine invited me to a show where AK was performing in London. I was hesitant because of how much my friend just went on and on about AK because it sounded too overated. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance because she was a classically trained pianist. MAN, the show was mindblowing that I couldn't believe such an artist especially in R&amp;B put it down like that or even existed. I haven't heard anyone like that in such a long time since stevie wonder. When she did &quot;U Don't Know My Name,&quot; that just did it for me. That song immediately reminded me of that old feeling  of how I started pursuing a long time crush and love who is now my wife. It felt so raw, real, tingly, and convincing that it left me in tears in just missing my wife. Alicia, thank you for bringing back that feeling of QUALITY &amp; MUSICIANSHIP in R&amp;B again. You seem very humble in consideration of how talented you are which is ALWAYS a great thing because honey, I KNOW that you'll soar and succeed beyond your expectations and then some. Keep up the wonderful work and PLEASE don't ever stop whatever you're doing recapturing that &quot;magic&quot; of true R&amp;B.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|When I bought this cd, the cashier asked me if Alicia Keys was any good because she loved her collab with C. Aguillera in \\"Impossible.\\" I assured her that even though I haven't heard the whole entire cd YET, I already know its good because Alicia Keys is that good that you can't doubt her musical talent. Knowing her music from her last album, I already expected and knew Alicia would expand, take her music to the next level, and ofcourse -- give it to us again. So, I knew I was getting my money's worth. Anyway, this CD is exactly of what I expected of her. I love ALL the songs. The ones that really speak to my heart and are oh so infectious to the extent that it can be addictive to listening to are: Harlem's Nocturne, U Don't Know My Name (that's my #1 most favorite!!), If I Ain't Got You (#2!!), Diary, Wake Up, and When You Love Someone. Alicia, I'm putting it down for you and betting that you'll outbeat Beyonce (she got NOTHING on you!), Monica, Brandy, and basically all those lame singers who HAVE to use alot of sex appeal to sell their music with a majority of meaningless, and worthless lyrics. We need more female artists like you, Norah Jones, Lauryn Hill that can bring worthwhile music AND talent, PLEASE!
0201626632|5.0|This is a great book for absolutely anyone working on his/her PhD or looking for career advice at the end of their PhD. In fact, it will be a great help even to those who are long finished with their PhD's especially if they are currently advising their own students. <BR>The writing style is very friendly and straightforward, as if the author is talking to you, sitting across from you. More importantly, the advise is very practical and comes from someone who has a lot of experience in academia.
0316666343|3.0|I have to say that I did read this the whole way through, and that alone says something good.  How happy I was though to see that other readers shared my feelings that this book just started out so amazing, and then went south with the whole body inhabitation thing and all.  The first 100 pages, I was thinking man 'o man I'm just loving this, and then something big time bad happened.  How funny that it has done so well...  I guess the TV show I mentioned above did pretty peachy too.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This is one of the 3 Best Albums of 2003, in my opinion (the others being the Outkast and White Stripe albums, with Ryan Adams coming close).  It quickens my pulse and shoots up my adrenaline every time I hear it!  It's better than their first classic album, because the songs are more diverse and richer.<BR>Every song on this album is great fun!  It takes awhile to grow on you, but it's worth the repeated listenings.  Now I can't stop listening to it and it brightens my day like urgent snappy music should.  Support your local (American) rock n roll classic band and buy this!
B00004U2AB|5.0|This movie never gets dated and has an all-star cast, many of whom were first starting their movie careers.  Richard Dreyfuss was great and reminded me of several people I went to high school with.  His search for the mysterious blonde in the car (Suzanne Sommers) is something that many males must have gone through.<br />On the eve of graduation, seniors prepare for a high school dance.  The plot seems to revolve Ron Howard and Cindy Williams relationship problems.  Though they had different names, they seemed to be playing their roles for Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley, which they were later to star in.<br />Wolfman Jack gives a great cameo appearance, and his voice is heard DJing on the radio throughout, giving us a medley of great 50s music.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|The one-star review from &quot;A Music Fan&quot; (see below) made me laugh.  This genius begins by criticizing the CD cover and making the ridiculous suggestion that it looks more like a Halloween scene. Umm, OK. Next, he says &quot;You've heard these songs before.&quot;  Not true.  Many of the songs appear on this CD for the first time.  Finally, he labels the band tired and uninspired without providing any evidence to back up his claim.  Pretty typical of these types of people to make bogus claims without offering a shred of substantiation to back them up.  The fact is the band sounds great, Ian's voice is strong and lyrical, the arrangements are creative and beautiful, and the CD as a whole is a real treat.  &quot;A Music Fan,&quot; get your facts straight before making absurd assertions.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  The DVD concert is also a great buy. I have been a Robbie fan since the mid-90's and the days of Take That and I think he is the quintessential pop star with a great voice, and a cocky attitude.  He stays very true to the original songs and pays his respects to Frank, Dean and Sammy.  A great CD!
B00005JKJA|5.0|SPOLIER ALERTS:<BR>I thought Club Silencio and the words of the master of ceremonies is a reminder to us all (and the characters) that our lives and the world and our beings are NOTHING. [In the beginning was the word, before that _silence_; the Word (as in the Bible) may be a dream or a shared illusion of sentient beings who don't know they aren't sentient and don't know they don't exist.] At best we are the dreams of a higher dimensional creature or a kid (God) in a 24 dimensional reality, playing on a &quot;computer&quot; virtual reality game. &quot;It's all recorded&quot; and the emphasis on AUDITIONS means our lives have been scripted and our particular lives have been assigned to us by a casting director. Lynch has excelled at emptieness, meaninglessness, dead bodies or body parts (much of Mulholland drive seems to have a faint sound in the background of insects consuming a dead body), and the random cruelty of nature; but has offered the only cure for this as: _a Kierkegaardian leap of faith_: The characters in Blue Velvet believe in the bluebirds in a world where they see more insects than birds; Twin Peak's Dale Cooper believe in the enthusiasm of being a human being who loves &quot;a great cup of coffee&quot; and a slice of pie &quot;that's worth a stop.&quot; He stands tall and smiles and Likes people in a world partly filled with corpses and human suffering and madness; Wild at Heart has 1) a Good Witch from Wizard of Oz and 2) the singing of Elvis songs which elevates the characters (who aren't too bright) to a &quot;nifty&quot; level of experience that is high above the blood on the marble floor where the head was bashed. Lynch is best at showing us the reality of meaninglessness, insects devouring our dead bodies in the future, the non-understandableness of life, existential angst, angst from physical and mental wounds, agony without much ectasy. He is LESS able to make the Leap of faith real. He portrays existence so well. The Leap of faith aspect seems forced. Maybe he's TRYING to believe in faith and is trying to sell the idea to himself. Well, I may be up in my armpits in a quicksand of diseased manure and my nightmares may seem to be coming true, and my body may rot and be food for insects in the future, and I may lose my persona and/or ego again, but, trust me, we are in the Platonian shadow world of 2 or 3 dimensions. At death we will unfold into our 24 dimensional selves. I love you all.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|No wonder this show was cancelled, no one could stay awake through it. BUFFY and (the superior) ANGEL, are examples of well-written, exciting shows...which begs the question as to what happened with Firefly?

0452282152|2.0|I was embarrassed on behalf of Vermeer while reading this book. Definitely aimed at high-school level readers, who may be interested in the pseudo romance and &quot;artist as a flawed regular man&quot; approach. Chevalier's first novel, recently published, suffers from the same sophomoric skill level and just plain goofy storyline.
B00008973Q|5.0|This film was the last of Kurosawa's great epics.  It is loosely based on King Lear but with Kurosawa's own plot twists and injections of Japanese culture including Noh influences.  The story basically revolves around the treachery of 2 of the Great Lord's sons after they are bequeathed his power and the rejection and final redemption of the son the Great Lord initially banishes.  Although, the film is 2 and half hours long, it does not get boring.  The acting is phenomenal, the battle scenes are spectacular, and the cinematography is breathtaking.  The kind of filmmaking that Ran represents is virtually extinct.  Movies no longer use thousands of extras and hundreds of real horses and can no longer convey the realism of movies like Ran.  Fortunately for us, Ran is beautifully restored as you can see in the Restoration Demo under the special features.  The commentary by Stephen Prince without a doubt establishes the 5-star rating for this DVD.  He analyzes the film constantly from beginning to end pointing out salient features of Kurosawa's style and making sure we understand everything relevant to Kurosawa's direction of Ran.  The second commentary by Peter Grilli is not quite as interesting unfortunately.<br />Despite the absence of the incredible Toshiro Mifune, I highly recommend this DVD.
B00005JKN9|3.0|2 1/2 stars.<br />I disliked this movie quite a bit, but I'll admit that it did have some powerful scenes that stuck in my head more than with most movies.  It's not a bad movie and there are numerous quality components and performances (not nearly as many as the Oscar nominations would suggest, however), but subjectively, there was little that appealed to me even though, as a big history buff and fan of action movies, I would have thought this movie would be exceptional.  I think the real problem with this movie is that most of its characters were caricatures and the plotlines have all been seen before.  Furthermore, scenes happened and ended not because one might reasonably and logically expect the characters to perform those actions but because Martin Scorcese decided to end them that way for dramatic effect.<br />Let's start with the performances.  I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio.  I find him to be a spoiled, simpering, tentative, effeminate, brooding and pouting pretty boy.  Now I actually enjoyed both his performance and the movie in Catch Me if You Can, but I think he was miscast here.  He simply doesn't lend the physical or charismatic attributes to this role that the character of Amsterdam Vallon required and just seems to be juvenile and immature.  There was nothing about him that suggested he actually could be a tough street fighter.  There was nothing about him that suggested he could be a leader of much more than a small handful of minor criminals and certainly not inspire hundreds of people as a leader of a gang army.  The role called for an actor who could actually project powerful emotions rather than just pout immaturely - a young Sean Penn would have been perfect.  The character of Amsterdam Vallon, though, is really just Robin Hood or Luke Skywalker set in New York in 1847 and 1863.<br />I have mixed feelings about Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher.  He is an extraordinarily talented actor and I very much enjoyed his performances in Last of theMohicans and My Left Foot.  His performance here left powerful impressions on me, but I couldn't quite buy his portrayal of Bill the Butcher.  First, his appearance didn't quite seem realistic - he looked like an extremely lifelike animated character.  Second, I found the mixture of pure evil and chivalric ideals to be unbelievable.  For someone who cherished the memory of Priest Vallon as such an honorable warrior and praised his adversary in such a fashion, one would have thought he would have considered Monk McGinn in a very similar light; certainly McGinn captured the respect of the entire community and not solely for his prowess as the supreme street fighter of the Five Points.  Bill's murderous sneak cleaver attack on McGinn's back was not consistent with the portrayal of respect for honor.  Finally, there was just something about Day Lewis' tone and accent that just didn't strike me as belonging to a person from any American background.<br />Other characters were unrealistic.  All of the police and firemen seemed comical and with the exception of the former Dead Rabbit gang member, didn't it seem peculiar that they were all inferior fighters compared to the other characters of gang background?  The black member of the new version of the Dead Rabbits seemed to be just a lame attempt to be politically correct - &quot;oh, I guess we need to have a sympathetic minority character in there somewhere.&quot;<br />I found a number of aspects about the opening battle scene to be incredible:  the members of the Dead Rabbits gang at the beginning outfitted themselves unrealistically, as if they were in a science fiction-fantasy movie rather than an historical one.  The character of the girl fighter with the steel claws - not realistic at all.  The members of the two armies poured by the dozens out of the woodwork at that battle in a very theatrical but unrealistic manner.  Upon Priest's death, someone blows a horn and then suddenly all of the fighting stops and the remaining Irish Gang members just trudge off?<br />I found some of the settings to be unrealistic.  The main setting is in some very large building that is part multi-story tenement, part tavern and medieval/viking feasting hall with vast amounts of open space, looking almost like a medival version of the Mall of America.  And rather than have a shop on the street, Bill cuts his meat and acts as his role as a butcher in some back office in this building.  Furthermore, this large main building is connected with an underground series of caverns or crypts to the old church?  It is the product of Hollywood.  The expansive Chinese restaurant with the similar, cathedral-like feasting hall was equally unbelievable for such an impoverished slum.<br />I simply did not find the scene of Monk McGinn's murder to be credible at all.  No street fighter as crafty and seasoned as McGinn would have trusted Bill sufficiently to have turned his back on him to walk to a &quot;peaceful&quot; meeting.  No one who knew Bill that thoroughly would have seen any possibility of working things out reasonably and peacefully.  I also found incredible the fashion in which Amsterdam allows himself to be taken in under Bill's wing as his apprentice/son to such an extent that he saves Bill's life from the assassin.<br />Finally, the level of violence in this movie was a bit too excessive.  A bit more could have been scripted as being off-camera.  For instance, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has a lot of violent scenes, yet the worst of it happens off-camera, leaving it much more palatable.  Furthermore, the violence was too theatrical - blood flowed and splashed everywhere as if the humans in this movie were just water balloons filled with blood.<br />Casting Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, the excess brutality of this movie and the overall sense of a theatrical melodrama really just ruined the movie for me.  If I was Ebert or Roeper, I'd have to give this one the thumbs down.
6304595247|5.0|There are at least three versions of this adapted book, those three being the only versions I personally know of, and this one is by far the best.  Expecting yet another jaunted version of Emily Bronte's best and most famous book, I taped this movie off of HBO and found that it was one that I would gladly see again.  The incredibly beautiful Juliette Binoche easily played both Cathys, and Ralph Fiennes was a surprisingly vengeful Heathcliff.  I actually was able to follow along with the book in my lap, unlike most of the other adapted-Bronte-novel movies.  The only burrs that stuck in my saddle were personal thoughts of the supporting cast, and nothing that affected the movie itself.  This is an excellent rendition, as the general opinion speaks of, and should be shown in any Literature class that wishes to show a version of the novel.  As good as any Sparknotes.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I never liked 'Let It Be' when it was originally released, there was something non-Beatles about it but I could not place my finger on what it was, till now. Without the Phil Spector influence, 'Let It Be...Naked' is how I expected The Beatles to sound, just like their previous recordings. 'I've Got A Feeling' gave me goose bumps.
B00006LI26|1.0|This is one of the many reasons why I gave the middle finger to Heavy metal and started listening to innovative Death metal albums like Death's &quot;Symbolic&quot; and Celtic frost's &quot;Into the pandemonium&quot;. It's nothing but the same damn power chord usage and sing along verses and choruses. Kai Hansen sounds like he was casterated to keep his absurdly high pitched voice and the drummer uses the same old double bass technique. This is for old, old school metalheads who refuse to grow and branch out into new territory. Check out Blind guardian's &quot;Imaginations from the other side&quot; for quality Power metal. Go listen to Hypocrisy's &quot;The fourth dimension&quot; if you want a diverse, unconventional (otherwise known as &quot;false&quot; metal) piece of music.<br />P.S.-Anyone who considers this definative 80's German metal needs to listen to Kreator's &quot;Pleasure to kill&quot;, Sodom's &quot;Persecution mania&quot;, and Destruction's &quot;Sentence of death/Infernal overkill&quot;. Those guys make Helloween look like a bunch o' nancys. Metal heart signing out now.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I watched this dvd over the weekend and all I can say is that it moved me to tears.  Incredible throughout, but especially the ending.

Oh my God, she steals the show.<br />Excellent sound and video.  You must buy this.<br />Peace to all.

So, when an artist like Badu releases a song/CD I kinda look forward to the &quot;listening pleasure&quot;. Mama's Gun was great!!!  Worldwide is cool.  I enjoy the long interludes and mixes.  Badu semingly does not rest on her laurels.  She always brings the creativity needed to ascend it to the next level!!!!  <br />I have enjoyed listening to this cd.  She has taken it to next creative level.  If you like creativity........BUY THIS CD!!!!<br />Peace and Love
B0000024Z7|5.0|The guitar solo on Song for the Wind by itself is probably one of the greatest solos of rock/fusion/jazz guitar. His phrasing is along the lines of the great jazz pianist Bill Evans. Just listen to the demo on this site and you'll see what I mean -- the actual solo is considerably longer but this gives a good taste of the album. I owned it in 1973 and just re-purchased and it has held up greatly with time.
B000068PQ0|4.0|The new flaming Lips album shocked me.  I was surprised about the depth the music takes you.  The CD takes you where it goes.  Yoshimi would have been proud to hear this Album because it's originality and rythm takes you home.
0783225903|5.0|This movie is just brilliant... an incredible satire on bureaucracy and all large, depersonalized organizations. The &quot;retro-future&quot; sets are mind-blowingly inventive.  The acting is great.  Worth watching repeatedly.
B000089RVX|2.0|Like most other owners of this album, I was first drawn to Evanescence via Bring Me to Life. Although the &quot;metal band with chick singer&quot; route has been taken before, Evanescence added a new twist-- Amy Lee's voice is more like that of Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera than Courtney Love. In &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; her voice works perfectly in the metal-girl mix... soft and demure on the verse, strong and demanding on the chorus, Amy is able to properly emote the underlying themes of pain, confusion, and hope within the song. <br />&quot;Going Under&quot; gave listeners an even better look at the extent of Lee's vocal power. She kneels to growling lows in the verse and soars high on the chorus. The song is masterfully composed. However, those beautiful highs that made us fall in love with Amy on &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; started to sound whiny and excessive to me as the chorus played a second and third time. <br />This is the problem with &quot;Fallen.&quot; Evanescence's combination of a vocally powerful soprano with dark, crunchy, melodic rock is refreshing, but one can only be refreshed so much before becoming irritated. <br />&quot;Fallen&quot;'s album cover, whether mistakenly or not, gives us the message that it's all about Amy, while the other band members take a backseat on the rear cover. However, Amy's voice is a little /too/ perfect. In many songs, she sounds more like a girl in choir practice than a rocker. She never strays from her precise vocal technique, and it's because of this that she fails to completely capture the spirit of the tormented soul in &quot;Tourniquet&quot; or sound truely in mourning during &quot;My Immortal.&quot; Her voice never cracks with emotion, sighs with fustration, or growls with anger, and she hits and maintains every note with pitch-perfect precision. The only thing she uses to convey any feeling at all are volume dynamics. This works on &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; because it's a power ballad perfect forshowcasing vocal prowess, but her sanitary vocal lines are the ruin of many of the other songs on her album. <br />While listening to this album, I found myself often wishing for a different singer. The songs are good-- Amy Lee and Ben Moody are both highly talented songwriters-- but Lee's sophisticated voice sounds too mature for the songs she sings. Quite honestly, I'd rather have a less talented singer like Toby from Snake River Conspiracy or the lead singer from the Donnas, both of whom can sing a line note for note like Amy, but who can also add the growls, whines, and other elements that make you feel like the singer is actually feeling something. No one wants to hear their high school chorus teacher rocking out to metal tunes, and Amy's opera-quality voice gives me ugly mental pictures of a matronly church choir director secretly rocking out to her hidden collection of metal tapes before Sunday school starts.<br />Although I wasn't really able to enjoy this album because of its vocal monotony (plus some of the melodic repetiveness that other reviewers have mentioned), this album can be a good listen. Diluted in a ratio of 1 Evanescence song to 10 songs from other bands, this CD is full of powerful tunes to add to a mix or to play on &quot;shuffle&quot; mixed in with other songs on your IPod. If Evanescence keeps making songs of equal or better quality, and Amy stops feeling the need to prove to the world how perfectly she can sing, there's no doubt I'll be giving the next Evanescence album 5 stars.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album musically is a phenominal masterpiece of style, technique, and brilliance. Dream Theater have once again proven to the world why they are the kings of progressive metal. That being stated, I regret to say that I found this album to be very disturbing with regards to the lyrics. I've read plenty that were much worse mind you, but never from Dream Theater. It seems Petrucci and Portnoy (having both written the majority of these lyrics) have taken the ever so popular route of blaming God and religion for all of their social problems in their daily lives. This, coming from a band that has championed itself for making positive and emotionally moving pieces of music was an absolute surprise to see. I was very shocked and offended to read a lot of these lyrics in a Dream Theater album simply because I though that they were above all this. Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Metal Blade metal artists, I would expect this from because that's what they're known for. But Dream Theater? A lot of people call this \\"nu-metal\\" but it's not. It's progressive and in top form, however they sound more like a Metal Blade band than anything else. Angry at the world and blaming God and Religion for all of their problems. I'm not pushing any views here, I'm just dissappointed that Dream Theater took this uneducated, nihilistic route to express themselves. I thought that John Petrucci, being the legendary artist that he is, would never execute such a low blow to certain people's beliefs with his lyrics. Not only does he attack other people's religious beliefs, he uses quite a bit of foul language in almost every piece on this album. This is a totally different band from Metropolis Part II. Fans of traditional Dream Theater need to know that this is not traditional dream theater at all. It sounds like them, it looks like them, but the lyrics do no read like them. However, having said all of this, I still give this album five stars because it is musically briliant as are all Dream Theater albums, and it's obvious to me that they had worked very hard on this album's technical content. John P., I'm very dissappointed. If this is the route you've chosen, you can forget about me buying any more of your albums. I don't care how good your technique is, if you want to write lyrics like these I'm not going to listen to them. You are a man with legendary skill, but you waste it all on a pessimistic philosophy of life. I'm sure you won't read this, but in case you do, here are your five stars. You've earned them, as you always do, but rest assured that this is the last thing you'll ever get from me. Goodbye, John. It was nice knowing you, I guess.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Overall, I think this album is an improvement over Mer De Noms. Billy Howerdel's guitar work is better than ever, and Jeordie White's bass playing is superb. However, I think that Josh Freese is the real star of this album. The drumming on &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; is especially original. On both Mer De Noms and Thirteenth Step, the singer seems to be the weakest member of the group.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|If Britney take hours and hours of music lessons and learn what real music is about, maybe she can become a better singer. In my view she is using her looks too atract lost TEENS. So bad that singers like Britney and like Madonna (That one is old already) brain wash TEENS minds to buy their imature CDs. My sister bought this CD and now she don't know what to do with this. She told me that this CD is terrible. I have an advice for Britney: GROW UP!!!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have all 180 episodes recorded, I love this show. I believe he is my number one favorite comedian. I went to go see him last month and it was great. The full series must come out on dvd. I will pre order the minute it is final.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Every DT recording takes on it's own personality, and this one would be catagorized as explosive. This one ranks very high in DT's library in my mind. It reminds me a little of the sound they go with in the Liquid Tension projects. In the name of God is without a doubt one of their best songs ever. If your not amazed by their musical genius, read the lyrics for this song. One of many reasons they belong in a catagory all by themselves.
B0000CDL3W|4.0|T3 had to top two of the best action movies of all time.  On its own, T3 is more fun than most action flicks, but, hey, who hasn't seen T1 and T2??  Our expectations were very, very high, and T3 doesn't even come close.  Yet, if you just want to enjoy an action flick, with wry humor (95% of which you'll miss without knowing what went on in T1 and T2), have a blast.<br />Here are some of the flaws:<br />After an engaging, luring first five minutes, we are shown our two naked-I-came-from-the-womb backsides shots.  Honestly, the viewer sees two rears which haven't seen the treadmill in a while.  <br />The early scene of Arnold entering the bar to get clothes caught me off guard and did not offend the majority of the viewing public with male nudity on display.  The Elton John sunglasses cracked me up.  The problem is that this movie is about the end of the world.  While I laughed at the &quot;inside&quot; jokes which only us &quot;T&quot; junkies would pick up on, something seemed out of place with so much levity and so little plot building.<br />Next flaw - the crane chase scene was too long.  The smash/crash seemed token.  It added nothing to the plot.<br />Next flaw - Sarah Connor died of leukemia????  For real???  Can't we do better than that?  Unless that is setting us up for T4 wherein she really didn't die, then I think that was needlessly weak.  (I did note that her body was not in the coffin, and was allegedly creamated -- lie?)<br />Next flaw - Casting!  Why no Linda Hamilton? (divorces notwithstanding).  Why no Edward Furlong?  Don't we want to see how our &quot;hero&quot; overcame troubled childhood?  EF was truly a depressed &quot;youth&quot; who we have been rooting for since T2.  Shell out the bucks and make it work!!  Even the two detectives (&quot;yo'r momma&quot; and &quot;afgan&quot;) could have survived T2 to revisit us in T3.<br />Next flaw - violence to women.....  Yikes, sure she's a leather-wrapped, mean woman machine, but the scene of smashing her head into toilets makes me wonder where those politically correct police are when you need them.<br />Next flaw -  I was so excited to see Dr. Silberman appear, and allude that he's been in therapy since T2.  Cool.  Yet it fizzled needlessly into a cameo!  Hello director!!  Anybody in there?  Have you heard of sub-plots?  How about tying scenes together?  Fill in some holes, don't just tell us of stuff, then drop it.  Why didn't the hearse run into the good doctor on their far-fetched escape scene?  Carry him with us for a while.  Come on, he added so much life to T1 and T2.  <br />Next flaw - Maybe the script writer didn't think about T2, but was there no reason for T2 to leave a torn-off hand in the factory?  Remember?  Arnold left a hand behind which they all forgot about when he melted himself.  Wasn't that the intended &quot;flaw&quot; of T2, to allow SkyNet to still develop these machines?  T3 missed it.  <br />Small flaw - Arnold tells us that he doesn't remember John because he's really not the same machine as in T2.  But when he gets in the truck at the beginning of the movie, he flips down the visor and catches the dropping keys.  Thanks for the laugh (I liked it), but Mr. Director also created a flaw by doing so.<br />Next flaw - Mid-movie, Arnold tells us that he must obey John's future wife (Claire Danes).  Yet, prior to that she was screaming at him to let her out of the back of the truck.  Again, I laughed, but it was a script screw-up.<br />Non-flaw - Claire Danes kept this movie afloat.  She was so real to life in our 21st century.  Her lines developed her character and the plot each time she spoke.<br />Overall flaw is that the end-of-the-world long-awaited sequel to T1 and T2 had no business not taking itself seriously.   <br />I'll watch T3 again, and I'll buy it.  But, I'll be waiting for T4.  How about this title:  &quot;T4 Governor&quot;    Oh well, I think I'll go pop in T1 or T2 tonight.
B0000TB03W|5.0|What to buy for the shania fan who already has everything. A Chicago dvd of course. Shania is by far the best perfomer out there at least in the opinion of her fans. Shania captivates the audience with old hits and new songs. The pyro-techs are not to be missed. The editing could have and should have been better. It's still an enjoyable dvd though. If your a diehard shania fan you won't be disappointed.
B000002KMV|3.0|Not much background on this one. He did ease up on the sex with this one, but it's more or less \\"Dirty Mind 2\\".Starting off the album is the title track \\"Controversy\\". The title does make one wonder if it will be, indeed, controversial. Not really, though it IS the best one song on the album, nothing not to like here.Next is \\"Sexuality\\", basicly an anthem about freedom. Some interesting lyrics towards the end.Next is \\"Do Me, Baby\\", the slow jam of the album. It's okay, though the ending may induce cringing, laughing, or both.Next is \\"Private Joy\\", a very underrated tune. Nothing bad to say about this one.Now we're onto \\"Ronny Talk To Russia\\". A short little ditty about, well, not so sure what it's about, I'm not even sure if he was trying to be political or if it was tongue-in-cheek (I hope it's the latter).If you ignore the lyrics it's quite good.Next is the funky song of the album, \\"Let's Work\\". Though the 12\\" is miles above the album version, it's still the second best song of the album.Next is \\"Annie Christain\\", a song about the \\"evils\\" of the world. The spoken lyrics is what makes this song work.Next is the closer of the album, \\"Jack U Off\\", and I know what you're thinking; the answer is yes. Prince attempt at a rockabilly song, it's solid, nothing special, but enjoyable.\\"Controversy\\", the album, is pretty mediocre by Prince's standards. It's enjoyable, but don't expect any revelations with this one. As I've said earlier it's pretty much \\"Dirty Mind 2\\", proving my theory that sequels aren't always the best way to go............
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has come and preformed her best show yet with an excellent group of old and new songs for all to enjoy. The songs are fun and happy and ballots with love songs. They are the best she has done and she has done her old songs even better. You must see this DVD and when you do you will then have to have the DVD to watch over and over again. Take the time to watch and enjoy this DVD and then buy a couple extra copies for family and friends.
B000002KLP|4.0|Prince's third album, \\"Dirty Mind\\", was/is quite an album. It has great music and lyrics that leave little, very little to the imagination. and then there's the cover...... The album starts off with the title track, which is safe enough (lyricly), and has a killer synth line done by band member Dr. Fink (matt fink). Nothing outstanding, but not too shabby either.Next there's \\"when you were mine\\" (later covered by Cyndi Lauper), which is sheer pop perfection. Truly Prince at his best. Very reminicent of 60s pop, but still unique.\\"Do it all night\\" is up next. I think the title pretty much tells you what this song is about. Nothing too special about this one, the \\"dud\\" of this album.Now there's \\"gotta broken heart again\\", the ballad. Great vocal delivery.\\"Uptown\\" is next, one of Prince's first minor \\"hits\\".Great synth.Aw, here we go, now we're onto \\"head\\". And yes, i know what you're thinking----you're right. Very funky, sexually frank song. A song that would pave the way for quite possibly one of Prince's favorite subjects.Here he shares vocals with new band member Lisa coleman. Girl had guts.Now moving onto \\"sister\\". Seems safe enough, right? Well, nope, it 's not. Pretty far from it infact. It's a 1 minute and 33 second long song about incest. Enough said.The last song, \\"partyup\\" is an anti war song written by Morris Day. Day gave Prince permission to use the lyrics in exchange for a record deal.Somewhat rowdy and angry, this'll surely bring out you're inner punk.Great album, but don't play this if you have prudes or kids around.You've been warned.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a great dvd, get it for the holidays. shania twain sings all her hit songs and she interacts with teh audidence very well!!! my famiy enjoyed watching it very much.
B00008AWOD|5.0|a stunning accomplishment of soaring guitars, magical vocals and thunderous percussion...not to mention some nifty lyrics that delight in many ways.<br />Absorbing this album, then catching the band live, will prove one of the most enjoyable musical experiences of the year, if not the next ten!<br />This music can easily generate not simply delight but absolute obsession.
1563899426|3.0|Ok, the art is quite good and Willingham takes a sort of dumb idea: fairy tale characters taken to contemporary NY, into quite an interesting crew of people.  However, I really missed more character development.  Ok, there's conflict and relationships between them, but it all seemed so straightforward and simple!<br />Besides, Snow White appears like such an interesting character with her attitude and all, along with B. Wolf, but I really think that they've been treated with not enough respect.  I think they deserved more development, more texture and depth.<br />And the end of the story is kinda obvious.  Although if you take it as a sort of wink to classic detective novels such as Agatha Christie's, etc, it may acquire a better edge.  Though not enough.<br />I still liked the book, read it quickly and enjoyed it enough to get me the second part.  However, I don't see how this can compare to other Vertigo titles such as Sandman or Preacher, which are an absolutely different kind of literature, more mature and the kind that really makes you think and question things.  <br />And I REALLY don't see how this could ever be compared to Sandman... please...<br />Still, I want to see how the series develops, I have some faith in it.  Take a look at the covers for the second book: wow.
B000002HAF|5.0|a crazily brilliant effort. It's powerfully schizoid, manic and electrifying in the best possible ways. It's fun to see the evolution of Frank Black and the parallels between the early work and such majestic accomplishments as Black Letter Days.<br />Pure musical talent knows no bounds.
B000002J3W|5.0|With this album, Skid Row shed all of the pop side of their 1st two releases to become an unrelenting, furious metal band.  Gone are slickly stacked choruses and song-structures that relied on just one central riff per song.  Here instead the songs are varied and unpredictable and refreshingly original, without losing the signature sound of their previous two albums. <br />Rob Affuso is a revelation here, anchoring the songs with truly creative, muscular pounding.  And Bach sings with a reckless abandon that sounds freer and more spontaneous, partly because of the reduced emphasis on vocal harmonies with little vocal contributions from the rest of the band.  <br />Like many great albums, this one takes a few listens to get used to because of its sheer originality.  The tunes are still melodic and memorable and songs are filled with a number of varied riffs.  The only minor missteps are some lazy fade-out endings (Beat Yourself Blind) and one tuneless chorus (Frozen, which cannot be salvaged despite Bach's best efforts).  <br />The production is also rawer than previous efforts, although not a huge departure in terms of the band's overall sound.  Bob Rock, who slicked up the package on Metallica's post-80s efforts, kept a loose hand on this one and maintaned a good focus on the band sound with no outside musicians/instruments added.  <br />All in all, very consistent and rewarding album.  If you're a fun of melodic metal music (as opposed to rap and screamers) then this album is highly recommended.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|Far better in almost every way than the recent re-make.<br />With this one, there is superb acting, a great story and plenty of action to see you through - WITHOUT ALL THE STRATEGIC PRODUCT PLACEMENTS!<br />Remember the days when movies were about art and not commercials?<br />We could go into all the symbolism inherent in a film about heists that features product placements...
0316776963|5.0|What makes the work itself so intriguing is its affinity for authenticity.  His first essay details the ridiculous obsessions of his father with hiding and eating rotted food as if it were his life treasure.  In all of his essays, there remains something original or personal from the author's life and it is far from boring or long, but simply witty and astounding.<BR>  <BR> David Sedaris, the character, is the focus of the book - as he explains in great detail the most memorable episodes of his life, whether it is embarrassing, funny, absurd, or deeply personal.  It remains clear throughout the entire book Sedaris examines moments, events, and language as though he was a shrink.  A lot of writers fail due to their inability to recognize their own bias, but where other writers fail - Sedaris is successful.  He recognizes his personal bias in numerous stories, and surprisingly makes a mockery, or perhaps a joke, out of it.  Take for instance, his seemingly shrewd personal indictment of the ever-growing technological era of computers.  \\"I hate computers for any number of reasons, but I despise them most for what they've done to my friend the typewriter.  In a democratic country you'd think there would be room for both of them, but computers won't rest until I'm making my ribbons from torn shirts and brewing Wite-Out in my bathtub.  Their goal is to place the IBM Selectric II beside the feather quill and chisel in the museum of antiquated writing implements.  They're power hungry, and someone needs to stop them.\\"  The reason why David Sedaris, the character, works so well in the book is because of his flat-out honesty on any number of subjects and issues. He also has an extraordinary sense of self-awareness most do not possess, or at least are less than eager to broadcast it.  <BR> <BR>        He weaves in and out of his own personal life, writing about the misfortunate (and comical) habits of his sister, Amy, who has always took a liking to `fatty suits' and mind-games.  She has had a field day masterminding such stunts as disguising herself as a victim of physical abuse, masking her identity to flirt with her father, and stealing money from an unguarded till at a grocery story and then simply explaining that \\"she wasn't stealing, she was simply pretending to be a thief. `And thieves steal,' she said.  `So that's what I was doing.' It all made perfect sense to her.\\"  Amy appears in several of the essays, each time with an unusual story and same role.  <BR> <BR>        Comedic short-story essay books are generally at a great disadvantage because they lack what non-fiction books have to offer - which is an education.  They are at another disadvantage because they lack what fiction has to offer - a world filled with what the author desires, whether it is a representation of reality, fantasy, horror, or a mixture of everything in between.  Instead, David Sedaris has defied the expectations and proved that essays can be as equally effective and compelling as historical accounts of world or national events.<BR> <BR>        David Sedaris writes hilariously of being offered a position as a college professor: \\"The position was offered at the last minute, when the scheduled professor found a better-paying job delivering pizza.  ...In a voice reflecting doubt, fear, and an unmistakable desire to be loved, I sounded not like a thoughtful college professor but, rather, like a high-strung twelve-year old girl; someone named Brittany.  My first semester I had only nine students.  Hoping they might view me as professional and well prepared, I arrived bearing name tags fashioned in the shape of maple leaves.  I'd cut them myself out of orange construction paper and handed them out along with a box of straight pins.  My fourth-grade teacher had done the same thing, explaining that we were to take only one pin per person.  This being college rather than elementary school, I encouraged my students to take as many pins as they liked.  They wrote their names upon their leaves, fastened them to their breast pockets, and bellied up to the long oak table that served as our communal desk.\\"  He then talks about his empty brief case and fantasizes about a class full of enthusiastic students, struggling to maintain order while students simultaneously shouted to be heard.  This is only a small glimpse into Sedaris' larger insights and analysis of the human condition.<br />        Sedaris has managed to convert ordinary happenings from one's life to incredibly comical vignettes worth discussing.  His linguistic tongue most closely resembles a sharp and oddball Woody Allen for his clever ability to make situations funnier than they normally would be and his over-the-top affair with words.  In creating something more valuable than a simple comedic story-telling book, he has both educated and entertained us with his personal experiences and observations of the world.  Hats off to David Sedaris, whose contribution to the literary world make us all the more grateful for his endless campaign to keep us thinking, and reading.
B000089RVX|2.0|I bought this CD after hearing two of their songs on the radio. I was disappointed. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing, but the guitars and drums drown her out. Overall, this is a very mediocre CD. The only two songs that I like are &quot;My Immortal&quot; due to the theme of lost love and melancholy and &quot;Hello&quot; because I love the piano that's interlaced throughout the song. I don't know what lead singer Amy Lee sees in the rest of her band, but she'd be better off solo. I gave this CD two stars for the two songs I like.
B00000IPAX|5.0|im normally the type of person that will buy a cd, have 2 or 3 favorite tracks and then forget about the cd. when i first got enema of the state, i sat down and i listen to the entire thing, start to finish. i loved the entire album- a first for me!<BR>1. dumpweed: great song that will get you pumped up, it has a catchy melody and good guitar<BR>2. don't leave me: will get you dancing around, this is a great high energy song<BR>3. aliens exist: this is one of those songs where you know every word and have to sing along every time<BR>4. going away to college: this is my second-favorite song on the cd. the thing i love about it is its bittersweet but refreshingly honest lyrics: &quot;i havent been this scared in a long time, and i'm so unprepared so heres your valentine&quot; and &quot;this worlds an ugly place, but your so beautiful to me&quot;<BR>5. whats my age again: if you dont like this track for the song, you have to love the video- this is a catchy song, i love the guitar<BR>6. dysentary gary: great opening 2 lines! one of the &quot;noisier&quot; songs on the album but unlike other punk songs, the melody and lyrics arent lost within the loud music.<BR>7. adams song: this song instantly became my favorite song ever when i heard it the very first time and was almost brought to tears. a lot of people can really relate to it: &quot;...to pass the time in my room alone&quot; and its sad lyrics. its the only &quot;slow&quot; song on the album, put picks up the pace toward the end. blink tackles the difficult subject of suicide in a beautiful song that really hit home with me. people underestimate the depth of punk bands, but blink 182 reveals a different side of themselves.<BR>8. all the small things: if there was one sellout song on the album, this is it. not that its a bad song or anything, i absolutely LOVE the video, its hilarious. blink mocks the extreme overload of teenyboppers out there and everything they suggest about them is so true! this is a really catchy song, and one that most people think of when they hear &quot;blink 182&quot;<BR>9. the party song- i think this song is sooo funny just to hear about how guys think about girls and parties, etc. this is a light, fun song. its title describes it perfectly<BR>10. mutt: i love the drumming in this song, its lyrics contrast the guy and the girl in a relationship: &quot;shes open waiting for more...and i know he's only looking to score&quot; <BR>11. wendy clear: talks about the difficulties of girls, i love the rift in the middle<BR>12. the anthem: i personally like this song because i can relate to a lot of its lyrics about parents, great song<br />bottom line: blink's combination of great guitars, drum, vocals ( i absolutely am in love with both toms voice and marks deeper one) and *gasp* sometimes deep lyrics, enema of the state is a definite breakthrough album-- buy it!!!
B0000AUHQT|5.0|How anyone can possibly say The Great Gatsby has no relevance to modern sensibilities only indicates the lack of emotional depth in the reviewer (see below)! There is a lot more to the book (but not necessarily the film) than flashy flappers dancing the Charleston, although it does make a perfect setting. The story is about hollow, careless people. The main flawed character in the novel and film is Daisy, but because she is so beautiful, Gatsby cannot see the ugliness behind her facade. He loves her, but like another reviewer said, she didn't care. Daisy didn't really care about anything.<br />So what is the relevance of The Great Gatsby today? The story is so full of meaning that one review could not hold it all. Only the book can, and to some extent the very good film. What angers me is audiences today only see the superficial qualities of the story (wow! It's about flappers) and dismiss the message (or can't comprehend it). It is not a book that provides answers, but it does illuminate more brilliantly than anything else the nature of those careless people who never love anyone except themselves. Who hasn't run into a few of these people in their life? Never fall in love with a Daisy.<br />As for the film; brilliant Nelson Riddle score, cinematography, costumes, casting (Karen Black as Myrtle and Mia Farrow as Daisy - absolutely brilliant choices!), and a faithful screenplay.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera is the greatest band of all time. Phillip Anselmo is the greatest vocalist of all time. Dimebag Darrell is the greatest guitar player of all time. Rex is the greatest bass player of all time. Vinnie Paul is the greatest drummer of all time... and now for my completely unbiased review:<br />Cowboys From Hell is the greatest album of all time! <br />Track 1: Cowboys From Hell - Perfection.<BR>Track 2: Primal Concrete Sledge - Perfection.<BR>Track 3: Psycho Holiday - Perfection. <BR>Track 4: Heresy - Perfection... listen to that guitar solo!<BR>Track 5: Cemetery Gates - Perfection... arguably the best song on                           the entire album.<BR>Track 6: Domination - Perfection... the entirely instrumental                          second half of this song is unbelievable.<BR>Track 7: Shattered - Perfection... amazing vocal-work.<BR>Track 8: Clash With Reality - Perfection.<BR>Track 9: Medicine Man - Perfection.<BR>Track 10: Message In Blood - Perfection.<BR>Track 11: The Sleep - Perfection.<BR>Track 12: The Art Of Shredding - Perfection.<br />Anybody who tells you that Far Beyond Driven is better than this album is out of their mind. Far Beyond Driven is where Pantera began to lose their touch (though they still ruled in a big way and are better than any other band). Vulgar Display of Power rocks big time, and is almost as good as Cowboys From Hell.
B000092Q4U|5.0|hehe, im proud to say i was the first and only person (among girls as well as guys) to wear lamb of god merchandise in my high school. now think of it people, if i was proud enough to show off their name to the world, dont you think u should go buy all of their albums?????<br />the album is in your face and loud, really loud. if you're a metal fan, i recommend you buy this album. its amazing. their first album was great, but this is just a double wow.
0792839730|5.0|The cast of this movie reads as a who's who of great actors.  I loved the movie, which details a not-so-well-known operation that could very well have ended the war 6-9 months before it actually did.
B000002HJR|5.0|who doesn't love down??? who doesn't love phil?????? i order u to buy this album or die :P
B0000CDNYM|5.0|It is a wonderful movie for the entire family and is you speak spanish you will laugh tons with the spanish version!!! Highly recommended
B000089RVX|4.0|so i hear this album is placed under the gothic genre (must be amy lee's sense of style, hehe).  well the first thing that kame to MY mind when i first heard their music was \\"modern goth\\".  now when u really think about this, it makes no sense, and i guess it shouldnt because Amy Lee herself states that she does not believe her music is gothic at all (TOTP interview). well lets just leave it at that ok people. stop the whole \\"i like evanescence so i guess i must be goth\\" crap. goth isn't just the music, it's a culture of its own as well.<br />anyhow, its a great debut album, i give them props for playing hints of genres that are not really in the mainstream nowdays. now, im not trying to steer anyone away from buying this album, because i have to admit, it is catchy to the common ear. amy lee's melodic voice and ben moody's guitar makes a good pair. now the whole rapping thing in \\"bring me to life\\"..i'll never understand why they chose to do that. evanescence has other great songs as well that are not on this album. songs like \\"even in death\\" and \\"lies\\" are really different from the songs on fallen.  so who am i to hold you back from listening to what you want, give the album a try, its not that bad
B0000DJZA5|4.0|They should have added more tracks to this cd release. With the enormous amount of sessions recorded for this album, I think the producers should have included more tracks. Having said that, I won't buy the cd because I am still disgusted at the RIAA for suing little girls, and the copyprotected design of the cds. Why bother?
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is another of the movies which marked the triumphant return of Disney to center stage.  Remember, that after Walt Disney's death, Disney as a company kind of sank into oblivion and did nothing remarkable.  After 1989's excellent The Little Mermaid, Disney continued its return in a big way with The Lion King.<br />This is the story of Simba, (Jonathon Taylor Thomas as a youth, Matthew Broderick as an adult) a young cub, who &quot;just can't wait to be king&quot;.  He has a powerful father, the king Mufasa (a booming James Earl Jones) and an uncle, the conniving and evil Scar (the devilish Jeremy Irons) who wants the throne that Simba will one day inherit.  Scar schemes up a way to kill Mufasa and dispose of Simba permenently, or so he thinks.  Simba ends up banished from the Pridelands, where he takes on the newfound attitude of Hakuna Matata(no worries).  This is the saying of Timon and Pumba, two new friends.  Eventually, Simba must deal with his past, which he finds very difficult.<br />There are two reasons why I consider this to be the best Disney film.  For one, the animation is absolutely superb.  From the opening &quot;Circle of Life&quot; sequence, showing all the animals in the Pridelands gathering to celebrate the birth of Simba, to the final battle between Scar and Simba, the attention to detail and vivid color is breathtaking.  Especially on this new DVD edition, this movie is a sight to see.  The second reason I love this as the best Disney film is the villain, Scar.  Unlike most other Disney villains, who are almost a joke (Ursula, Malevecent, Gaston, the evil stepmother), Scar is truly evil and he is a scary character.  Jeremy Irons was the perfect choice for the voice.<br />For that reason, I would recommend you keep this movie away from the very young.  This is an adult cartoon.  There is much violence and adult material.  A father dies, an uncle tries to kill his young nephew several times, and the evil elephant graveyard has an ominous appearance.  Very small children would struggle with this film, so keep that in mind.<br />In all, the story, animation, characters, voices, and appearance make this DVD a must own.  The extended feature is somwhat overrated- the song &quot;Morning Report&quot; is unnecessary and a waste of time.  The second disc features several making of tours and some games that would be fun to play with children.  I recommend making this film a part of your collection.
B0000BWVCM|1.0|I had high expectations as I quite enjoyed the first X-men, but upon seeing this movie I wished my television would implode on itself so i wouldnt have to see this crap anymore<br />I Hate This movie.  I hate it with a passion.  1 star out of 5, i have not seen something this bad in a long time.
6305972591|5.0|This was made in the 80's people! Of couse it might suck! But this film really wasn't scary, a good try to make it scary but it wasnt. The begining of the film takes you to three minutes of gore and violence, but thats all the gore you will see in the film, not counting a stabbing issue. THe film is a bit better then the short story itself, but then what else is new? Sure, you get a boring plot that wished it needed more violence since its a horror film, but this film is great the way it is. In my opinion its a great film, but dont expect a lot. IT was made in the 80's, not of this century. Watch if you are a SK Fan or a COTC fan. Either way is great. Trust me, you'll like it if you like the friendly version of horror.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As one of the lucky 5000 audience members who attended the event captured on this DVD, I can assure you it's the next best thing to having been there.  It takes five thousand of us to fill the Albert Hall.  Now we know.  Tremendous sound quality (make sure your system is up to snuff) and images to match.  The emotion comes through and even McCartney's minimal contribution is welcomed -- he couldn't have really done less.  His snide crack at Clapton was thankfully edited out.  <br />Anoushka Shankar (Nora Jones' half sister) is like an Indian goddess descended on Earth to play sitar for us mere mortals.  Sort of makes you wonder whether there IS such a thing as musical genes.  Ravi, you dog !<br />One might have hoped for a few more pictures of George in the photos bonus , but there are plenty of THOSE floating around.  Also, not one single camera angle of Sir George Martin who was watching enraptured from the royal box -- very moving.  <br />And if you really want the feel of what it was like to be there, burn some incense.  The place was full of it.  Enjoy !
B000002UDB|5.0|One of the greatest bands of all time. Not their best cd, but definitly worth adding to anyone's collection.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Although I am partial to Sarah's past cds more, I think this cd reflects her changing life and maturity. Her angelic, melodic voice is definitely back on this cd, it wasn't as good as what she has done in the past.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I think too many people are acting like mindless lemings nad giving this album 5 stars. There are also too many people saying it is horrible.  In my opinion, it is an incredibly ambitious album, but is just much too unpleasant to listen too. There is more sonic experimentation AND rocking, but the problem is that Radiohead has completely lost their soul. It is very intelligent and they definitely put lots of work into it, but all of the abstraction leaves me ice cold and with the feeling that my brain will explode. The problem is that, as with OK Computer, Radiohead is using almost exclusively their brains, and ignoring their most overlooked assets: their souls and emotions.
B000089RVR|4.0|For a pretty girl, with this angelic voice, who only wanted initially to make music that she could listen to in her car....she has done amazingly well with this cd.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|Alicia Keys has only one hit....her first single.  The rest of the cd is garbage.  Her first cd was much better, in my opinion.  I am not even a fan of A.

I hate I wasted my money!

6302413931|5.0|Strangely enough this film is not about the Vietnam War itself, in spite of what it may seem, in spite of the decor. It is about man confronted to war. On one side you have Captain Willard (willing to do what he is ordered to do) of the special forces in Vietnam. He only lives through the actions and missions he gets involved in. When out of action he plainly gets crazy. When in action he is as cool as a cat and then no obstacle can stop him : he is ready to do anything, including killing innocent people, to reach his target, to fulfill his mission. Even his life does not count anymore except that it is necessary to retain it to reach the goal, which makes him prudent. This man becomes a simple thinking machine that does not consider any element that may stand across his road, except as an obstacle to be removed. He uses his intellect to solve his problem, but ethics are beyond him and he even agrees with Colonel Kurtz and yet he fulfills his mission and terminates him. In other words this man is so faithful to the mission he has received that his ethics are suspended, his intellectual positions are pushed aside. Ethics and agreement or disagreement have been entirely delegated to and deposited in his higher-ups. He works on a delegation of perspective. But the real lesson about human nature in war comes with Colonel Kurtz. He did not delegate his ethics or his intellectual powers. He is a pragmatist and he looked at a situation, analyzed it, came to conclusions and implemented the measures that these conclusions entailed without any consideration of wrong or right, good or evil. His only law was to be effective in the war he was in. All means are then made acceptable, even if not palatable, by the concrete effectiveness of them. It is a regression, caused by war of course. War pulls people down and brings them back to some ancient view that says survival and the destruction of enemies are the only goals to be taken into account, once the enemies have been clearly determined. Man in such a situation does not question the goal, the means or the results. He can only make sure the results go the way imposed by the goal. So he comes to the idea that to win a war is to utterly destroy the enemy : drop the Bomb and kill them all. Death then becomes a decor in wartime and to kill becomes a daily tool in this situation. A warrior in such a war becomes a poet of death : he has to invent new ways of killing, as cruel as possible in order to create fear, the only way to impress the enemy and bring them down, though the only road to victory is to annihilate that enemy. The only thing that this Colonel Kurtz, his shortness in a way that his name implies, is that what will come out of such a method is not peace, is not an integratable country, but a pocket of unmanagable dictatorship based on the law of blood, of shedding blood, of feeding blood to the minds of the victors and to the land of the territory. And this regression will not know any end. It will have to go on forever. On the other side, the other method is not better because in such a war, a war of liberation (and both sides are using the word), it is the side that will be crueller that will win. Hence the Americans are defeated both ways : either creating a no man's land of cruelty or being defeated by a higher level of cruelty. That is what a war of that type, what any war produces in any circumstances and conditions. Human nature is a fragile fabric that can be brought back to ancient barbaric stages easily because humanity retains, collectively and individually, all the phases of its history in its present development, ethics, behaviors and actions. It takes nearly nothing to bring back the barbarian to the surface and the only way to retain some sanity is to delegate ethical questions to a higher level and to implement orders without even questioning them. To be a soldier is to be a slave, and like all slaves, soldiers who have initiative will be put to death because they goagainst the will of their masters. As Jim Morrison sings at the beginning : « All the children are insane ».<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUagainst the will of their masters. As Jim Morrison sings at the beginning : « All the children are insane ».<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B0000DJZA5|1.0|&gt; First, I would like to respond to Roger Lamb's review by saying that even though &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; was available on the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; album, that album was a BOOTLEG! Therefore it doesn't count.<br />Do you also believe that the holocaust never occurred? That Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldren never walked on the moon? The &quot;Hey, Jude&quot; album WAS NOT A BOOTLEG! It was available in reputable stores across the nation--national chains. It was marketed more vigorously than &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (on the heels of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;'s great commercial success, of course)! Anyone older than ten when it was released can't possibly have missed it. If you were a baby or unborn when the Beatles existed, then please don't presume to lecture us about Beatle history, thank you very much.<br />Anyway, I think this remark aptly demonstrates the efficacy of historical revisionism. No doubt some time after the original &quot;Let it Be&quot; is withdrawn, those not old enough to remember it will claim it never existed or that it was itself a bootleg. (Think of all the Beatle books published after John Lennon's murder vetted by Paul McCartney that incorporate McCartney's revised version of events and how many young Beatles fans believe them.)
0553573403|5.0|Love this series.  Can't wait for the fourth to come out in april 2004.  Reminds me of the books of the Fey series of Kathyrn Rusch
B0000DJZA5|5.0|What a bunch of crockodile tears from a bunch of longtime Beatle fans.(Some reviewers have even given this one star only because they can't download for free,never mind they never heard the music at all). Five of the Beatles best songs are on this album,just like they were on the 1970 version, Get Back,no 1 for 5 weeks,Let it be,no 1 for 2 weeks.Long and winding road,no 1 for 2 weeks, Across the universe,and Two of us,plus a bunch of good songs which any recording artist today would love to take credit for. Yes,the versions are different(duh,thats the whole idea behind this).Great in 1970,great today...sincerly,A REAL BEATLE FAN!!!
0385504209|5.0|Wonderful book. Was recommended to me by umpteen people.<br />WOrth all the praise.
B0000067X1|5.0|Hailing from Germany in the late 60's early to mid 70's, Can is one of the most best kept secrets of influential alternative music----combining the cosmic progressive rock complexity of King Crimson and PInk Floyd, the nightmarish freeform noise and unorthodox jazz stylings of Sun Ra, the punkish electricity of THe Velvet Underground, the wild out of control funkiness of early Santana, and the intriguing production values of Joe Meek, Can was truly an important and energetic part of psychadelic music in the 20th century. THe influence of this album can be heard everywhere from Sonic Youth (&quot;Mushroom&quot; and &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; as well as elements of the excellent head tripping noise peices &quot;Aumngh&quot; and &quot;Peking O&quot;) to Radiohead (&quot;Paperhouse&quot;, &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; once again) to The Birthday Party (Damo Suzuki's insane vocal delivery, crossed with the equally intense music, sometimes bears similarities) to Mars Volta (mixture of Crimson-exque prog rock with more aggressive punk elements and funky Latin influences) to Japanese noise-rockers THe Boredoms (listen to where it all goes mad on &quot;Peking O&quot;) to Stereolab (no distinct similarities, but there are a few reference points), and the countless bands that those bands inspired. As said before, Damo Suzuki is an intense vocalist---at times his wild ranting comes off as Mick Jagger mixed with Birthday Party-era Nick Cave and Mr.Bungle madman Mike Patton, while at others his soft delivery is closer to Thom Yorke. Actually, his vocals are alot like Yorke's, with the some virtually indiscernable somewhat mumbled appearance. Each song is it's own little adventure easily discernable from the last, and all are epics that find time to extend each song to it's spaced-out, wormhole-inducing, mind-expanding best---isn't that wha a psychadelic masterpeice should do? My favorite tracks are the super-funky and freaked out &quot;Halleluwah&quot; and the noise trips &quot;Aumgn&quot; and &quot;Peking O&quot;. Get this if you like good music and better trips.........
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has come out with this DVD and there is nothing better than this DVD for fun, music and singing. She has put all of herself into this DVD and she sounds better than she ever has. With a clear soomth beautiful voice she puts up her old and new songs. With a beauty few women have she graces the stage to sing to and to enjoy the time with the fans.
B000003Z6I|4.0|The use of ambience and noises as essential elements are emphasized than on any other album, and the more rock-like songs continue the thrashing crashing colliding work of THe Birthday Party, while Cave's ventures into Americana and Delta Blues and balladry start to make their appearance as well. The result is a very atmospheric album that can't really be explained in any normal terms other than incredibaly scary, supernatural music that stands up to other works by post-punk bands that were popping around the same time---Sonic Youth's &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and THe Swans &quot;Children Of God...&quot;. &quot;Saint Huck&quot;, &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;, and the title track are long, thought-out aggressive masterpeices, but my personal favorite is the so spooky it hurts &quot;Box For Black Paul&quot;. A frieghtening listen from beginning to end.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has cut DVD that is up on top of the list. It is one that ya'll can live it up to. You want to get down and jam or you want to hold your loved one close or the one you want to love close. This DVD has it all for those who want to live it up or just slow it down. Shania Up Live in Chicago is a dancers and lovers DVD.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|The Beatles are really getting old and boring.  They are a good band, but come on, how many times can you hear the same songs, over and over and over again.  Its time to move on people.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was sitting around bemoaning the lack of &quot;newness&quot; in much of today's music, not creativity as such but a new feel/approach to music.  I was also pleased I grew up in the 70s where there was much to enjoy in music.<br />Then I caught Evanescence at the Am. Music awards. <br />My hope for today's youth and music is restored.  Bought the CD the next day and listened to it 4 times.  Can't remember the last time I did that. Bought tickets to their concert the day after and I don't care if we're twice the age of every one else there! :-)
B00005JKLZ|2.0|HG Wells' short novel gives a filmmaker the perfect set-up for a smart science fiction movie. The plot is very thin, allowing the filmmaker to add all kinds of details and characters. But the visual potential is great, something a good director can really sink his teeth into. Unfortunately, Simon Wells blew it. He added  characters and plot details, but none of them are compelling. The main character, played by Guy Pearce, is a romantic. He finds the love of his life and loses her, more than once (and more than one woman as well). This romance feels all wrong, like the love story tacked on to so many recent special-effect-heavy films (Gangs of New York, Attack of the Clones, etc.).<br />The visual aspect is good in small parts, but most of the movie looks silly or boring. The urban landscapes (New York in the future and London in the past) are beautifully-built. The laboratory and the time machine itself look good, too. But soon enough, the story moves to a rainforest that looks exactly as you would imagine it. There are no surprises and no creativity. The Morlocks have very little thought put into them, as well. They look like dust-covered Uruk-hai.<br />You know the story is too complex when you need *two* extraneous characters to explain everything (Orlando Jones and Jeremy Irons). The explanations don't help, anyway. Although the plot is simple on paper, on the screen it becomes needlessly complex. This is an inept, confusing, ugly movie. Guy Pearce can carry the film (he's enjoyable to watch), but that's not enough. It's too bad. In better hands, this could have been one of the all-time great science fiction films.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I'm hoping I get this set for the holidays.  I originally questioned Fox's decision to show the episodes out of order, but after being hooked in AND THEN seeing the pilot (slow) I understood why.  <br />Joss did a terrific job of melding old-time western and futuristic high-tech into a believable sci-fi world where it can all exist at the same time.  I've never seen it done so smoothly before.  Always:  great theme song, interesting characters, great plot development (why, Fox, why did you cancel?  Did you not know about the plot development?) He's not just a horror-geek--this man is a huge talent.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown lacks all of those qualities that set the greatest authors of novels (both contemporary and classical) apart from writers in general. However, he may just contain those qualties that are conspicuous in the writers of prime time television shows, and action movies. The novel does entertain, and also contains some interesting historical facts, but the writing style, or lack of it, is what leaves me with a negative impression.  I did give it three stars because I think Brown created exactly what he wanted in this novel.  What we are left with is a very marketable book, with few memorable qualities... similar to much of our pop culture. But if you can understand what I mean when I say that Scarface was a better movie and Coetzee's \\"Disgrace\\" was a better book, you might also understand why the DaVinci code is really not worth the time.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|You don't listen to Britney to discover the meaning of life. You don't listen to Britney to be amazed by the new and unique way she and her band make use of music. You don't listen to Britney for deep lyrics, emotional kinship, or to uncover hidden truths about yourself. You listen to Britney because she's fun, she's clever, and she's incredibly sexy. If you can remember all of that, then you will understand what a success this album is. <br />Despite my opening comments, I believe Britney has the makings of more, if she were only allowed. There are more places that this shines through on this album than on any of her previous releases, which is as frustratingly tantalizing as some of the clothing she wears. I don't think it's her fault, though, so I don't judge her for it. Record companies exude an enormous amount of control over money-making artists.<br />Judge the CD for what it is: sexiness and fun. She's at the top of her form, and she continues to better herself despite the limitations placed on her.
B00013F35I|3.0|A Bruce Springsteen concert is akin to a religious experience a sort of rock and roll baptism. Recorded live in Barcelona two months into the tour to support The Rising the Boss shows what he can do and why fans continue to believe.<br />This show is pure rock and roll energy. The show is made up of equal parts old and new music. There are powerful renditions of classics live Born in the USA, Badlands, Ramrod and others. Thre are quiet reflective moments including Spirits in the Night and Incident on 57th Street. There are new songs soon to be classics like The Rising.<br />The band was in peak form the night that this show was recorded.They were a cohesive whole. This was the E Street Band of the past but with a unique sense of the present. They played loud and agressively.<br />The discs are  not without problems. It seems that Sony does not do its usual best for some reason when they present Springsteen. There are comments about the special features not working on disc two. The sound abruptly shifted from Dolby 5.1 to PCM 4.8 for the encores making the end of the show sound like it was recorded in a tunnel.<br />Another comment thats going around is that the mix is muddy. I don't see this as a problem. E Steet has always been abouit power not finesse. All in all a worthwhile view but Sony really needs to do a better job with its presentation.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I just got the Rosle garlic press a few weeks ago and I love it.  It's easy to use and easy to clean.  It has a nice weight to it.  It feels like a tool that will last many years.  I had obsessively read all the customer reviews on Amazon for various garlic presses and I decided to spend the extra cash on this model.  Completely worth it.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Actually, it's about ironic personalities and expecting the unexpected. It's also about whether two people in a marriage can ever truly trust each other. <br />In the scene with Domino as a hooker that lures Dr. Harford to her apartment, one does not ever buy that she is a prostitute. She's way too sweet and doesn't even want Harford's money when he offers it even without her services. The white bread college kids as homophobic tough guys is completely incongruous. And Milich casually offering his daughter's services is surreal and disturbing. Expect the unexpected. <br />The characters are typical Kubrick and are three dimensional and real. The casting was brilliant as was the acting. And the irony's so thick you can cut it with a knife. <br />Dr. and Mrs. Harford's marital insecurities strike a raw nerve. I think we've all been there. And it's all the more painful to watch because the characters are brutally honest in expressing their considerations of infidelity toward the other. But it's entirely enthralling. <br />This is a great Kubrick film. It does him justice as his last.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|To put it simply, the sophomore album of Alicia Keys is worth looking at.Even if you don't like the R&amp;B style of music, it's still a worthy addition to anyone's collection.Keys shows her maturity growth on this album, both lyrically and musically.From the hip-hop but upbeat feel of &quot;Karma&quot; to the old-school feel of &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, she tries many new musical styles on this album.Of course, she still uses her piano in every song, but that was never a bad thing to begin with.Song highlights on the album include &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Heartburn&quot;, &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, and &quot;So Simple&quot;.The other songs are still magnificent by any means, but these songs are just the ones I enjoy listening to most on the album.The bonus DVD is wonderful, too.It proves to anyone that this artist can really sing (and that she doesn't stage her performances, unlike other artists).The album is truly worth picking up, and I can't recommend it enough.

B0000DD7NL|2.0|I would have to agree with the reviewer from Alabama when she says the album is garbage, Alicia Please, it's has been about 2 years and this is all you can come up with, maybe you should<br />have had some features to get your album status up. Okay I can admit that she is a sexy female and that can sell you some records, but put out something that the people like instead of what you like, cause I am not feeling the cd, I wasted my money, and could have saved it to buy Beyonce's cd again, the new Musiq, Anthony Hamilton and Carl Thomas. The only SONG, yes song, other than You Don't Know My Name that is good on the cd is Diary and the Feeling you/Feeling Me Interlude and you were better off making that a song.  Look she is 23 I believe and you making music for ages 40 and up. So sad, maybe you could have post-poned you release date another year to work on this sad record, cause the only reason your selling is because of your looks and the only good single. Like the video by the way. This Cd is not good, don't waste your money, just by the single or record it off the radio and keep playing it over and over.<br />By the way if you can, go pick up that T.I.'s Trap Muzik & I'm Serious, He is on his way to the top, couple of years, he is going to be compared to Jay-Z, if he isn't already. Keep It Pimpin' T.I.P, Shouts out to P.S.C, Big Kountry K.P.,C-Rod, K.T.,JR,D.P.,J.G.,YoungBloodz, Free Pimp-C. Keep Doin'It For Texas Bun Bizzy.
B000056C6U|5.0|All Mod Cons is a quintessentially mod album. For Jam fans, it was quite a departure from In The City and The Modern World. Weller's superb song writing shines with this album. Having been a fan of Weller/Jam for 20 years, for me, it is the best album that they made and is a worthwhile addition to the collection of any fan of not only The Jam, but The Kinks/Who/or Beatles.
0679428895|2.0|Let me start out by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this book.  I have never read Harris before but have an interest in history/thriller/mystery idea.  Needless to say I was excited about reading the book.  In the end I was pretty disappointed.<br />Pompeii chronicles the four days leading up to and including the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.  While this backdrop is intriguing, I have to agree that the time limitations made the character development non-existent, the plot underdeveloped, etc.  Marcus Attilius, aqueduct engineer from Rome stumbles across love, conspiracy, and heroism all within 96 hours.  There are some interesting storylines here including the rebellion of young Corelia and the subsequent relationship with Attilius, the water conspiracy in Pompeii, the disappearance of Exomnius, etc.  Nevertheless none of these storylines are grossly developed and in the end I felt that I really didn't care what happened to anyone.<br />The novel is at times hard to read and the character names hard to pronounce.  All in all I was fairly disappointed and glad that the book was a mere 300 pages.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Cannot add anything significant to the plethora of superlatives already used to describe the DVD box set, it IS truly incredible and a must own for any film geek.<br />However, I'd like to stress out the fact that I wasn't familiar with Alien Resurrection. Not being a masochist, I stayed away from this one after the DISASTROUS \\"Alien small 3\\", and by the truckload of negative reviews, having lost hope for this franchise.<br />HOWEVER, this set gave me the chance to experience it, and it is brilliant. <br />I think most of you were put off by the strong change in tone compared to the excellent first two.  In my opinion, there would be no use in adding a Cameronish of Scottish clone. Storywise, any new encounters between Ripley and the creature must be over-the-top because it is highly illogical. Maybe a flashback film on the creatures themselves and how they ended up crashing on that planet would be interesting, but without  Weaver's character.<br />So I really think you need to give the material a fresh directorial spin to make it worthwile.<br />Fincher's flawed film at least tried, but it just didn't tied together well, and I personnaly hated the pseudo-inmate-british despair-genX-nineties bull**** of it. Come on, it's a monster movie. <br />It is nicely shot, and I applaud Fincher for coming out of it alive. But the Alien 3 script ruins it all. I seem to be alone in the following opinion, but after seeing the section on disc 6, I hope that more of you will realize that Vincent Ward's agressively stupid original story of amish medieval hard-on monks living on a wood planet (on which this film is unfortunately loosely based) should have been without question shredded and flushed down the toilet. <br />In contrast, Jeunet's satirical mix of (sometimes hilarious) black humour and comicbook approach makes for an interesting addition to the series. It's almost Monty Python's Alien, which is a good thing. Watch for Dan Hedaya opening doors with his breath, or the greatBrad Dourif teasing the creature through a window, or an insane alien babyboy with humane face(looking straight out from one of Peter Jackson's early gems) licking mommy in the face with its penile tongue. Inspired stuff. It even has a cool underwater chase sequence.<br />Weaver is, as always, great. Winona Ryder is cute as a goodwilled robot in a pirate crew.  Cinematography is awesome and set design is top-notch.<br />So what is there to complain? It's not Ridley Scott's Alien? Of course not. It didn't even try to be that.<br />I admit that the cloning premise is far-fetched, as if a DNA sample from my blood would include information about the spaghetti I ate or the socks I'm wearing. But it's in good fun. And what else would you do to resurrect the main participants?  Fincher should not have killed them in the first place.

B0000DJZA5|1.0|I have been a big fan of the Beatles for 30 years, I cut my teeth on the &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; albums.  That being said, I was skeptical when I first heard about this album.  My wife went out and bought it and I'm very dissapointed, in fact, I told her to return it (which of course, you can't do!).  There is only one version of the title cut that is worth listening to and that is on the original version of LIB.  It has the amazing George guitar solo.  All of the other mixes (including the Naked version) have this wimpy organ instrumental which I can't believe anyone in the Beatle camp would want to be a finished product.  Get Back is a dissapointement, if we can't hear a rooftop version, at least give us a studio version with Ringo's 1.5 second drum solo at the end, a truly wonderful Ringo moment.  I've never liked &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; in any version (except for the &quot;Wings Over America&quot; version) and this one doesn't do much to sway me.  I thought the fly on the wall disc would be interesting but the Beatle anthologies had already been there and these snippets don't give listeners anything new to hear.  Couple of things I'd like to comment on; there is an 8 minute version of &quot;Dig It&quot; out there which is not much different than the :30 second version on the original LIB but it is interesting listening, why wasn't this included on Naked?  Same thing for the rumor of John singing lead on Get Back, why isn't this included on here.  A major dissapointment for what could have been an interesting collection although I don't think this album needed to be in the first place
B000084T18|2.0|this album was good, containing  several good songs, this cd is still in my player, i recommend it
B000000LZV|5.0|The minutemen were certainly an anomaly in the 80s punk scene.  While the majority of their peers were concerned with simple three-chord thrash and dedicated themselves to fulfilling a plangent sound that rendered the most of them indiscernible from one another, the Minutemen were incredibly individualistic.  They divagated from the tonsured standard that others had been rapt in; they coalesced an authoritative adeptness of their instruments with the caustic wit of their lyrics to become one of the seminal punk bands of the era.  While somewhat an aberration from usual punk music (especially that of the 80s), they exemplified the viscid attitude of the music.  Mike Watt's bass playing and D.Boon's sing-speak vocals, combined with a rapidly acute percussion section, became the core of the Minutemen.  Always entertaining, occasionally intelligent, amazingly funny, but never didactic (as was the tendency of most bands back then), the Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime is one of the greatest punk records of the decade.  Their assiduously self-assertive legacy confidently places them in the echelons of such contemporaries as Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Minor Threat, Fear, and the Dead Kennedys.  A must for any 80s punk fan.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|35 minutes of second rate music, flawed by numerous synthetic music-overs. containing 1 good song. i'll pass. maybe i'll wait another 6 years.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keyes has done it again!  This CD is off tha hook!  This CD is full of so much emotion and feeling.  The music and lyrics are absolutely amazing!  I'm sorry.....anyone who doesn't like this CD truly does not know what real music is!  How can anyone deny the talent of this young women?  Oh well....my favorite tracks are <br />Karma, Heartburn (Miss Keyes and Timberland got down on this <BR>song.....it's real funkadelic!), If I were your women, You don't know my name, If I ain't got you, Diary, Wake Up, So Simple, When you really love someone, Feeling U, Feeling Me (Interlude), and Slow Down!<br />This should tell you alot!!  Here's a piece of advice....If you want some &quot;REAL&quot; music, GO GET THIS CD!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|There really is nobody in mainstream American cinema to touch the Coen Brothers. Young aspiring screenwriters must look at most big Hollywood movies and think, Oh gee, I could write better than that so easily. Then they must look at what the Coens write and think, Oh gee, I could never write like that. As screen writers, the C. Bros are giants in a race of pygmies.<br />At the heart of their work are three of the finest films ever made in the United States, made consecutively, \\"Fargo\\", \\"The Big Lebowski\\" and this. One of the glorious things about these three films is how different they are. \\"Fargo\\" is a police procedural and morality tale set in the snowbound backwater of Minnesota, \\"Big Lebowski\\" a glorious send up of film noir set in the asinine wilderness of Los Angeles. \\"Oh Brother\\" is a musical epic, an enchantment, set in Depression era Mississippi. If the idea here is to signal which movies are not simply worth seeing but specifically worth buying, where a movie worth buying is a movie that will delight not just on a single viewing but repeatedly, on viewing it again and again, all these three movies are eminently worth singling out. I've seen them all several times now and they just get better.  Many movies get to be classics because of just one or two scenes that have some peculiar magic. This movie is composed almost entirely of such scenes. <br />In essence it's a comedy and seems to spring from an almost infinite well of comic invention. Here we get George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talking \\"Odysseus\\" character with his loquacity and vanity, John Goodman as Big Dan Teague, the one-eyed \\"Cyclops\\" (with an neat pun on that word's murky second life as a term for a KKK officeholder) bible salesman and thief, Michael Badalucco as George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson the manic depressive cow-hating bank robber, Stephen Root as the strangely manic blind recording engineer and radio station manager in the middle of nowhere, Wayne Duvall as Homer Stokes the KKK-affiliated candidate for governor with his performing midget, Charles Durning  as Menelaus \\"Pappy\\" O Daniel, the incumbent governor, terrified of losing, Holly Hunter as Mrs \\"Penelope\\" McGill who has told her army of children that her fallen ex-husband was run over by a train, Ray McKinnon as her suitor who, inverting the Homeric source, is more than a match for Everett in a bout of fisticuffs,  Lee Weaver as the \\"Tiresias\\" character, the blind driver of a handcar, and Daniel von Bargen as an avenging angel, the sheriff, who is also at once The Devil and the Greek God Neptune. All the above act like people who never expect to be offered a better-written part and many of them never will. Quite good comic films could be made from one twentieth of the cinematic ideas on display here. The Coens just have such an abundance of them, they toss them off, exult briefly in them, and them move gaily on to the next. If there's one quibble, it might be Pete and Delmar, McGill's companions, who have escaped with him from a chain gang. While Walter Sobchak in \\"The Big Lebowski\\" was not merely an idiot but a magnificent, outrageous idiot of Dickensian dimensions, these two, though certainly well enough acted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, are much closer to being stock comic characters whose plain unembellished dumbness is intended to render them funny. If \\"Big Lebowski\\" is a better comic film, as I think it is, I'd single that out as a reason why. <br />As well as the Coen's, the movie's magnificence owes a large debt to T Bone Burnett who put the music together. It's very much a musical and the soundtrack is pure heaven to listen to, especially those items involving the marvellous singing of Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. Though if there is one slightly off note here too, it is Ralph Stanley's \\"O Death\\" sung by a hooded KKK chief who turns out to be Stokes. Not only is credulity strained in supposing Stokes could have a singing voice remotely like Stanley's but it seems far too cool a song to be found on the lips of so desperately uncool a character. But again now I'm splitting hairs. This is a classy, classy movie and a pure joy to watch.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The first time I heard anything from this album, I was on my way out of Austin to Dallas for a weekend, and one of the local DJs played the track &quot;Let Down,&quot; introducing it as the first release from the long-awaited new album by critic's darlings Radiohead.  My mouth dropped open within the first 30 seconds (a bit of a problem as I was smoking a cigar at the time) and I didn't shut it until the fade-out.  After a pause of a few seconds, the DJ returned and said, &quot;Wow.  Is that not the worst piece of crap you ever heard?  Sheesh!&quot;  The DJ's on-air name was Whipping Boy.  'Nuf said.<br />&quot;Karma Police,&quot; a somewhat more accessible (and shorter) cut fared better as a single, but the real achievement here is the album, and the isolation, manipulation, and dehumanization that are themes communicated with crystalline clearness, even when done so through murky lyrics and muddy guitar.  Journeys into pure dissonance -- something usually left to arty types on one side and screeching garage guitar happenstance on the other -- resolve with the resultant anxiety into even purer harmonies.<br />This music ain't for everyone, and no insult intended to either group.  But if you ever find yourself having trouble telling the difference between the bands you've been hearing on the radio, give this one a chance.
0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club is a highly enjoyable and interesting book about a group of Chinese mothers and their daughters. The women form a club when they move from China to San Francisco. They hold weekly mahjong parties where they share insight and tales with one another. <BR> The novel tells the stories of oppositions in their lives and differences between the generations. The author Amy Tan uses many symbols and themes to relate the relationships of the family members and friends. Her uses of vivid descriptions help the reader to better understand the diversities between the Chinese and American cultures.<BR> One major theme in the book is the translation from the cultures. It is portrayed as being quite difficult and challenging.<BR> \\"A mother is best. A mother knows what is inside you,\\" she said...\\"A psyche-atricks will only make you hulihudu, make you see heimongmong.<BR> Back at home, I thought about what she said...These were words I had never thought about in English terms. I suppose the closest in meaning would be \\"confused\\" and \\"dark fog.\\" But really, the words mean much more than that. Maybe they can't be easily translated because they refer to a sensation that only Chinese people have.\\" <BR>This quotation is from a conversation Rose Hsu Jordan and her mother An-mei have about Rose seeing a psychiatrist about her problems, but refuses to confide in her own mother. The incomplete understandings of the mothers and daughters cultures are due to the fact that they have an incomplete knowledge of language. This act as a barrier between the mothers and daughters. <BR> The daughters know some Chinese words and the mothers speak some English. This is not enough to accurately translate intended meanings. Throughout the book, the characters bring up Chinese concepts. The frustrating fact, however, is that an understanding of the Chinese culture is required to understanding its meaning.<BR> The motif of sexism was also prominent in Tan's novel. Most of the characters in the novel encounter sexism, as it is a common problem to both Chinese and American cultures. The women experience rape, feminine submission, and stereotypes. The author makes the distinction between a respect for tradition and a disrespect for ones self as an individual. One of the main characters Lindo Jong speaks of this submissiveness in her narrative \\"The Red Candle.\\" <BR>      \\"I...looked in the mirror...I was strong. I was pure. I had genuine thoughts inside that no one could see, that no one could ever take away from me. I was like the wind.<BR> ...And then I draped the large embroidered red scarf over my face and covered these thoughts up.\\" <BR> The problems Tan discusses are important concerns facing our society. Cultural translation and sexism are two issues I displayed; however, the book also speaks of immigrant identity, communication, destiny, and sacrifices for love. The author accurately portrays the feelings and emotions of women, their children, and immigrants from other countries. The book can relate to everyone regardless of their gender, race, or culture.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Personally I think that this score is slightly better than the previous two, this is mainly so because of the final track, Into the West. I find it a phenomenal song and the voice &amp; lyrics of Annie Lennox makes you feel sadness that will come with the end of the movie.  This is one of the few songs that has actually brought a tear to my eye.  It kind of makes me not want to see this movie in the theatre being a the guy that will be crying at the end of the movie then this track starts to play.  The rest of the score is good as well with my favorite tracks been Hope and Memory, Minas Tirith, The Steward of Gondor, and Ash and Smoke. Makes me get into the ROTK mode even more.
B00000JHAU|5.0|If you're feeling sinister stands as one of the best albums of the nineties, perhaps best ever.  The music has a timeless feel and the lyrics speak to universal truth and beauty that can readily be understood and appreciated by everyone.  No surprise then that this was their &quot;breakthrough&quot; album, meaning that more than their friends heard it...<br />This album is threaded through with an incredible joie de vivre- a group of young people playing any instrument they can get their grubby little hands on with an emphasis on spirit over perfection playing the songs written by one of their mates. When one of your mates is as talented as Stuart Murdoch though, you're going to go far.<br />Despite the needless attention given to the bands fear of the press and faceless nature, it doesn't really matter who the band are.  The songs speak for themselves so clearly, creating their own little white middle class bubble of daydreams and poetry and crushes on unattainable boys and girls and an utter fascination with the world around them, interpreted through their own vision of course.<br />Each track on here strays fantastically close to perfection.  The stand out tracks for me are &quot;Get me away from here I'm dying&quot; and &quot;Seeing other people&quot;, but it would take a heart of steel not to melt in front of the beautiful melodies crammed into this short album.<br />To classify it as lo-fi, folk rock or twee pop really doesn't do it justice - this is some of the best music ever created and if you listen to it you'll love it.
0156027321|5.0|Books that take us out of our everyday world to transport us through our imagination to somewhere real, yet unreal, are worth the effort.  I recall other favorite novels such as, &quot;The Cunning Man&quot; and &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; that caused me to pause to catch up on my thoughts.  I would lose myself in the story while marvelling at the author's ability to spark so much self analysis and personal feelings.  A ride worth taking.
0780020685|5.0|People are saying that &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; w/Tom Cruis is a good/great film. That reminds me of those who say &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; with Affleck is a good war film. How I laugh at their ignorance. Kurosawa's great, moving, deep film is the samurai film template, which all the others try to copy. I laugh when I hear the masses say that &quot;Last Samurai&quot; is quality filming. They know nothing of what is good. They're like the masses who go and buy Britney Spears CDs. Kurosawa's film is 3.5 hours of substance, with no filler to speak -- it pulls you in immediately and holds you until the end. It's a shame that so many of the ignorant masses have yet to see this film, but yet have seen such drivel as &quot;The Last Samurai.&quot; I won't describe Seven Samurai down to the fine details since it's already been done by others here, but I sigh, thinking that &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is going to find its way into many people's homes on DVD, and have a place right next to &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; in their &quot;Japan&quot; collection. Bottom line is, far too many people have opinions without any basis. All emotion, all knee-jerk reactions, based in a lack of knowledge.
0815411839|2.0|Spoto spends a lot of time drawing conclusions backed up by flimsy evidence and armchair psychology.  It all comes off as a little too Freudian.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  The soundtrack really intesified the moods of the scenes and brought out the passion.  The soundtrac is great.
B00005QJDG|5.0|DT is easily one of my all-time favorite bands.  Each member is individually one of the finest in the world on his instrument, and together they are an incredible act.  I was lucky enough to be able to see them on tour this summer--if you get the chance, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Until then, though, live recordings are an acceptable substitute, and this is easily the most powerful and moving of DT's live sets.<br />Scenes from a Memory was a needed boost for the band in terms of songwriting--the last two albums were something of a disappointment in that respect--and this set captures the entire thing, an ambitious concept album that wraps politics, jealousy, family dynamics, and the supernatural into an interesting and enigmatic story.  The much-discussed John and Theresa solo brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.<br />As good as SFAM is, the album also contains highlights from the band's earlier albums.  Despite my grousing about songwriting, DT has produced plenty of beautiful and haunting songs, and some of the best are presented here--&quot;Another Day&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all time, as is &quot;Learning to Live.&quot;  Most of the extra songs aren't on the DVD edition, so even if you've got the DVD, the CD is a worthwhile purchase.<br />One more reason to check out DT live: even if you have all the studio albums, you're still not hearing it all.  The guys commit their work to tape, but that doesn't mean the songs are finished.  One of the pleasures of being a long-time DT fan is hearing how the old and newer songs continue to evolve and grow, and hearing the in-jokes and tributes the band inserts into their live performances.<br />This set gets my unqualified recommendation.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Its just simply breath taking to listen to Karen's wonderful voice.  It takes me back to my youth.  It makes me sad and happy at the same time.  These songs are wonderful.... Simply put, &quot;Top Notch for any Christmas Collection.&quot;
B00009TB5G|5.0|Simply put, this is a wonderful DVD package, continuing the fine job that was started last time for &quot;Fellowship.&quot; The extra scenes are worth the price of the set, and on top of that you get commentaries, and two extra discs of supurb &quot;making of&quot; documentaries. The film itself is a wonderful achievement that will be hailed as a classic for years to come, just as the previous film.
0375713751|1.0|For starters, Helen Fielding did it better (the brit-breezy funny diary) in Bridget Jones. But what makes me and other women want to throw this book across the room (that's how I wound up reading it, I caught it on an enraged flyover in my office and needed something cheesy to read on the subway home) is the over-the-top setup that would be satirical if Ms. Pearson didn't keep bringing in the violins (heroine's sad childhood) and, the predictability of an ending that would make Phyllis Shlafly pround. Working woman, thou cannot mother! Ms. Pearson tells us. I thought this was a hateful little piece of tripe. Don't know how it got such kindly reviews.
0385507755|5.0|...I found this book compelling.  There were passages where my heart started to race and I found myself trying to read faster because the experiences described felt so true.  I underlined lines that put my own experience into words better than I ever have.  I am a member of a 12 Step fellowship but do not believe it is the ONLY way to recover from addiction; Frey's struggle with the idea of a Higher Power closely mirrors my own.  Though our \\"core issues\\" (Frey's is \\"the Fury\\"; mine is depression) and our paths differ, our experiences of addiction are the same.  I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone who wants a better understanding of why we do what we do and how it feels to stop.<br /><br />********<br /><br />I need to amend my review of this book in light of The Smoking Gun's expose. Because I gave it an emphatic five stars, I am obligated to acknowledge this new information.<br /><br />I certainly don't know how much of what he wrote he actually experienced. The fact remains that his description of addiction and recovery therefrom - the feelings he described - rang true for me. Whether the book is fact, fiction, or some combination of the two, he nailed what I went through. I would still offer this book to someone wanting to understand what it is like to be an addict. I may also tell them to take the rest of it with some little pieces of salt.
B000002LBH|5.0|\\"Singles\\" may seem like the obvious choice for someone wanting just one Smiths collection, but if you can deal without \\"How Soon Is Now\\" and \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\", THIS is the Smiths disc to have. 24 tracks of 5-star music. It includes favorites like \\"Shoplifters Of The World Unite\\", \\"Panic\\", and \\"Shakespear's Sister\\", as well as the excellent obscure cuts \\"Half A Person\\", \\"Back To The Old House\\", and \\"Unloveable\\". Plus it has \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\", which was also on the \\"Pretty In Pink\\" soundtrack. Every song is better than the last, right up to \\"Asleep\\", which is practically a lullaby. Louder Than Bombs is both quality and quantity, and any Smiths fan should own it.

B000127LW2|1.0|Voyager is by far the worst Star Trek series. It started out ok but quickly went downhill. No amount of Jeri Ryan's t&a could save it. To post this I had to give it at least a 1 star rating. The show doesn't deserve that.<br />If you want to see the best Star Trek series, go check out DS9. If you can't get that, then go watch the original series, or TNG, or even Enterprise. But please don't waste your time on Voyager.<br />Trust me, you will regret it.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys has come a long way in the two years since her first LP dropped. She has enhanced upon her driven talent and penned new lyrics reminiscent of the old school flavor we all still long for. Unlike her peers who were topping the charts in her absence, Alicia continues to develop a distinct sound in her music. I personally believe &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; was overrated (ok a little miffed because she remade one of my favorite Prince songs) but she is letting everyone know that she's still around with &quot;Diary&quot;.<br />&quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; is undeniably fantastic once you get past the obsessive babble on her phone call. Other great songs include:  &quot;If I were your woman&quot; (yet another classic remake), &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;, &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;Slow Down&quot; and the outro &quot;Nobody, Not Really&quot;. The only misstep out of 15 tracks is &quot;Heartburn&quot;. I tried, but the beat is just not hitting it and the song is weak in comparison to the well written music surrounding it. <br />Overall, the CD is good; refreshing in this new age of horrible club happy sap songs.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Interpol, like many other bands riding the Post Punk/80's rock scene wave lack clarity and vision. And while their influences are interesting, essentially their music goes no further than the sounds of those earlier ground breaking bands. Joy Division ceased to exist over 20 years ago and unfortunately the only facet Interpol has chosen to resurrect from JD and alike bands is the melodrama; which does not alone make for good music. If you are going to spend your hard earned cash, invest it in music that strives toward originality and innovation regardless of when it was created, be it 1979 or 2003
0380789035|2.0|How can a book with such good writing and interesting ideas be so excruciatingly boring?  There's a damn good story in &quot;American Gods,&quot; but unfortunately, it's a short story stretched to nearly 600 densely typeset pages.<br />I found this book meandering, and the side trips weren't all that worthwhile.  As a writer myself, I appreciate exposition, character studies, etc.  But where is the plot, and why does it seem like he's making it up as he goes along?  That would be the only excuse for the glacial movement of the story, the haphazard connections between characters, the sense that he's just trying to fill pages, the derivative storylines and characters.  If it weren't for the basic descriptive skills, or the curve I'm using as a fan of Gaiman's in general, this book wouldn't get stars from me.<br />That being said, the characters aren't quite one-dimensional, as many reviewers have said.  Much of the descriptive writing is beautifully wrought, even when describing things not so beautiful.  The dialogue has moments of snap and crackle.  The ideas and concepts are fascinating.  But.  The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to see if, for a &quot;road&quot; story, it actually got anyplace.  And it really didn't.<br />The most telling thing is in the acknowledgments, where Gaiman gives a tip of the hat to Harlan Ellison and his &quot;Deathbird Stories,&quot; also about the withering of the gods.  Well, not so much a tip of the hat as a big, wet, sloppy kiss with a promise of breakfast later.  And he's right.  Ellison's book deals with these concepts, and does so with style and grace.  His stories--and make no mistake, they are stories, they do not wear out their welcome--his stories are light on their feet, jabbing into the dark places, haunting the reader no matter how many times you read them.  (That goes for most of his work, frankly.)  &quot;American Gods,&quot; on the other hand, is more like Wile E. Coyote with an anvil for a parachute, if anyone still believes in Wile E.<br />In short, a beautifully written but poorly crafted and interminable novel using stories, ideas and plots from far superior works.  A great disappointment, and I say this as a fan.anyone still believes in Wile E.<br />In short, a beautifully written but poorly crafted and interminable novel using stories, ideas and plots from far superior works.

B00009P1O0|5.0|[WARNING: Long review]<br />Neil Young is a widely varying, sometimes frustratingly inconsistent artist. However, he was clearly at his peak in the late '60s and early '70s, putting out at least five studio albums that could be deemed classic: Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After The Gold Rush, Tonight's The Night, On The Beach, and Zuma.<br />You may notice I didn't put Harvest in that list. While Harvest is certainly a good album, it's almost TOO accessible and tries too hard, in my opinion, to be commercially successful. It also suffers from the two London Symphony Orchestra tracks. Neil's best work often came when he didn't give a damn about what his audience or record label wanted, and so that puts Harvest out of the running for best in my book. After The Gold Rush was a great album, as was Everybody Knows.. and Zuma, but each album had one or two tracks that didn't feel up to par.<br />That leaves just two PERFECT Neil albums, both released in the dark period of the early Seventies after losing Bruce Berry and Danny Whitten (members of his backing band Crazy Horse) to drug abuse. Tonight's The Night is a dark, harrowing, bleak trip through a shattered hippie dream, an amazing album but nowhere near accessible, maybe a little TOO dark for some. 1974's On The Beach is more easily digestible and lighter, but still quite bleak and very personal. It has remained inexplicably out of print for almost 25 years, but thankfully Neil has brought it back with a remaster (now, if he would only release Time Fades Away to complete the &quot;Doom Trilogy&quot;).<br />On The Beach ranges from moodily atmospheric (the title track) to quite upbeat (Walk On) but throughout Neil's mood is bitter and confessional. He tells off of his detractors (record labels, Harvest fans, press critics, Lynyrd Skynyrd) on the rocking, radio-friendly Walk On and gets pensive on the hushed, organ-driven See The Sky About To Rain (similar thematically to the title track of After The Gold Rush). Revolution Blues is a disturbing rocker with the infamous figure of Charles Manson supplying narrative, and is one of my favorite Neil songs. For The Turnstiles is a dark, lyrically enigmatic cut with Neil plucking away at a banjo. That concludes Side 1 of the original LP.<br />While Side 1 was great, Side 2 consists of the four best Neil songs possibly ever released (that's personal opinion, of course). Vampire Blues is a darkly funny number commenting on the oil industry, and is the only actual &quot;blues&quot; song on the album. The title track has a very haunting, somber feel to it as Neil sings about falling out of fame. Motion Pictures (For Carrie) is a very personal ballad about Neil's relationship with actress Carrie Snodgrass.<br />And finally, there is the grand epic Ambulance Blues, which is to Neil Young as Desolation Row is to Bob Dylan--the greatest song of their respective careers. Over 9 minutes, Young takes us on a lyrical trip through his psyche, delivering some truly inspired imagery while a fiddle fills the air between verses:<br />&quot;Back in the old folky days<br />The air was magic when we played.<br />The riverboat was rockin'<br />in the rain<br />Midnight was the time<br />for the raid...<br />All along the Navajo Trail,<br />Burn-outs stub their toes<br />on garbage pails.<br />Waitresses are cryin'<br />in the rain<br />Will their boyfriends<br />pass this way again?<br />I guess I'll call it<br />sickness gone<br />It's hard to say<br />the meaning of this song.<br />An ambulance can only<br />go so fast<br />It's easy to get buried<br />in the past<br />When you try to make<br />a good thing last.<br />So all you critics sit alone<br />You're no better than me<br />for what you've shown.<br />With your stomach pump and<br />your hook and ladder dreams<br />We could get together<br />for some scenes.<br />I never knew a man<br />could tell so many lies<br />He had a different story<br />for every set of eyes.<br />How can he remember<br/>who he's talkin' to?<br />'Cause I know it ain't me,<br />and I hope it isn't you.<br />Well, I'm up in T.O.<br />keepin' jive alive,<br />And out on the corner<br />it's half past five.<br />But the subways are empty<br />And so are the cafes.<br />Except for the Farmer's Market<br />And I still can hear him say:<br />You're all just pissin'<br />in the wind<br />You don't know it but you are.<br />And there ain't nothin'<br />like a friend<br />Who can tell you<br />you're just pissin'<br />in the wind.<br />I never knew a man<br />could tell so many lies<br />He had a different story<br />for every set of eyes<br />How can he remember<br />who he's talking to?<br />Cause I know it ain't me,<br />and hope it isn't you.&quot;<br />In one word, brilliant.

B00008PW2D|4.0|Every review on this acts like the season completely sucked. I am here to say they are wrong!! Yeah, we got shorted some shows, but they will be given back to us in January!! Hello anyone!! Eight bonus episodes of the final season. I laughed just as hard as any other season. Loved Miranda's pregnancy and Samantha and Richard. In \\"Anchors Away\\" Charlotte was totally out of character and hilarious! I loved Berger and Carrie's chemistry. And Samantha babysitting Brady = craziness!! And the last episode wedding has me wanting Miranda and Steve together again. Maybe it isn't as good as some seasons and maybe we were shorted some episodes (again, getting them back in Jan), but you still have to admit that this is some of the best stuff on TV right now.
0451204530|2.0|Follett is a talented enough writer that even this implausible, formulaic, cloak and dagger tale is not a total bust. Still, I expected a lot more. I have greatly enjoyed several of Mr. Follett's other books (though I haven't read any recently), but I found the plot of this book to be so contrived, and the lead character's struggle with amnesia to so implausible, it tainted the whole experience for me. Like most stereotypical cold-war spy thrillers, the lead character is a former OSS operative who learned his craft behind enemy lines in WWII. In this tale, conveniently, an entire group of college chums/lovers become secret agents either during or after the war and their relationships form the basis for the plot. I found the calm, analytical, behavior the amnesiac possesses as he proceeeds to solve the riddle of his past to be totally unrealistic. Fortunately, he works out enough of the riddle to find his way to his ex-secret agent, ex-girlfriend, who also happens to be a renowned leader in the field of memory loss.  Heh, heh, heh. I'm not kidding. Pure, B-movie stuff. For those of you who really enjoyed this book--more power to you. Enjoyment is what reading is all about. But to those who gave it five stars, I have to wonder whether you've ever read a truly good cold-war thriller (or a good Follett thriller).

0064471837|5.0|\\"You're alive!\\" That was the last sentence of Sabriel. You must be thinking, what kind of book is this; however this story is beyond your imagination! The main reason I enjoyed reading this book is because it is different to other adventure or fantasy stories. This is because it is both magical and down-to-earth. The entire story is based on magic and sorcery but the characters are very life-like and occupy the same characteristics a normal person would have. The story tells me about how the courage and determination of a girl called Sabriel can save millions of innocent people. She lives in Ancelstierre where she is learning the skills and knowledge she needs to become a Charter Mage. A Charter Mage is a powerful person who has the ability to fight against evil. Her father is Abhorsen a very popular Charter Mage who has saved thousands of lives. But he has disappeared. Sabriel encounters on a voyage to find her father which leads her to fight the dead.... 1 against 1 million. The real test begins when she crosses The Wall leading to a different universe where evil is begging to be freed. This story unlocks the key of life and how many hardships we face in our lives.  Also, how we all encounter on a voyage to discover something new and increase our knowledge about the world we live in. On this voyage we have the support of many people who help us and give us courage to move forward in life. This story uncovers the message ` Courage, Determination and Knowledge is the key of life'.<br />So read this book and be amazed!!

Come back with me through the Jacksons 5s motown classics, back through Off The Wall's rnb trend setting hits, back through the biggest selling album of all time, Thriller's awsomness and stop, now your at Bad, 5 number ones off a 11 track CD? 8 top 10 hits, oh yes! he didnt release three! that was it!<br />But to me music is not how much it sells, music is much more that, music is that disc you play, it isnt the videos on MTV it isnt the top 10, it certainly isnt the billboards, its what comes though your speakers souly, forget the hype and listen to the music...<br />Bad is my personal favorite album of all time from the unforgettable bad, which personally is my least favorite track on the album to the hard hitting classic Smooth Criminal. Personally i love it when Mikey uses his high pitched rhythm on tracks like Another Part of Me, Just Good Friends and Leave Me Alone, it sends shivers through your spine. The Way You Make Me Feel is one of the great tracks of all time its Bad's Billie Jean and Michael steps up to the next level in his vocal abilitys his range is much bigger his voice is at its best. Liberian Girl is smooth and sexy and is one I could listen too today and think it was recorded last week, these sorts of tracks will stay modern forever. Dont forget Man In The Mirror which brings tears to a grown mans eyes! And just to round it off he add his 'Bad' touch that is Speed Demon & Dirty Diana.<br />This album is music in its self, wether you like rap, rnb, rock, dance, you will love this, that is whats so great about Michael he is universal.<br />Long live the King of Pop, RnB & Soul
0783229364|4.0|\\"The Secret of My Success\\" owes all its minimal success to the casting of Michael J. Fox, one of the most likable screen presences in all of film history. In \\"Back to the Future,\\" he was the overwhelmed high schooler who accidentally traveled back in time to 1955 and had to find a way back. In \\"Teen Wolf,\\" he was the highschooler turned into a werewolf. In \\"The Hard Way,\\" one of the best cop-buddy films of all time, he was the eager-to-please Hollywood actor trying to do some good-natured research.<br />All his roles fall back on the Sweet Guy persona. In \\"The Secret of My Success,\\" he plays Brantley, a Kansas boy who makes the big move to the Big Apple, where he lands a job at his uncle Howard's (Richard Jordan) firm. He gradually makes his way up the ladder as a mail boy, but his real break comes when he is mistaken for a higher-up and tries to woo hard-to-get girl Christy (Helen Slater), a beautiful co-worker of the company who buys Brantley's job position.<br />Simple premise, but it becomes all the more entangled when Brantley has to run back and forth between different job positions, changing clothes in the elevator and getting in a heated affair with his uncle's wife (played by Margaret Whitton), the kind of lady who doesn't take no for an answer.<br />The film's amorality is what struck me on multiple viewings. It sort of seems dirty and unclean -- Brantley's a farm boy but he's eager to get in a romance with his aunt. The casual sexuality of the film is what, ultimately, makes it sort of disturbing, and also sort of memorable, as odd as that may sound.<br />Fox shines in the lead role, and with any other actor the film would simply fall flat on its face. And, to be honest, a film like this could never be made nowadays -- I can imagine Jim Carrey in such a role, but the outcome would be wholly different. The eighties were an entire generation of comedy unto themselves. A lot of people love the comedies from the eighties because so many were made with so little thought and yet a lot of heart, kind of like \\"The Secret of My Success.\\" Its mediocrity is what drives it, amazingly, but also its heart, and so many comedies nowadays lack the heart of the comedies from the eighties.<br />I come back to \\"The Secret of My Success\\" a lot, probably because I saw it on TV when I was younger and it's been in my head ever since. It's a routine film that's hardly recommendable, but I actually enjoy it a lot the more I watch it, and it has a kind of frenetic comedic energy that most of the films of the genre are lacking nowadays.<br />The script, by Jim Cash nd Jack Epps Jr., seems as though it were one from an earlier decade. It has a delightful sweetness to it that's simply not unnoticeable.<br />I understand how many would dislike this film. The critic Roger Ebert gave \\"The Secret of My Success\\" 1.5/4 stars upon its inital release in 1987. I can't say I wouldn't have, either, if I were in his shoes. But comedies, over time, sort of grow on you, and this is one of those cases.<br />It's not as good as \\"Back to the Future,\\" or \\"The Hard Way,\\" but it's a lot like Fox's \\"Teen Wolf\\" (1985): fast-paced, extremely routine, cliched, flawed, and lots of fun. Don't miss this one, even if it isn't exactly the pinnacle of comedy.

As for those who compare him with Bocelli, let me tell you this: he's got a better voice, and best of all, he isn't torturing us with \\"opera singer\\" pretensions, if you know what I mean. Message to those of you whining about him not singing every song in English: get over it! The world is much more than \\"America\\".

0156027321|1.0|This is a survival at sea story.  I read all of it and enjoyed reading about Pi's search for religion and his relationship with the tiger.  I could even stomach the many gruesome details of fish guts.  Rather it was the last pages that gave me nightmares because they were were graphically violent and extremely cynical about human nature.  The last pages were a complete reversal of tone of the rest of the book.  After reading the end, the earlier chapters took on another meaning and it became obvious that the author meant to undermine faith and the belief in the goodness of human beings.  The end of the book was very disturbing and I couldn't shake it off for a long time. The author wrote the book with a double meaning.  The people who enjoy this book don't read deeply and have taken only the surface meaning.  They have not thought about how the book was constructed and why the carefully crafted double story was put into the book.  If you are a thoughtful person who sees below the surface you will find this book is gruesome.  If you have experience with wild animals you will also find that the book is not really about animals at all.
0425163407|5.0|Quick Review- Unnatural Exposure<br />I adore Patricia Cornwell's books; the mystery, the murder, the suspense- and this book doesn't let you down. <br />In Ireland five dismembered, beheaded bodies have been found and now five more have been found in America. Their murderer has struck all across America and has been named the Butcher.<BR>But the tenth body is different. The victim was already seriously ill, when she was murdered- with an unknown deadly virus.<BR>Soon people are dying from this disease across America, and no one knows what it is or what could possibly stop it- there's no pattern to it. It's like a super Smallpox.<BR>Scarpetta is still struggling along, but seems to be getting tougher- well slightly.<BR>But then along with stories leaking to the press about the virus, the murder is contacting Scarpetta. And the murderer seems to be taking over Scarpetta's identity.<BR>But as if it seems, it can't get any worse- it seems that Scarpetta may have caught the deadly disease . . .  <br />I love the twists and turns of this book- the way you never know what is going to happen next. Patricia Cornwell describes the emotions of the characters and the situations in such a way that you almost feel that it's real- it makes you feel weird about going out at night and who you trust . . . <BR> <BR>If you are going to get one book this Christmas- make it be this one, it'll be worth your while.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This music is the completion of a journey begun over two years ago.<br />When I first heard, quite a while ago now, that Howard Shore had been selected to write the music for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, I wasn't sure what to think. I liked Shore's music well enough from movies like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or &quot;Seven,&quot; but I wasn't sure how he would handle the epic nature of something like this. Three times over now, Shore has proven to me (and to many others) that he is quite capable of expressing everything that makes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; such a grand story in his music.<br />The score for &quot;Return of the King&quot; is the most grand and sweeping of the three scores, which is as it should be, since the events of the story are of the largest scale. And yet, somehow the music finds moments of intimacy and soft beauty, even amidst all the epic movements and operatic themes.<br />Each of the different tracks on the album is recognizable for its theme: &quot;The White Tree&quot; is a powerful and noble theme for Gondor, &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; is a terrifying piece for its namesake, &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; is a softly moving march accompanied by panflute, with a surprisingly-moving vocal piece by Billy Boyd (Pippin in the film), and &quot;Minas Morgul&quot; is an even more intense repriese of the recurrent theme for the Nazgul. &quot;The Fields of the Pelennor&quot; will rouse you right out of your seat, and &quot;Twilight and Shadow,&quot; with the incomparable Renee Fleming lending her gorgeous voice, will make your eyes tear up.<br />The track that will rip your heart out, though, is definitely &quot;Into the West,&quot; with Annie Lennox singing vocals. Such a beautiful, powerful, emotional song is the perfect coda to these films, and an excellent summary for all that has gone before. The first time I heard this song, before I even saw the film, I was left with tears rolling down my cheeks. Of the three songs which play at the end of each film, &quot;Into the West&quot; is easily the best one, the most moving, and the most deeply-felt.<br />If you get the Special Edition version of this soundtrack, the DVD that accompanies it has some pretty interesting stuff, but it's mostly for movie music buffs.  If you're into the process of creating music for motion pictures at all (I definitely am), then the short documentary shown on this DVD is an excellent one.  Other than that, the other interesting features are an extra music track (&quot;Use Well the Days,&quot; again performed by Annie Lennox) and a long &quot;supertrailer&quot; for the three films.  Both are worth seeing, but the documentary was the best part for me, and the real selling point of the extra DVD edition of the soundtrack.<br />The point of it all is that this is It.  From the Fellowship theme to the music of Rohan, from the violent strains of the Dark Lord's minions to the gentle tones of the Shire, this soundtrack brings it all together. It is operatic in scale but intimate in effect. Whether you want to relive the film itself or just find a good accompaniment to read the books by, Howard Shore's music for &quot;Return of the King&quot; provides the perfect musical companion. It is unquestionably a masterful acheivement, and should be required listening for any fan of the films, or any fan of the works of Tolkien.gs which play at the end of each film, &quot;Into the West&quot; is easily the best one, the most moving, and the most deeply-felt.<br />If you get the Special Edition version of this soundtrack, the DVD that accompanies it has some pretty interesting stuff, but it's mostly for movie music buffs.

B00003CX95|5.0|I recommend that everybody watch this movie.  It is truly an epic and worthy of every award it received and probably more.  I will not wax lengthy, as other reviewers have quite ably reviewed the film.  But I will say this ... I first saw it on TV, bought it on VHS, and upgraded to DVD without hesitation as soon as it became available.  That ought to tell you something.
6303419607|1.0|I want to deliver a loud siren to those who are unfortunately still stuck with the VHS editions of movies. This product I'm reviewing here is not, I repeat, NOT the Die Hard movie trilogy that contains all three of these excellent movies in one.<br />This product is just a two movie set containing the first two movies and a third tape with commentary about the making of them. Don't get me wrong, the first two are absolutely awesome movies and worthy of rememberance in the action movie genre but this product is a total waste of time and money.<br />Do not be fooled by the name of the product listed on this site. It may say that it's a trilogy but this is a totally obsolete product that has no merits for being bought unless as backup copies.<br />A total waste of time and money. Once again, do not be fooled into thinking that this is the same product as the box set. It's just the first two movie.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I never expected to like this movie.  I thought it was more hype than substance.  Since that ill-conceived little notion, I have watched this movie over and over, never tiring of it.

B000002KNI|4.0|Ok, so I wasn't there, and I never thought I'd call a concert &quot;beautiful&quot; without barfing, and the aftermath of the concert was actually quite ugly, but nevertheless this recording captures a wonderful musical spirit rekindled for one night. Simon and Grafunkel go through scores of old favorites, new solo material, and some extras. (Think the Everlys.) Each of the old tunes has been expertly reworked with new harmonies that enhance the musical experience while keeping the true feel of the song. For example, &quot;The Boxer&quot; is wonderful, with a new verse plus all of the old ones, an infectious pace and haunting harmony as usual. The same holds true for some of Simon's solo songs that have been reworked as duets. I'm in love with this version of &quot;Me and Julio&quot;--the whole album's almost worth it for only this one tune. &quot;Kodachrome/Maybellene&quot; (yes, the awesome Chuck Berry song) is another favorite--they prove that, yes, they can rOck. SO there. Energetic, fun, exciting. <br />Of course, the concert has its less-successful moments, but to each his own. I'm not a big fan of, say, &quot;A Heart in NY,&quot; or &quot;Bridge...&quot; for that matter. However, if you go for the ballads, these are austere, lovely, and haunting as ever.<BR>Overall, this concert recording has many high points and a few mixed bags. The high points are new and innovative and fun, but still conjure up that...umm, nostalgia. Hey, I'm not old enough to be nostalgic about them but what I mean is that the &quot;souls&quot; of the songs are still strong as ever. <BR>One final note: If you're interested in this music, I highly recommend the VIDEO/DVD of the Concert in Central Park. I believe it contains the FULL concert, with some amazing moments (Johnny Ace brings tears, yes I'm a sap)and the same great music. Check it out...a great concert video, straight up, captures the spirit of the night.

This review will concentrate on the feature disc but just in case you haven't seen the movie I'll just say watch it as it is superb and something which is highly likely, well not the time travel maybe but the war against the machines definitely.<br />Watch the scenes which were cut from the film such as the Terminator walking to his car after blowing away the second Sarah Connor with kids and everyone else running away, lots of scenes between the two main cops (learn that one of these actors was originally supposed to be the Terminator before Arnie claimed it in the Other Voices feature section), Reese breaking down in a field as he tells Sarah how he has never seen plants and stuff plus much, much more.<br />Other Voices is interviews with the actors and key staff, where they reflect on moments in the film and on being cast.  Michael Biehn was originally almost rejected for Reese because they thought he had a southern accent, is just one of the interesting facts you'll come across.  All companies but Orion rejected the movie idea as well as other background facts make this entertaining and educational viewing.<br />Terminator a Retrospective is mostly filmed in 1985 with a young Arnie and James Cameron discussing the film with a few inclusions of a 1991 interview mentioning the sequel.  Worth watching just to see what these famous people looked like back then and very interesting too.  The theatre trailers are interesting for those of us too young too remember them.  A very entertaining and well worth the money must have DVD.  T2 Ultimate Edition is also excellent.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|is this it?  the title of the first record.<BR>the answer:  no, we promise to release a new record just like this one.  <br />the problem: when a band makes a good debut record that feels good in part because it incoporates every classic influence from 60s 70s rock and manages to do something that still seems a bit fresh, it cannot still maintain the freshness seal of approval if it releases a record 2 years later than proves they have (maybe) taken a half-step forward when they should have been miles away.  sorry guys - if you're bored and still want they same porridge then fear not this goldy locks ain't taking jack room on fire
B00004TRD8|5.0|There is so much on the second disc in the Ultimate Edition that I have spent hours watching and still haven't seen it all yet.  T2 More than Meets The Eye gives a lot of interesting background information as well as showing scenes which did not make the original film.  Granted you have probably seen most of these scenes on TV by now but the accompanying commentary explains what James Cameron was trying to get across and why he ultimately left them out. There are also interviews with the actors in this section.<br />The Making of T2-3D Breaking the Screen Barrier is interesting but is obviously a made for TV piece put out before the Ride was launched at Universal Studios.  It still has the voiceover throwing to two commercial breaks which I wouldn't imagine would have been too hard to cut out.  Apart from that it is pretty interesting but if you haven't actually been to Universal Studios and seen the completed thing I do not think you will get as much out of it.<br />The menu you locate everything on this DVD from is really good, a bit hard to get used to how to get back to the main menus in some sections but once you work it out it is a breeze.  Here you can see stuff like all the merchandise available at the time, the 3 different theatrical trailers which are excellent as well as the trailer for this DVD.  You can see all of James Cameron's 700 original sketches he drew as storyboards as well as stuff from special effects to every different job needed to create the thing.  If you are into making movies then you'll be entertained for days.<br />Oh and yes, the movie is great too.  You'll be back to watch it over and over again. You will also find summaries of the four main actor's careers as well as James Cameron and Brad Fiedel (guy who did the music) on the first disc which are pretty interesting.  The only thing I think could have been improved would be to put the scene selection feature with one less step so you are not just looking at numbers ie 1-4 5-9 etc as this is annoying and time consuming when you haven no idea which one a scene is under.  Apart from that though it is pretty hard to see how this sensational 2 DVD set could be improved. Just buy It!tc as this is annoying and time consuming when you haven no idea which one a scene is under.  Apart from that though it is pretty hard to see how this sensational 2 DVD set could be improved. Just buy It!
B0000DD7NL|4.0|Well, what can I say?  Songs In A Minor is nothing compared to the Diary Of Alicia Keys.  I hardly think you can even compare the two... The girl has changed so much.  Her voice has deepened and matured, her songwriting style has changed and matured, and this album is more insightful than the first.<br />I love that Alicia is always paying tribute to her influences.  I absolutely love the fact that she knows where her style comes from and that she doesn't bit other people's.  She's extremely talented.<br />There are an assortment of tracks on this fifteen song album.  Some of the songs show off Alicia's vocal talent, such as Karma - which doesn't have the greatest lyrics, but her voice is enough to melt your soul.  Other songs on the album show off Alicia's songwriting capabilities, such as Slow Down.  Also, various songs on the album, show off the great work that Alicia's production team, Krucial Keys does.<br />The only quarry I had with Alicia's album -- as I did with the latter -- is that all she writes is relationship songs.  If she had kept Streets of New York on the album, I probably would have given her a full 5/5.<br />But all in all, this is a great album, and most definitely worth going out to buy.  I've had this CD in full rotation since it dropped and I couldn't bring myself to skip even a short interlude.  My favorite tracks would have to be, Karma, Diary,If I Ain't Got You, So Simple, Feeling U Feeling Me, and Samsonite Man.<br />~Conundrum
B000068TSI|3.0|the women in this story drag the story but theres still some great action scenes in here with Mel Gibson(Braveheart and Signs) leading the men to victory...sometimes silly but all in all its an ok view..other cast includes Marc Blucas(Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Pleasantville), Dylan Walsh(Blood Work, Congo), Ryan Hurst(Remember The Titans), Madeline Stowe(Unlawful Entry, Impostor), Barry Pepper(Knockaround Guys, 25th Hour), Chris Klein(Election, Say It Isnt So), Keri Russell(Tv's Felicity), Sam Elliott(Road House, The Hulk), Greg Kinnear(Auto Focus, Dear God), Desmond Harrington(Ghost Ship2002, Wrong Turn), Don Doung(Green Dragon), Keith Szarabajka(Tv's Angel), Mike White(School Of Rock), and  Clark Gregg(The Last Time I Committed Suicide, The Usual Suspects)
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I can't stand Britney! She is not a singer, actress or anything else. Good match with Madonna who is another bad singer and artist. Damn when Britney and the already old lady Madonna going to learn what is to be an artist with CAPITAL A? If you listen to Cyndi Lauper, Natalie Merchant, Lara Fabian, Sandra, Zizzi Possi, Simone and others you will see that Britney SUCKS.<BR>Her music is a danger for the right education of the TEENS all over the world. Like Cyndi's song says: MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING!
B00006IUNN|2.0|Nicolas Cage(Snake Eyes, Vampire's Kiss), Christian Slater(Pup Up The Volume, Heathers), Adam Beach(Joe Dirt, Smoke Signals), Noah Emmerich(The Truan Show, Monument Ave.) and Mark Ruffalo(The Last Castle, xx/yy) star in WindTalkers, which really means some Native American thing about the soldiers who were Native American....being that Adam Beach is in this one. good battle sequences makes this good for some time but the dramatic side becomes wooden and we dont seem to care about Cage or Beach or anyone after awhile..note: Slater gets beheaded in this one..ouch
061301328X|5.0|Shogun is a masterpiece. the book draws its readers into another era, dark and mysterious, Clavell succeeds in suspending, no annihilating resistance to entering the exotic and fascinating world outlined in this novel. Reading this book is like falling in love. At times hilarious or brutal, always exhilarating and occasionally deeply moving. The world of medieval Japan which he brings to life is exquisitely detailed in all its aspects, from the spiritual (eg the cha ceremony) to the esoteric (the ninja) to the martial, political and romantic. The cast of dozens in this novel all come across with disarming realism and engage the reader very strongly, so that even a western reader has no difficulty remembering who is who despite their strange sounding names. Essentially a story about one man's struggle for survival and love in a hostile alien world, Shogun delivers, in every department. I have read this book several times.    <br />You will not be able to put it down.
B000099T2L|2.0|I'm not a Beyonce hater. Th girl has an awesome *yet way over-used* voice and tons of talent. Plus, she was great with Destiny's Child. Yet, I think she is the second most overrated performer of 2003 *Justin Timberlake being first.* <br />Beyonce has basicly dominated the radio this past year with materail from &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; album and has had two massive #1 hits that are seemingly played back to back on every pop station in the world. &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is not that great of song. It's far from awful but it's not worth several weeks at #1 and neither is &quot;Baby Boy&quot; which features Sean Paul who has also dominated radio either by himself or on collaborations. &quot;Me Myself and I&quot; is also really picking up and is sure to be another over-played smash. The only real winner is &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; with Luther.<br />Sorry, but Beyonce doesn't deserve all of the hype. I liked her better with Destiny's Child. She is a sweet, moralistic and talented gal, but there is better music out there. I recommend the new ones by Mya, Britney *Beyonce's vocals make her look like a muppet, but the album is awesome*, or Stacie Orrico. However, by all means purchase Beyonce over Ashanti...yuck. :x
B000002534|5.0|This album is an experience of openess to a musical expression that elicits an understanding of the universe that seems to have escaped the best of us. The Creator has a master plan and we are a part of it for good or ill.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is a very enchanting cd starting off with a pure instrumental then leading into one of my favorite tracks Wild Child .. then it takes a turn into the haunting beautiful song Only Time which is one of my favorites and also has a story behind it. I had herd the song on the radio for over a year?! The DJ never said who it was tho grrr. So finally im over at my friends house who is playing it n i ask her who it is n she says Enya the next day i go out n buy the cd n find out i love every track on it .<BR>my only complaint: far too short but a must own
B000089RVX|4.0|This is a decent album, even good at points, but this is nothing compared to Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Within Temptation, Rhea's Obsession, Aghora, Collide, or Nightwish. Some believe this is the new direction of mainstream metal and maybe it is, but it's not new. Just new to the mainstream. If you like this, you will like the bands I named the same or probably more. Give them a chance if you really like Evanescence.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wish I could give it 6.<BR>Can't believe how many one-star reviews its getting. I would suggest you to buy this album. It's not like all other Britney albums which people always hate.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|It's not really clear to me how old Alicia Keys is, or is supposed to be, especially in a music industry known to shave years off of the true ages of it's performers to make them more appealing to younger audiences. But whatever her true age is, for her sophomore album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, it's clear she has been digging in the crates looking for that old-old soul. Several times she finds it or at least elements of it, such as on the lead single &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, and &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;. In fact &quot;If  I Ain't Got You&quot; so successfully employs elements of a late-60s or early-70s love song, that I had to check the album credits to make sure it wasn't a sample or remake. Rarely does an artist who experienced so much commercial success and acclaim, only some of it deserved, return with a sophomore LP that is actually better and more deserving of praise than debut that the industry bandwagon worshipped. Keys simply seems to be far more confident in what she is doing musically, and you get the impression that she is really growing up, and out, with her sound. It would have been easy for to go the tried and true root for commercial success, and basically do what everybody else is doing; make an immature album of junior high-school ruminations about love and relationship and throw in a few &quot;club songs&quot;. Instead Keys chooses to record songs like &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Nobody Not Really(supposed to be an interlude but more like a short song)&quot;, and &quot;Samsonite Man&quot;. Alicia Keys &quot;teeny-bopper&quot; fans might not like this album as much as her debut but it's a superior album to her first, and with following she already has in addition to having people like Clive Davis pushing her, the album will no doubt be a commercial success too.
B00000K0EA|5.0|\\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is my favorite Bond film ever.  Practically every element in the film hits the right mark.  The acting, action scenes, characters, gadgets, and most everything else.<br />Brosnan has the right combination of the suave manners that Connery created in \\"Dr. No\\" and the emotional intensity that Dalton brought to the role in \\"License to Kill\\".  He makes Bond human, with out losing any of the beyond human qualities of James Bond.  He really hits the mark in this movie.<br />Other characters of note, would be news maniac Elliot Carver played to insane glory by Jonathan Pryce.  He is kind of villain who uses his head, instead of his muscles.  Michelle Yeoh is the only Bond girl in history who could actually beat James down and have him cry over it.  With two machine guns, kung-fu skills, and the same tendency for destruction like Bond, she puts most other girls in the series to shame.<br />The action scenes are classic.  The tricked out BMW 750 in the car garage is fast, explosive, and made with perfect precision.  The idea of putting Bond in the back of the car with a remote control is a great twist on the car chase theme.  The BMW motorcycle chase is also great to watch.  Once again, the film doesn't just toss out another motorcycle chase with out adding some thing different.  This time, you have two passengers, handcuffed, and trying to avoid a gunfire from choppers and other things.  Great stuff.<br />One other quick thing of note, David Arnold's first Bond score is still his best.  His work in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" blends a great amount of styles used in the other films, and new styles for the 90's.<br />Since it's release, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" has remained to me, the best James Bond film to date.  Check it out if you haven't already.
B00006JLX4|5.0|It's true. I'm at a loss. I've listened to Pavement for years, and always will. They have actual talent, something most bands wish they had. S&amp;E is absolute punk classic. Everyone should own it, no matter what kind of music you listen to. It's emotive before &quot;emo&quot; existed, it is too weird for your parents, it's Pavement.<br />Now remastered w/ all kinds of goodies... I couldn't be happier...well, I could be... if they were still together.
0634049011|5.0|I have been using this book with my students since Barrett started putting together the opening chapters. I first used it with my advanced students, those who already had some experience with the 5 patterns of major scales. Immediately they returned saying that it helped them understand the scales and visualize the fretboard more easily.<br />Having my students walk in with diagrams of scales and intervals for me to check has been an incredible reversal of roles. Normally I would draw diagrams for them to study and play. Going over a chapter and sending them home to complete and play the exercises gets the student involved in a way that the normal draw, demonstrate, &quot;see ya' next week&quot; cycle never really reaches. It gives the student an opportunity to take home and digest the information that was normally only available during the lesson.<br />Teaching people to operate a guitar and teaching music on a guitar are almost completely different tasks. I found the first six chapters to be very helpful when initiating beginner and intermediate students into the world beyond the 3rd fret and power chords. There is something in this book for nearly anyone interested in knowing how to play the guitar.<br />If you are an instructor you will find the comprehensive, organized approach very thorough and focused. If you are self-studying the instrument or a student seeking more than just another tabbed-out solo this is a book you can keep coming back to throughout your journey. I highly recommend it.<br />Billy Burke
B00000IMYA|5.0|My mother was still in her teens when these recordings were made, and I was yet to be.  The flawed field recording at the NJF and Columbia's subsequent attempts to &quot;fix&quot; it in New York the following Monday are legion and the stuff of legend.<br />All I can say is THANK YOU to Phil Schaap, Sony/Columbia and the Voice of America for their efforts in setting the record straight, and then some with the brilliant, dedicated and painstaking work in making this work available.<br />I was not &quot;into&quot; Ellington as much as say, Basie until I came across this CD...that has changed!
B000066NW0|1.0|I'm not going to let my disdain for this...creature get in the way of my review, since it will be the music I'm reviewing and not the person behind it.<br />I can tell you I'm severely disappointed. <br />I never really expected a good solid rock album, but being a lover of pop-rock as well this album still couldn't satisfy me.<br />When you buy an album, you usually expect the same type of music you hear on tv from an artist. Of course you want an album to be diverse and interesting, not repetitive, but I think most people will agree with me that the videos are what you expect and want and therefore what you should get.<br />When I heard 'Losing Grip' I was semi-interested in this album, since the song is actually quite good pop-rock. I knew very well that her other videos weren't quite so 'hard', of course, but she and everyone said that this was a good, hard rock album.<br />Don't think I'm an imbecile, I knew very well this wasn't true.<br />But I never saw this coming. A teenage girl that lacks vocal talent, therefore has to rely on computers to make her voice sound halfway decent (which they failed at), singing to disgusting pop/country songs that will bore many people after a good 15 minutes.<br />The first time I heard these songs I didn't really dislike him (it's better than most crap on MTV these days), but after listening to this pathetic excuse for a cd for several times every song makes me want to pull my hair out and bash my head against the wall.<br />It's especially the lyrics that are a weakness. For someone with the help of songwriting team 'The Matrix' (Hilary Duff, Christina Aguilera (yes people, POP songwriters) this is unacceptable.<br />I'm sorry, but the music I consider to be good should be able to keep fascinating me.<br />There's great stuff out there, but it's not on MTV.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|dream theater never ceases to amaze. this album is not another awake, or SFAM. it is not a new Images and Words, instead it is the progression of the greatest progresive rock band today. more metal, more balls, more speed from petrucci, everything you could want. some people said the songs didnt grab you like awake did, just listen to &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; (track 2) its an amazing song and the solos are incredible. in my opinion one of their greatest efforts, comparable to 6DOIT and Awake
B00005ATQF|4.0|The quintessential Marine Corps movie! Kubrick created a masterpiece for those who want to ride along with a group of marines from boot camp thru Vietnam. Matthew Modine is an excellent cast as a young, idealistic, joking, pseudo-hippie who learns what war is all about! A fine job of casting for the different characters you would see in the Marine Corps. Kubrick is able to show the brotherhood that exist among marines and show the senselessness of what we were fighting for, yet display the loyalty and devotion to duty that makes the Corps the best fighting force ever! As a former US Marine, this is as close as it gets to the real Corps!
B0000797IO|1.0|I Really Hate the way Women cheaters in films Lately All Seem to get away w/ adultery while there male partner is made to suffer the Consequences of His actions,Watch Unfaithful to see what I am talking about,Olivier Martinez is killed too !!! :( Lately there Seems to be this strange trend toward Forgiving the Vile B_tches for there Infidelitles...If it were my Wife She would be Dead and buried !!!

B00000G3PL|5.0|I've got all 4 lethal Weapon movies on DVD and I must say, you have to own ALL these movies to make the touching experience complete.<br />As I said these movies have heart and comedy along with the pain and action. You actually watch Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh grow so close in family and in work. They fight it all together, Riggs and Murtaugh, Its really touching. There is still no reason why Riggs cant give Murtaugh a bit of a hard time and joke around with him! The action on the other hand is 5 star. I enjoyed these movies so much and I am sure you will too.<br />I suggest buying the complete trilogy.
B000065V41|5.0|This is a hilarious take on the classic christmas story. The muppets know how to make it creative and fun. I must see during the christmas holidays.
0679737456|1.0|Black Ice was by far one of the most difficult and boring books I've ever read. I choose this book because it was and autobiography about a young African American girl and I thought in some way I could relate. First of all, the book starts off completely slow and it stays that way throughout the whole book. It doesn't have any parts that are interesting or keep your attention. One other thing I didn't like was the fact that the words she used were dull and hard to understand. There were too many characters and she jumped back and forth between them throughout the entire story, so you never know whom she's talking about or what their purpose is in the story. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 21 and I'd never read it again.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Unfortunately, it's the little kids who write the reviews. I don't see why anyone would listen to Rage and complain about rebels. No offense, but I think the name says it all really. If you're going to be all ultra-right republican on us, I don't feel as though this album should even be in your posession. We all know that America's presence in the Vietnam was pointless, that doesn't mean we're downing the soldiers that fought there. It means we're only chastizing the government that sent them there. Other than that, the music is great, more appreciated by the current extinction of RATM, than it was when they were around. I'm done rambling...for now.<BR>Dedicated to luke worle.
0553212737|3.0|It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.<br />Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly  `helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together. <br />Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that. <br />This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace.
B00009TB5G|2.0|Please even extended edition that the original boring version? please... this is clearly a comercial move toward the theatrical exhibition. Who care about an extended edition of a already very long and extended movie? I hope there's no going to be a fourth movie of this series.<BR>Thank you.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This new album from the kings of prog. music really rocks!Most of the people complains about it but if you just give a chance to it you'll exactly be hooked to it..Complaining people say that our &quot;kings&quot; haven't used their talents..Well,it's a complete lie..Specially, As I Am ,Endless Sacrifice and This Dying Soul are probably one of the best songs in DT history..As i am a metal fan i liked Petrucci's style in As I Am..Maybe it can sound a bit different,but if bothers you why do you listen to prog.metal??If they had stayed unchanging they wouldn't have done Metropolis Pt.2..Who says this album sucks,they must listen to album once more time..
1577311523|5.0|I LOVED the Power of Now. No book has changed my life as deeply as Tolle's book. Move from \\"mind\\" to Peace/Presence/Being effortlessly, with no criticism and truly Understand the ancient teachings and actually how it could be that we \\"know not what we do\\". Tolle is one of the greatest spiritual teachers. All the self help type books do not compare. With Tolle, I truly entered the Now and Being and saw how I had been unsuccessful time and time again. Tolle gave me true inner Confidence and the ability to Be Myself in situations where I never could before. I am unable to express my gratitude for this blessing. With Tolle, in the Now, You Are...no more mind wanderings...Peace/God/Love/Joy/Christ are all Here Now.
B00008PW2E|5.0|They want us to subscribe to HBO, they don't want the one time shot of cash. They want a year worth of cash. Well im not going to blow the money per month  for one show, the rest of HBO's series just dont interest me.  I love the series, but heck I won't even buy the dvd if it comes out, just like the sugar comment made, well im losing interest fast.  You know, i'll just find the online free downloadable episodes, im sure they are out there, how about that HBO.
0393057658|5.0|I thought this book did a great job of comparing the two divergent schools of baseball thought - the dominant &quot;old school&quot; approach, exemplified by the old time baseball &quot;lifers&quot; who know what they know because they know it, and the up-and- coming objective, statistical based analysis of the game, embodied in this book by Billy Beane.  The book, slanted towards the new wave of baseball men, does a superb job of punching holes into baseball truisms and dopey practices (I particularly loved the section regarding amateur draft day - why do teams continue to throw away high draft picks and millions of dollars on untested high schoolers - high schoolers!!! - when there are so many quality college players to choose from?).  But, most of all, what this book does is prove that you don't necessarily need a lot of money to win - just good management, which is something that is apparently in short supply in baseball.  Every baseball owner and general manager should be required to read this book.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Simple put this album is amazing. Any TRUE DT fan will get this album. It's leaps and bounds over crap like 6 degrees. Scenes is still one of there best but the production on this one surpasses that album. This is just as good as Images, Awake, and Scenes. Anyone that says different is a moron. If you just started listening to DT and you say this album sucks, you don't count. 5 years and up experience. This album has it all. It's heavy, melodic and it rocks. But i'm sure some people will complain and say they were let down. Well, what have you done? Until you can do even remotely close to this, shut up. DT has the best and worst fans in the world. Alot of them will complain and say i want more of this or that but if they put out the same crap over and over again they'd say &quot;Oh they suck, they can only play one thing.&quot; if you don't like change, don't listen to Prog Rock. That's the whole point of the music. Constant progess and PROGRESSION!! DEAL WITH IT!! THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I think that Britney really put herself on the line with this album. I like it and think that everyone should quit hating on her for trying to make her money. Shes got more than all of you so why talk bad about her, because your jealous! Well I personally LOVE Christina Aguilera and would pick her any day over Britney but this album is really good for her!
B000005ALP|4.0|Beautiful Freak is a very mello album with original sounding music. Novocaine for the Soul, the first song on the CD is an amazing song, that, I have found, different people who prefer different genres of music tend to like. Susan's house, the second song on the album is another one of my favourite songs. The song changes about 4 times to a completely different sound which keeps it interesting. Within the song there are several different storys about some people who may be prejudged by some, for the negative, who may be more normal than you think.<br />I believe this is, although an older album, a worthwhile buy.
B000089RW0|2.0|I wouldn't buy it but it's an ok movie.
B00005OC0G|4.0|As a convinced Mutter's fan I have (unforunately) to say that this recording of Beethoven violin concerto was a lost opportunity by Deutsche Grammophon. <BR> In fact the interpretation is astonishing both for the powerful of the bow and for the clear pronunciation and accents that give ms Mutter expecially in the third movement, the comparison beween Heifetz or Uto Ughi records does not leave any doubt: apart from the tempo of the first movement, in my opinion too slow, she shows a very fiery, fine and VITAL interpretation.<BR> The point is that Deutsche Grammophon COMPLETELY FAILED the registration! It seems like the microphones were placed 1 miles from the soloist and the orchestra covers wholly her sound. You can feel it powerful, but very far away.<BR>To hear Mutter violin during cadenza, I have to turn up the volume up to 20 points!!!<BR>However, apart from the mistaken registration, this is for me a 5 star work for Anne-Sophie.
0385504209|5.0|I reluctantly picked this book up.  I just didn't think I'd be interested in the subject matter.  My best friend read it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  So I bit.  WOW!  As I was working my way through, I could not tell fact from fiction.  Not only am I left with wanting to go to Paris to the museum but I'm looking for a historical biblical course to learn more.  In my opinion great book.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This consists of two discs for each film, the original and an alternate version (more on that below) on the first disk, and collections of approximately 2 hours of featurettes and other bonuses on the second disc.  The ninth disc is a hodgepodge of trailers and other items from previous DVD and laser disk versions.  Although the extras have been released in a variety of forms over several years (the John Hurt documentary 'The Alien Saga', being the latest), THIS is the definitive version.<br />'Alien' (average user rating: 4.6).  If you haven't seen this classic film, then you must be living under a rock.  The collection includes the original theatrical version (which I prefer) and the &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, notable for its inclusion of the controversial captain-cacooned by alien scene (controversial because from the Alien mythology developed in later films, we know that only the massive queen can lay eggs).  I prefer the original (which is actually 1 minute longer), and interestingly enough, it appears that Ridley Scott prefers the original as well.  The making of featurettes are extensive and reveal Giger's extensive participation and how what was originally expected to receive a b-moive budget became one of the very few examples where Fox studios followed the vision with a classic.<br />'Aliens' (average user rating: 4.7).  This is the only sequel I know of that is rated higher than the original.  This time, the &quot;Special Edition&quot; version (also on the previous 'Alien Legacy' box set) is a superior experience and exactly is how upstart director James Cameron (who had written the script prior to the release of 'The Terminator') wanted to release the film, but was constrained entirely by time limits.  The result is additional scenes featuring the colonists and Ripley's family lost to the time she spent in hypersleep.  As with the first installment, the featurettes are interesting and thorough, although the Viet Nam War metaphor is not as thoroughly explored with Cameron as has been in other releases.<br />'Alien 3' (average user rating: 3.2).  As a fan of the franchise, this was perhaps the most anticipated part of this new box set.  The &quot;working print&quot; of the film (the longest of all the versions here, and complete with subtitles for missed sound editing), adds a depth to the film that was not in the original.  That is, the arrival of Ripley and the characters are covered much more thoroughly, the alien creature is begotten by an oxen with a much more original look, there is an additional plot twist arising from the nature of the inhabitants (criminally delusional), and there is no riduculously-timed chest-burster scene at the end.  Still, the film is a flawed masterpiece.  The film is better appreciated in light of the bad situation first-time director David Fincher had been placed in - not the least of which is an incomplete script during production and a set that had already been constructed for the ill-conceived &quot;wooden planet/monestary&quot; vision of the previously assigned director.  In this sense, the three production featurettes come across as almost an apology/tribute to Fincher.  (NOTE:  Fincher is the only director who is not interviewed on the box set.)<br />'Alien Resurrection' (average user rating: 3.0).  What happens when you put the French director of 'Amelie' (Jean-Pierre Jeaunet) in charge of an alien movie?  Well, foreign/art movies were all the craze in the last 1990s, so . . . Fox studios thought, &quot;Why not?&quot;  In the end, many fans of the franchise did not appreciate the obviously satirical slant on this final installment.  The opening scene and ending scenes (the only additions of substance) on the extended version make the film even more tongue-in-cheek.  Despite the French director and crew's obvious regard for the original 'Alien' (as documented in the featurettes), armed with the return of Sigourney Weaver and the addition of superstar Winona Ryder, the directorultimately made a quirky, campy action film.  But in the end, it was the last quarter of the script that makes this the weakest of all the installments by far.  Postscript to Fox studios: if you had given Fincher this much creative freedom, you would have have a third masterpiece.
0385504209|3.0|Had it not been for all the hype I might have expected less and not been disappointed by this book. Nelson DeMille calls Dan Brown \\"one of the smartest writers in the country\\". Maybe so but if so, I don't see that demonstrated in this book. The book is loaded to the gills with what I assume are historical facts but so what? Thhe characters are unreal. They are so ingenious that the reader can't keep up with their thinking at one point and morons at other points.For example, the symbolism of Sauniere's death message (the Vitruvian Man) becomes clear to the reader long before it does to the expert, Langdon. Another: The brilliant detective Fache doesn't know that in order to know what number Langdon dialed from his phone all he has to do is look in his \\"recently dialed calls\\" file? (pg 117). Another: (pg 299) when the three are trying to figure out what language the message in the cryptex was written by Leonardo in, the reader finds his brain screaming at their stupidity. It's freakin' mirror writing in English! Everyone knows this is the writing Leonardo used. There are more examples of poor character development. But, maybe it's a four start boook that was oversold. What's left is three stars.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I'm so glad I bought this album. I haven't been playing piano too long but Alicia Keys is one of my &quot;piano idols&quot;. Her voice is so beautiful and she is a great talent. I became a fan in a while before her debut album came out. There's no sophmore slump here.<BR>Harlem's Nocturne- awesome intro 5/5<BR>Karma- I can really relate to this song. It's about a guy crawling back and karma of course. It has a good funky sound. 5/5<BR>Heartburn- GREAT song. It's fun and makes you feel good 5/5<BR>If I was Your Woman/Walk On By- Good song. Not my favorite but good. 4/5<BR>You Don't Know My Name- One of the best. Great old soul sound. It's about falling head of heels for a guy you don't know too much about. 5/5<BR>If I Ain't Got You- Love this song! Her voice shines through. 5/5<BR>Diary- She's telling a guy to think of her like a diary. Good song. 4/5<BR>Dragon Days- It seems like a lot of people didn't like this one. I do, It's different. 5/5<BR>Wake Up- This song doesn't do too much for me. I like it, but it's not my favorite 4/5<BR>So Simple- The beginning of this is kind of strange. I don't really like this song. 2/5<BR>When You Really Love Someone- Sounds like something from her debut album. I love this song. 5/5<BR>Feeling you, Feeling Me- Just an interlude. Nice. 5/5<BR>Slow Down- I can relate to this. She's telling a guy they need to take it slow. 5/5<BR>Samsonite Man- Good lyrics. It's about a guy whose slick. I was a little bored with it. 4/5<BR>Nobody Not Really- This reminds me of her debut album. It's a pretty song. 5/5<BR>So I love this album. All the songs, with the expection of So Simple, are great. I like how she's changed her sound some. That's what artists are supposed to do from album to album, not just create the same cds. Worth buying!
0385504209|2.0|I was expecting an intriguing look at the history of the Catholic Church and it's representation in art.  What I found was a &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; novel with predictable characters.  If you are looking for a page-turning murder mystery, that will make a popular movie - this is it.  If you are looking for something deeper and thought provoking you will need to look elsewhere.
B00009ATIX|2.0|It was obvious to me that they were trying to emulate 2001 with the music and the camera shots.  The sets were really neat.  The acting was pretty good.  The idea is intriguing.  Sounds all pretty positive huh?  I did give it two stars....<br />What I didn't like was the dialogue, the pace of the movie.  The actors did a great job with what they had.  I didn't think the nudity was neccessary.  It didn't help the story at all.<br />Like I said before it was a lot like 2001.  That's treading into some sensitive territory.  I liked 2001 a heck of a lot more than Solaris.  Solaris was really a drawn out film.  2001 at least had a unique vision that should be left be alone.  Solaris didn't give me that.  I don't think the story justified the direction they went into.  <br />I think if it was filmed differently it could have been a great film.  Of course, this is just my opinion.
B00005JKZV|3.0|More digitally processed landscape shots from New Zealand.  More trudging across the tundra.  More story lines that resemble nothing in the books.  One scale model castle.  One scale model castle storming battle.  The cavalry arrives in the knick of time.  Color fades in and out.  Aspect ratio is screwy (and this is the widescreen edition).  The highlight of this snore fest are the Ents (talking, walking trees).  Not worth 3 hours of my time and barely worth the $4.50 I paid to rent from block buster.  You want to see a good 3 hour movie, rent the Longest Day.  That was an epic movie.
B00004RYZT|5.0|Everything has been said, except for the right translation of &quot;Du hast&quot; - so, here it is:<br />&quot;Du hast&quot; means &quot;You have&quot;, BUT: in German, it SOUNDS exactly like &quot;Du hasst&quot; which means &quot;You hate&quot;. And when Till sings &quot;Du hast mich&quot;, then it SOUNDS like &quot;You hate me&quot;. It's a pun!
0061015725|4.0|Michael Crichton is a master of limited disaster stories.  Small areas and small casts combined with high tension and sometimes the possibility of greater impact.  Such is the case with this one.<br />An out of work programmer begins to suspect that his wife is having an affair.  But at the same time other strange things begin to happen at home.  As the questions about his wife's behavior begin to become to much, he is offered a job straightening out a programming problem at his wife's firm.<br />The problem concerns nonotecnology and using microscopic robots for imaging.  Some of the nanobots are loose and not responding to controls.  Their fail-safes seem to be inoperative.  The devices are evolving and they are dangerous.<br />The story encompasses about a week with most of the action happening in a single day.  Like Jurassic Park, the story is told from an after-the-fact perspective so some of the tension can't quite build.  There are a few unanswered questions that seem like the answers were edited from the final draft (i.e. the black cloaks) but it still reads well.<br />All in all, if you enjoyed Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Twister, or other similar Crichton stories, you will be hooked on this book.
B000089RVR|4.0|I absolutely loved Dido's first disk and this one is very good too. Most everyone has heard White Flag (and it is good), but I would like to point to &quot;See you when you're 40&quot;, &quot;Mary's in India&quot; and my particular favorite: &quot;See the Sun&quot;. &quot;See the Sun&quot; has such a feeling to it that it became became like a story written in a novel and not just a small amount of lyrical lines. (And yes, listen a while longer to hear the secret track!).<br />&quot;Who makes you feel&quot; seemed out of place with the rest of the disk, and I didn't particularly enjoy &quot;Do you have a little time&quot; - the background track on that piece was a little annoying, otherwise I would have given 5/5 stars.<br />Overall this is a great CD - and I would think anyone would at least find a couple songs they would enjoy. It is rare to find one CD that has so many enjoyable songs!
B00005JM1F|2.0|This is Amazon's property, meaning they can do with it what they want.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Now, this review will be a rare one.. I am an adamant fan of both the books and the movies. Usually its one or the other, I've noticed. <br />What do you get when you combine J.R.R Tolkien's uncommonly good tales of fiction with modern movie-making? <br />You get two, (Soon to be three) uncommonly good movies that are among the greatest ever. The Lord of the Rings is by far the greatest fiction story ever created, in the form of either books or movies. Hands down. This review will focus mainly on The Two Towers though, On both the DVD and the movie itself. <br />1. The movie. Amazing. Incredible. The story from the book has been preserved fairly well, with some changes. The acting is amazing, with each character contributing to the story in some way. Who else knows that Orlando Bloom, who plays Legolas, made his debut in these movies? When I found out, I was amazed. He is an excellent actor. (He's also the one who attracts the greater majority of the female audience). The casting is perfect. Almost every character is exactly as one would imagine them. (Gollum especially). Gollum is completely computer generated, but you can never tell. He looks perfectly real. His attitude and voice are perfect. <br />The special FX are another thing. Two oscars in a row don't lie. The special effects are so good, you don't even think of them as special effects at all. Thats the amazing thing. <br />BUT...The movie is not perfect. No movie is. <br />The movie has many departures from the book. Some insignificantly small, and some so big and blatant that they would have Tolkien &quot;Purists&quot; raving to the bitter end. Here are some of them:<br />Arwen has a huge role in these films, unlike the books. This is okay, some people may be glad to see this story explained in full. (You got barely any info on it in the books.) But it is rather annoying to see scene after saliva-soaked scene with her and Aragorn sucking on eachothers lips. <br />On the way to Helm's Deep, the troop getsattacked by Wargs and Aragorn falls of a cliff and is gone for a while. I don't care too much about changes, but I thought this was just a pointless one. It adds absolutely nothing to the story.<br />The most notable change is this. In the books, when Faramir captures Frodo and Sam, he eventually lets them go. In the movie, he gets tempted by the ring and takes them to Gondor. When I first saw this, I was disgusted. But not so anymore. On the DVD, the writers explain why they made this change, and it makes total sense. This whole story is about this ring tempting and destroying people. It destroyed Isildur, Boromir, Turned Gollum into what he is now, is working on destroying Frodo. Yet this man, who is no different from any other- (In fact, Faramir is Boromir's brother), says &quot;I would not pick this thing up if it lay on the roadside.&quot; Doesn't that sound a little strange? Although, at the end of the movie, Faramir lets them go.  <br />The movie also does not end where the book ends. The movie ends after Helm's Deep. No Shelob, no Isengard. (But only pickiest of nitpickers would be complaining about this, because these scenes will both be in ROTK. <br />Now, these are the two changes that I resent. One, Frodo and Sam have way too little screen time. They are upstaged majorly by Aragorn. Two, Gimli is a walking comedian. The writers seemed to have gone out of there way to make sure he never has a serious line.  <br />There are some more changes involving Helm's Deep, but I won't get into them. <br />Yes, there are changes. Lots of them. But that does not change my opinion about these movies. <br />And this is my word to the so-called &quot;Tolkien Purists.&quot; You must realize that there is no way to convey every single detail from the books onto film. Consider this: What say they devoted just one minute of screen time for every page of the book. Thats around 400 minutes. Thats over six hours. For just one movie. <br />Peter Jackson, (The Director) is making his own movies. They are not Tolkien's movies, they are his. He has every right to make changes, for better or worse. In fact, I am surprised he has stayed so close to Tolkien's work. Don't expect him to become a slave to the books and merely crank out a carbon copy of the books on screen. And even if you don't think these movies aren't accurate portrayals of the books, just accept them as movies and enjoy them in there own right. <br />These is a great movie, and the extended edition is even better. Far, far better than the theatrical.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This double DVD-set is a gem in every sense of the word. Of course, the 1938 movie itself hardly needs an introduction anymore. It is by far the best screen adaptation of the legend of Robin Hood and his merry men ever made. Cast to perfection with Errol Flynn as Robin, Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian, Basil Rathbone as the villain Guy de Gisbourne, Claude Rains as the scheming John Lackland, Alan Hale as Little John and a host of inimitable character actors, shot in awesome Technicolor, with a rousing score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and masterly directed by William Keighley and Michael Curtiz, it still stands as one of Warner Bros. finest moments.<br />For this DVD release picture and audio have been restored and digitally transferred, and I must say that the picture quality, sharpness and colour are simply mind-blowing and completely belying their age. <br />The special features spread over the first and second disc are all of great interest. Film historian Rudy Behlmer provides significant audio commentary to the movie. There is a documentary about the making of the movie, and features that will learn you everything about the cast, the crew, and even the figure of Robin Hood and his many movie adaptations. From the movie itself there are a few outtakes and bloopers. Not to be missed by anyone interested in Hollywood history is a revealing documentary about the development and fame of Technicolor (narrated by Angela Lansbury). And much more, turning this set into a surefire investment that will provide many hours of home movie pleasure.<BR>In short: highly recommended.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is an AC/DC album I treasure above all others.  I believe this represents the band at their prime.    BUT, I sure wish they could have included the Australian album cuts on this as bonus tracks - &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot; (a really great song), along with the &quot;alternative&quot; studio tracks of &quot;What's Next to the Moon&quot; and a few others where the American and Australian versions are slightly different...
B00009ATIX|1.0|I almost feel bad writing a bad review for this film, but honestly, I am off to the store to go get some more NO-DOZ. This movie is as slow as any that I have ever seen. I've watched half the movie so far, and after seeing George Clooney's but two times too many, I had to run to my computer to warn all potential renters to not rent this movie. Many of the other reviews state that this movie will make you think, well it definately does that. I was thinking about how boring this movie is, and what else can I be doing to keep from wasting my 2 hours, not to mention what other movies I could be watching. <br />Maybe I will finish watching this movie tonight when I have trouble sleeping.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|You can write 5000 bad reviews because you are Mariah fans, but it does not erase the fact that Whitney sounds great on this album. I'm sick of Mariah's &quot;whisper singing&quot;. She sings normal, then she whispers, then normal again. Just sing straight! Whitney may have had troubles, but Mariah is no angel. SO, face the facts and GROW UP! There's room enough for ALL divas. Although some are better than others. :-)
B00005JMCT|5.0|the is the funniest one. i laugh so hard i laughed hard. they did a great jorb in this one. i thought they were gonna crap it up, but they didnt. this is one of the funniest movie of 2003. the thing with movie it's just hilarious. and im not really much of a shawn william scott dude. he was ok in dude wheres my car. the thing was i didnt think it was gonna be good because not everyone from the original cast was in it. and the dude from rookie of the year didnt really do anything. same with the dude from saving silverman, all he did was get married. na they were all funny. this is a must seen movie and a must get dvd. get it
B0000DD7LB|5.0|There are many customers out there who say that this CD is rubbish and make jokes about Britney's fourth solo release.  This CD is ambitious and follows many of the trends in music today.  To put down the material on this CD is to put down the entire hip hop and pop industry.  Although the material on this disc may seem contrite at some points, there are many instances where Britney has taken the plunge and experimented into a variety  of beats and music styles successfully.  Those putting down this CD giving it one star do not know what they are saying and probably just rate the CD like so to prove that they are not fans of Britney.  One must admit, either to him/herself that this disc, all cynicism aside, is actually pretty impressive.  The hip pop-esque beats on the CD coupled with the fantastic production and reinvented sound of the pop singer is spectacular.  For all Britney fans and those who are just catching on to Britney as an adult singer, not the teeny-bopper she once was, this CD is a must.  Though some may criticize her for her use of hip pop-like music, she cannot be picked on solely.  Looking at the direction of pop right now, including artist like Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, pop and hip pop are colliding.  Britney Spears, a woman unafraid to take chances is dipping her foot into this pool that has brought much success to her colleagues.  Although some may snicker at my comments, no one can deny the originality and appeal of some songs on this CD.  People need to stop being cynical and start getting conscious.  Just because you believe this CD is not your style, there is no need to diss this CD and say that it is entirely junk.  Again....BUY THIS CD...YOU WON&quot;T BE SORRY!!  don't listen to the cynics
B00009TB5G|5.0|Wow this by far the coolest DVD I have in my collection.  The new scenes and extended ones really show more of what is happening and helps explain more in the story.  Any way the special features are out of this world, there are more than 3 maybe 4 hours of documentaries and cast and crew features.  THis is the best of the 2 movies {Return of the KIng isn't out yet} so far, yet not saying the first one was bad it just didn't have this much action or multiple story lines.  IN the words of the comic book guy on the Simpsons \\"Best DVD ever.\\" Buy the Fellowship extended as well, so you can make your friends jealous...hehe.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This set is a monster of a set.  I don't know of any other way to put it.  For any fan of the series, this set is a MUST own.  Others before me have already gone into detail of the plots of each film, so I'll focus my views on the extras.  It has taken me almost one week to go through everything this set has to offer (5+ hours of viewing a day).  The second disc of each film is a great treat as it exposes each film's creative process from pre-production all the way to post-production and offers a lot of insight from just about everyone (I paticularly enjoyed Cameron's apparant fustrastion about the production crew taking a break everytime the tea cart rolled in).  The commentaries are also top notch.  Even if your not a fan of listening to commentary tracks, listen to the Aliens commentary, which combines Cameron (Director), Gale Ann Herd (Producer), Alec Gillis (Creature Effects Designer), Carrie/Christopher Hein (Newt/Timmy), Micheal Beihn (Hicks), Bill Paxton (Hudson), Lance Hendrickson (Bishop), and the actress who played Vasquez (can't recall her name at the moment).  It is a dynamic and entertaining track and is just awesome.<br />All in all - buy this set if you have ANY interest in the series.

630027120X|4.0|Me gusta la pelcula de La Misin porque la representacin de los indgenas. Pero es muy triste situacin porque los indgenas sufran mucha opresin. La pelcula representacin realidad de su vida.   <BR>En la pelcula, \\"La Misin\\" durante la poca colonial, los indgenas tuvieron una comunidad arriba de las cataratas.

El obispo en la pelcula crea que era necesario que los guaranis volvieran a la selva y dejaran su pueblo o comunidad.

B0000E1WKE|1.0|I should have known better than to listen to the so-called music experts and critics who stated that this is a good CD.  It is overproduced, Whitney screams a lot, and it lacks reverence and depth.  The only bright spot is &quot;Who Would Imagine A King?&quot; <br />Don't be a fool like me and waste your money.  I am so sorry I bought this CD.
0345452577|3.0|I'm a long-time Kellerman fan, but I didn't care as much for this novel.  It is extremely slow-paced, which is not necessarily a bad thing if there is some feeling of direction or plot movement, but it seemed missing here to me.  The story seemed meandering and obscure, and I didn't find the characters to be compelling.
B000089RVX|1.0|Never bought this CD, just borrowed it. It's exactly how I predicted... predictable. It just furthers my belief that today's youth knows crap about music, and flocks toward these pseudo-dark pop rock songs from another band that (again) has mastered the art of conformity.<br />The only good music in the last 5 years has come from already established bands from the early 90's... and even some of them have drifted to the medocrity of mainstream radio (like Our Lady Peace and Live, when &quot;Naveed&quot; by OLP and &quot;Secret Samadhi&quot; by Live were friggin brilliant).<br />What happened to all the unique writers and voices out there? I guess they died with Jeff Buckley in 1997.<br />Bands WORTH spending money on, for they will completely open up a new world of rock to fans of this: Our Lady Peace &quot;Naveed&quot;, Live &quot;Secret Samadhi&quot;, The Fire Theft, Ours &quot;Distorted Lullabies&quot;, Jeff Buckley &quot;Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot;.<br />Oh, I'm sorry, you want &quot;hard rock&quot;? Ok, go get yourself some early Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, or STP. They're the last remnants of honest true hard rock.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I've know this movie since my childhood and I never fell out of love with it.<BR>It's so intelligent and politically incorrect, I feel certain it wouldn't have been made today. The musical numbers are terrific and exciting, and the dialogues, especially the ones between Fosse's alter ego and Death are legendary. It's interesting to catch a glimpse of what it's really like in show business as well.<BR>Roy Scheider was never given a better chance to prove his worth and he does it wonderfully. Everybody has great moments but it's the movie that stands out on its own, thanks to Fosse's directing. If only it has been him to give us the movie version of Chicago...
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Though this a beautiful piece, there seems to be many hints of the previous two musical themes from(FOTR + TT) without really striking out on it's own direction.  Granted the point of the third installment is to weave the various threads together and provide a final climax.  None the less, the subtlety of many of the themes are quite poignant and use a &quot;less is more&quot; mentality...wish there had been more and then realize, hey....I'm dead an not even in the third movie. No wonder I don't like it as much!
0790730960|5.0|When I saw the first Batman by Tim Burton I thought for sure that the sequel wouldn't be as good, because it so often isn't. I was therefore very surprised to love this one much more.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer is one of my favorite actresses, because I always found fascinating the tough-girl-but-good-person aura she gives. I love the combination of that with the character of Cat woman, who's all that plus the vulnerability, the body, the shiny suit, the one liners, the acrobatics, the whip...It's so bloody exciting! If I was an actress I would kill for a part like that. As I am not, I admit I wish I WAS like that!<br />Also, it's a movie full of unforgettable lines, something that seems to have gone out the window when the golden era of actresses like Joan Crawford was over, lines like \\"I don't know about you miss Kitty, but I feel so much yummier\\", and \\"You can never have too much power\\", not to mention the dialog about the dangers of mistletoe that takes place between Batman and Cat woman.<br />One of the best movies ever made and certainly my favorite as far as Tim Burton's movies go.
B000002IOW|5.0|What a refreshing album. this isn't what most Rush fans know them for, but this is quite an album. this album leans more toward the structure of the song rather than prog rock chops or synthesizer excess. This is a very well-written, deftly executed Rush album. My favorites are Show Don't Tell, Chain Lightning, Hand Over Fist, The Pass, and Superconductor. Get this album but understand that Rush is a constantly changing band.
0800141849|5.0|I have a knack for knowing whether I'll like a movie just by watching the trailer. I'm hardly ever wrong, so I didn't watch this movie when it came out.<BR>It was one of those instances when a trailer turns out to be a wonderful movie's worst enemy, depicting it in such a light that I actually thought \\"Oh no, not another Barbra Streisand movie, where she weeps about how ugly she thinks she is, all the while making love to gorgeous men, and then the guy is unfaithful to her, please God no\\". I was traumatized by that movie of hers starring Robert Redford and nothing will induce me to watch anything like that again.<br />Having finally watched it, almost by accident on television, I think I like it much more than \\"The Prince of Tides\\", which I really loved. Her character is a wonderful, fascinating person, with a full life and great things to offer - who, among many other characteristics, also happens to feel lonely and inadequate at times, and has dreams about finding Prince Charming, no matter how late in life. I wish she was always this cool. She never gave me the feeling she was being full of herself, or neurotic about it in any way, not ever.<br />Jeff Bridges' character is a great guy, who is so damaged by prior relationships that he isn't thinking straight anymore. The way their love affair unravels is something to marvel at, it's so sensitive and clever.<br />It's a wonderful surprise for those who, like me, thought Streisand would never stop feeling sorry for herself.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I just got done watching David Lynch's \\" Mulholland Drive\\" and it was a simply breathtaking film. Not since Donnie Darko have I seen a film such well written and acted. The directing by Lynch is beautiful, making this movie seem like a dream at times. The plot is very confusing so im not going to explain it, just go out and rent it for yourself. Needless to say this is my first Lynch film, and it was a great experience. I wish i would have discovered him sooner..<BR>Rated R for Violence, Disturbing images, Language, and Strong sexualtiy/nudity
B000088E6D|1.0|Hey we don't need more bad singers to sing good songs, we already have Barry Manilow &amp; now Rod Stewart ruining the standards.  This guy must be joking adding a techno dance beat to Fever!  This cd is a good joke but not a serious listen.  It's half parody half insult to the great singer sof teh past.  I'm only 16 years old and I can tell the difference between this garbage and per say a real singer of standards like Tony Bennett.  Skip this and save yourself from a uncontralable laugh attack!!!

B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is tough to explain. I love it, but find it hard to watch at times. This film seems to invoke feelings of isolation, depression, and sheer wierdness within the viewer (at least me as a viewer). It is truly a nightmare (imagine, as you watch, that this was a dream you had last night and that you have just awakened from that dream). I think that David Lynch did a great job with the imagery, sounds, etc... If hell has a waiting room, the land of ERASERHEAD is it. It's where things just are the way they are and there really isn't any escape. The characters in the movie are set fixtures who will never be anything more than they are. It is a world darker than most people's reality. I hope that soon this film will make it to the DVD market because it is truly a great film, although, not for all (and I can understand that). A close match for this film in my opinion is Santa Sangre directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky.
0451169514|4.0|I thought this book was great, just that it was overly long. I mean the was tons tons of description. But besides the massaive amount of reading this book was really good. Gory, foul , and entertaing. What more could ya ask for?
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Well I have seen this movie in theaters not really knowing what to expect. Well it was totally action packed to say the least. It was a mixture of horror and thriller. Just think \\" The Matrix\\" but with vampires and lycans and you got it.The Special effects and the make up was top notch. The dark scenes were excellent but it was not a Romeo and Juniet love story at all. It was more of a battle till the end with the Vampires and Lycans. I went out of the movie theatre in complete shock it was such a great movie nothing that I have ever seen before, I hughly recommend you go out and buy this awesome thriller, you won't be dissapointed!!! g2g Peace Out!!!!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I have seen all 53 of Hitchcock's films and this one stands out in my mind the most. who would of thought that a movie could be so absorbing and suspenseful if the whole story took place on one set? only hitchcock could create such masterpiece. given to any other director and this story would have fallen apart in the first scene, it takes genius to do what he did.<br />this movie has everything: sex, betrayal, humor, murder, nudity, and all seen through a handy pair of binoculars. you won't be dissapointed with this thriller! watch this movie, and i promise you'll think differently about the people next door.
B00000JZIK|5.0|Before the dime drops (or should I say the cup of coffee) at the end of the film, I felt that I had already seen a great movie. And then we find out the significance of the name of the manufacturer of bulletin boards. By the time the last word of the film was spoken, my jaw dropped in amazement. This is an extraordinary film. A film that asks the old question: How can we be sure about the truth of anything? Are things true because we simply believe the teller, who might be a consummate liar? Or do we believe the teller because he tells us what we want to hear? <br />I'm going to stop there because this is not an artsy, philosophical film. This is a suspenseful, action-packed, and strangely-funny movie that has as a PLOT DEVICE our susceptibility to believe what we want to belive--it is not the THEME of the movie. And what a plot device! I can't say any more without giving the story away. <br />So I'll go on to the performances. Yes, Kevin Spacey is great, and all that Academy Award worthiness stuff. But the other actors were overlooked, at least by the critics. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin all do a great job, but Benicio Del Toro's role as Fenster is nothing less than a tour de force! Pete Postlethwaite turns in his standard excellence. Rouding out the cast are the always surprising Dan Hedaya and Giancarlo Esposito--two actors that I think deserve better recognition than they've gotten so far.<br />Behind it all is an unbelieveably tight script and Bryan Singer's masterful direction. This is a must see movie for lovers of crime, action, mystery films, and a must see for anyone who enjoys the type of rare film that is well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, which is something that is not usual for movies today.
