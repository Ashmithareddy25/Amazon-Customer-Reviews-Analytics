B000I0QL82|5.0|This was a gift but the recepient made me watch too.  I am glad they did.  It is a GREAT film and the DVD I ordered was in wonderful condition.  Although, we may wear it out since we'll be watching this film so much.  :)
0307949486|3.0|Mikael Blomkvist is part owner of the magazine Milenium and an journalist. When he publishes an article in Milenium exposing Wennerstrom as a crook, Blomkvist is put on trial for libel.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a free lance researcher for a security company. Henrik Vanger hires the security company to find out about Blomkvist. Vanger wants to know what kind of journalist Blomkvist is before he hires him to investigate the disappearance of his neice 30 years ago. Salander is assigned to dig up everything on Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />Everyone wants to know--is Blomkvist really guilty and what happended to Harriet Vanger.<br /><br />There were some descriptive violent scenes--so if you're sensitive to that I don't recommend this book. It is not fact-paced, in fact I'd almost call it a laid back mystery. I wouldn't call it a thriller--not fast-paced enough. I could tell by the flow that it was written in another language in another country. It was a page turner with some twists but with sufficient breaks that I could put it down from time to time. Definitely interesting and different.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Trust me, this movie is a waste of time. Slow, dull, and boring. If you want a movie where you yourself have to draw conclusions on every single detail then this is the one for you. No direct plot and other than the first scene and some action scenes, this movie was terrible. Don't believe me??? (here are my movie faves)<br /><br />Citizen Kane<br />Gladiator<br />Inception<br />The Patriot<br />Troy<br />Titanic<br /><br />here are my worst<br /><br />Joes Apt, Catfish, Drive, What's Your Number, any tyler perry flick
B006UG90RM|4.0|At last! A real Van Halen album!  I've been waiting for this album since 1982 (1984 sucks).  I saw my 1st concert ever when I was 15 at the Palace Theater in Albany in 1978.  Journey, Montrose, and some unknown band called Van Halen?  Tickets were $7.50.  Walked into the theater with my stepbrother,  not knowing what I would see or hear and I heard an \\"eruption.\\"  Since that night Van Halen was always my #1 band.  Blew the other 2 bands away.  When 1984 came out (their most commercial album) I really didn't like it.  They lost the \\"old\\" feel.  I did like the Sammy years (I like Chickenfoot) but I always longed the old VH. The 1st VH album to me is the greatest rock and roll album ever...<br /><br />So it's 2012 and we get \\"A Different Kind Of Truth.\\"  Finally.  And here I am almost 50.  Better late than never I guess.  I do miss Mike Anthony though on vocals.  \\"You And Your Blues,\\" \\"As Is\\" and \\"The Trouble With Never\\" he's really missed on the background vocals.  Yet these tunes still manage to rock.  \\"Tattoo\\" is a great intro single for the album.  People talk about the video but my mindset is in '79.  David Lee Roth has lost some of his range.  But to me this is Van Halen the way it's suppose to be.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" should have been on VHII.  It's a great tune.  I hear a little \\"Ice Cream Man\\" in there.  \\"Honeybabiesweetiedoll' starts off with Eddie doing his guitar thing.  Enjoy hearing the dog bark too on this tune.  \\"Outta Space\\" and \\"Big River\\" are just classic VH rockers.  Very enjoyable.<br /><br />So yes.  I really think this album rocks.  I am looking forward to seeing them in Boston and in New Hampshire in March.  (Oh I hope they play \\"D.O.A\\" and \\"Hear About It Later\\")...:)
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Purchased 405cx after a long break from  Garmin.  This 405cx got very light scratch along inside of metal band the screen ended up cracking $110 to replace. Scratch probably came from a jacket zipper.  Now one of the buttons has fallen out. I can stick it back in to operate watch however it isn't waterproof now. Garmin. In the past I have had Garmin 101, Polar, Timex and Suunto. My Suunto has been robust, Suunto has been great about repairs but doesn't support Ant+.  Polar was very solid, however is not Ant+. Timex is so-so with reliability. just be careful with the 405cx seems like it is not very sturdy.  51 years old - Sports Triathlon and Winter Biathlon
B004RE29PO|5.0|This release on bluray is incredible, first because of the story and cast and also because it has extra footage from the film. I recommend this disc for sci-fi fanciers.
B0073CNGCC|5.0|The characters are so well written and acted. The show is beautiful. You really feel like you are in that time period. You will be totally hooked.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is highly additive. the flying is balanced nicely, solid through and through.  I'm glad I got it free BUT would easily pay for it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. Very very very fun to play even though I am not all that good at it yet. LOL
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Soo glad I grabbed this app for free but it is worth the full price! When I finish this version I will buy part 2! Recommended!
B0072QPV6I|5.0|I saw this when it was released in theaters for one day (Feb 1, 2012) and the movie basically made me feel like I was high the whole time. The footage was amazing, the sound was superb, the music choice was great, and that Japanese chick they followed around was pretty hot!<br /><br />There is one issue, though: the giant creepy clown faces that sing along to a couple parts near the beginning and at the end. I don't even find clowns scary or creepy at all, but these ones were definitely creepy. It might make someone in a... fragile state of mind go to some bad places... if you catch my drift.<br /><br />That said, I do not have a copy of the Blu Ray, so I can not comment on the extras. But it was such a good film that I intend to purchase the Blu Ray as soon as I can.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|You'll never hear a perfect RING. There are just too many variables, options, and difficulties, plus it's an organic entity that takes 15+ hours to stage. So the law of averages automatically kicks in: when you've got more things that can go wrong, more will.<br /><br />And so it is with its multitudinous recordings. Among the live versions, the earlier ones (Furtwaengler, Krauss, Knappertsbusch) suffer from murky sound, while even those in decent stereo (Keilberth, Boehm, Sawallisch, Barenboim) feature thuds, clunks, and assorted live-performance anomalies that grow less endearing with each listening. As for the studio recordings, they're variously undermined by continuity problems (Solti, Karajan), subpar singing (Swarowsky), or deficiencies in tension and energy (Levine, Haitink).<br /><br />Which brings us to this Marek Janowski set. I first reviewed it for Amazon in February 2005, and I'm now updating that review. One of the great unheralded achievements of the waning LP era, Janowski's was the first all-digital RING, recorded in just 2½ efficient years during the early 80s. Later the same decade it was the first version to debut on CD, at the top of the 90s a mid-price edition emerged, then a dirt-cheap reissue marked its first appearance in the 21st century ... and finally here it is again, pricewise an even more astonishing bargain. After several return visits down through the years, I'm ready to call it the cycle with the fewest things wrong and the most right.<br /><br />First off, it's registered in clean, ungussied digital stereo of exceptional radiance and lucidity - massed strings can be a tad opaque, hinting at its pioneer status, otherwise the color and fine detail are ravishing, plus the whole event has the definite feel of being recorded in long takes: it offers the commitment and intensity of a live performance minus the wrong notes and stage noises. Second, it showcases lithe, athletic playing from Dresden's underpublicized but authentically great orchestra - strings turn on a dime, woodwind staccati are needle sharp, brass are lean and subtly integrated. In contrast to their only continental peers in this repertory - the Vienna PO with its creamy sweetness and the Berlin PO with its iron power - the Dresdeners favor sheen, transparency, and fast reflexes, lightning as well as thunder. Yes, they can whip up a glowering storm in the SIEGFRIED Act III prelude, but you'll never hear a Rhine journey with more wit, sparkle, and agility.<br /><br />Janowski's propulsive conducting is invaluable for two main reasons. 1) Beyond projecting the RING's well-known tempests and tensions, he also puts over its comedy and irony - the teasing mischief of the Rhinemaids, the gallows humor during the valkyrie confab, the sad silliness of the nibelung squawkfest in SIEGFRIED II iii. 2) He's continually alert to Wagner's dramaturgy, to its narrative ebb, flow, and movement toward crisis. Janowski's pacing is ideal at the great turning points - Alberich stealing the gold, Erda's intervention when Wotan won't give up the ring (Solti is oblivious here), the mounting violence in Siegfried's meeting with the Wanderer (here Karajan is gingerly), the tension gathering under Siegfried's narrative in GOETTERDAEMMERUNG III ii as he incriminates himself step by step. This is purposeful, goal-oriented conducting that I suspect even Wagner himself would have admired.<br /><br />The cast, too, is exemplary. For one thing, it's a true ensemble with the same talent staying on board to the finish: out of 12 recurring roles, 11 are single cast (sole exception: Mime, not fatally disruptive). Plus these singers, with unbeaten consistency, are both listenable and characterful. The set's original manufacturer, Ariola-Eurodisc, was a major player during the decade prior, recording both operatic rarities (Schubert, Orff) and standards (FIDELIO, CARMEN). Eurodisc had the budgets to sign up the biggest names, and here even bit parts can be stunninglycast - Kurt Moll as Hunding, Lucia Popp and Hanna Schwarz as Rhinemaidens, Cheryl Studer and Ruth Falcon as walkueren. A couple of the supporting players are routine - Stryczek's rough-and-ready Donner, Noecker's decently sung but undercharacterized Gunther - otherwise Siegmund Nimsgern is the optimum Alberich, a full-bodied character baritone with a genuine legato and a meaty high G, while Peter Schreier doubles Loge and the SIEGFRIED Mime with imagination, gusto, and (gasp) real singing.<br /><br />And so it goes: Jessye Norman and Siegfried Jerusalem are a Sieglinde and Siegmund competitive with anybody's, Yvonne Minton a Fricka of icy loveliness, Ortrun Wenkel intense and specific as Erda and Waltraute, Norma Sharp cool and pretty as both Gutrune and the woodbird, while a young Matti Salminen turns in the most baleful Hagen since Frick - and a Fafner so innately cavernous, his dragon scarcely needs any special miking. As for the three leads, our Wotan is Theo Adam, who probably clocked more stage hours in the role than anybody in Wagner history. By the time of the recording he'd logged 22 RING seasons, but his high bass still has plenty to offer - interpretive savvy, trusty top notes, dead-center intonation. WALKUERE III iii finds the old pro in below-form voice, struggling for focus and steadiness; elsewhere, surprisingly, his sound is sometimes firmer than fifteen years earlier under Boehm (compare the \\"Abendlich strahlt\\" in RHEINGOLD). Overall he's a rugged, patriarchal Wotan and he catches the curve of the character superbly, politician, rageaholic, and shaman.<br /><br />As his daughter Bruennhilde, California soprano Jeannine Altmeyer has been shamefully undervalued down through the years. I heard her LA Isolde in the mid 80s, and trust me, this is a big, carrying voice. Stack her against her recent peers: she has a fuller, steadier instrument than Behrens, a lovelier sound than Marton, the upper extension that Dernesch hadn't, and Jones's caterwauling is beneath discussion. No, she hasn't the slash and bite of dominatrix Bruennhildes like Nilsson and Varnay; instead she offers page after page of fresh, supple, centered sound, you pick the note. She's the aural equivalent of the young, willowy Bruennhilde in Arthur Rackham's watercolors, and it's high time we noticed: Altmeyer is the valkyrie easiest on the ears.<br /><br />Lastly Rene Kollo's contributions are arguably his most valuable on disc. As John Culshaw once wrote, we must think of the younger Siegfried \\"as a youth instead of an adult,\\" so dark-timbred tenors such as Melchior, Suthaus, and Windgassen can present big credibility problems. Kollo is near ideal: his silver sound is mainstream lyric tenor - even chest tones preserve a basic leanness and lucidity - but its fine-line definition means unexpected carrying power and maneuverability; in short, he's persuasively youthful yet he can cut through heavy orchestration. Some soft passages, though, catch him thinning the support out of the voice (e.g., \\"Es sangen die Voeglein\\" in SIEGFRIED I i), but it's still a splendid achievement, vividly phrased, both mercurial and meditative. And he's fine, too, as his elder self in GOETTERDAEMMERUNG, though not quite as indispensable.<br /><br />All of which, taken together, accounts for this RING's front-to-back superiority - digital stereo of documentary directness and transparency; podium leadership that articulates narrative structure while projecting not only its passion and poignance but (rare indeed) its comedy and irony; and a repertory casting policy that generates both good sound and plausible characterization. Yes, a couple of the bit players are substandard, but the leads are astonishingly persuasive - Adam's leonine Wotan, Altmeyer's mellifluous Bruennhilde, and several who are arguably Best in Stereo: Kollo's Siegfried, Nimsgern's Alberich, Norman's Sieglinde, Schreier's Mime, Salminen's Fafner and Hagen. In short, it's the All-Purpose RING - ideal for thefirst-time listener who really hopes the epic will make sense, excellent for the score-in-hand professional who wants a clear, dependable reference edition that actually does what his score says. For me it's the version that has stood up best under repeated listening; so treat it as your basic set, then supplement it, if you like, with choice alternatives - Karajan's WALKUERE, say, or Solti's GOETTERDAEMMERUNG, or Krauss's mono edition.<br /><br />Sony's bare-bones packaging offers cast and track lists but no synopsis or libretto. Not a problem. For under $20 Amazon can sell you WAGNER'S RING OF THE NIBELUNG by Stewart Spencer et al. (ISBN 0500281947), a reader-friendly modern translation complete with beneficial annotations, commentaries, and background material.eneath discussion.

B00656C6KK|5.0|If you are a Doris fan, you will adore this album.<br /><br />I adored every song and was in tears listening to one particular track which features her son. Doris' voice is so beautiful, she has a certain allure and charm in her voice which makes you want to day-dream and drift away. There is not one song I dislike on this album. I felt everything was perfect
B006UG90RM|5.0|In reading other reviews and I had to write one myself. First off I love it on the first review the guy acts like he's a huge fan and rates every song. On the second track he states it sounded familiar (guitar) and it was out of the 80's. Well let me help you and everyone out. That song along w/three others on the new album are off the original Van Halen Demo from 1976 (This is the one Gene Simmons drooled all over and wanted to sign them right now)and musically they are almost exact to the original. So it's a little more mid-70's than 80's. I would bet almost every track but Tattoo is from the Van Halen vault.If you listen you can hear Diver Down,Fair Warning,Women and Children First,etc.<br />The biggest thing about this album is the reunion. Dave is the best front man to ever be in a band,hands down! I did not say best singer. The band is at its best w/Dave. I'm not talking album sales. Real fans who grew up w/Van Halen know what I'm talking about.<br />In conclusion this is a great album for any die hard VH fan.
1843106698|5.0|This book is very well written with everything a parent would need to know about Asberger's.  I was standing inside of a Barnes & Noble when I ordered it because it was much cheaper on Amazon, but I was anxious to get started reading it.  To my surprise, it was delivered 2 days ahead of schedule.  Excellent book, Very fast delivery.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This film is beautifully crafted and the performances are excellent - Ryan Gosling is amazing in his understated subtlety as the Driver.  It really is a classic fairy tale - the hero attempts to rescue the damsel in distress - along with her child.  I love the quiet passion between Driver and Irene - it's a love story told in a very unique, beautiful way.  The graphic violence is difficult to watch but necessary to show the rage within the Driver - we never know his name or his story but Gosling does an incredible job of showing the vulnerability and tenderness within his heart - without saying much at all.  Loved this film!!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|It was a wonderful movie. I enjoyed it completely. The story line held your interest and the acting was superb.  I am sure I will watch this over and over.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Some of the reviews were negative and I had my fears but the case looked to be what I wanted.  Fortunately I was correct in ordering this case, it is exactly what I wanted.  It's light yet does exactly what I want as far as protecting my Kindle.  I like that it easily folds open and around so that with one hand I can hold and read my kindle in bed at night.  That is mainly how I use my Kindle.<br /><br />I'm sure you'll like this cover too, it's just what the good Kindle needs.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of the best movies out there today! I saw it in the theatre, and could not have been more happy to spend the time and money on such a wonderful, uplifting, and challenging movie. Love it!!!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I've read this twice now, and enjoyed it each time. If you enjoy Bourdain's television work, you should love this. It probably catches him at his most honest and revealing, likely because you get the sense that he had no idea that this book would take off like it did, and certainly couldn't imagine the new career it would lead him to. It's strange to read him describing a trip to Japan as if it was a once in a lifetime experience, knowing that a few years later he'd be doing things like that on a regular basis.<br /><br />It's a fascinating look at the world of a chef, and the type of individuals that world attracts. If you never realized how complicated the process is that allows us to enter a restaurant and enjoy a meal, your eyes will be opened. It's amazing that all this comes together countless time a day, every day, all around the world.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I am only 50 pages in and already love the character development and story.  It reminds me of American Gods which is a phenomenal book.  I must admit that being half-Irish with red hair biases me towards the story and characters :-)<br /><br />Plus if you've seen Hellboy II you will recognize some of the peoples and names.<br /><br />Robbie
B0054JZC6E|4.0|super cool game. Take my advice and go ahead and by it already!!! the only reason I don't rate this game 5 stars is cause of the pop ups. Otherwise, AWESOMENESSS!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very polished version... Multiple modes add value and replay value. Best graphics I've seen in this genre. Got it as the free app of the day, but it's worth the price to a fan of the game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is the best paid game ever. I say that you should get it. Its addicting.  get agoing nuts now
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. very useful and easy to use. this is better than the one I use for my iphone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok.I'm not the best at video games, but these seemed simple enough.they're kind of difficult though which keeps you hooked til you win:)
B00008CLNQ|4.0|This is a good Brahms cycle and would please any Brahms collection.<br />We can find here the typical Karajan style of conducting of that years.<br />Precision, clarity and brilliance of sound, but a bit of lack in deepness.<br />Karajan made earlier recordings of Symphonies 1 and 3 for DECCA with the<br />Wiener Philharmoniker that are really thrilling and much more preferable.<br />Would have been desirable to complete a cycle with these forces for that<br />seal. Whatever, this is a good cycle, but there are for sure better<br />alternatives (Sanderling, Klemperer or Levine)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so fun i like the basketball game and the one where you throw the thing
B002P7BQQS|5.0|Jim Parsons (Sheldon Cooper) should have won an Emmy award for this episode.  I felt this was one of the funniest conclusions of any sitcom I've watched.

The charcters are amazing and Enzo quickly worms his way into your heart. Overall its a great read and I would and have recommended it to all of my friends.
B005POK858|4.0|Well made game, feels alot like the earlier final fantasy games. Takes a long time to play through, which is a good thing.
B004QL7K6G|4.0|After missing \\"The State\\" when it was on the air, I became a fan of David Wain when \\"Stella\\" hit Comedy Central in 2005. From there I went back and visited Wet Hot American Summer and Role Models. Wet Hot American Summer is a classic while Role Models is humorous but just slightly better than average overall. Expectations were honestly pretty low for Wanderlust. The trailers were mostly just toilet humor (literally) and what appeared to be your everyday modern couple going to live with a group of hippies. How good could that be? It's probably because expectations were so low that Wanderlust is as great as it turned out to be.<br /><br />George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are moving to New York to follow their dreams. Well, George is reluctantly moving there while Linda follows her dreams. Now they find themselves with a studio apartment (oh excuse me, a \\"micro-loft\\") that is incredibly tiny and massively expensive. But things get rough when Linda's hopes get washed down the drain and George loses his job. George's brother Rick (Ken Marino) has a job waiting for George, but they're all the way in Atlanta. Leaving their dreams behind, George and Linda go on a road trip and stop at Elysium before reaching their destination. Elysium is unlike anything George and Linda have ever experienced before as everyone shares everything, is so open with one another, and even believes in free love. As everything that could go wrong does, George and Linda are faced with the decision of continuing to live in the city for the technology and advancements they love or moving to the country, being stripped of that technology, and feeling happier than they can ever remember.<br /><br />One could argue that Wanderlust uses the same formula over and over involving raunchy jokes and dialogue and featuring the most nudity of any film in your recent memory. That may be the case, but if you're familiar with David Wain's humor then this should come as no surprise. You probably know what you're getting yourself into and you're either a fan of his work or you hate it (but then why would you be seeing this anyway?). Wanderlust is labeled as a comedy and if it makes you laugh, then it's done its job. If anything, this is actually a return to form for both Wain and the majority of the cast of \\"The State.\\"<br /><br />The film throws you headfirst into hilarity as the \\"breaking the apartment in the old fashioned way\\" scene is kind of a warm-up for what's to come. George's sarcasm is what will more than likely win you over the most while Linda's inability to commit to any sort of career causes her character to be pretty unpredictable. Elysium is a gold mine of eccentric characters; the most noteworthy being Wayne (Joe Lo Truglio) the nudist and Seth (Justin Theroux). Wayne's nude habits will either have you in tears from laughing so hard or cause you to turn away in disgust while Seth's outdated technology references, his ability to loiter around doorways out of sight and selfish tendencies are hilarious in their own right. Paul Rudd's mirror scene is what you'll remember the most though as you'll be laughing for a good two or three minutes straight from that scene alone.<br /><br />Wanderlust does get pretty outlandish in its second half, but it isn't exactly the most grounded concept to begin with. There are several dream-like sequences that are fantastically surreal. The two that come to mind are Linda's peyote-like trip during the trust circle and George's fly dream. The fly dream is actually one of my favorite scenes in the movie since it's just so bizarre and random yet manages to fit the flow of the movie somehow.<br /><br />The R-rated comedy does have its shortcomings though. Rick is easily the most annoying character to be featured in any film so far in 2012. You'll breathe a sigh of relief once his story arc is resolved. The other main one is the film's conclusion. It feels a bit generic when all of the raunchiness is dropped for heartfeltspeeches and the struggle to do what's right. Everything still comes together in a logical sense, but it's in a way that seems so familiar which is kind of a letdown. The transition just doesn't feel as smooth as it should.<br /><br />Wanderlust is vulgar, obscene, littered with jiggling unclothed man and lady parts, and downright disgusting at times, but it's laugh out loud funny because of all of these things. The story may be a bit lacking in parts, but your laughter will drown out whatever flaws the movie may have. While Wanderlust may not be for everyone, it certainly soars and caters to those who love this type of comedy.speeches and the struggle to do what's right. Everything still comes together in a logical sense, but it's in a way that seems so familiar which is kind of a letdown. The transition just doesn't feel as smooth as it should.<br /><br />Wanderlust is vulgar, obscene, littered with jiggling unclothed man and lady parts, and downright disgusting at times, but it's laugh out loud funny because of all of these things. The story may be a bit lacking in parts, but your laughter will drown out whatever flaws the movie may have. While Wanderlust may not be for everyone, it certainly soars and caters to those who love this type of comedy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not usually a fan of post-apocalytic sci-fi, but I loved this series. At first I was not sure how I would like it, but for the omnibus price, I figured it was worth a shot. By the end of the first story, I was hooked. Characters are well written, the science and technology is pretty solid, the sociology of the silo is well thought out. Everything seemed plausable- I never got that jarring sensation that something wasn't \\"realistic\\" enough- no suspension of disbelief needed!  I would definitely recommend this. Would love to read more.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky One is one of my favorie books.  I highly recommend this to anyone who will take the the time to read it, especially hopeless romantics.  The characters are very well-developed. The three main characters are: Logan Thibault, Clayton(cop), and Beth.  Beth is the woman whom Logan finds a picture of, and keeps it with him. The picture gives him good luck, so he must find her. Logan eventually finds her, and gets a job where she works.  They start going to dinner and doing things together.  Ben(Beth's son) gets really close to Logan, and likes him as a dad.  Logan Thibault is my favorite character in this book, because he has a heart, and is very kind.  Clayton is my least favorite, because he is mean, rude, and tries to ruin everything.  He stalks Beth and any guy she has, he runs them off with a threat.  While reading this book, I felt like I knew everyone as a friend.  I was never bored reading this book, infact I never wanted to put it down.  Nicholas Sparks kept my attention by just making the book very interesting.  He doesn't rush anything to let you know exactly what the ending will be, but he gives you just enough information to make you keep reading.  The book ended just the way it should have.  No improvements could be made, it was actually my favorite part of the book.  So, anyone looking for a good book, I recommend The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks to you.

B0042EJD8A|4.0|Gasland is a great entertaining piece of work, it just lacks a though overview of the facts. This may seem like a major flaw except that if it did give you all the facts it probably would not be all that entertaining and would not be viewed by as many people and thus would not be at the center of much controversy.<br />  In my book Gasland says a lot that needs to be said. It flows very well and brings up a lot of legitimate concerns that are very important.<br />  Bottom line, I would recommend, and have, this film to anyone, but if your looking for proof then you shouldn't be looking in the documentary section anyway. There called books and google. Do you own research, but Gasland is a good place to start.
B00008DDHZ|4.0|It's 1972 and group of Catholics from Derry, Northern Island are planning a peaceful demonstration on the lines of Martin Luther King's peaceful civil rights marches in the 1960's. This march will help bring attention to the plight of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.  The British Army is prepared to stop and derail the march in any way possible. The result is the bloody Sunday massacre.<br />BLOODY SUNDAY is a hard movie to watch. Emotions run high knowing this is a story based on an actual tragedy that will always be in the hearts of Northern Irish Catholics.<br />Director Paul Greengrass  does a remarkable job of making the film seem like an actual live newscast of events. We see the planning of the march from the Irish side and the plans by the British soldiers to stop the demonstration. Although it's clear that Greengrass is tilted toward the Northern Irish viewpoint, it is hard to fault him. Whatever the exact causes of the massacre, there is no doubt that innocent people were killed that day.<br /><br />The march is set to be peaceful but as always, a few hooligans hoping to stir up trouble and incite the British are in the group.The British soldiers are determined to stop the march and some are actually looking for revenge over the death of some fellow soldiers.<br /><br />BLOODY SUNDAY is a \\"You are there as it happens\\" film. This makes the film all the more realistic and unnerving. This is not a fictionalized story created in someone's mind. The camera work is jittery just as if someone were following around participants as things happen. There is no transition because the  film goes back and forth from the Northern Irish to the British and various members of both sides. It's like a few cameras are in place and we are cutting back and forth from one side to the other. IThe film is jarring in its realism and it is painful to watch knowing what is going to happen.<br /><br />The Catholics want to speak up for their civil rights in their own land. The British soldiers, for the most part, are presented as all bad and desperate for revenge. A couple soldiers seem to have a conscience and a heart but they are forced to follow the majority. In some cases, soldiers are \\"executing\\" wounded demonstrators. It is a brutally realistic film made all the more disturbing  knowing the massacre actually occured.<br /><br />James Nesbitt is a fine Irish actor who appears in many British shows and films. He stars as the Northern Irish member of Parliament organizing this peaceful protest that all ends in tragedy.<br />BLOODY SUNDAY makes the viewer wonder how all of this could have happened in the modern era. I, myself, want to find out more about this sad bit of history. What are the exact facts? Were any of the British soldiers sympathetic to the Northern Irish Catholics? What happened to the surviving participants and soldiers. Why did it go so terribly wrong?<br />Be prepared for a real heartbreaker.
1416550550|4.0|Set in Victorian times, with all the roadblocks that women endured in those days , this is a delightful read with some twists that leave you thinking about what might have been in different times .how we are all prisoners in our own ways and how human spirit rises to the occasion whenever given half a chance.Characters were well written and the storyline keeps you guessing until the end.recommended, our bookclub lived it

0060557818|3.0|I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman; enjoyed many of his books but there was just something about this one that never captured me. Maybe it's because the story felt so similar to other stories by Gaiman. Maybe it's because the main protagonist was a typical Arthur Dent. Dent being the British everyman with the bland name swept up in a strange world over which he has no control. Arthur Dent was enjoyable in his blandness but Richard Mayhew's most noticeable quality is his stupidity. He's the kind of fellow who'll tell a fire breathing dragon to his face that he has bad breath but not because he's brave; because he's just obliviously dumb.<br /><br />Richard Mayhew was just trying to live his normal, ordinary life in London when he came across a badly injured young lady while walking his girlfriend to dinner. Faced with the choice of helping the girl and losing his girlfriend or ignoring her pleas he opts to assist. As a reader of Gaiman might expect the injured girl is far more than she initially appears. She leaves the next day as it's clear she is being pursued and doesn't want to put Richard in harms way but the damage is done. Involving Richard now causes him to fade from existence. Oh, he's still there but only when Richard forcefully addresses someone can he even get them to notice him and a moments distraction will cause people to forget he's there. Richard now only truly exists in \\"London Below\\", a strange fantasy type world that overlays his own more mundane London.<br /><br />A thousands years ago Douglas Adams demonstrated that an extremely popular book could be written merely by stringing together a series of clever ideas but what CAN be done and what SHOULD be done are too different things. I've seen multiple British writers appear to try and emulate Douglas Adams without his success. Even Douglas Adams failed to recapture his earlier magic as his writing career progressed. You have to be REALLY clever to overcome a lack of story and still produce an engaging book and in this case Gaiman isn't clever enough. To those who defend the book as having a story I would argue that what it has is a vehicle for moving from one scene to the next. Not a story.<br /><br />The further into the book I read the more it failed for me. The \\"jokes\\" were predictable and bland, the characters were forgettable and the writing was way below what I expect from Gaiman. At one point the psychopathic killers Mr. Croupe and Mr. Vandemar have Richard trapped and decide not the kill him because they don't have time. This despite the fact that they absolutely did have time, reveled in killing and would have removed their last potential thorn. This is the kind of lazy writing I expect from a bad action movie not a Neil Gaiman novel.<br /><br />For me `Neverwhere' is to Neil Gaiman what `So Long and Thanks for All the Fish' was to Douglas Adams, a major misfire where you can't believe the author is the same one you've loved in the past. The final nail in the coffin was the \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" perfect Hollywood ending. Read Anansi Boys or The Graveyard Book or American Gods because they're far superior. At least it appears that Gaiman is improving since this was one of his earlier efforts.ook and in this case Gaiman isn't clever enough.

1933952806|5.0|Before I lavish praise on this book, I would like to explain that I have read 3 D7000 books, including this one and hands down this book is by far the best of all 3. It is very thorough in covering the small details and I particularly like the addition of the authors own preferences. It gives the reader a feel for why or why not to utilize the function and whether or not it would be useful to their particular circumstances. I particularly like the fact that this book is about the D7000 and not about elements of photography that should be covered in a general photography book. The author does not presume to know more about the art photography than the reader, an aspect I appreciate greatly. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I'm the end all, know all about photography, more that I bought this book to learn about the D7000 and I fully expect it to be about the D7000. Far too many technical books try to include aspects that are far too broad and do a disservice to the reader.<br />I would strongly recommend this book for both advanced and beginner Nikon users. It's inexpensive and packed full of information.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Think Rocky.  Not as stellar, but VERY well executed, acted and done.  I expected a bad script kids flick.  However, I have to hand it to the script writer and Hugh Jackman to take Rockem Sockem Robots and a father son kid stereo type arc that has been done a thousand times, and yet deliver a feel good Rocky film.  Real kudos to the kid who plays Jackman's son.  He stands up well against Jackman, which is hard to do when Jackman is a fantastic talent.  Guys like Stallone, Clooney, Jackman 'steal' every scene they are in - that is why they are stars.  In the scenes with Jackman, the kid was very talented considering who he was acting alongside.  That was no mean feat.  I'd definitely recommend this as a good movie for anyone, despite the marketing as a kid flick.  There is enough Rocky in it to make it an adult flick that most will like.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|Reel Steel is an excellent Father/Son movie that showcases the relationship between a father and a son he was unaware of.  Tugs at your heartstrings but also makes you smile at the positive message.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|Great Flick - wold recommend it to anyone without reservation.  Timberlake does such a great job, that you don't think of him as Timerlake, but as a good action actor (kind of reminded me of one of the guys from The Unit).  The class stratification and the wide gap between the haves and the have nots are extremely representative of what is happening in the U.S.  Also, the sic fi concept of living forever, and the problems it brings by making people bored and directionless, was good - though there should have been more of that.  Very good film.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|the blu-ray disc did not work after attempted playing several times. I just updated the firmware recently because other purchased discs did not work as well. I did not play disc until this week which was past date to return so I am stuck with it.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|The movie is marketed as an action film.  But that is not what you get.  I'm not sure what it was.  Art house?  Whatever.  I like the main actor as an action star.  but this movie didn't showcase his talents as such.  He's a tough guy mafia, assassin type.  It should have been a campy shoot em up plus heavy car chase mindless guy entertainment.  It wasn't.  Look, I can't fault the movie itself or the acting, only the trailers and the expectations they set - and the trailers were false advertising.  There is certainly a place for this movie.  I fault the marketing department.  They royally screwed up an thereby damaged the otherwise solid efforts of the actors, editor, director and production team.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is a well-made game and is definitely worth the price. It's long, too, unlike so many other options. I highly recommend it.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This album does something to me... it feels melancholy and hopeful all at the same time.  Instruments and sounds float about, in and out of songs, adding depth and texture to each track.  The lyrics are almost undecipherable, which is oddly almost preferred as the listener is free to interpret his or her own meaning for each song.  The entire album flows wonderfully from track to track and stirs up many emotions from beginning to end... most songs are soft but with a wide range of instrumentation and dynamics, the vocals are powerful and soothing at the same time.  This album was my first introduction to Bon Iver and I'm glad I finally got curious enough to find out what all of the fuss was about.  I will say that this album is a bit of a grower... it doesnt necessarily blow you away upon first listen, but by the second time through you can really get a feel for what they were trying to create... and it's magnificent.
B000002MY3|5.0|I love the cd and would recommend it to anyone. The case was delivered smashed and crack though. Might want to beef up your handleing along with your shipping. Thanks!!

B004T32SOK|5.0|I like being abler to access and share my content from anywhere, and I get plenty of storage space to to it
B000XAE3IM|1.0|I ordered this without seeing the reviews first, my mistake.  Thankfully Amazon is fantastic about returns. One glance at this told me it was a fake. It was lighter in size AND in color, the box packaging was pretty close to an original, but you could easily tell the quality in materials was not there.  What really sold it off as a fake was the cheap silk screening of the 'Infolithium M' text on the front of the battery and the fact that the stickers were nothing like those on the two official Sony batteries I already have. A quick search online showed me that my assessment was true and it was indeed a fake.
0143119680|4.0|It took me awhile to get into this book but I'm glad I stuck it out. I loved the character development, the unfolding and introduction of new characters and the twits the plot took. The story was solid with so many intricate details explored and lavished upon us. I'm finding that now I've finished the book, I appreciate it more. Recommend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are short but entertaining. Good for passing the time. I would definately recommend this for anyone who has time to kill.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going nuts is like my favorite app! I was addicted to it and i still am.Great for the daredevil type
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If you normally write down notes on little scraps of paper, only to lose them, you need to try Evernote. This is the best note taking app ever, and it'll sync across all of your devices. Never lose a thought or idea again. Love it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|works great on the kindle and does not fail you its worked great for me and I have used it for a long time
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Captivating!  Can't pull myself away from it. Interesting how it changes with each movement! Even my dad was very entertained!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|It was very interesting to watch this movie.  It kept me interested the whole entire time.  Best movie i have watched in a long time.

B0036S4CTS|4.0|Following 'Starter for Ten', I had high expectations for this book and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The author creates such vivid characters, you feel you know them intimately and shudder when they let you down, as Dexter often does!<br /><br />I loved the idea of moving through the years and taking a 'freeze frame' of their lives and although this was described to me in advance and I couldn't imagine how it would succeed; it did so wonderfully.<br /><br />Another great book from a great author.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|the games fine I got it for free though so I don't know if id pay five dollars for it
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Of course this album is fantastic.  But what I was writing about was the fact that when this was downloaded to my iTunes it came through as unknown artist - and tracks are only listed by number - there is no name for song.  Annoying.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|You should read this book for the details. The descriptions of the Night Circus and the multitude of tents that are inside of it are amazing. They create powerful and beautiful imagery and are dream-like.  However, the characters in the book fall flat. Celia and Marco, the two main characters, remain rather boring despite the dangerous situation and their feelings to each other. You don't ever really connect with the main characters. None of the side characters reach their full potential, as you never get a clear idea of who they are.  I found the details about the circus so good that I was able to look past the weak cast. If you need to connect with the characters and be able to understand their motives or don't like slow moving imagery, then this is not the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Has a lot of fun classic games for hours of playing. Only bad thing is you need a lot of points to unlock the last few games.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|A good not so original crime action drama with exceptional scene direction,decent action sequences,and most of all great acting by the cast,Ben Affleck best performance in a film recently, this film reminded me of the gritty crime films of the seventies,where honor among crooks is what mattered more than the crime itself,extended cut added back scenes that made the film even longer by a few minutes, I will conclude this review without giving out spoilers,with this one thing, Jeremy Renner is the man!he rocked in this one ,just like he did in S.W.A.T. and the Hurt Locker and the recent Mission Impossible 4 ,this guy could play characters with such intensity, overall The Town is solid entertainment......peace
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This CD stands up VERY WELL to repeated listening.  This is the only thing my kids have wanted to listen to in the car for the last two months, and, I must admit, I have not gotten sick of it.  Has a nice mix of live, studio, newer and older songs, sequenced in a non-chronological order, which sort of enhances the experience.  Very well reccommended to old fans, and especially a great starter CD for those who are just getting into George's solo material.
B000089RVR|4.0|I am really enjoying this CD. The songs are catchy. It's a little different from the other CD I have, No Angel, it seems more upbeat.
B00127RAJY|5.0|As an avid runner...this was a welcome and very challenging change.  I have only tried level 1 at this point and it is great.  Very tough workout but short enough to fit in when there is a time pinch.  Very sore after day 1, but feeling better every time.  Loved it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Lots of fun destroying groceries and they definately make it more difficult as you go.  I recommend  it if you like puzzle games.
B002VWNID6|4.0|Costner's \\"Robin Hood\\" isn't the most true to the books. It isn't the most accurate historically, at least as far as the myth goes. It is a delightfull movie.<br /><br />Great entertainment. Period.<br /><br />From the hell that was Jerusalem's medieval prisons, to bonds that transcend religeon and culture it has a great many messages built into the storyboard.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays a roll as Robin's guardian angel, not Freeman's usual repertoire but he excells, Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio brings most to the movie as Marion, but both Robin, Marion and the Children they eventially set forward to protect as they strive to survive and keep a rightfull king on his throne would be little to nothing without Nottingham's lenendary sherrif, who lives on in infamy. Alan Rickman, later Harry Potter's Snape, brings the role to life with what can only be looked at as toungue in cheek devilry. He seems at his most effective when threatening to wield a spoon.<br /><br />The storyboard is well written, the dialogues excellent, the backdrops and sets are the only area the movie fails in, and that's infrequent. If one knows the areas it was filmed you can see how camera angles were not always successfull in keeping the fact \\"castles\\" and \\"manors\\" were ruins, but its a minor issue.<br /><br />The scenery and special effects are otherwise excellent, even after a decade they show little age.<br /><br />There isn't really anything in the movie I'd say was inappropriate for kids, and as inexpensive as it now is it might be a shame not to own it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Addicting and Fun<br />Just started playing this game this morning. I am impressed by its lively pace and its crisp graphics. the controls are crisp and responsive. sorry that I had to work all day.<br />So far the game has been fun.
B000267ZB4|5.0|Great CD, great interpretation, fantastic trio. Hugo Diaz was an extremely gifted musician. I recommend other tango CD by his trio. They may be expensive due to their rarity, but they are worth their price. Hugo Diaz also plays folklore music from Argentina, but his sound is much better fitted for tango music, of which he's a top interpreter.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|For anyone like myself who, over the years following Master of Puppets, has lost interest in Metallica and their increasingly shoddy releases, this will likely drive the final nail in the coffin.  What a shame, because Death Magnetic was almost a great return to form for one of the (once) greatest metal bands in history.  This is so bad that even Queensryche's new album is less painful to listen to!  Now THAT'S bad!  Lar$ fought so hard against piracy, yet garbage like this virtually supports illegal downloading.<br /><br />It's nice if bands want to try something new once in a while, and engage in some \\"artistic expression\\" or whatever bands call it when they put out a stinking heap of dung, but why poop all over your core audience and the people who have supported your rock-star lifestyles?  Are you listening, Queensryche?<br /><br />It is not even that this is \\"experimental\\" for Metallica or Lou Reed.  It's that it just plain sucks.  There might be a more poetic adjective but...no there's not.
B000641D2Y|4.0|My children recently watched Home Alone for the first time and loved it.  Knowing that I would be going into surgery and needed to keep them occupied during my recovery, I ordered this movie for them.  They love it and think it's very funny.  I think the first Home Alone was better, but this is still a fun, if predictable, movie.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|Helplessness Blues was so-so the first time I heard a few of its songs on the radio, but Fleet Foxes has the strange ability to create songs which become more likeable over time, until finally you love them and cannot get enough of that music. The reason I say \\"strangely human\\" is that it reminds me of meeting a person and eventually becoming close friends with them, rarely do you think more of a person who will be your friend after the first five minutes than a \\"hmmm\\" but after getting to know them, you might consider that person a critical part of your life. So it is with their music. There is no time too stressful, no time too happy, no time too miserable that Fleet Foxes' music will not speak to me. Sim Sala Bim is my favorite on this album, but Montezuma is a close second. The lyrics on all these songs are as haunting as the melodies, which I think adds to their mystery. Keep up the beautiful songs!
B00275EHJG|5.0|My children are huge Toy Story fans.  This movie didn't disappoint.  It's a wonderful movie for the whole family.  The story line doesn't get old and it ends in the only way that it possible could.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|The signs that songs like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" gave off about The Beatles next musical direction were finally crystalized in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album that fully melted the band's psychedelic pop ambitions with an extended orchestra, arranged by none other than George Martin.<br /><br />The results are quite convincingly unique; whereas this orchestral approach had already been explored by everyone from Phil Spector to The Beach Boys, it had never reached the levels of production and experimentation that Sgt. Pepper provided.<br /><br />There are so many elements that the album compiles uniformly, from historicity (\\"A Day In The Life\\") to social commentary (\\"She Is Leaving Home\\") to even consciousness (Harrison's \\"Within You, Without You\\"), which gives the album a historical quality due to its sheer landscape in the 1960s' culture.<br /><br />Despite it being a splendid work, it does fall into a number of overstatements. For once, to say that it's the best Beatles album is not to say its the most essential, since it lacks the down to earth rock elements of their albums post Magic Mystery Tour.<br /><br />Also, its not the first album to mix baroque-like orchestrations with rock'n roll qualities, since, even in terms of straight edge rock bands, The Left Banke had already envisioned this approach in 1966 (let alone The Beach Boys with Pet Sounds).<br /><br />Finally, the best album of all time? Arguably the most historically relevant record of all time, but to be fair, 50 years ahead of the album some of the concepts have not aged very well.<br /><br />In any case, nothing takes away the fact that it is masterfully arranged, full of harmonies and studio wizardry, as well as a unique eccentricity. A must in the 1960s' catalogue.

1594744769|3.0|The concept to write a book and utilize these mysterious photos is definitely intriguing, but it was poorly executed. There were some serious continuity issues, and at times it felt like I was reading a slightly more adult fairy-tale.

B001P5HI4A|1.0|Yes, I too was ripped off.<br />I bought the 2-disc set on this & the only dvd that worked was the extras dvd.<br />The dvd with the actual movie didn't play at all -- was definitely not my dvd player.<br />I figured it out too late to return it.<br />After the other shady dvds I've seen sold via Amazon (e.g., foreign vids that are bootlegs), I am going to be much more cautious about videos I buy here. Just isn't worth the headache to save a couple of bucks...
B0077ATSU4|4.0|I am happy to have watched this film at the theater.  Despite the generally not-so-positive reviews, this film turns out to be surprising well done.  Both this film and Hugo deal with how a son copes with the loss of a father.  Hugo gives us a very lovable boy but this film gives us a troubled boy (which to me is harder to present).  I like this film better because I don't think all kids should be, must be lovable in real life.  I also think, in real life, we (adults and kids) don't usually act on our best behavior when in deep, deep grief (as reflected in this film).  I don't mind seeing that side of reality in a film because it is in the redemption that gives us (the audience) the resolution to a terrible tragedy (the sudden loss of someone we love).  I can understand and identify with both boy's need to continuing on a project their fathers started while alive as a way of holding on to their relationship a bit longer. I like this film better because it goes into the boy's realization that at the end of the project, his father is still dead and there's no secret message to be had.  Some critics were \\"offended\\" because the film took place with 9/11 as its background.  I don't think the director/writer was taking advantage of a tragedy.  I think it was just a recent tragedy that gives most of us a common starting point.<br /><br />Is this a film worth buying the DVD or Blu-Ray?  It will depend on what extra features it will have.  A good feature commentary might be good for film buffs and some info on how \\"real\\" people deal with tragedies or the grief process etc might interest people.<br /><br />*The above just my opinion and I decline any responsibility for anything I say so don't yell at me.  If you don't like, just skip.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|In less than about four years, True Blood has managed to become a huge cultural phenomenon. I joined the bandwagon around season three and have became an absolutely obsessed fan since then. I have seen all four seasons, but watched them in a rather backwards way which has given me a different perspective than if I became a fan when this season, the first, aired.<br /><br />Season one is quite possibly the quietest season of all four. We are introduced to the sleepy, small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana and our colorful cast of characters (alive and undead). While my knowledge of the killer's identity from the first episode eliminated much of the suspense, I was still absolutely riveted from the first episode to the season finale. The writing in this season was superb and so much different from the lovably crazy kitchen-sink approach of the later years. It almost made me wonder if they hired different writers (which they didn't; they just introduced many new characters in the third season and had to fit in many different storylines).<br /><br />Due to the more singular focus, the stories have a more intense dramatic weight. This season was also the best at capturing the small-town, Southern feel of the show. The lighting is dark and grainy, the music is slow and country-fried, and everyone's up in everyone's business. Many people believe the \\"prejudice\\" against the vampires in this world is some sort of Civil Rights metaphor. It could be taken that way, but it's a little insulting to compare make-believe, blood-sucking creatures' bid for equality to the struggles racial minorites and gays have faced (and still do). In my opinion, I see it more as a very clever way of depicting the age old struggle of human vs. vampire, placing it in a much more modern context.<br /><br />All of the characters are at their best in this season; each one very sharply defined, depicted with complex layers. Anna Paquin is brilliant as Sookie. She's all at once endearing, relatable, and a bit irritating; in short a real person. There's an endearing paradox about her that one reviewer I read pointed out: the balance between her sweetness and feistiness. She's kind and sympathetic but outspoken, independent, and unwilling to suffer fools gladly. The fact that she can also read minds just makes her even more fascinating. Paquin won a Golden Globe for her performance in this season and it was well-deserved. Moyer makes a perfect contrast to her light, effervescent energy as the somber, brooding Bill. Their chemistry is most electric in this season, as their unlikely courtship provides some sizzling sexual tension (and release).<br /><br />All those who complain about the focus on the other characters and how that strays from the book, get over it. I, for one, am glad that Alan Ball and his creative team have the inventiveness to branch these other storylines out, as well as change some things from the book. If they didn't, it would require absolutely no creativity on their part and everything would be totally predictable.<br /><br />The supporting cast is superb as well. Rutina Wesley is quite possibly my favorite as Tara. I like her character best in this season. In subsequent seasons, she's more victimized. But, in this season, she's at her best and is absolute dynamite, literally as Tara is a real hothead (to an often hilarious degree). But she's also smart and a survivor. Something about her always made me root for her. Nelsan Ellis is thoroughly entertaining as Lafayette. His character is possibly the most consistent throughout the show, but (like all the other actors) I find his characterization in this season most interesting and colorful. Ryan Kwanten as the horndog with the heart of gold Jason and Sam Trammell as Sam, Sookie's unrequited love interest, also shine. It's nearly impossible to find a bad actor on this show, even in some of the smaller roles.<br /><br />I truly do think this is the best season out of all. The writing, acting, and storylines were all pitch perfect. The only complaint I have is the somewhat flat characterization of Eric (a very important character, who goes on to become much more layered as the show goes on). But, this was just the beginning, after all.

B000LYIXN6|5.0|So, with more than a few variations of this LP, how do you write a proper review???<br />Well, lets start with the US version. I've had three different versions of the \\"Red & Blue\\" albums, A later 80's pressing on the Red Capitol Label, The Original Red and Blue colored Vinyl US issues, also with Capitol Labels and the \\"C1\\" issues on the \\"small\\" Capitol label-and those issues are very limited pressings as the record companies were already starting to ditch vinyl as a popular format. The Blue colored edition looks beautiful, but it sounds just average for sound fidelity. The UK Blue vinyl edition sounds much better and the UK mixes, which in 73 were superior to the Capitol mixes, were used. The nice thing about the US edition is some of the US mixes, even thought their not as 'clean' as the British mixes, sonically I like them better. Songs like 'She's A Woman', 'I Feel Fine' sound more fuller and richer with the added reverb to my ears. And 'Help' is preceded by the James Bond Theme as found only on the US mix, and it fits perfectly. All in all great music!<br />Gerard Masters

B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner is a fine beginning to Dashner's young-adult dystopian science fiction Maze Runner trilogy. I couldn't put it down. At the very beginning Dashner introduces suspense, and he keeps ratcheting up the suspense with each chapter. Along the way, he produces fine characterization-distinct, dynamic, and highly sympathetic. Dashner's descriptive techniques utilize all of the senses and imbue us in his highly imaginative dark world. The plot itself is ingenious, and it seems that for every three questions Dashner threw at me, he answered only one, leaving me dying of curiosity at the end of the book. I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
0553381695|2.0|Russian master Chekhov once said, \\"If there is a gun hanging on the wall in the first act, it must fire in the last.\\" When you read great masters of literature it is always a pleasure. You enjoy every page, and everything in the book makes sense. In \\"A Clash of Kings\\" Martin often writes in a way that I ask myself afterwards, what was the point of the whole chapter. We follow Arya on her escape from the castle, and she starts her journey with a group of recruits for the Wall. We follow their journey over several chapters, and at the end most of them get killed (I apologize for spoiling it), and she still does not escape. After I read that, I honestly asked myself, what was the point of her journey with that group? What was it that Martin wanted to tell me in those chapters? I did not have an answer. On the other hand, we follow Arya's little brother, who cannot walk. Martin develops his charcter nicely, and I started liking that little boy, and I hoped he will be the one who will stop the evil. Suddenly, for no particular reason that I could see, the boy gets killed by another character who was just another villain. Again I asked myself, what was the point of having that character in the first place? Did Martin run out of ideas what to do with that character, and just decided to kill him? We don't need Charlie Sheen in \\"Two and a Half Men\\" any more, so lets throw him under the train. When Talking started writing his master piece, I am sure he did not say, \\"I am going to write three books.\\" He developed his story and wrote as much as it was needed to give us all the answers, and to finish his story. When reading \\"A Clash of Kings\\" I often had a feeling that the author just wanted to add few more pages, and set the stage for one more and one more book. He created so many characters that I had to have a spreadsheet with all their names and relationships to be able to follow. In my opinion,that is not how a book should be written. I am sure I will not read other books.

B004EPZ06Q|5.0|First off I have to say that when I watched the first Hangover in the theater I wasn't super impressed with it. Everyone was saying it was super hilarious, but I found it only  mildly funny in a large auditorium with ~200 other people. When I rewatched it at home with just a few people it was infinitely better. This Part II however was completely hilarious in the theater and again at home. I found myself walking away trying to figure out how this movie made it into the public without an NC-17 rating. I suppose they are becoming more liberal with the rating boards. There are too many funny moments to pick just one. Needless to say this is a must see for fans of the first one, but at the same time some of the more light hearted folks may want to pass it up. Definitely not for anyone up 18.

B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|So this was many months ago: Stunned in the aftermath of a brutal shellacking meted out by Chris Cyborg, MMA fighter Gina Carano entertained one of them standing at the crossroads moments. Which is around when Hollywood came knocking, when Steven Soderbergh decided to call and ask her to star in a movie. And here's HAYWIRE, fruit of their collaboration, a film that isn't high-brow or artsy or a Major Motion Picture. What it is, though, is gritty and action-packed and massively appealing. It just might make a movie star of Gina Carano. She's better looking than the Rock.<br /><br />From the opening scene in an upstate New York diner, your eyes are fixed on Carano. She sits at her table quietly, but there's a trapped animal watchfulness about her and you're instantly put on guard. And yet when the sitch goes sour, it happens in a shocking heartbeat and you're caught unprepared anyway (unless, of course, you've seen the trailer). Carano plays Mallory Kane, an exceptional employee in a private contracting company that takes on all manner of dirty ops work. The narrative doesn't follow a linear track. It shifts back and forth from the present and the past. As the film opens, Mallory Kane already has a bullseye on her.<br /><br />Mallory must work thru a labyrinthine puzzle to figure out all them what betrayed her. It all goes back to an eventful rescue mission executed by Mallory and her fellow agents in Barcelona - of which entirety we see in flashback. But all this is a superfluous info dump. It's the film's MacGuffin. Somewhere along the way, someone high up in the cloak & dagger community made the decision to sanction Mallory Kane. This then allows us to marvel at Carano as her resourceful, lethally capable character travels the globe bent on exacting revenge. From Barcelona to Dublin to New Mexico to upstate New York, she leaves a trail of busted up bodies.<br /><br />Even when Soderbergh is slumming, his stuff registers high on the watchability scale. HAYWIRE is his spin on the action thriller, and it's a well-crafted one. It's not just one fight after another. It takes its time in unfolding its narrative beats (okay, there are some slow spots). But HAYWIRE overall feels like the product of a master filmmaker letting his hair down and having fun but not neglecting his due diligence. It's obvious that Soderbergh set out to make Carano a star. HAYWIRE showcases her pretty brilliantly. Carano isn't half bad at the acting bits, and she is most definitely eye candy. But recognizing that she's a fledgling actress, Soderbergh populates her film with big Hollywood names. We're treated to hard-hitting scenes in which Carano opens a mean can on hunks like Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, and a slightly weasely Ewan Macgregor. The cool thing is these actors - along with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas - seem to not mind playing second fiddle to a rookie actress. The performances are universally solid, with the biggest surprise being that Gina Carano does hold her own in their company. There's something about her, about her attitude, a sense that she's working hard but still not taking herself seriously. And when she smiles that flirty smile, there's a feel of wheels spinning internally. I believed that her character really was that intelligent and resourceful and undeterred. I already knew she was sexy.<br /><br />Soderbergh plonks her in diverse settings which showcase her versatility. We see her glamorous side as she partners Michael Fassbender's dashing MI6 operative on a work night in Dublin. We see her down and dirty as she gets to the business of eluding her assassins and dishing out payback. I didn't doubt that Gina Carano would be able to sell her action scenes; she's photogenic that way, too. Her fights are nasty affairs, no holds barred and sometimes not pretty to look at. Carano is explosive and marvelously athletic, and when she hits a body you don't doubt that her blows have a serious impact. And, to make it even more realistic, Carano also absorbs her share of punishment, lots of it. Soderbergh opted to not have a music score framing these no-quarter-given scraps. All you hear are the desperate grunts and harsh breathing and the thuds of striking feet and fists. It makes it even more believable.<br /><br />I heard someone mention this already, and, in fact, a cop in the film even refers to Carano by that name. But if the role of Wonder Woman is still being cast, why not Gina Carano? She's got the goods. And she probably won't even need that lasso of truth to whup on them villains. In any case, Gina Carano needs to do more films.re realistic, Carano also absorbs her share of punishment, lots of it.

B005HSG3TC|3.0|I like having a shell for my Kindle.  However, I had hoped that the flap that moves around to become a prop would have something on the back to help keep it in place, but it doesn't.  There is just a bit of a groove that the flap will link to, but if there is any movement, the flap will quickly fall out.  Also, if I have to keep the Kindle upright instead of sideways, there is no way to keep it propped in that position.

0062060562|4.0|Can you imagine waking up each morning having no clue where you are not to mention having no ability to remember anything from the previous day, weeks, or years? Well that is Christine's life. During the day she can accumulate and remember things but as soon as she goes to sleep for the night, they are gone. This is all due to an accident she apparently had although she has no memory of it but it left her with a severe brain injury. Her husband Ben (who she doesn't remember either) tells her each morning about their life together and what had happened to her.<br /><br />Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson is a fantastic psychological thriller that completely held me in its grip from the first page. When Christine awakens in the morning she figures she's still in her 20's so imagine her surprise when she looks in the mirror and instead sees a 47 year old woman. One day after Ben leaves for work, Christine discovers another cell phone ringing in her purse. It turns out to be Dr. Nash who has apparently been helping her but this turns out to be something she has hidden from Ben because he's never been too enthusiastic about her getting help. Dr. Nash reminds Christine to read the journal he has suggested she keep and then they meet afterwards. He repeats this process every day. One day when Christine pulls the journal out she sees some words that terrify her... `Don't trust Ben'. What could this mean? Ben is her husband. He takes care of her. Why shouldn't she trust him?<br /><br />Yet as she reads her journal she notices all the inconsistencies with what Ben tells her and what Dr. Nash tells her. You see Christine keeps having flashbacks to times in her past before the accident. When this happens she sits down and tries to make sure she gets it down in her journal. As times goes by she begins to piece together her past and what ultimately happened to her that fateful day of her accident. What she uncovers terrifies her!<br /><br />The author has done an incredible job of writing in this novel. He builds up our excitement as every day Christine discovers something new and yet we know the next morning it'll all be gone. The mystery and suspense kept me on the edge of my seat. I had some idea of what was going on but as the mystery and events of Christine's past unfold; I was at times shocked and at others viciously angry at some of the characters in the novel.

1451627289|4.0|sports almanacs and the butterfly effect and JFK add up to more than I expected. There's more going on here - the main character Jake has been left by an unfaithful alcoholic wife who complained that he doesn't know how to express grief. He's also haunted by a horrible childhood story he reads in an essay written by one of his students, and he learns a friend is in the late stages of lung cancer - but although Jake has \\"never been what you'd call a crying man\\", crying is only one of the stages of grief. Another is going over what we could have done differently, and when we realise the answers don't matter because we can't change the past, we cry. So it makes sense that Jake cannot resist the opportunity to change the past, especially tragedies that seem senseless like the waste of life that scarred the mature age high school student or the actions of Lee Harvey Oswald who is portrayed as a random wife-beating loser who lacks JFK's \\"sense of humor; a sense of the absurd. The man in the sixth-floor window of the Book Depository had neither. Oswald had proved it time and again, and such a man had no business changing history.\\" The theory is that stopping JFK's assassination would prevent Martin Luther King's death, the Vietnam War, and bring about a quicker end to the Cold War. But are we sure that undoing a horrible happening in the past will have only positive consequences? Seeming digressions about Jake's new love and the evil in Derry that seems to infect everyone who lives there (the original title for \\"It\\" was \\"Derry\\" and several of the same characters from that novel about childhood trauma make an appearance in this novel) belong in the same story because it is really about what it takes to let go of a painful past. If \\"Dallas is Derry\\" as Jake says in his sleep, then might JFK's death have been not only about Oswald's delusions of grandeur but something about the place and time that required the release of negative energy? While this is billed as a departure into a \\"mainstream time travel novel\\" for King, he cannot escape his own past - at times the story felt like sort of an inverted version of \\"The Dead Zone\\" - right down to the school teacher main character - and a lot of King's bigger themes are here, especially the idea that evil is sometimes in the air and takes hold of suitable hosts to make them do things they might not do in a different place and time. This new novel explores the idea that these seemingly senseless and horrible things in our past might somehow have been necessary.

This album not only has great individual tracks, but has a great flow to the album as a whole.  Rope, White Limo, Arlandria, and A Matter of Time stand out, but my favorite tracks are These Days and Walk.  To me, no one is doing more to keep the bar set high for good ole american rock as the Foo Fighters and this album is them at their best.  Dave Grohl is officially a Rock God!!!
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I can only imagine how disappointing this book must have been for the people waiting since 2000 for it.  No plot line of any interest is advanced in this book.  The fact it took seven extra years for DwD puts a lie to Martin's explaination about having too much to write.  Clearly he has lost interest in his creation.
B006UG90RM|1.0|Compressed and limited to hell, no dynamic range, don't waste your money.  Why they allowed what would otherwise have been a great album to be butchered like this is beyond me.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love these kinds of games and this one is very well done. The graphics are excellent, the music is beautiful, and the puzzles are just tough enough. Highly recommended.
0553801473|3.0|I haven't finish reading the book yet but I think now I can give a review...<br /><br />I have read 53% of the book and it was not until like 45~48% that I started to feel the book was beginning. As many books I have read, the beginning is slow while everything get set in its place, them it begin to get more interesting, but seriously?, I have read half of the book in 3 weeks and before that I read one of the same size in a weekend (vacations :P).<br /><br />I just kept reading it because I told myself \\"the book hasn't begun yet\\", and now I will end it because is from a song of ice and fire, one of the best book series I have ever read!<br /><br />The book is boring, there are just some entertaining moments in entire chapters, I don't think the book is bad, I actually like it, but it is filled with a lot of unnecessary details, is like the calm before the storm, I still wait for something to happen but the storm just don't begin!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|only earn a few points and some games seem like they cheat. a lot of games are fun so try if you like different and think outside the box.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose to avoid any details of what the book was about before I started reading it - everything a secret. Highly recommend approaching it that way. All I knew was that my best friend liked it enough so send me a copy. As soon as I finished this one, I was starving to read more. Luckily there are 2 more books in the series. Such a good book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think the game is really fun! There is always something that you have to accomplish and a goal to reach!
0307887898|4.0|This book and Steve Blank's book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany, are great books of lean startups. I've learned so much from these two books since I started my first social web startup (sharing2care.org) few months ago. The lessons I learned from these books have saved me a lot of money and time. I highly recommend these two books for all first time entrepreneurs, especially those with engineering background.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Such a great show and who can watch & listen just once?? The songs Joe composes and sings are my favorite. \\"Happier Times\\" and \\"Mountain Time\\" are super, delving into his past with a touch of melancholy. If you've never been inspired or shaken with an emotion, you will be at the end of \\"Just Got Paid\\" when he hoists his guitar above his head. The camera shot from behind Joe out toward the audience is one of the best I've ever seen. Enjoy!!
0307454568|3.0|It is a shame that Mr. Larsson died before he could write any more books. The man clearly had talent. The first two books in the series were fantastic and for the most part this book doesn't disappoint. All of the loose ends from the first two books are tied up. Lisbeth is largely sidelined after taking center stage in the 2nd book. And the bad guys who treated her so badly get their comeuppance.<br /><br />BUT, there are a few flies in the ointment with this conclusion. There is a secondary story thrown in with Erika that feels largely tacked on; it has no ties to the central plot and it's not at all clear why it was in the book, unless it was to lead into future stories (and I have seen claims that Larsson did have plans for more books). But here it feels like it was just there to add some padding. And we get the wonderful buildup with the Section who seem to have all the angles covered, but then they seem to be forgotten in most of the second half of the book while all of Lisbeth's friends unite to defend her. You're left wondering how guys who ran a super-secret agency with the Swedish equivalent of the FBI & CIA for decades could be tricked so easily.<br /><br />Did I enjoy these books? Heck yes. They were a fast, entertaining read. Lisbeth was an interesting character, definitely an anti-heroine and a great female counterpoint to male characters like Dirk Pitt, Jason Bourne, and James Bond. Highly recommended.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Bad review because every time I open it, it ask me to rate it, there isn't a permanent ignore button. I pay money for apps because I don't want to be annoyed by the ads and expect paid apps not to advertise even for their own product
B005ZUR724|1.0|it was fun, until this update came out it doesn't download and your paying monthly fees.  seriously!!!! I mean come on gameloft
B006ON41FC|5.0|i think this game has come far and i hope it keeps updating. i love it. great physics and gets pretty crazy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it is very addicting and great way to waste time. c'mon its free! don't rate it bad. you get so much for free. as a free game id say its flawless
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun, and I love the customizable card backs and playing board. its just like the old school Microsoft computer solitaire
B00005NE1K|2.0|please do not make the mistakeof buying from these people as I have.I am a movie collector and the copy of T2 will not play in my dvd player. I have e-mailed them twice and they have not replyed to either.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I put this app on my kindle fire, I really enjoy playing this game, I play all the time, its one of my favorites. Thanks.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|ONE WORD: KLAUS! awesome actor (joseph morgan) and he plays the part of bad guy very well. what i love about VD is that you cant hate the bad guy for too long. First/second season we get to know damon more and understand why he is the way he is... and now with this season you get to see The Orginals and understand Klaus more. i hope they make him a regular!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great game. I wasn't sure about it ay first but the more you play it you realize it is more than a simple puzzle game. I like most the fact that I can walk away from the game and come back to it a few days latter. It doesn't keep absorbing your time or require refined skills. I would recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy using this app! It's easy and user friendly. I have a ton of options from translation and the sequence in which I want to read such a an annual schedule, chronological, etc. I don't need any other app.

We'd never worked with polymer clay before but I became fascinated with it from seeing other artists creations online.  So I bought this book and tons of clay and tools, and we made beads, figurines, and learned great techniques including Skinner Blend, it actually worked exactly the way the book said, by running 2 colors of clay thru a pasta machine 15 times, then it was blended in the middle, then I rolled it up and cut it and it made the 2 color slices, different on both ends of the roll, exactly like the book said!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Keeps my brain working! The games are not too hard but they are challenging enough to keep you interested. I like the variety.
1935670913|5.0|Though I've read a few reviews with the writers complaining about Mr. Locke 'tooting his own horn' I had a very different take on the first few chapters of this book. I saw them as detailed possibilities of things that could happen if authors put his instructions to use. I saw them as proof of the benefits he reaped because of implementing and using his own guide. I saw them as a motivational tool to literally 'put a fire' under author's who were serious about having their books and work read. I have begun putting his recommendations to use and though it's not always easy I feel better as an author because I know the positive message I received from reading his book is, 'If he can do this, so can I'. Thank you Mr. Locke for a very detailed guide. Everything in this book, had a point and a reason for being in it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun so far been playing for a couple days don't have any complaints. wish it gave more tokens per game but oh well.
B0063T12RM|5.0|This wonderful full length 'documentary' is all about Pina Bausch's modern dance theatre, based in Wuppertal (Fritz Engels' home town). It should win a documentary Oscar this year.<br />It is the first 3D movie that I have watched that really makes it worth while using this technology. Wim Wenders makes it such a tangible visual experience, you think you are sitting on the stage or in the middle of each random dance floor (trains, coal mines, riversides, roadsides, crop land after harvest...)<br />Bausch's creative choreography makes classical ballet look rather ridiculous. I watched the film in a well packed Boston cinema afternoon show. The audience applauded the film, which is not a usual experience.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Best free for a day I've come across in a while.  Now I know how Rocky (not the boxer) felt.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate and a very easy app to use.  Alerts me for weather changes. I would recommend this app over the rest
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I have listened to this album several times every night since I got it and it has become my favorite in that time. It is almost unlike anything that has come before. We should only hope that we could create something this incredible at any age. Make no mistake; this could only come about with the wisdom that comes with age. I have often as a woman been irritated with Cohen for his attitude about women but I appreciate his present space and all offenses are forgiven. I'll have to buy several more copies for friends who need to hear it. It is not a collection for the young; it is a gift to the myriad who have followed him since the beginning. We are silver haired traveling companions who understand what he is saying because we are on the same journey at the same point in our lives. If anyone gives us a reason to continue this journey, it is Leonard because he keeps creating such wonderful music.  I would be satisfied with listening to most of the wonderful things he has done in the past built he keeps giving and creating. He keeps me creating as well, thank you Leonard for being you.
B005OK81HA|1.0|I grew up listening to the Scorpions, and I think that most of their music is incredible.  Classics like \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" are the types of songs that embody perfection, songs that will have timeless appeal to all generations.  With Comeblack, the Scorpions have taken some of their best work and turned it into over-produced garbage.  I do not know why they chose to go down this road, but for me it has proven itself to be nothing more than a marketing ploy to entice younger audiences used to overproduction to buy their music.  If it's not broken, don't fix it.  Unfortunately, for the Scorpions, they chose to take classic songs and turn them into computerized shells of their former selves.  It is a trend afflicting many bands right now, and it will probably not go away anytime soon.  It's too bad, because the Scorpions are one of the worlds most successful hard rock bands.  I would understand if they wanted to re-master some of their older material so the strength and depth of the original recordings was maximized, but to take it and cut it up like dead fish and throw in some tasty bites along with crap is unfortunate.
0811875040|5.0|Nough said!  It is amazing!<br /><br />The illustrations are prefect.  They completely capture the essence of Miette.<br /><br />The book is well detailed.  The edges of the pages have a scalloped cut, which add more charm to this already charming book.<br /><br />I've actually had the Old Fashioned Cake from Miette in San Francisco, which is amazing, and I'm happy to say that the recipe in the book produces a cake of the same quality and taste.  When I made the Old Fashioned Chocolate Cake for Christmas everyone was raving about it.  My sister-in-law said it was the best chocolate cake she's ever had!<br /><br />Although the cake is a bit laborious it is worth all of the work.  You can really taste the superiority of this recipe.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|See the firt part of Downton Abby om DVD,then this second season,there will be a third.This series is set at Highclere Castle which is the real home of the lords of Carnarvon.It is an outstanding series,it had to be this good ,because all the males like it as much as women do.Ask a around.I cannot wait for the next season next fall.It has nothing to do with the Carnarvons,every thing to do with the family living at the Abby.The second part season two,is about the Great War.enjoy!Downton Abby won first place in series at Emmy awards this season,enjoy.
B000KE1P7S|5.0|The cadence of the language, a script that slides over one's shoulders and down an arched back,the luxuriant details, the play of light and shadows -- all these riches combined with Timothy Dalton giving the most seductive male performance I have ever seen in a film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works fantastic on my Droid RAZR, I have no problems whatsoever, I do agree though that they should update the game to run on ICS.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Finally got to see this film which was very outstanding. It gave me new insight into the history of the abdication and the marriage to Mrs. Simpson. It deserved the Oscars it got.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is the best album I have heard in a long time.  Adele has such a sultry voice.  The lyrics really hit home.  Recommend highly.
030746363X|5.0|This book changed my life. Years of working out when I got in the mood, and changing diets only to skip back into bad habits. 4 hour body was a great read and even better process for body transformation. And it's not even about the body transformation as it is the mental development from being healthy. When it came to the therapy I found a product called coolnek ([...]) and it's the best option for those looking to incorporate a comfortable core-cooling solution to their daily life. I wasn't so much into the ice bath, but wearing this was extremely comfortable.    Read, try, and make the changes in your life. Ignore your health and it will go away!! Thank you, 4-Hour Body!!!

B004EPYZUI|5.0|I bought this the day it came out. The movie itself is great. In both versions. My only dissapointment is that its not in 3D.
B00009PBRP|1.0|When I bought this movie it never said what region the movie was, so when I got it it didn't play in my AMERICAN DVD player. I wasted my money on a movie that couldn't play. Then the company I bought it from was going to make me pay for shipping to get my money back. So I kept and won't do business with there company ever again \\"MoiveMars\\" I used my iPhone amazon app to but this movie so it's amazons fault or MoiveMars but someone should fixs this
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|The CD has all the good songs that they play on the radio, plus several more good ones. Track number 9 is my favorite. Unlike some CDs, there are no songs that I really don't like. Can't wait for them to put out another CD.
B006ON41FC|5.0|a great app that's really addicting and the funnest game I've played since I have gotten my kindle fire so buy

B006ON41FC|4.0|this is an awesome app I love the goals that the game gives you. it is challenging. n lots of fun. would be good for kids of any age.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|This review is for the Blu Ray version.  I've been a fan of this movie since it was released theatrically, but was not old enough to see it.  I always thought the cut-off Statue of Liberty head on the poster art was awesome.  I caught it later on HBO and it has never left my yearly movie watching rotation.  This disk replaced the lousy bare bones first DVD version.<br /><br />PROs:<br />Snake Plissken is a bad-assed anti-hero [Later copied by The Grimm Adventures of Billy & Mandy as the character Haus Delgado]<br />Cult sci-fi classic status secured<br />Numerous one-liners throughout the film, repeatedly quotable (\\"You gonna kill me now Snake?\\")<br />Kurt Russell & Lee Van Cleef (Sergio Leone Western fame) have outstanding on-screen chemistry<br />Excellent direction by John Carpenter<br />Chef from South Park is the Duke of New York<br />Adrienne Barbeau shows a LOT of cleavage<br />Harry Dean Stanton is awesome [He's great in David Lynch movies too]<br />Manhattan Island as a maximum security penitentiary<br />Blu Ray transfer is Outstanding!<br /><br />CONs:<br />Special Effects are dated [Budget & special effects limited in 1981]<br />Some of Carpenter's soundtrack music gets on my nerves after a while<br /><br />NOTE:  I spent years hissing at people that bother me like the bad guy toadie in this movie.  This is worth a purchase if you can get it for $12.99 or less on Amazon.  This is one film Sci-Fi fans must see before they die.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the most beautiful little zen-like world in which to play with a little raindrop. It works flawlessly on the Kindle Fire.. if there is any doubt in your mind, get it, it is well worth every last cent!
B001GQSY5U|5.0|I am 65 years old.  I am watching the Clone Wars series with my grandchildren and I wanted to get the original movie in order to fill in some blanks.  This the source movie does and quite well.  This DVD was not made for me, but I was able to enjoy it nonetheless.  I think the more critical reviews of this movie are mean spirited and absurd.  The movie is intended for younger viewers and that is just fine.  As one reviewer said, \\"give it a chance.\\"  I agree, I thought it was very watchable and entertaining ....... a quality effort and a good job.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this is a really fun and challenging app. I've always loved chess and now I don't have to wait for someone else to have the bug to play too!
B006ON41FC|1.0|this game abosuluteluy sucks. I cant believe I payed 99&cent; for this piece of crap. absolutely terrible don't buy. don't waste your money
B003L77GG0|4.0|I absolutely loved Season 10 for about 12 or 13 episodes. The first episode was absolutely friggin brilliant. The whole Lex Luthor thing even seemed feasible....a bit of a stretch...but I was willing to go with it.  The episodes that followed in which they were trying to figure out how their relationship could work was the brightest spot of the whole season for me. That whole darkness and cape business seemed to drag the storylines down. I wish the focus would have stayed on Clark and Lois. Loved the show. Hope their is a spin off of some kind in the future.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I opened it and couldn't. stop playing.  my boyfriend soon joined in and we finished the game in one sitting. the pictures are beautiful and the puzzles are challenging, but not frustratingly so. I was surprised at how much fun we both managed to have playing together. highly recommended.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|While not as good as the books, it was a well done adaptation.  Really looking forward to the extra features.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Fun game, nice concept. Challenging but not so difficult that you get frustrated. My only complaint is that it was too short. I completed it in a few hours. Maybe because I'm very familiar with the genre, but I wish it had another island or something...
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This cover is great:  it protects the Kindle, was hardy enough to withstand it when I accidentally dropped it.  I think it's a very good buy.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is the greatest PC to PC connection app ever.  It's a must have application.  I dont know how I've managed to survive this long without it.
B005EM8O8O|4.0|Someone is trying to kill the manager of one of Europe's largest hedge funds. Or has he arranged for all of this to happen because he is losing his mind?<br /><br />It's quite fun. I read it over a weekend in Palm Springs and it was just right. Algorithmic investing, upscale Geneva, a creepy burglar, computers doing strange things...a race through the streets of Geneva, a couple dead people and a conflagration. What could be better?<br /><br />In response to some of the other reviews, I didn't find the protagonist to be unsympathetic. I thought he was interesting. He thinks he might be going crazy, which could be scary. That part was well-handled.<br /><br />Fans of this book might also like works by David T Lender such as [[ASIN:B005WWC62G Trojan Horse (Wall Street)]].
B006ON41FC|5.0|seems dumb but its so addicting and fun. it gets faster as you get farther down. my farthist is about 4500
B0052UZIFA|1.0|What exactly is the reason for update? Updates with no explanation don't get installed..... Period. Try a 'what's new' blurb in description.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very easy to use. With media playback it gave me more than I asked for. Nice and smart app. Recommend it for multiple uses
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm just doing this to get the free points. ha ha. i want to beat it just to say i did. pretty interesting games and challenging. i like it but i can be lame at times.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I haven't had a single problem with this app. since I have downloaded it I have yet to back to the web based version. I use it on the kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun app. it is so addictive. my boyfriend played it until he ran down the battery on my kindle. definately wo<br />rth the time to download
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy &amp; quick _ but still a challenge. Great for kids just learning the game. Entertaining for anyone who enjoys a good card game.
B0054JELS4|4.0|I absolutely love this product.  I am even more impressed with this company.  When I noticed some problems with a few of the discs and notified them, the response was immediate and helpful.  I was given the time needed to check all of the discs.  Once I identified the few that were bad I sent an email.  I received the replacement discs in about a week.  There was also a hand written note of apology.  I would order from this company again anytime.  This is the type of customer service not found often in today's hurried market place.  Thank you for remembering what customer service is all about!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|When you look at the Matrix, you see the beginning of a great series of special effects.  The storyline is very, very good, but when you look at the cities, the way they traveled, the weapons, all of that, you have to give it a 5 star rating.  The beginning of the series is over 10 years old, and yet, it still stands as one of the best trilogies ever!  Neo, Morphius, etc... You couldn't find a better cast!  Look at the actors and actresses today.... The Matrix was a launching pad for a lot of careers to be noticed!!  Great on you.  Now, since it is 2012, will the brothers come out with another series of movies that will make us say \\"Wow!\\"?
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I highly recommend this book to every baseball fan. Billy Beane and his cohorts bucked a system that has gone unchallenged for nearly 100 years and did so successfully. Money doesn't buy happiness and apparently you don't a lot of it to win....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this a great app. used it on droid and blackberry phone. now on my iphone and kindle fire. never had any problems. thumbs up from me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As an Irish dance teacher, the hardest part of any class is getting the students to get up and start. They arrive to class with their Kindles, Nooks, PSPs and books firmly in hand, and I have to launch into my \\"crazy happy teacher\\" routine to bring them back to the room intellectually. That problem was significantly compounded when they started reading this book. Suzanne Collins' story so captivated them, I had to physically (gently) remove the items from their clutching hands.<br /><br />Once I finally read The Hunger Games, I understood why. Not since [[ASIN:1416925082 Hatchet: 20th Anniversary Edition]] and many other of Gary Paulson's books and the [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]] books of JK Rowling, have stories and scenes stayed with me in my thoughts and dreams. The vividly drawn characters, the tight pacing and the entirely believable society and scenarios weave a world that appeals to adults and young adults alike.<br /><br />This book may be classified as young adult, but as is true for all incredible books in this genre, it is equally pleasing to adults as well. I look forward to revisiting this again and again. Thank you, Suzanne Collins!!
B000V5W84U|2.0|1.  The \\"religious fanatic\\" fits the usual caricature put forth by \\"rationalists\\", scheming, false to her own belief system using the ends to justify the means, quite stupid in her positions and, finally, a conspirator to a murder.<br />2.  The usual Galileo canard was brought forth as the classic \\"religion vs. science\\" propaganda, while ignoring the political context and Galileo's own provoking of the situation.  All of which had NOTHING to do with science.<br />3.  The teacher, Ms. O'Brien, clearly states that she will not teach anything but what she considers \\"truth\\".  She also claims to refuse to teach from any set philosophical position, which in itself is a set philosophical position.  The episode mentions that fact, but then proceeds to ignore it, probably because it defuses the entire \\"science = hard fact truth\\" vs \\"religion = no fact speculation\\" paradigm being pushed.<br />4.  Sisko states that all philosophies have a place on his station, but still, refuses to work towards the reasonable compromise.  He also comments on the Galileo affair by noting that things that happen in the past when people know less cannot be judged by today's standards.  Which happens to be a common failing among \\"rationalists\\".<br />5.  Creation of the universe and evolution also get mentioned gratuitously for no reason in the episode.<br /><br />The fact that how simple would it be to mention the local Bejoran beliefs that the \\"Prophets\\" (the powerful aliens responsible for the galaxy's only stable wormhole) have their \\"temple\\" inside the wormhole and keep it stable by their power would be trivial.  Especially considering that Sisko knows that these aliens did create the wormhole, did decide to make it stable, did decide to leave it open and, as far as is known at this point, do reside somehow in the wormhole (or place accessible by the wormhole somehow), makes this twisting of it into a \\"religion vs. science\\" + \\"science is right & religion is wrong\\" + \\"reasonable believers stayout of the way of science\\" + \\"attacking science by fanatics means a slimy ulterior motive\\" propaganda episode.<br /><br />A shabby one star propaganda episode, that gets the second star because it at least paid lip service to the clear refutations of the usual \\"rationalist\\" claptrap.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is a good game with a great twist of a challenge it is also cool and recommended
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Not even worth putting thought into writing a review, I'm already asleep.  If I could rate 0 I would.  This makes \\"Eyes wide shut\\" look like a masterpiece.
B005OTPKX4|5.0|I bought this collection out of curiosity since there was no track listing and the price wasn't bad. For those wondering what songs are on this collection, they are:<br /><br />01.)  QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART<br />02.)  AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME<br />03.)  EVERYBODY (Backstreets Back)<br />04.)  I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART<br />05.)  ALL I HAVE TO GIVE<br />06.)  I WANT IT THAT WAY<br />07.)  SHOW ME THE MEANING OF BEING LONELY<br />08.)  SHAPE OF MY HEART<br />09.)  MORE THAN THAT<br />10.)  DROWNING<br />11.)  LARGER THAN LIFE<br />12.)  INCOMPLETE<br />13.)  JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW<br />14.)  INCONSOLABLE<br /><br />Now if they'd only release a collection of remixes.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|While this game does seem to chew on my Galaxy S battery, it is very enjoyable and rather addictive - sort of like Tetris with a twist. 4-stars only due to battery drain.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Love this show and can't wait for the newest series to come out so I can own it too! This is a great DVD set to have and watch on those cold lazy days.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites! Who can't enjoy a Tv series with two hot brothers, the suprnatural, awesome music, and a bad ass car!?
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|If you are a fan of either, then I am sure you'd love this cd. My boyfriend listens to it every night with a blues cd as well. It's happy, upbeat quality music
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This series is an absolute favorite of mine! I don't watch TV often with my busy schedule, ut this is one show I take time to watch. Love Supernatural!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|you know how hard it is to top the original right? Well, they did it. quell reflect picks up where quell leaves off, raising the bar on style, fancier music, and even more diabolical dilemmas to devour!
B00637HXNG|5.0|Fantasic show!! Great picture! Great audio!! My only \\"complaint\\" is that I wish they had a few more tracks from recent releases.  All of the songs sounded great, but we already have several dvds with the classics.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you want to be a good father to your children, then this movie will inspire you to be that \\"Great Dad\\" that is deep within you.  A must see for any parent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are already many eloquent and exuberant reviews online, so I will only add that I can completely agree with the rave reviews. I am, however, happy to have bought the omnibus edition and to have read it as one book, I think I may have been left unsatifsfied had I read them one book at a time.<br /><br />Like many, I wonder if there will be more to come with the current set of characters, judging by the answers in the authors FAQ, we may not be disappointed.
B001684L0A|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised by the extensive work put into the period props.  You feel like you are back in the 1770's.  Paul Giamotti and Laura Finney are exceptional and intense.  Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson come to life.  Very well done... enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is koo, it cost too much to unlock new games but I like playing them, they are fun most of the time
B000002KO1|5.0|I would say that this album marked an important transitional point for rock as the decade turned into the 1980's. But it was actually recorded in the spring of 1979 so I suppose it doesn't count. Very much like the Police,The Presenders had the flavor of a cross continental band-three English musicians and one American singer/songwriter/guitarist named Chrissie Hynde. Now, we know that Hynde had and still has more than enough musical weight and personality  to hold her own as a solo performer. But evidently a part of her didn't seem too comfortable to do this the way Pat Benetar did. Besides her all around style blended well together with Pete Farndon,Martin Chambers and James Scott. Anyway why do I think this album is so often considered a classic?<br /><br />  Well for one think it walks a pretty much straight line between post punk and new wave pop/rock. Chrissie after all is a songwriter. So that plays into it a lot. Though you wouldn't expect the ultra fast,still very punky \\"Precious\\",\\"The Phone Call\\",\\"Up THe Neck\\" and \\"Tatooed Love Boys\\". These are noisy tunes,filled to capacity with fire and attitude. Even here though you can here some more heavy song craft becomming part of the mix. After the more abstract instrumenal \\"Space Invader\\" that song craft gets right to business with some catchy,slickly produced jangly guitar pop with \\"The Wait\\",\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\",\\"Kid\\",\\"Lovers Of Today\\" and \\"Mystery Achievement\\". These songs represent  the more fully formed Prentenders sound most fans  know and love.<br /><br />  The big hit of course course is the sassy groove of \\"Brass In Pocket\\",one of their best known and strongest songs from throughout their career and a great example of soulful pop/rock. \\"Private Life\\",covered later by Grace Jones showcases the reggae aspect of their sound. Sure it was a very trendy move at this point. But it's one of my favorites from this album. This was a band that was in it very much for the long haul. And even though hard living would result in one band member dying eventually and this particular lineup of the band being somewhat short lived....well it was a great thing while it lasted. Time would find Hynde taking more and more control,to the point where Pretenders were basically a backing band made up of whomever she happened to be working with. But as they say,sometimes there's nothing like the real thing.result in one band member dying eventually and this particular lineup of the band being somewhat short lived....well it was a great thing while it lasted.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Much more satisfactory than ear buds.  Use them all the time for listening to audio books.  Ordered at least 4 additional pairs for spouse and friends. Just wish they could fold, but no matter - they are wonderful.<br /><br />bought through Amazon - where I buy EVERYTHING
B004ZJADNQ|5.0|Catching Thin Lizzy in a period of transition before one of the guitar chairs turned into a revolving cast of characters, \\"Bad Reputation\\" is also one of the band's best LPs. Guitarist Brian Robertson is largely absent, having sustained severe hand injuries during a bar brawl just prior to the start of the sessions. Scott Gorham plays virtually all the guitars here, as well as coauthoring several songs. The rhythm section of Phil Lynott and Brian Downey delivers the goods. Tony Visconti's prtoduction allows the songs to breathe.
B0058YPGL6|1.0|Back in the 80s, thats right this is \\"WereWolf\\" remade with the pretty people, and what made the older series so spooky was that they used the same type of change effects that they used on the howling. Chuck Connors made the series, as the, what we thought was the Alpha. The twist with Connors Werewolf was that not only was he a werewolf, but in his human form had also been bitten by a rabid dog. Combine those two factors and you got one nasty mean mofo of a werewolf. Now we have pretty prissy boy bitten by werewolf helped CGI pretty much doing the same thing.    The difference is that John Yorks Werewolf was on his own. After killing his best friend and hitting the road to find Skorzeny, he interacts with people who have their own monsters afflicting them, human monsters that preyed on the helpless and this is where his change to Lycanthrope came in hand. Time and again he finds Skorzeny who reminds one of Wolf Larson from Jack Londons story. But Skorzeny is too old, evil and outright vicious for Eric to have beat Skorzeny while transformed.    Unfortunately the series ended as do all good series, without closure as we discover the Skorzeny was not the true Alpha after he was finally fried with electricity. Turns out it was Nicholas Remy, best known as the ice pick wielding bounty hunter in the X-Files, aside from DragonHeart and Fright Night 2. Now this show comes along and pretends to be something that it can never be. All it is is another pretty boy series with pretty girls trying to spook people, ooh Im scared of computer werewolf.    The series your about to see has been done and done better. The scripts have been changed to make you think your getting a decent product.    You can still see the series on Youtube. Watch a great Chuck Connors performance and then see if you still think this piece of fluff series even comes close.    [...]
0439023491|5.0|Great second part to an amazing series. One of those reads where you get real nervous as the pages become fewer in your right hand. You just don't want it to end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am a major gamer. So I find this app challenging but I'd have preferred if the game instructions appeared on the same page,when it starts. Being a free app, I'm ignoring the annoying popular. I love the variety it offers. overall, above average and worth installing.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I got this game as a FAOTD but I believe it to be worth the $2 payment. I find the combination of color-matching and puzzle game absorbing. I was surprised and delighted when the developer recently doubled the number of puzzles in the game. I'll be very disappointed when I've completed all of them. I hope I can reset and play all over again.

B005ER6SNM|4.0|This is a movie I saw the trailer for and had to know more. But then I forgot about it for a while. Well I finally got it, watched it, and cannot get the images out of my head. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying a movie about tricking a guy into getting into making snuff porn is disturbing. People will argue over what the most disturbing scene is, as this film hit you with omg and wtf moments from the very beginning and is in a constant state of one-upping itself. When the DVD was done my girlfriend and I just stared at the screen...we had to put in a DVD of the roadrunner and coyote just to wash our eyes out. Good luck jacking off or getting oral sex within a week of viewing and not having awful thoughts.

0596522347|3.0|The popular reviews on here seem to be the ones that give this book a lower rating. I'm not a professional designer type of person so perhaps I'm less of a purist and just in it for the joy of learning about presentations. I found the book to be a quick read and I liked that. There were some other reviews about this being low on content or too PowerPoint-related. Yes, it is called Slide:ology but it's not a PowerPoint book. The information was easy to digest as opposed to some books that want to expand on their points so much simply for the sake of filling space.<br /><br />As someone just looking to improve my presentation style, this was a good book to read, although I started reading The Naked Presenter based on another review and have found that to be the book to get. That said, what stood out for me in this book were the following chapters and points:<br /><br />- Chapter 4: Displaying Data<br />I thought that there were great tips in here about how to display data and charts in general. These tips are not PowerPoint-specific and can be referred to for any application you're using to generate graphs. For example, some useful recommendations were to wlways start your first data set for a pie chart at the 12 o'clock position, remove the legend and move the key into the graph, and use color to highlight what you really want viewers to focus on in the graph.<br /><br />- Chapter 5: Arranging Elements<br />There was a lot of useful information about laying slides out in a grid. Some of the useful tips from here were: when using images of people, make sure that they are looking at the content instead of looking away, or fleeing it; and that leaving the top and bottom rows in a 5x5 grid creates a more cinematic feeling while providing space for titles and similar information.<br /><br />- Chapter 7: Using Visual Elements<br />This chapter reminds you to think of your slide like a billboard and ask yourself whether your message can be processed effectively within 3 seconds. It also reminded me that my logo doesn't need to appear on every slide -- the people who have come to hear you speak most likely know who you work for.<br /><br />- Chapter 9: Creating Movement<br />This inspired me to add some slight movement to a presentation I was working on. It educated me on the ability to use transitions between two slides to create a timeline effect, especially when there is information that can span two slides.<br /><br />- Chapter 11: Interacting with Slides<br />It was here that I learned that hitting the \\"b\\" key during a PowerPoint slideshow would turn the screen to black so that the speaker can have the focus on them.<br /><br />- Chapter 12: Manifesto: The Five Theses of the Power of a Presentation<br />My favorite of the five theses is \\"Practice design, not decoration\\". I think that sums up the book nicely.<br /><br />I've been reading a few books on similar topics. They all have a good deal of overlap, but I think there's value in reading some of the same things over again in order to better reinforce them. This book is such a quick and easy read with well-done visuals and good tips that I don't agree with the harsh reviews given to it by others.onds.

0545259088|5.0|Forever is such an inspiring book just like the other two in the series. I could not put the book down once I started it! Definitely a  MUST READ! Some books start out great and end horribly, or vice versa. Forever was amazing all the way through! The characters are so realistic. I do love twilight but I have to say, Grace is SOOOOO much easier to relate to than Bella! Maggie literally went to all extents to make sure this series left with a bang!
B004EPZ00C|4.0|I bought this item for my sister who saw this film at the Movie theater and she laugh so much that I  decided to pre-order this items for her anniversary.

0439023513|1.0|Wow. In between publishing Catching Fire (1 Sep 09) and Mockingjay (24 Aug 10), the author certainly switched up the quality of her series' character-driven storyline.  I guess deflating the characterization from three-dimensional to one-dimensional allows her to spend more time and energy developing her subtle theme.  However, while many of the reviews here have suggested the book is \\"anti-war\\", I find it to be more \\"pro-impotence\\".  Not only does it seem to argue that nothing is worth fighting for, I'm having a hard time even finding an example of something it suggests is worth living for.  Nice message to the YA audience.  What a disappointing conclusion to what could have been a great story.<br /><br />...Spoiler Alert...<br /><br />This book \\"spoils\\" the entire series!

B005D5E8Q4|1.0|This book is a waste of your time ! The book leaves you with many open ends and forgotten characters while it makes long boring turns around new characters that seem to be completely unrelated to anything that ever happened. The end is abrupt and really doesn't appear to be the end of the book until you realize that there are no more chapters to follow. The author created so many characters in this story that he failed to connect them in the end. I'm so disappointed !

B003ZWTGKU|4.0|Despite a very uninteresting production, I really enjoyed this DVD, mainly because of the wonderful singing of Jonas Kaufmann!  He has got to be the greatest tenor of our time.  He sings and acts with such sensitivity, emotion and intelligence and it is such a beautiful sound !  Sophie Koch sings a nice Charlotte but in closeups her facial expressions are somewhat offputting!  The minor parts are all well done - but the whole opera revolves around Werther himself and he is amazing!

0060873027|2.0|OK, Gentle Reader -<br /><br />I readily confess that I am getting a bit long in the tooth, but I yet clearly recall when a brash young author by the name of Michael Crichton penned \\"The Andromeda Strain\\". As an old Sci-Fi fan, the book was instantly among my favorites - the science in the book was quite sound, if sometimes not quite yet done, but always more than believable. And the only part that was \\"out there\\" was the dingus from outer space that hit us. The movie was also quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Many dinguses (\\"dingi?\\" - we get dinged?) from outer space hit us every day. It is only a slight stretch to imagine that sooner or later, some such dingus will carry bacteria, viruses, prions, amino acids (oh, wait - they've done that already) here and - We're All Gonna Die! Well, that is also true, space dinguses or not.<br /><br />So - what happened between \\"Andromeda Strain\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", etc. and \\"Micro\\". Besides the authors death. Well, there is THAT.<br /><br />I have no idea what the people involved with the estate of the late Michael Crichton were thinking when they allowed this dog to go to print. \\"Andromeda Strain\\", while solidly in the Science Fiction genre, never strains credibility. Whilst reading it, I never once thought \\"Well, this is just BS!\\"<br /><br />Micro is pretty much BS from beginning to end.<br /><br />PLEASE someone tell me that M Crichton didn't actually write this!<br /><br />I have no idea how much of \\"Micro\\" was written by Crichton and how much by someone else, but the publication of this dreck does disservice to the memory of the late Michael Crichton. But that is just my opinion.<br /><br />GWoody<br /><br />On the other hand, \\"Micro\\" is, IMHO, pretty much BS from start to finish. The characters are not believable, the dialogue is laughable, and the plot is - excuse me, what plot? If you're very small, then Bugs are very Big. And Bad Guys are Far Worse if you are very small. That's pretty much it.

I hope she doesn't start making crappy decisions and singing over bad rappers like most pop<br />Singers do these days.
0385535139|1.0|This book is a poor excuse for a Grisham novel.  The plot is poorly developed and rambles on for more than 75% of the book before it begins to make sense - and than not that much. If this was written by a new author, it would be their first and last.  It saddens me to see someone of Grisham's ability trade on his name and put forth such a poorly written story.  This is the last Grisham book I'll ever purchase.

B005PW3OS8|4.0|This was an amazing movie. There was never a moment where I found myself bored. At one point, my wife decided to pause the movie to take a break and I found myself upset. It was that good.<br /><br />I'm not a Captain America fan. Of all the Marvel heroes, I thought he was too cheesy. Yet, this movie was exceptional at modernizing a war set in the 40s. The comedy was appealing, not as corny as I imagined it would be. The romantic interest wasn't overdone--I actually wanted to see more of it. And the action was right where it needed to be.<br /><br />My only hangup, the end. The original reason I didn't want to see this movie was because I knew they were rushing all of the Marvel hero movies to make the Avengers. The Avengers' trailer looked so great that I thought I should give this a shot. It was worth it, but and this is a big but, it was in fact rushed. The ending just didn't seem there for me.<br /><br />I'm somewhat of a Wolverine fan and I definitely expected to see a quick shot or at least a mention of his name. Nothing.<br /><br />So maybe he'll show up in Part 2? No. Spoiler alert: Good ole Cap will end up in the future. Why? Stupidest thing ever, he had to crash the plane. For what? It made absolutely no sense. He could turn the nose of the plane down, but couldn't turn it around or make a safe landing. The ending was almost enough to spoil the movie, but I won't judge the entire thing off the last few minutes.<br /><br />Overall, this flick really did it for me. I'm happy to have watched it.

0553386816|4.0|This book of yarns feels a little like the cull pile from ideas that were not strong enough to be self-standing novels. But they surely worked as short stories. Nice change of pace.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Back in the day, our Mom couldn't understand why so many of us \\"kids\\" loved Stephen King books.  She read a few chapters of Salem's Lot and declared, \\"He's such a good writer, why does he write about such awful things!\\"  As far as I'm aware, she never opened another of his books.<br /><br />How I wish (for more reasons than I could count!) she was alive, this time because I know she would love 11/22/63.  And so would other \\"non-fans\\".  This is simply a good read.  Well, not completely. It's also a good listen.  After receiving the book for Christmas, I devoured it before New Year's.  How I hated it to be over!  So.....I borrowed the audio edition from the library and enjoyed it again via my ridiculous 90 minute commute to and from work.<br /><br />Craig Wasson reads the audio version and does an outstanding job!  He is now one of my favorites and I will seek out more of his work.<br /><br />How many times have we wished fervently that we could go back and change the past?!  Not sure I will again.  I'm pretty sure I'll hear Jake saying \\"the past is obdurate\\".<br /><br />And who'da thunk it?! Stephen King, romantic author.  Now don't freak out guys, it's not a Harlequin Romance!  But there IS a love story. And a good one.<br /><br />The ending was perfect.....and heart-breaking.  Even though I knew it from reading the book already, I sobbed driving to work.  That's the magic of Stephen King....you grow to know and love his characters, and you feel for their experiences, the tough decisions they must make.<br /><br />How we danced!  Thanks, Jake.  Mom would have loved you!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Fun,entertaining,relaxing. Hours of puzzles to solve. A little slow after the last update I'm sure amazon will fix that. Have already had fun trying to beat my best times some are very hard. A couple of the puzzles my best time is over 10 minutes.
B000HEVALC|3.0|The sound is not up to today's standards. It is faint and hard to hear. Too much chatter and strumming by the original voices.  After seeing the stage play, I expected this music to be on par. Price was right.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This app allows you to download music and videos and its great if you want to keep them if you want to watch/listen without Internet. But this does have its bugs, for example, some videos wont appear to download. But you can find it in the gallery. Overall, this is a great app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|at first I thoht it was totally silly how simple these games are BUT back in the day we all played Tetris for hours on end. this terrific group of games are no different. I'm hooked on the sunshine and cutlers game to say the least. glad I downloaded it!

I read that joe challenged sammy to sing like he never did before but I dont hear any change in his vocals not bad just no difference in his style and sammy did the same with joe to play things unexplored and i dont hear anything different but joe still is badd real badd plays his ass off so he's just fine. Chad and Mike are just fine as well but I don't like the lyrics(who writes them?) on some of the songs but overall great collection of songs.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great game play. The text can be a bit small and the non standard tiles in the later levels can be a bit confusing. Excellent overall.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Outstanding!!! This is not your average action film. It has elements of art house which will turn some people off. It is also a violent film with exciting but fewer car chases than what many were expecting.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|this is a awesome movie. it is diffrent and thats what i liked about it. can you imagine the world like that. i wouldn't like it. i loved the story and the actors were great. this is a good movie.  if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love YA fiction...and I've read quite a bit of it.  Believe me, when I say this is the best trilogy I have read in years.  I'm not usually a fan of post-apocalyptic future books, but the world building is so delicious in this, I couldn't put it down.  After devouring all three in this series, I was left with a sense of complexity and finality.  She wrote the best \\"last line\\" of any book I've ever read.  Well done.  I'll certainly be looking for future books by this author.
B002V092M4|2.0|Jana Perskie's review was helpful but I found I could not get into this book at all, in fact I'm very disappointed with it. The story itself appears to be very compelling but I really got tired of trying to work out what the author was trying to put across, there were just so many names and words I was completely unfamiliar with. The work just doesn't come across as serious writing for what is a \\"serious\\" subject.

0307346609|5.0|I purchased this book so I'd have something to read before I went to bed at college, since I didn't have cable. The stories within are compelling and relatable. Its a good thing the stories were not too long, or I would have ever put this book down and went to sleep. If you're someone into post-apocalyptic world stories, zombies, or just want to try something new, pick this up.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I can't believe how horrible the ads were for this version of angry birds.  thank God I didn't. let my kids play this version yet. there should never be Xxx rated ads for any apps.  and if your clicking on them. SHAME ON YOU!!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|At first I was torn whether or not I should read these books. Alot of people were talking about how inapropriate it was about children fighting. I am so happy that those reviews did not deter me from reading this series. I enjoyed these books more than I ever enjoyed any books I have read. This is an amazing series from an amazing author!! A MUST READ!!!!

1904920209|4.0|If you're complaining that this book isn't accessible, you should try some of the baking textbooks we followed in culinary school. Richard is actually considering the home baker, not only by providing you with options on how to bake the bread (try finding another book that tells you to bake bread on an overturned sheet pan), but something as simple as alerting you to preheat your oven an hour before production! He's teaching you to bake from the heart, rather than from the science. Honestly, you'd be dizzy if the scientific facts on how gluten works were included in the book.<br /><br />Yes, there are little quirks within the book: typos, weight conversions bouncing between imperial and metric. However, that's nit picking. If you're afraid of the dough being too liquid, Richard gives you an exit strategy by providing the mixer preparation as an alternative. Hello?! I think what most people are complaining about can easily be remedied by being patient. Thoroughly reading the entire book (rather than assuming they're going to jump head first into a scientific experiment and coming out with a baguette that's both traditional in taste and measurement). And all without any previous experience in baking.<br /><br />I tried to branch out and avoid using my very classic culinary school baking textbook, and most books were vague and the recipes produced dense bread. But, with the DOUGH recipes, I followed the recipe to the tee and rewarded with amazing bread. Lighter Pan de Mie, closer to the store-bought bread my mother is used to. Fougasse, that's crunchy on the outside with a tender crumb. And Focaccia that disappeared from a party tray in no seconds flat.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, it would be that the focaccia recipe didn't say what size sheet pan to use, when I used a 1/2 sheet it came out too thin. No worries, I used common sense, adjusted it to a 1/4 sheet and it came out the thickness I expected.<br /><br />My dream is to participate in one of Chef Bertinet's classes in Bath, one day.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This is an all time favorite movie. Its great. Everything, the characters, the story. Gotta see it, gotta get it.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|To be honest, Sophies books have always been abit hit and miss to me ... \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" was definatley her best.<br />But this new book was great, I'm so pleased she hasn't lost her touch, It was just great escapism .... the only downside were the footnotes...not needed, and annoying towards the end ... ignore them and the book is great! :-)
0553386794|4.0|\\"Lord Eddard Stark is lord of Winterfell and lives in the North, in a time where winter and summer are measured by years, rather than months. His friend, and King of the seven kingdoms, King Robert Baratheon, comes unexpectedly to visit with his wife, kids and brothers in law. He offers Eddard a position serving him in King's Landing as the Hand of the King, and Eddard accepts and leaves Winterfell with the King.<br /><br />Westeros is a continent of sorts, that is ruled by Robert, and bordered by the land beyond the Wall, where the Others and wildlings live. The wall is protected by the Night's watch who take an oath to guard it as long as they live.<br /><br />The book is told from different character's point of views, the Stark kids, Catelyn (Eddard's wife), etc. In the beginning I found it very difficult to keep track of all the characters, and wished there was some sort of page where they were all listed (most fantasy & historical fiction novels have maps and family lists). I got the hang of it, eventually. And after finishing it, I found the appendix with all the names! I read this on my kindle, and had no idea it was going to be at the end..<br /><br />Greatly enjoyed it. Mid way through the second already, and can't wait to finish the series. I miss reading fantasy. I think this was exactly what I needed to motivate me to finish reading The Eye of the World (stopped at book 9 in that one, but I could definitely see the similarity in both EotW & GoT). My complaint about A Game of Thrones, however, was that I found it too explicit; there were several recurring scenes that I wish I could've just skipped.
1612930875|2.0|Look for another copy. This one has a typo on the FIRST page. \\"...keeping nothing back but the beaings [sic] of the island...\\"
0553381695|4.0|Book two of The Song of Fire & Ice picks up where the first book stops; Westeros is not the same place anymore. Both the King and his hand have been killed, and several people proclaim themselves as Kings. Fighting erupts amongst the warring sides, and the story continues with different characters' perspectives shedding light on the many events that happen.<br /><br />After the first book ended, I thought, well I will NOT get attached to any characters, since everyone seems to get killed! I hope though, that Arya Stark and Jon Snow will not meet their end in this series. This was such a fast paced book, utterly gripping - I'm actually reading the fourth now, but am behind with my reviews.
B006ON41FC|5.0|omg I love this game!! a lot of people have complained about the open feit but it really doesn't do anything. I finished the game and it sucks because the goals don't start over:( get this game because it rocks!!!
B004UHSB5A|4.0|HTC Incredible<br />Unlike what others have mentioned I found the tiles to be reasonable easy to place. Once you get use to the amount of precision needed tile placement is never a problem. I can't really understand the major complaints about that unless they are device dependent. I love the game and have no complaints about how it plays. One major flaw though is that it keeps running in the background when you switch out of it and uses a lot of battery power by doing so. I don't see a way to exit out of it either so you have to use a task killer app or otherwise force close it. That is actually a fairly big deal to me and I thought about taking off two stars but the game is so excellent and fun in all other areas that it just felt wrong to go below 4 stars.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|I didn't really like this game. I mean I like pinball but this is not a good version. I wouldn't waste my time.

0316098515|4.0|That answer is not my answer but the answer the authors give themselves.  And it is definitely not a complaint on my part either: it is a very accurate appraisal of a beautiful book written with the kind of attention that goes into creating innovative epicurean delights.  I heard about Eleven Madison Park through the New York Times review.  I would love to go there for dinner but have not gotten to New York since reading about them.  So my wife got me this cookbook for my birthday.<br /><br />This book is about restaurant food -- high end restaurant food.  The kind of food that is prepared with the help of a sous chef and specifically the kind of food that is prepared in a kitchen that uses all kinds of delicious house made ingredients (basil oil, lemon oil, crumbles, fresh mayonaise etc.) to create depth in the recipes.  The recipes have not been streamlined to create \\"gourmet food in thirty minutes\\".  Yes that does limit the utility of the book.  But if it were not this way it would not do justice to food that most of us only dream of eating.<br /><br />I have only made a few things from this book -- mostly salads and granolas (since we are vegetarians, many of the meat dishes will be left aside).  Even a simple looking salad can create challenges (if you don't have the lemon oil made in advance).  But, as the authors promise, if you do take the time to create these dishes, you will be rewarded.  We have yet to have a dish from this book that was not stupendous.<br /><br />I am using four stars to alert people that this is really not a home cookbook.  If I were rating just the food, I would petition for the addition of a sixth star.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I started reading this eBook, my first thought was, who comes up with this stuff?!?!!  Our world in the future, a government who uses the self-killing children of its land to yearly remind its people that you shouldn't rise against the government...  Boy do I wish I had this type of imagination.<br /><br />I got hooked right in.  My sister-in-law recommended it about a year ago, and I finally got some free time.  The characters are well developed, the foundation was well thoughtout, the intensity started in the first chapter.  I could barely put the book down.  I am a very slow reader, often used to proof-read others' materials because I read every \\"and\\", \\"the\\" and \\"to\\".  I read this book in three days!!  A personnal record for this slow reader, I am sure.<br /><br />I couldn't believe the next chapter and the next chapter after that.  Shock, awe, confusion, questions, intensity, insanity.  It really was good.  Had to learn a few new phrases and terminology, but after a while, it was second hand.<br /><br />The ending was totally worth the wait.  LOVE IT.  Thanks to my SIL for recommending the series.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book.  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.  The eBook was great, I didn't feel I missed anything by not having the actual book in my hand (in case you are on the fence).
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Awesome case! Fits perfect, feels solid and well made. My husband wished they made one for his Sony tablet! Looks awesome in white too! Great job! A+
B001O1O71C|4.0|I read this eBook free from the library.  I was really surprised by it.  I will admit that I read the ending first, knowing \\"ish\\" how it ended, to be sure I wouldn't sob while reading it on the bus.  I thought the ending was extremely well written; I wasn't full of tears, but I did hold my breath.  It was shocking, even though I knew what was coming.  Odd I know, but extremely good when reading a book.<br /><br />This book was written from the 10 year old's \\"voice\\".  I must say one thing I did NOT like were the run-on sentences, long paragraphs, and a whole lot of \\"ands\\".  In my opinion, it made the flow difficult when reading.  When we were kids, yes, we spoke run-ons and a lot of \\"ands\\", but as an adult, it seemed a bit busy, messy, sloppy.  Nothing that would make me hate this book, but as a slow reader in the first place, it was a small challenge.<br /><br />I thought the two children trying to understand their new home, was really the best part of this book.  The older sister deciding what and where they were; the younger son comparing his old life to his new one.  The lack of communication between parent and child is haunting.  How a child strings things together, puts two-and-two together to try to understand a situation, is a facinating look into their situation.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the \\"childish\\" (in a good way) take on WWII, Hitler, and an extremely well known concentration camp.  Talking about the great \\"Fatherland\\", \\"The greatest land in the world\\", the \\"Fury\\" (the Fuhrer) and \\"Out-With\\" (assumed to be Auschwitz).<br /><br />The topic is breached gently, poetically, and with respect.  It's the insight into a world that honestly, I have never thought about.  It's a quick read, and could probably be read in a day.  Try it.  It leaves you thinking...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This isn't your usual Sci-Fi spaceship with epic battles story.  I really liked it, and could barely put it down.  Now I'm hoping the author with come out with more soon!  I can't wait for the next story.  I have a short list of authors I watch for new books, and I'll be adding Hugh Howey to my list!  The author gave ideas where future stories might go, and I'd love to read them all.  Keep up the great writing Hugh!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
0062101897|5.0|It is an awesome book! I definitely learned a lot from it. There was quite a few things I had no idea about from watching the movies to reading this book! I saw it at a Barnes & Noble for $75 and I jumped on amazon and got it for so much cheaper!!! Thanks amazon!!!!!
0545265355|1.0|What a God Awful depressing piece of work this is, I think \\"The Road\\" is more optimistic than this. The thing that bothers me the most is the way the author so casually dismiss's this country's long history of democracy and freedom as something trivial and totally swept away. Some of the comments expressed in Mockingjay lead me to think the author really doesn't care much for our unique form of government. I'm also amazed (but in some ways not suprised) that this series was wtitten expressly for teens, why in heaven's name would you write something as negative and depressing as this for an age group known for high rates of suicide, look aat this! no future here! As far as teens go, I wonder how many will actually sit down and actually read the whole series. I suspect many will buy the books read a few pages put it aside intending to read further but never finishing, Hell! they will just watch the movie, afterall, look at all those teenage heartthrobs they stuffed into that picture. I understand the author was attempting to portray young people caught up in a time of war, funny she would create a story such as this when there are so many real-life and historical examples to chose from. Don't get me wrong, one of my favorite genre's is Sci-Fi (thats why i read the series) but all through the series I kept \\"smelling\\" an agenda, too bad, when theres so much better out there it's a shame to waste precious time on crap like this.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have had a Forerunner 305 for several years and been generally happy with. I mostly use it for biking and indoor workouts.  Unfortunately I ran it through the washer and it is not working reliably and was about to purchase another from Amazon when I noticed their note that said the 405CX  had the same features, was wireless and less expensive, also waterporof[[ASIN:B0025UHKNS Garmin Forerunner 405CX GPS Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor (Blue)]].<br /><br />It is not better and I am going to return it for another 305.<br /><br />The instructions are terrible!  Nothing in there says you need to push the \\"start\\" button to access the functions.  Installing the Ant+ stick is a nightmare because the manual does not say that you need to access settings on the watch to get it to sync; I also needed to download 3 upgrades to software to do this. I ended up spending 30 minutes on the phone with tech support; they are open until 7 pm CT M through Th although their website says 6 pm, and best to call later in the week.<br /><br />The real problem is the bezel is hyper sensitive at times, and unresponsive at others, so that when I tried to set a field, it would sometimes go back without any touch from me and change itself.  Getting it to work for a workout was a nightmare; I could not do it.  It appears I need to spend 5 minutes setting it up for each workout.  On the 305, I just press start and I am ready to go.<br /><br />But the Forerunner 305 instead. It is much easier to use.<br /><br />agw
B004GXL8GC|4.0|My daughter loves the smurfs, this collection was a great buy. She constantly plays with them, she also collects little figures like this, she has tons of Dora and Diego, and Strawberry Shortcake, so this went well with them all. If you love the movies, or your kiddo does, buy it for them, they will love it.

B006KSAPV0|5.0|Every now and then a film comes and introduces to the audience an entirely new unheard of concept. The Skin I Live is a film with a unique plot, very well dramatized, high intensity story, some super acting and ended making me wish there were maybe three of four minutes more to it.<br /><br />Of whatever little I have seen of Antonio Banderas, this is his best film.<br /><br />The director Pedro Almodvar has made some outrageous films. Let's talk - \\"All about my mother\\" , \\"Volver\\" , \\"Broken Embraces\\" , \\"Talk to her\\" were made with such a heavy unforgiving sincerity. His work, I dare add is no less than a great book or a great painting which lasts for years - it is art. Of these films, All About My Mother was the most poignant one but imagine this  - I think the director may just have raised the bar a little with \\"The Skin I Live In\\"<br /><br />A real treat and easily among my top 5 films of 2011. The makers of the film deserve all the academy awards they can get but I won't be surprised if this is overlooked as it doesn't have a political message but there is a wondrous world this director manages to create within his films and for the love of that, this film deserves to be watched. The Skin I Live In stands alone, I have never seen anything like it. It will disturb you, rot your mind but in the end, own your vote of confidence.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you have not begun the Wool series, you should get ahead by purchasing this omnibus. As an avid science fiction reader, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Hugh Howey is well on his way to being considered one of the giants of the science-fiction genre. Yet Wool is so much more than that. It is an exciting and roiling journey through the human condition. The characters are so aptly developed, the setting so densely painted so as to ingrain into the reader's conscious and subconscious mind that you will find yourself asking questions of and as to the fate of the characters in the idle time you have between reads...that is if you can bear to put this series down.<br /><br />I can easily see myself reading this series time and again, as I consider it to be on par with that of Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender\\" series and works by giants like Timothy Zahn and Michael Reaves/Steve Perry.<br /><br />Expect to be riveted. The tale of Silo 18 will have you begging questions about humanity. What happened? How long? Why? How? You will be angered by the treachery of ambitious politicians hungry for power and seemingly beyond justice. You will be enamored by the subtleties of love both as romantic and as camaraderie between the lives of those embroiled in the fate of Silo 18. You will disdain at the seeming futility of it all, only to find yourself burning through the pages anticipating the resolution of perhaps the most desperate of conflicts, of which there are many and of which you will be hard pressed to define.
0062101897|5.0|Wow. Got this book a couple of days ago. First thing struck me was how beautifully designed and printed it was. Spot UV varnishes and silver inks abound...<br />Very informative and interesting to read. Great pictures and very well laid out..<br />So glad i made this purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|24-Feb-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:0545425115 The Hunger Games: Movie Tie-in Edition]] appears written for a teen/young-adult audience.

My daughter gave it to my convalescing wife, who recommended it to me.<br /><br />I burned through the book in a couple evenings and want more. (Young adult audience? Pshaw. You're as young as you want to be.)<br /><br />What I like about the book:<br /><br /> - Hunger Games is VERY fast-moving<br /><br /> - it pulls you into the story.<br /><br /> - it has a couple large-scale social messages embedded, and I hope this will get people thinking<br /><br />What I don't like about the book:<br /><br /> - it ended<br /><br /> - (give me a minute, I'll think of something)<br /><br />My recommendation: read it.<br /><br />Hunger Games is suitable for pretty much any teen over the age of, say, 15 or so.<br /><br />For parents: read it yerself. The characters are teens thrown together in a survival situation. (We've all read \\"The Deadliest Game,\\" haven't we?) There is really nothing racier than Ron and Hermione snogging. People have commented that the story is brutal. Think about how many characters get avadra-kadabra-ed in Potter: no blood, but they're still outa the game...<br /><br />BTW, Amazon, though I have a KF, we read the print, no-movie-tie-in edition. It would be nice to be given the option of reviewing the original thing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not going to write a lengthy review. For those of you who are reading the review to see opinions about the book and if you should read it or not. This one is for you. First, I will have to say, I had never heard of this author until about a week ago. I am now reading all his books and craving for more. Wool 1-5 is a wonderful, amazing story line that makes me wish there was more. The story is great, the suspense is great. It is an easy read and keeps you captivated. I finished all 5 of the wool series in about 20 hours. I would have finished sooner if life did not get in the way. I could not put it down. If you need a new good author and book to read. This one is for you!
B006OAB3ME|1.0|I expected way more from this CD.Englebert is back, and John is laughing his ass off! If I wanted this I would listen to Sinatra, Doris Day or Stewart! Paul has turned in to a Lounge act!
B006IND5M8|4.0|The visuals were really good but the characters felt like tired stereotypes. The only real strong point of this movie is that it changed up the western pace with aliens.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|Overall, a good movie, that had moments of greatness.<br />This movie is based on a book. I have not read the book so I can only speak to what ended up on the screen.<br />The story follows two women, in a small town in Mississippi, who live on opposite sides of the tracks.  One woman is a maid and has lost her inner fire, and the other woman is trying to find herself despite the social restrictions and pressures of who she's \\"supposed to be\\".  Both women end up working together, writing a book about the lives of \\"The Help\\" in their small town, a behind the scenes look at the lives of poor black women in Mississippi.<br />There were some absolutely great moments in this movie, some that broke your heart or even made you laugh outloud.  However, they were not as frequent as they should have been, in my opinion.  And that tells me, areas of the story were lacking. Also, I did not believe the character development of the maid was as good as it should have been.  The idea for the movie, was fantastic, but the idea needed a little more work in the writing and development department.<br />Sometimes a good movie gets a lot of attention, partially because it's so unusual (the story) and the timing of when it came out (nothing else like it).  While that may be true, it still doesn't make it a great movie.<br />I would buy this movie for my collection.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is your classic game with a wild twist. I love the wild tile option. The graphics are good but could use some different layouts.
B004UID2LC|5.0|just satin amazing perfect for me and anyone who likes to dance sing and have fun all of ya haters yr tones are wacko just saying kk byee
B005LJ6YK0|4.0|The other amazon reviews are all right on the money.  I love the consistently strong mid-60's strumming/jangling guitar work and even better the surprisingly retro drums.  It all works.  I dont think the band has quite found its stride yet though.  The vocal melodies are there but they arent perhaps as compelling as the band wants them to be. Some lyrics repeat too much.  There's a flatness to all of the tracks that may be more the fault of the producer rather than the band.  No matter -- I'll be very interested in their next CD.

1573301183|5.0|I have loved AIC from the beginning, but being a poor young adult I did not have cable and missed this on MTV.<br /><br />Nutshell and Sludgefactory brought me to tears, today seems like Layne was singing about his own demise.<br />Alice in Chains is definatly one of the most iconic bands of the 90's with one of the most undeniably talented front-men ever.<br />This is one that I will watch over and over again.<br />I would give this DVD 10 stars but Amazon wont let me.<br /><br />off the topic but I was wondering if any one noticed.....<br />I would almost swear that there were a couple Metallica riffs between songs.

0545425115|5.0|This is one terrific book! Katniss is not the first female heroine, but she is one of the strongest. Seen thru her eyes and experiences in games set in a future dominated by one powerful state, and many serf states, Katniss both allows you near to her, yet keeps herself far away. This is a girl that doesn't trust, not even at the end.<br /><br />Katniss is from district 12, a poor mining district, who elects to go to the Hunger Games, and annual battle royale tournament, featuring 12 boys and 12 girls, one from each of the 12 districts, killing each other to the enjoyment of fans in the Capitol. Part 1984, part Rollerball, with a hint of the manga Battle Royale, this is not a world where one wants to live, unless they are part of the privileged few of the Capitol. The Capitol has amazing, and horrifying, technology, while the districts each struggle to survive. The story of Katniss and her wouldbe boyfriend (or not) Peeta is riveting.<br /><br />Great stories require great characters, and Katniss is one. Noble, brave, and caring, but not trusting, she is a girl that cannot let others get to close. In a world where death is everywhere, she is afraid of hurt, and unsure what it means to actually love someone. She is one of the best characters I have experienced in a long time.

B005ONTD42|3.0|EDIT (January 2014): Yup, forgot to change my number of stars.  I turned off comment notifications because being berated for a negative review isn't very fun and I just forgot to get back to it.  So many more important things in life :)  In any event, the Sphero still sits in it's box.  It's been taken out a few times over the years and the novelty wears off after ten minutes or so.  My kids are now four and two and there are more exciting things to keep them busy.  Sorry haters, but I can't change my mind about a product that a) isn't very fun in the long run b) is very expensive compared to the amount of use it gets c) only releases apps that make it more engaging a LONG time after the product is released and lastly d) well, I forget what d is for (insert Blister in the Sun lyrics here).  Seriously, it's just my opinion.  No need to get testy.  I spend .99 cents on an app that I play for months on end and I get more than my moneys worth.  Not so, FOR ME, for this product.  Three stars.  One for the innovation (however that has long since passed since there are now so many other \\"use your iPhone to move x\\" products on the market.  One for the level of proactive responses by the company.  Last star to bring the review up to 50+%.  I'm happy now.  You?  :)<br /><br />I had my Sphero pre-ordered for over a year before it shipped.  I was really excited about the product and the demo videos looked amazing.  I was shipped one of the first batches and excitedly took it out of the box.<br /><br />YES, it freaks my dog out.  YES, my three year old likes making it move via my iPhone.  NO, it didn't stand the test of time and some issues with functionality make it pretty useless.<br /><br />*** [EDIT: Useless is the wrong word.  It is very cool, but didn't stand the test of time for me.]<br /><br />The main issue is that the darn thing has a turning radius of around two feet.  Imagine running the thing into a wall and waiting patiently as it slowly figures out how to turn around.  It's like watching someone try and do an eight point turn in a Cadillac.  The other issue has to do with it's directional abilities.  When you turn the Sphero on it asks you to \\"orient\\" the device.  In other words, it wants you to pick (and maintain) a forward direction.  Fine, but the ball is in motion and if you roll it somewhere else, it would be nice to be able to move around with your phone/controller.  If you were to turn around with your phone, forward would now be backward.  Does that make sense?<br /><br />*** [EDIT: Thank you, Sphero, for responding and teaching me how to use the device.  I think the UI could use some polishing since the settings aren't always obvious.  That said, \\"turning radius\\" and \\"auto-heading\\" DO exist.  Yahoo!  Turning radius, at it's lowest, was much better.  Still not \\"reverse\\" but it was better.  Auto-heading didn't work for me.  I was still finding myself in situations where forward wasn't forward anymore.  Frustrating for me and definitely frustrating for my three year old.]<br /><br />In any event, I believe the reviews have been stacked with Sphero employees writing glowing reviews.  Don't be tricked by the \\"more apps coming soon\\" reviews.  We all bought into the hype by reading pre-release reviews on Gizmodo, etc. but in my experience, the actual hands on time is lack luster.  Remember, I had this thing on pre-order for over a year.  Plenty of time for them to create apps if they wanted to.<br /><br />*** [Sphero responded to my review over a month ago.  Still nothing new on the app store...  Again, I had this thing on pre-order for a year.  More apps please for me to want to take this toy out of the closet.]<br /><br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />*** [Just one last tidbit.  Packaging was awful.  One of those products that's designed to look good in the box but hard to take out, environmentally unfriendly, and almost impossible to put back in the box.]und.

B006ON41FC|5.0|it fun but a little hard try getting 15 golden nuts when trees and other nuts are trying to get to you and the owls just hard but its fun get this app NOW!
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Good is the perfect word to describe this, until you take into account the price.  Then it's surprisingly excellent.  My only complaint is the power socket/plug mating is less than super tight and if you move the unit or the power cord around a lot, it tends to disconnect.  This isn't an issue once you're set up, obviously.<br /><br />I just worry about its lifespan if it's this loose to begin with.  Maybe flattening the plug a bit will cause it to mate tighter.  This problem isn't even bad enough for me to try that, though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really like this app very fun hours and hours of entertainment for the whole entire family. great job 2 thumbs up. my 3 kids dig it.
0671449028|5.0|Great story in paperback. It is even better on the iPad, though...things move, make noise,...we save iPad Boynton time for the weekends and read the board books M-F. Our son (almost 2) LOVES Boynton, as he calls her books.  She has so many great titles, we have over ten of her books, but this one was our first.

Mix one part Quixote, one part Aquinas and 5 parts W.C. Fields and enjoy the cocktail!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a quality mahjong game.  It's very fun to play (if you like mahjong) and I enjoyed the unlocking of the different artifacts.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I've had the basic version of this movie in more video formats than any other in my collection.  From videotapes (Beta, VHS), LD (laserdisc) and both versions on DVD.  I really like this movie.<br /><br />Negative comments like preposterous, tedious, pedophiliac, I've heard from folks in person.  I guess some are set differently in their ways and obviously don't share the same taste, fortunately a more accurate overall view is presented here in volume.<br /><br />Jean Reno has been described by some as an unattractive middle-aged man yet that hasn't deterred his success as an actor because he has likeability, a characteristic that isn't heavily based on looks.  Gary Oldman fit and played the part of a bad cop exceptionally well.  Director Luc Besson is a romantic and it shows.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful to use and oh so mobile. Easy to read and a blessing to have. I recommend it as s must have.
1594203334|5.0|I actually ordered this book in hard-cover as soon as I read about it.  (Except for professional reference books, I usually only buy paperbacks and get books as cheaply as possible from the library, resellers, etc.)  So that's saying something about my level of interest to read this book.  My husband and I are older parents of a toddler.  My 3rd child and his first.  My other 2 kids are adults.  I want very much for this younger child's upbringing to be more successful (for all of us) than I felt when I was blundering through the other 2 kids' childhoods.  The idea of having a child who isn't \\"unbearable,\\" who we can travel with, who is thoughtful and articulate, and who will not take over our lives is very, very attractive.  The author also makes a strong argument that children raised in the French way are happier, more resilient and self-confident, which of course is what we all want for our kids even if we can't quite figure out how to help them get that way.<br /><br />The author makes interesting and enlightening comparisons between American and French parenting.  She presents concepts in an entertaining way, acknowledging often how difficult it was for her to recognize and change her own instinctive ways of Americanized parenting to be more in line with those she observed in France.  She seems to amaze even herself when small changes are effective, which is encouraging both to her and to the reader.<br /><br />I have been telling my husband all about this book and he is looking forward to reading it next.  I hope we will be able to incorporate  these ideas with our child, who although quite bright, doesn't listen particularly well, doesn't sleep well, and has a fairly restrictive diet.  I am excited to know there can be another, more peaceful, way to live with a toddler!
B006GRBK4G|5.0|Saw this film on the big screen, can't say enough about it. Mark Neale has created something very special here so when I found the DVD on Amazon I had to have it, you won't be disappointed. Anyone who thinks this movie is boring just ain't living!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I will simply show you what I just said to the author of this book... @JamieMcGuire_  I have just this second finished reading 'Beautiful Disaster' I just want to THANK YOU for one of the BEST experiences of my life, I have been on such an emotional journey with this book, laughed, cried, smiled & held my breath hungry for the next page! I will carry this book with me forever & the two characters of Abby & Travis, wow.. Im speechless the adrenaline running through me as I came towards the end, I didn't want to say goodbye to this book but I just know I will experience it time & time again as I re read this book in the future. Thank you.
0446530573|5.0|While I have never even watched a full episode of The Sopranos show, and while I do not condone anything that plays up Italians as dirty rotten crooks, I have to say that I do love this cookbook.  If you are a Sopranos fan, you will like how the cookbook actually reads like an interesting book, with antecdotes from the Sopranos characters.  If you want authentic Italian recipes, like those my grandparents made, you will enjoy using this cookbook.  I am 100% Italian and my mother (the best cook on Earth) says that these recipes are pretty authentic, so there you have it.  Don't mess with Mama. :)  She likes it so much that she bought all three of us kids a copy!  So far every recipe I have tried has come out great (including the pignoli cookies, which are Dad's favorite), and most are really easy and often written to be convenient to make too.  Love this book!
030788743X|4.0|This book is definitely written for the \\"Geeky\\" folk. Set in a dystopian future wherein the resources of the Earth have been famished. Among the few things left to do, the biggest addiction is the utopian virtual world OASIS. The creator of OASIS has created a fantastic game wherein the players can play and spend reminiscing about the past. The biggest draw being the search for the three keys which will bequeath the finder with the fortune of the creator.<br /><br />The first part of the book is its strength as the author's research about the games, movies, music and all things of the 1980s. The book is a sort-of-quest fantasy which adds to the fun in reading and set in a virtual world. The shortcomings about the book were that some of he main character's decisions in the latter half of the book do not directly gel with the character established in the earlier half, however this is a bit subjective so depending on your perspective it might not seem such a big draw.<br /><br />All in all an awesome debut and kudos to the author for bring the 80s alive so vibrantly in a book wherein one's knowledge of the 80's culture and  milieu can help unlock one's life so get ready readers for a debut to chuckle along with and enjoy thoroughly!
0152023984|5.0|If every person in the world read this book, we would live great times! My dad gave to me when I first learned to read... As I will to to my sons with I have any....<br />And this edition is beautiful!

B004LROUNG|4.0|I was concerned that this would be another of John Grisham's boring mechanical legal novels. Rather, it was a good read! The characters were likable and plot just thick enough to keep me interested. With 75 pages left, I couldn't put it down.
0142419400|5.0|Of all the books that I have read this year, Anna and the French Kiss is one of my favorites!!<br />Once I picked up this book I could not put it down. Every chapter kept you wanting more and more from this novel! I started it at around 8 at night and kept on reading till 1 am!<br /><br />The best part about this novel was the romance between Anna and St. Clair (isn't that the best last name?!). Their relationship kept going back and forth and I was rooting for them throughout the whole novel!<br /><br />Of course, I loved the setting. Paris isn't called the city of love for nothing!<br /><br />Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this book! I think I have read this book at least three times which goes to show how much I loved this book!

0385534639|5.0|I'm in love with this book. Utterly enchanted. This story shows the loveliest form of words, the power of words to enchant, to entrall, to entertain. Imagination & dreams to carry you on a looping journey of magic, fantastic vistas, travel, performers, a circus, and the age-old tradition of storytelling itself.<br /><br />A book for the dreamer in all of us.<br /><br />A couple of quotes from the book, to me, sum up the beauty of this story as it completes the delightful circle of storytelling....<br /><br />-----<br /><br />\\"I find I think of myself not as a writer so much as someone who provides a gateway, a tangential route for readers to reach the circus. To visit the circus again, if only in their minds, when they are unable to attend it physically. I relay it through printed words on crumpled newsprint, words they can read again and again, returning to the circus whenever they wish, regardless of time of day or physical locaiton. Transporting them at will.<br /><br />When put that way, it sounds rather like magic, doesn't it?\\"<br /><br />-----<br /><br />\\"It is important,\\" the man in the grey suit interrupts. \\"Someone needs to tell those tales. When the battles are fought and won and lost, when the pirates find their treasures and the dragons eat their foes for breakfast with a nice cup of Lapsang souchong, someone needs to tell their bits of overlapping narrative. There's magic in that. It's in the listener, and for each and every ear it will be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict.\\"

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I must say I'm a Metallica and a Megadeth fan, but much more so the former. Everyone knows the sad saga Metallica has become. Even after purchasing their latest EP, which imo is only 3.5 stars (death magnetic 3.0), and having a good taste in my mouth I can help but be overhwlemd by the superior quality (sound), and craftsmanship Mustaine put in this album. This is a very good album. The songs flow good, the engineers did a good job mastering the album, just great EVERYTHING!! Doesn't sound so contrived like Metallica's last few albums at all. So if you think Metallica's EP was good, this will blow your sox off. The first track has some blazing fast guitars and drums and rhythm which makes me thinkg of Judas Priest's Painkiller album...unreal Mustaine is that damn good still! This is my favorite album since Youthanasia for sure. Tracks 1,3, 4, and 13 are very good, for varying reasons.<br /><br />Frankly, I think Megadeth and Mustaine may have finally eclipsed Metallica for making quailty music. Maybe not on the marketing front, but any true metal head, regardless of any silly 'alliances' with a band, really has to appreciate how good this album is, imo.
0525478817|5.0|John Green has a talent for somehow understanding male and female characters who are teenagers. It's interesting, because he, obviously, is a man, and was never a teenage girl. But in this story, he gives Hazel, a teenager girl with cancer, a voice that is so real it feels more genuine than anything else I have ever read. Hazel meets another guy with cancer, Augustus, fondly called Gus. He had a portion of one leg removed while Hazel is forced to carry around a respirator all of the time. They bond over Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction by Peter van Houten. It too is about a girl with cancer, and the ending leaves both Hazel and Augustus unsatisfied. As they discuss the book and set out on a journey to ask Mr. van Houten the questions that plague them, they slowly fall in love.<br /><br />It doesn't feel like cancer is the main point of this book. Obviously, it would feel like it drives the entire plot, but somehow, beautifully, it doesn't. It takes a backseat to two teenagers falling in love over something as lovely as a book. Cancer isn't a looming presence, probably because Hazel and Gus accept death as an ally. This story is magical- it is funny and sad and poignant and brutal, but most of all it comes across as terribly honest and that is what I most appreciate about it. This book is a must-read if you have ever read anything else by John Green, and if this is the first book you are reading by this author, then you need to read his other books, like Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns.

She has a presence about her that exudes femininity, gracefulness, lust, intensity. She is a woman who knows her own body, and wields it with skilled deliberate tenacity.<br /><br />There are 150 photographs of her in this, taken over a 20 year period by amazing photographers. Its a big slick hard gorgeous book with red edges on the pages..a work of art, that contains a work of art.<br /><br />She turns me on. She turns my man on. And that makes for a good ..read.
B007BLDFWG|5.0|I am not a clinician, although from my viewing of this film it exhibited so many elements of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) resulting from what happens to a person who has suffered traumatic events. Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) exhibits many of the symptoms; flashbacks, dissociative states of mind and patterns, inappropriate behavior, paranoia, emotional blunting, etc. after she was no longer held against her will in a religious cult. The content during her life within this cult is quite shocking for the viewer, at least, it was for me.  This most 'probably' happened brought on through Martha's life within the cult where she was shocked innumerable times.  It also may have begun earlier in her life, although from what is depicted, it arguably became full-blown and chronic while there.<br /><br />Martha is renamed &#34;Marcy May&#34; upon her arrival with new friend Zoe (Louisa Krause). Patrick (John Hawkes) heads-up this communal cult and is overly quick to take over the new Marcy May after his renaming of  her.  They are located in the Catskill Mountain area in a very dense wooded area.  As is typical with many cults, the women remain subservient to the men and are made to have sex with Patrick. In this particular cult, the women are made available to the other male members also.  Patrick is quite a haunting persona with a likeness to another cult leader of repugnant reputation. The activities and violence of this group are also reminiscent of that horrific sect'.  It  provoked those heart pounding memories for me while frightening me all the more.<br /><br />Martha is able to escape into the trees for her cover during the early morning hours, then taking off and running for her life.  She begins to be chased by a fellow member, although eventually gets herself through the woods and into a small town. Finding a pay phone as quickly as possible, Martha calls her sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson).  She is directly picked up and drastically tries to identify where she even is.  Lucy finds her sister then brings Martha to her home that she shares with husband Ted (Hugh Dancy).  This is where the movie quickly gains pace and Martha begins to sharply unravel.  She is confused and caught between her past life in the cult commune and the present with her family.

The obviously normal actions of Lucy towards Martha is called, &#34;secondary wounding&#34;.

ONE OF THE BEST BANDS ON EARTH. BUT U CAN'T SEE THE VIDEO. I AM NOT GOING TO RETURN THE CDS BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD.<br />HOPE THIS HELPS YOU.
B0055SWM08|4.0|:its a wonderfully done version of a semi-old game, but that just can't bring 5 star \\"love\\" (per the star mouse overs) anymore. 5 stars should be for ground breakers. it is beautiful and enjoyable though, and worth it at just a buck. It is quite polished.

B003KUSUG8|3.0|Great CD, however this CD came with a broken case. To make matters worse the CD I received was USED. No adhesive sticker on top of album, can see fine scratches on CD face. It was also wrapped with aftermarket shrink wrap. I will not be purchasing from Fogo Books LLC in the future.
031261246X|5.0|I don't read much novels in general. In my spare time I read books about technology and articles regarding security and ciber crime. But I wanted to give this a shot knowing the superb expertise Mark has. He also always displays subtle humor at his technical presentations so both characteristics triggered me to buy his book and give it a try.<br />Using my Kindle I finished reading the book in two days. It is well written and realistic when thinking about the technical threats being described. With all data theft and leakage these days and hackers breaking into systems, the scenarios are extremely real. I am sure many, if not all, are related to real world situations.<br />The book reads like a novel though, so no technical knowledge required. My wife read the book as well and was impressed and amazed thinking about the threats.<br />I thought the whole story is thrilling and the developments in the book build up well so you want to keep reading.<br />I hope for another great novel from Mark.<br />[[ASIN:B00457X7XQ Zero Day: A Novel]]
B003OY91HW|3.0|I've had Magnolia's cupcakes, and the recipes come pretty close to the real thing. I'm wondering if there's an ingredient that they're withholding on purpose, because I mean, come on, if they sell their recipes, who would buy the cupcakes from the bakery?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|wonderfully addictive, great twist on a classic, glad I downloaded. even the sound effects make me happy! highly recommended, love the comics for the introductions
0525478817|5.0|I have been anticipating this book for a while now.  Not just because it's by John Green who is an amazing writer.  But also because I like the premise of the story.<br />A dying sixteen year old girl named Hazel Grace meets Augustus Waters, a gorgeous boy who also happens to have cancer.  He falls for her fast.  But Hazel, knowing her death is near, pulls back.  Both are quick witted with very deep thoughts about everything, including a particular book written by a recluse, Peter Van Houten.  So Gus decides to use his one WISH (basically a wish granted as a gift by The Genie Foundation specifically for very sick children) to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet the author.  The trip turns out to be good and bad.  Bad because Houten is a drunk loser who tells them nothing they want to know.  And Good because finally Hazel relents to loving Gus back.  But just when happiness seems possible for the two, Gus finds out his cancer has spread.  Now it's just a matter of time before one of them dies.<br />The first few chapters were hard to process.  It felt like I was watching Joey and Dawson in the 90's TV show Dawson's creek in the way they talked to each other.  As if existentialism is a part of their daily discussion.  But slowly I fell in love with Hazel and Gus.  So much so that I almost bawled at the pre-eulogy.  But that's getting ahead of the book.  One thing about both is that they are brave, they fight to live and to love. Gus is a sweetheart.  His sunny disposition and love for Hazel breaks down her walls.  But the tables are turned past half of the book.  And you'll see Hazel come into her own for Gus. To help him accept the hand they've been dealt.<br />This is a great book that will squeeze you dry of tears.  Your heart will break. And you will be devastated.  But you will also appreciate that life is a gift, and that loving, no matter how short it may be, is always worth the eventual heartbreak.  Read it and weep.

B000069I3K|5.0|Most alien movies are creepy and scary. ET is none of the above as Spielberg produces a movie that is charming and sweet. This is a movie most older children can watch as ET shows love and compassion for the children in the movie.<br /><br />Of course the Spielberg touch is evident, and you will laugh, when ET encounters a Yoda costumed character. Watch the movie and you will see why this is funny.<br /><br />As to the special effects:  They have stood the test of time and they are awesome.<br /><br />This is a feel good movie suitable for family movie watching unless very young children are present.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B000VXJYFI|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite Jimi Hendrix records, primarily because it was the first time I had heard the legendary Buddy Miles. The opening song \\"Power of Soul\\" has been very influential on musicians who have followed (i.e. Tom Morello). I appreciate having this one.
B000001GQJ|5.0|Lots of folks critique Argerich in that she is \\"liberal\\" in her interpretations of some composers. Notably, Ravel, Chopin and Prokofiev. I believe the word synchronicity has been lost as there are some Masters who acknowledge, this should be done, interpret, be liberal, let the music live. I have her recording of Scarbo and yes, the technique is JAW dropping, beyond this, there is, IMO an artistry which is worth listening to. Hence the expression, a good musician executes their music, a bad one murders it.<br /><br />The Prokofiev and Liszt are alone enough to buy this , her treatment of Ravel is breath taking, critics be damned

B0000007BI|5.0|I only have one other recording of this (by Bernstein) but I have heard plenty of other versions in full or in part.  I recently purchased this CD and Herreweghe's version here is by far my favorite.  Good tempos (not slow as molasses), great balance between the orchestra and the choir, and, hey it is actually recorded well.  I don't know how many times I have been told a version is 'good' or the 'best' only to listen to it and be shocked by the poor recording / sound quality.  This is the one to get.

B006TXDOZ0|3.0|When they rock, as they do on tracks \\"Sweet Sour\\", \\"The Devil Takes Care Of His Own\\", and \\"Lies\\", Band Of Skulls are at their best. The mellow tunes have some nice melodies and vocals, but tracks like \\"Lay My Head Down\\" are just plain boring. Musically this band is pretty solid, lyrically not so much. The chorus is most always the song title repeated three or four times, not much as far as catchy hooks go. In any case, they are still a decent band and worth a listen. They remind me alot of The Kills.
0439023491|4.0|It's difficult to talk about this book without running the risk of divulging anything, which is sad because I really quite enjoyed this one and wish I could discuss it in more depth.  I thought it was a great follow up to an excellent series opener, and it ratchets up the horrors of what people experience in this dystopian society.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Katniss is that her background has taught her that she needs to question things and think for herself.  It makes her suspicious of everything, which I find to be very believable because it's exactly what most of us would do if we were faced with the same situations.  It's a survival instinct that makes her pretty cautious, as well as fiercely loyal.<br /><br />The Capitol has taken what was already a very unfair system and made it even more so, giving me cause to wonder why anyone, even the citizens who live in it, are willing to put up with it at all.  Obviously I've never lived under a government like this, so I have no idea what it would take to instigate a rebellion, but I can't imagine being content to do nothing for long.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unfair thing they do is put everything on the shoulders of Katniss, a girl who has no idea what's going on in the rest of the world.  The idea that she could singlehandedly start or stop people from rebelling is just insane, and an extension of how delusional this sort of government can be.<br /><br />The events of this book become more and more upsetting, resulting in a depressing scenario I find almost unimaginable.  Again, I couldn't make it through the book without crying quite a bit, I became very attached to characters we encounter and I felt a lot of pain at each thing that happens to any of them.  I'm also glad I waited for this series to be fully written before reading it, because I don't really enjoy waiting to read the next installment in something!
6304708521|1.0|I had totally forgotten about how 95% of this movie was so absolutely and utterly and unconditionally STUPID this movie was back in the day.  I purchased this piece of garbage for the Beatles playing their songs - - which if you really think about it, were the first \\"music videos\\" ever made - - long LONG before MTV !  But if I would be perfectly and 110% honest about this film, I will tell you I spent the $18.00 to purchase this to have and own ONE SONG & VIDEO: John Lennon's \\"I Am The Walrus.\\"  To this day STILL a TOTAL CLASSIC !  Dig it (but leave the rest of this waste of film footage in the garbage can.  Not fun, not funny, not entertaining - - just sheer BS !)

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Okay; combine time travel with one of my \\"favorite\\" historical events (the assassination of JFK, which took place on my 9th birthday) and I just KNOW I will love it...and I did.<br /><br />I'm a Stephen King fan from decades back but I've enjoyed his later novels more than the earlier ones, perhaps because now that I'm \\"old\\" I'm more drawn to supernatural elements than straight horror. I started reading King right from the beginning, and I feel like his work has \\"matured\\" at the same rate I have. Throughout all of his books, though, I've been so impressed with his ability to evoke a time period and allow me to immerse myself right in it. In this case, it's the late 1950s/early 1960s and half the fun of the book was experiencing the imagery he uses to take me there.<br /><br />This was a fascinating \\"what if\\" story; not exactly a new idea (and King himself says he thought about writing this book in the early 1970s) but a brilliant handling of it. It's the type of tale that could be riddled with inconsistency and improbability but, assuming you buy the idea of time travel (and to enjoy this book you pretty much have to), it's really pretty flawless.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the ending felt a bit rushed to me. I really wanted to spend more time in \\"the new present\\" (not that it was a pleasant place), especially after the long, meandering path it took to get there.<br /><br />Some of King's books are among the few that I have read more than once, and this one will probably be added to that list. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B004KPLVYA|5.0|I am not a golf fan, but my husband and I were flipping channels and we caught this movie on the Golf Channel.  What a wonderful surprise indeed!  This movie has something for everyone, even if you are not into golf at all.  The most important thing is that there are many life lessons that everyone in the family can learn from in this movie.  We have 2 teenage girls and a 7 year old boy and they all loved it.  They didn't want to watch  at first, but soon they were hooked!  James Paxton who directed the movie has some great golf shots!  To think that the shots in this movie actually happened makes this movie even more inspiring!  Our family fell in love with this movie and we have watched it 4 times already!  Still a great movie the 4th time around!  I can''t believe we missed this movie when it came out in 2005!  Loved the cast, loved the shots!  Hollywood, please make more inspiring, family movies like this!

B0006L16N8|5.0|I do not exaggerate when I say that I must have listened to this album in its entirety hundreds of times during my three years in college.  This was my anthem when walking across the campus to class and when doing homework in the library with my earbuds in. I listened to them when I felt lonely or sad or just needed to think. The songs are soothing, very real and visceral and while broken down, the lyrics may seem cartoony almost all lyrics sound too dramatic when spoken aloud like words in a book.  Chris Martin and the rest of the band outdid themselves with this one. All these years later its still my favorite album from them, and because of that I'm going to repurchase this album.  My last one has seen better days.

0684135051|1.0|This book is more a collection of essays and the opinions of a knitter from a long time age. I read her instructions on how to fix a dropped stitch and forget it -she is not very clear about how to do this. Stitch and Bitch by Debbie Stoller is a great book for beginning knitters. I've owned Knitting w/o tears for over 10 years and I find it boring. It certainly lacks illustrations. Yes, she gives you ideas for patterns but doesn't teach you how to do things. Of course, she has her devotees. I for one, found this book to be useless. It is very dated. This book might be great for super advanced knitters who are of her generation.

B0042HQBQ4|5.0|I turn 60 this year, so keep that in mind that my musical experience spans over half a century.  Please, please, I'm not saying that makes me smart or that my opinions are more valid because I'm an old fart.  All I'm saying is that I am perhaps not as given to being caught up in trends.  Fair enough? (Skip to the last line if you want ONLY a review)<br /><br />When I first heard of the Killers I thought that, with such an inappropriate name, how could they be anything but a messed up bunch of young people.\\"  So when my wife's young co-worker - who has good values - asked for Hot Fuss for her birthday, I was surprised, and my interest was piqued...after all, I'm always looking for the next legitimate contributor to music.<br /><br />After listening to Hot Fuss I felt it was not only great music, but that the band had the potential to last.  The potential to last comes from the songs, for sure, but it is primarily due to the fact that Brandon Flowers is fun to watch, has thought provoking lyrics, and his voice isn't the usual bland, affected, auto-tuned voice you tend to hear with so many bands and performers these days. But, at the end of the day, it was that his voice is terrific, and very interesting to listen to.  He tells stories.<br /><br />I thought it was a joke when someone told me Brandon Flowers is a Mormon, so I checked it out at lds.org and found that it was true.  But the video he put on that site has Crossfire and another country sounding song as background to his voice.  I loved both of the songs I heard.  Below his video it talked about how he had released a solo album in the fall of 2010, and I was surprised that I hadn't heard about it, so I watched and listened to the video several more times and, liking the songs, bought the album.<br /><br />My review is that Brandon Flowers, uh, delivers.  His songs are thought provoking, as I've said, but there is a yearning in his lyrics that I relate to.... that feeling that he sees things clearly in his life- people, places - and tells stories about them....that there is always something missing, or that he doesn't understand, but he observes rather than judges for the most part.  He does get personal at times, perhaps justifying his approach to life, spirituality, people, etc.  But it is sincere and interesting.<br /><br />As a songwriter I always start with the lyrics, so the fact that his lyrics are so good enhances my appreciation of his compositions.  If you listen to popular artists such as Coldplay you'll hear some interesting lyrics, but Chris Martin gets a little lazy and repeats his 'good lyrics' on occasion rather than come up with additional lyrics that are just as good.  It's not a cardinal sin but, to my way of thinking, it is lazy.  You can repeat lyrics but slightly change them and it's good enough, but to repeat verbatim....not good enough, at least to me.  Brandon Flowers is at 'another level,' and his voice is so very interesting, yet unpretentious.  This is not to cap on Chris Martin, but these are two important singers of our time, so comparing Flowers with Martin helps me to make a point (I like Coldplay a lot, so this is just my way of pointing out what I like about Brandon Flowers.....).<br /><br />Chris Martin writes a lot of songs where he sings in falsetto for most of the song.  He has a nice falsetto, but he is, after all, the composer, and can write a song in any key he chooses, so why not write it in a lower key?  To me, he does it to show that he can sing falsetto and, again, to me, it is pretentious to write songs where he is in falsetto most of - but not all of - the time.  The purpose of a song should be to deliver a message through music, not to say \\"look what I can do.\\"  And the fact is that, as good as his falsetto is, when any singer goes into, then pulls out of, falsetto, there is a difference in tonal timbre.  It is distracting to the melody, at least for me.  The first popular artist to use falsetto on almost every song was David Gates of Bread.  He used it to make the music more interesting (singing in that upper register to expand the range of the melody), but not to 'show off.'<br /><br />Now back to my review of Brandon Flowers: his voice is at once rich, gritty, baritone, tenor, but always - always - expressive in a way that expands the power of the lyrics and music.  He is, to me - as opposed to Chris Martin - a pure musician.  No weird graffiti on his keyboards or other instruments, just pure, American music.  His singing, even his little flirtations with falsetto, seems authentic - yes, they are done for effect, but the effect relates to the song, not to the fact that 'he can do it.'<br /><br />In closing, it is interesting that many people thought the Killers were European at first (and they've been, if anything, more popular in Europe than anywhere else, so the impression, while unintended, was genuinely derived).  I love most great music, from sacred to Peter, Paul & Mary, from Steve Winwood to Iron Maiden, so my biases are limited.  But, if I had to say one thing about British music vs. American rock it is that British music tends to be more sophisticated, the harmonies tighter, the lyrics less whimsical, the arrangements richer unpredictable, as opposed to being a platform for an inevitable lead guitar solo preceded by 2 verses, followed by a verse, a bridge, and a final verse.  These are a few of the more refined qualities that I see in British bands, and I find them to be present in the music of the Killers, and I think it is a compliment that they were seen that way.  Brandon Flowers take this one step further, and assimilates these elements so they authentically flavor his work.<br /><br />Everyone is influenced by the music they hear, the artists they see perform.  So, at some level, imitation is always a part of the recipe.  But I find the Killers' music to be genuine because, as opposed to mimicking these elements, it integrates them into the personality of their work.These influences are therefore not karaoke-like, but have been ingested such that they become part of the fabric of their music.  This is what I mean by authentic.<br /><br />Now, my review:  Brandon Flowers CD \\"Flamingo?\\"  Buy it if you like the Killers at all.  And, if you like the Killers, I think you'll love Flamingo.

B004I744AS|5.0|Easy and comprehensive. Plays sound for pronunciation, typical visual pronunciation, and multiple definitions. Thorough. Lets you search for complete word or portion of word.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A great adventure story that is a quick read. Recommend for something light yet interesting. The photos are marvelous and truly add depth to this book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun game.  i don't normally like mahjong but this game has me hooked.  fun timewaster. works flawlessly on htc rezound.
B000009ROK|5.0|Luis Miguel and this music.. is very nice.. try it..many of these songs are done in the tradition of the balladeers (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett)..the articulation and phrasing is wonderful.. I do not understand Spanish and yet.. I've been learning some of the words based on these songs..very nice.. some of the songs are 30 40 50 years old. yet.. a joy to hear.. some melodies you will recognize.. In the USA these songs were done in English and are not a translation of Spanish or Brazilian.. a lot of the music is warm, passionate and filled with emotion .. Luis Miguel is an incredible singer..
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Short review: This is one of those either ya love it or hate it movies. We own horses & have always enjoyed horse movies so we just loved it. The story is \\"magical\\" and precious and the scenery is grand and has a purpose in the story. Spielberg did a great job of telling a story where the star never utters a word! Even if you buy the DVD go see this epic film on the BIG SCREEN while you can. You won't regret it! BTW there wasn't a dry eye in the house ...& It's a family movie too :-).
B0061S073A|5.0|I use this app for my 3 kids, and love it!<br />I only wish it could control where on the Internet they could go!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A truly great app. I will highly reccomend this app to both family and friends. I thoroughly enjoy this Bible.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game, makes me think, and the music won't drive you nuts! It's easy to start using with little instruction. Try it, you'll like it!
886293713X|5.0|I love this calendar because it has a page of notes across from each week's entry. I can also always find the red cover in my purse!
0316044695|1.0|I was enjoying the book and was about 40% of the way through it, when I decided to google Marcus. The first thing that popped up was how he has been shunned by the SEALS and they claim this book in fabrication. He changed his story from the first intial review he did after the mission. And after reading some of the absurdities that I did not even get to, I'm glad I stopped reading.<br /><br />The team voted to decide to murder civilians? Come on. Pathetic.
B0063IH60K|3.0|loved but loosing the love due to stupid adds after every single game very annoying if it keeps up its going bye bye ill just play ad free on my phone
0525423656|3.0|First of all, I do not recommend listening to the audiobook production of this book. I ended up switching to a paper copy and I didn't really care for the female reader. (However, the male reader was good.) This book was good but not great, just like book 1. This series is weird for me. There is something about it that makes me keep reading (rather than just pulling out the bookmark and saying forget it) and yet I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. The books are not all that exciting and the characters aren't even really that special. Perhaps it's the writing, which I feel has an almost \\"poetic\\" quality; I find it \\"smooth\\" and somewhat \\"soothing\\", for lack of better words. There are a lot of good thoughts and discussion points in these books, but seeing as I'm not reading this for a book club or for discussion, I'm not sure that plays any part in the draw of this series. I don't feel any urge to recommend this to anyone but I wouldn't discourage anyone either. Since I've already invested time in the first two books, I will likely read book three, just to see where the author takes the storyline.
B006W0QR1S|5.0|This movie isn't for the person looking for a mind numbing experience. This movie is for the thinker. One who can appreciate all that a movie can bring. It doesn't need many lines spoken as it plays off facial features, screen shots, and overall character involvement. Nice to see a movie with some thought put in to it.
0670451495|5.0|book came fast and in perfect condition! Read this to my kids when they were young, and now to my grand daughter!!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is maybe the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. It's filmed in Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Egypt, Cambodia, Bali, and other places too.  with incredible, dramatic landscapes. It took 17 to make this film and I can see why. The filming style was fresh and creative, though there were moments I was reminded of Kurosawa. I watched this film twice, to really figure it out and to really appreciate it. I plan to buy it though I rarely ever buy movies. This is one I have to have. I searched for other films by this director, Tarsem Singh and could not find any other films made by him, which was disappointing. Also could not find any other films with Catrinca Untaru, the child star of this film. Evidently she has not been in any other films, which I find amazing because she is the best child actor I have ever seen. She was charming and her performance seemed totally natural and unaffected, and very moving.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My baby loves this toy!  Don't know why, but he tries to grab at it non-stop when I hang it above him...
B001M72JC2|5.0|This was an underrated movie that did not do well at the box office.  However, it has a great underlying message to people of all ages.  \\"You Better Watch Out What You Wish For!\\"  We all have a tendency to look at the past and wish we could change our previous actions.  But if we could do so, you might not like the results!
B006T5G73Y|4.0|Clint Eastwood's latest film here is likely also his most disappointing film, to date. But still, it's not all bad. Music, costumes, make-up and screenplay are all good. It definitely has some good scenes: Armie Hammer & Leonardo DiCaprio's fight scene in their hotel suite is palpable; the same pair's conversation years later at the breakfast table is moving. An odd scene of Hoover putting on his mother's dress actually was quite effective (I won't reveal the nature of that scene). Armie Hammer steals the spotlight in his interview scene. The supporting cast are excellent. In fact, Armie Hammer upstages Leonardo! I liked Jeffrey Donovan's performance as Robert Kennedy. Of course, Judi Dench is very good as Hoover's stern mother. She leaves you wishing she had more screen time, as she always does!<br /><br />Still, Eastwood's biopic Will probably only interest those who are quite fascinated by this period of history or by this historical figure in particular. Dicaprio's performance had depth to it, but his strange-sounding accent was distracting, for me, and seemed affected and self-indulgent; it sometimes felt as if DiCaprio were merely performing to try to get another Oscar nomination (Frankly, He didn't deserve the Golden Globe nomination he received). The aging make-up looked a bit weird at times, to these eyes. The sequence of scenes was sometimes confusing, but not too hard to follow. Worth one watch to the history aficionado. If history is not your thing, you won't be missing much by skipping this one. If you fall under the latter category, and you've seen Public Enemies with Billy Crudup playing J. Edgar Hoover, you've already seen all you need to see about this man. In fact, a courtroom scene here sounds as if it were lifted from that preceding Johnny Depp movie. Overall, this movie is pretty slow-moving, but it kept me watching due to my personal interest in the era.<br /><br />Finally, this movie was rated R, which is unfair, as it only has about 1 or 2 expletives and one brief kiss between 2 men that is hardly erotic! Should be rated PG-13, then history classrooms could show it, as I don't think it will make it into many people's living rooms!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|The game is fun and you can play it again and again with a different outcome. I don't like how the game board is put together like a puzzle. It's impossible to have the game assembled neatly. The frame (ocean) pieces don't actually click together and the land pieces don't fit in the frame so the whole game you're struggling with pieces floating around. It's not impossible to play though so if this is the only version out there, suck it up and play it already.
0439023513|3.0|Very good book i admit, just that i think that its not at the same level as volume 1 or 2. Should definitely get it in order to complete the series or else you'll just be left wondering what is going on. The book itself came in perfect condition and came fast enough. high recommend, just subtracted 2 stars cause i didn't like the way the story played out.
0553381709|5.0|I have read 4 out of the 5 books. This is by far the best. Lots of Tyrion, Jon, Arya, Bran. The 4th book is a bit of a letdown because this book is so incredible.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a well written novel, better than many of the \\"low cost\\" kindle books. I'm glad I read the combined version as I would have hated waiting for installments to find out what happened to favorite characters. I don't want to spoil anything for other readers but I certainly hope that the author finds a way to put in more HOPE for the human race in any future stories (apparently planned) for other silos.  Optimism for the future and the expectation of amazing encounters is what drew me to science fiction.  Wool reminds me of the Hunger Games series which I read to its conclusion because it is a gripping story. However, I don't think I would ever want to put myself through either story again! In contrast, I re-read my favorite books many times.
B0061S073A|5.0|this app provides a safe way for child to play with apps without purchasing products by accident.  I reccommend this app.
B0000793ZB|5.0|This is a stellar recording & performance, not a bad track on it. The production is great quality and stands up well today - not buried in reverb and reverse-gated snares like many albums of the mid-80s. Pristine sound, energetic performances, great songwriting, soaring vocals and a tight band - caught perfectly on tape at the top of their game.<br /><br />Some have commented that this was a 'sell out' album, which I absolutely refute. This album was a natural progression from their earlier stuff, a band that had mastered their instruments, and mastered the art of writing a great song. To those who cry 'sell out', I'd say get over yourselves. Having one of their b-sides used in a great movie of the time doesn't change the passion & integrity of the band, or diminish the listener's experience one bit.<br /><br />Great album, go buy it.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Released 6 months ago, and I just heard of it today? Don't know how that's possible. Pitchfork's review nailed it. It's pitch perfect SMART adult pop.
0525478817|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful novels I've ever read.  It was poetic and unique and said so many truths about life in a way that was not even remotely precious or cliched.  John Green is a genius.  You must read this book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is just straight up absolutely lovely. I just cant stop playing, goodbye social life. get it now! I'm going to play right now. adios
B0000793Z9|5.0|I didn't hear this album until sometime in the mid 90s, and since then it has become an all time favorite album. Lush sounds, fat bass & kick drum sounds, great guitar & keyboard bits interacting, steady dance grooves mixed with a dark feel, jim Kerr barking out vocals on some, crooning smoothly on others - lots of charisma.<br /><br />Every track is great and the album is very cohesive in sound and feel - think of being in a hip, dark club somewhere in mid-80s Europe. Crisp mids, sparkling highs and warm lows. Excellence.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|OMG this video is so wonderful. I just \\"discovered\\" Queen a few months ago.  I'm<br /> buying all CD's and books and DVD's. I can't get enough.  To watch them and hear them talk about their music is like a dream come true.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Ive had this app for a long time and could download videos onto my fire till an update happened and now i cant download any more gods?
B0058VW36U|1.0|levels change vary little. they only change when u get a new box and it is soo boring after a while
B006ON41FC|5.0|You r trying to dodge trees<br />It is kind of like temple run but with a flying mammel I love this game it is so much fun!!!'
1440788235|4.0|I was looking for the E-Book and it is not available.  I have read the book but wanted it to add it to my E-Reader.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie and I love the music in it as well. I wasn't dissapointed and felt it was money well spent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great but you might want to have some money for this. but over all it is a great game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Really fun. I can not stop playing it. It is.something that I would highly recommend you download this app for.adults.and children.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love the game. But I would like it if instead of unlocking all the robots at once it should be every tournament you win then you get one at a time
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is sooooooo awesome I love it its all I do Is editing photos and saving them!!!! woo its so awesome
B006ON41FC|4.0|it's fun to fly and get nuts. don't look at it upside down or from an angle... you might get dizzy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the only problem I have with it is replaying levels over and over again to unlock new ones gets a little old. but it is good
B003UMW68O|5.0|I don't know very many people who haven't seen this movie! But if by the very slim chance you haven't or you have kids who haven't, you should. It's happy, sad, funny. It's Disney. This is one of those movies that if we happen to catch it on t.v. we all can't help but watch it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game was moe<br />these games were more than I expected......I was not disappointed!!  I found myself coming back to to this app over and over!  I enjoyed working toward opening the new games....and it was really quite easy with many point opportunities!....enjoy!
B001W6RRNY|5.0|excellent book written very well. The concepts are very carefully explained in detail and supplied with many examples. As you read it, you can immediately start to implement the ideas into your daily work life. great book for all ages and experience as there is something new for you to learn. Finished it and immediately let a friend barrow it before he bought it as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|for the most part like the game... some games are heard to figure out... need better directions...overall have fun play the games...
B004UFEJS0|4.0|As with any Disney it's worth the watch. It's very charming and endearing. Although my kids are getting to the ages they don't care that much for cartoons, they both still enjoy watching this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its fun having different games to pick from.... challenging to get points to get new games. My 3 yr old likes them too!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is to be not turned down it is like turning down a chocolate bar to me or avideo game or what ever you guys like this is the best game ever and it is free
B003Y5H542|3.0|It was boring the first 10-20 minutes, then the story got more interesting. The animation/movie is not for kids, but for older audience because it includes death and a few inappropriate for kids moments. Myself, I considered the world/characters to be far from pretty, a little creepy. But that is just what I think. The plot itself was good but a little predictable. Had only one favorite character and that character didn't have many lines in the movie. Overall it's okay. The art and animation are well done, but overall I didn't feel like this movie was anything special to me. Still it's worth watching.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|The acting is terrible. The socio-economic undertones, or overtones (whatever) were disgustingly blatant. Such a cool sci-fi film idea thrown away! Do not waste your money, I mean time!
B0037RDPEG|5.0|I must say I'm surprised at the intensity of some of the negative reviews - I really enjoyed this one, in fact it's one of the few books I re-read almost straight away (in part because we were going to Bali - somewhat surreal reading it on a plane going to Bali while the movie played on the plane).<br />I actually avoided this book at first because I've seen these fads come and go - everyone raves about a certain book and I read it and it's poorly written, shallow and a waste of money - until a trusted friend said that's what she thought until she got a free copy and  read it. And so I got it from the library and enjoyed it so much I bought it.<br />Yes, it is focused on her but it's an autobiography, what do you expect?<br />It was exceptionally well written - it's a relief to be able to read without tripping up on poor grammar and construction.<br />I also appreciated her honesty about how she was feeling and don't think I could be that frank in public!<br />And I found it meaty enough to get a lot out of it, it's not some fluffy, 'think positive and success will seep into your pores' rubbish - it's one women's story of how she changed her life and if you think you can get something out of that, then I highly recommend it to you.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|In my opinion, this is what movie making should be, entertaining.  I want to be entertained.  Some movies do that, some don't....this one does.  In this filmwriters' imagination, FBI agents do possess a little humor.  We enjoyed this one.
B005MHSELS|5.0|This show is in the realm of Greatest Of All Time (GOAT). Watch it. Each episode is grounded in reality and the motivations of the characters are sound. Gets better every season!!
6300262855|4.0|Im just crazy about movies. This one happens to be a good one almost like the old frankenstein plot. If you see it you wont be dissapointed
B001LF347E|5.0|We have gotten hooked on the Merlin series.  We love that there is some serious conflict and lots of spell-casting, sword wielding, magical resolutions. That said be confident in watching with children--the language is clean (but who knows what is being said in those Druid spells) and no gore.  When someone dies in a battle the shot cuts away and you are left to your imagination.  Thank you!  Fun character relationships, beautiful settings and costumes.  Highly enjoyable family fare.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I use dropbox as well. Never can have enough storage, especially when you have a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />They are running a special promote right now for 30 days.. you get upgraded to 50 GB of storage for lifetime for fee. Don't miss out on this!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This item does exactly what it's supposed to, and it's actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be, which is a definite bonus. I have an LG 60pz550 (60\\" 3d plasma) and of course the tv's only audio OUTPUT is through OPTICAL. I have a set of Sennheiser RS-160's which I LOVE but they only have analog audio L/R. So this device is exactly what I need to feed all my audio inputs through. Optical cable out of the tv, into this, L/R cables out to the 160's receiver and BOOM - (Oh wait, plug it in first!)- BOOM! Crisp, clear, wonderful audio that may even sound cleaner than it did when I plugged the headphone receiver directly into my DirecTV audio outs. The obvious drawback, and the ultimate reason I went with this device, was that I could only use the headphones when I was watching DirecTV! What about a blu-ray?! What about XBOX 360?!!! Now I can listen to them all in comfort and happiness.<br /><br />This little guy will make all your dreams come true.
6301955668|4.0|Like I said, \\"Every living being needs a mate\\" Even if the being was dead and brought back to life. All these re-animator movies remind me of the old frankenstein movies. This one of course would be \\"The bride of frankenstein\\" I dont think theres nothing else to say. The title speaks for itself.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I bought the book and read the first few pages of it and couldn't finish it because I though that the style was kind of childish and I didn't find it very interesting to read.  However, when the movie came out I went to see it in the theater and the movie was a different story.<br /><br />The movie is both powerful and emotional. It opens with the birth of a colt and then the story develops into a strong bond between the horse (Joey) and his owner (Albert). You can not help but empathize with the horse and what he goes through as a war horse.  There are few painful moments in the movie where you could actually feel Joey's pain and suffering. Joey is reunited with his owner at the end of the movie which gives the movie its happy ending.<br /><br />The movie is a must see for anybody who loves animals in general and horses in particular will enjoy \\"War Horse\\".  If you've seen \\"Black Beauty\\" and enjoyed, you'll definitely love this movie.<br /><br />I've seen \\"War Horse\\" in the theater, but I will order the dvd because I just love it.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|this CD is so much fun!!  I'm a new uke player and this isinspirational!<br />I hope to play as well as Eddie on this CD someday!
0062082353|3.0|OK, we get the idea that you are a SEAL.  It gets brought up every page.  Like other reviewers, I wish there was more about the actual engagements.
140053271X|5.0|I bought it and love it.<br /><br />The Good Stuff<br /><br />The UI is a lot better than the Kindle (I bought one for my brother, so I felt the difference between them), it's really confortable to hold and read, the touch is great for navigating between de UI, but the physical buttons are my choice, takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the Kindle ones (that are too sensitive, I mean the basic edition), but that's a good thing since I avoid turn pages accidentaly.<br /><br />The structure is lightweight and really confortable, unlike Kindle, the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read (I have large hands), the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior. It's a pleasure to read on this thing.<br /><br />The Not so Good Stuff<br /><br />Not sharing on sideloaded content. If I sideload a book from other store, the sharing option gets unavailable.<br />Not that many formats. Just Pubs and PDF. I mostly read Pub files, but it would be great if they support other formats too.<br />Not \\"send to\\" option. In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless. This thing doesn't have a feature like that, so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.<br /><br />Overall a great product, I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read, better ergonomics, and the UI makes it feel a lot better.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was a little worried when ordering this product, but soon found out that it was the best thing I could have ever hoped for to use with the Fire. It is light weight but sturdy. It is very well designed and comfortable in your hands. If you own a Kindle Fire, then you need this product.
B004RXKJ16|5.0|The book that i bought it was very good.<br />I want to Receive e-mail when customers comment on your reviews
B005CGI4EG|2.0|According to Amazon's description, the option \\"SUBTITLED\\" is available, which is not true. There's no subtitles, any language. Considering that MWC is a very funny and classic sitcom, very successful in all over the world, the quality is poor. And that's why I think it could have subtitles for many languages.
0316067598|5.0|I will read this book many more times.  It is so well written and you won't want to put it down.  You get to know so much more than what you read in the press and your opinion of what our soldiers go through will be intensified.  Thank you, Marcus, for sharing your story with us.  You are indeed a hero!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I purchased this mic to use with a Canon Vixia HF R20 camcorder.  The sound quality is truly excellent, especially for the price.  It is easy to attach to a lapel, etc, is quite small and unobtrusive, and comes with an optional wind screen.  The total cord length is 20', with roughly three feet between the mic and the battery pack, and then another roughly 17 feet from the battery pack to the plug.  It came with one battery.<br /><br />I purchased mine from dependable resource, and ended up with a stereo plug (desired this based on reading a previous review) but the plug is a straight plug, not a right angle as pictured.  That was a little bit disappointing, as the straight plug inhibits my view of the camera's monitor a little bit when recording and does not look as clean and sharp.<br /><br />Of particular interest to my situation, I was getting a \\"buzzing\\" noise on the audio of the camera when the camera was plugged into AC power AND I was using a corded microphone.  (The other wired mics I used had shorter cords so I had to use an extension.)  No problem with buzzing with camera on battery power. No buzzing when using a wireless mic either.  With this mic though, no buzzing, even when the camera is plugged into AC power!  Great!  Maybe it has something to do with one long cord as opposed to using an extension.  It seems every time you plug something else in-between the mic and camera, you let more interference in.  I only hope I don't get any interference when I purchase a 3.5mm stereo right angle adapter to make up for the straight plug instead of the right angle plug I thought I would be getting.<br /><br />Still a solid 5 stars in my book!!
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|I bought this as a gift (it was the only thing my friend wanted for Christmas!) a little leary since some reviews said there were some packaging and music quality issues, but, when the discs arrived and my friend started watching the discs she didn't care-- she said the dvds were great and she was happy to again watch one of her favorite tv shows from start to finish. Thanks! Packaging and music/disc quality was great, no problems here.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favorite Bible app by far. I love the version options and the different reading plans. Very easy to use, user-friendly, and a great way to keep on track in your personal Bible reading. I recommend it highly.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|wont fit american version by a long shot, the guy that made the video review must have something different all together
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This app runs when not playing, have to force close it constantly so it doesnt drain my battery, AND has ads even when u pay. Waste of space. Deleted.
0143118757|5.0|I found this book to be a really interesting read.  I needed to read it for school, but it felt more like I was reading it for fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|God game to waste time... play it all the time. Great for kids too. Easy to play for anyone of all ages
0061784788|4.0|Even though I am not a James Rollins fanatic like so many others (only other book I've read of his was [[ASIN:B0055X494A Altar of Eden: A Novel]]) I was looking forward to reading THE DEVIL COLONY. It appeared to be a hard-charging adventure and action packed novel. In that aspect I was not disappointed. From almost the very start it just takes off and never lets up. The main characters are interesting and somewhat believable although they do sometimes stretch into the cartoon character realm a bit, meaning that on occasion they seem to be able to do things well beyond the imagination.<br /><br />The issue I have with the book is the plot itself is way way out there. Too mystical, a ruthless but totally unbelievable villain, and a premise that I just can't buy into. I went with four stars because even with all that the book is overall still a fun ride with, for the most part, very interesting characters. The action is non-stop and keeps the reader riveted to the point as making them forget the flaws. I would recommend the book for someone looking for that escape book on a long weekend. It's well worth it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  First time you play it you get addicted. only downside is it kept asking me to rate it...soo that's why I'm doing this.
B0063IH60K|3.0|What's with all the ads? Would give it a 4 but ads are a pain. So it gets a 3. Overall, not a bad app.
B006C1DH92|5.0|so I thought this game was going to be boring. Boy was I wrong! this game is so addicting. I have all the backgrounds and blades. and I like that they have different game modes! so addicting! you have done ir again halfbrick studios!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love the variety. My 3yr old can play a lot of the games which is an added bonus. Definitely worth the free price tag to pass some time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play solitaire during me free time. It entertains me when I don't have anyone to play with. The game might be confusing, but it is actually pretty fun. Two thumbs up for solitaire. ;)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games but the amount you have to get is stupid. I like to play the games often because they are so addicting.
B00417HV14|5.0|Worth the price to upgrade from the DVD version to Blu-ray for the audio experience alone. Those who complain that it's in DTS need to upgrade from their 1st-generation Blu-ray players or upgrade their pre-amp/receiver's decoder firmware.  My decoder plainly recognizes the DTS-HD Master 5.1 encoding.<br /><br />Stage lighting is a bit harsh in both versions with some washouts, but in terms of musicianship, performance value & reference-quality audio this concert ranks as one of my all time favorites.

B0000DJE9R|4.0|Not a bad little CD.  Has some great songs from over the years. If you are looking for just a mix of his top songs this is a good one.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This is not a review of the movie but of the Special Edition and all its features.  It's a solid 5 stars of great material packed on two discs.  Besides the feature-packed second DVD, the first has two commentary tracks (stars and the director) plus a track for the isolated score with commentary by the composer.  I would give the movie Star Trooper 3 stars (well done but I wouldn't search it out) but if you love the movie and already have the bare bones DVD, this Special Edition is WAY worth it.  Especially if you are into filmmaking and love every nut and bolt it takes to make one.  Great release.

0439023491|3.0|Personally, I thought Catching Fire was worse than Hunger Games. Catching Fire I found to be really confusing, the author would seem to jump from one subject to another without easing into it. I got lost mulitple times but seemed to bounce back, but I didn't find that enough to comprehend what I read. On the bright side, I really thought the author had a good concept going, when i could understand it, I found it fun and had lots of adventure involved. I think part of the reason it was so confusing is all the characters mentioned. Not only did they have the characters from the story but since the brought back so many old characters (from previous games)and kept referring back to them I got so confused sometimes that I thought they were apart of the book but turns out they really weren't. I would recommend reading this IF you read The Hunger Games. But you will have to be ready because you have to prepare of what you might read.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Still remember the day over 15 years ago when i bought the 1996 remaster which had a somewhat cool packaging, but was totally offset by a completely lifeless and dull remaster! Well now after all these years and having had this in three or four versions, i'm so thrilled to really hear this! Always sone of my favorite lps or cps, this is it! No need to rehash the content, after all these years it is now more brilliant than ever! Thanks Steve Wilson for the care, attention, and hard work in setting the record straight! By the way mine is the mp3 download, which i've started rowing more and more.
0553801473|2.0|I don't really know what to say about this. I rated it 2 stars because I guess I enjoyed parts of it? I actually did enjoy Bran's chapters, but there was precious little of that. And I enjoyed Barristan Selmy, because it was such a relief to be in his head after so many bleak, cruel, depraved, or hopeless perspectives.<br /><br />The overall feeling is bad, though, and I feel really bothered and annoyed with the direction of the storyline in almost every specific case. I put it down, completely fed up, after one of the Asha chapters, read a couple of other books, and then picked it up again. The author is supposedly \\"realistic\\" in that, you know, sometimes bad stuff happens and the good guys don't always win. But this is beyond unrealistic. This is gratuitously dark. And rapey, wtf. I don't even understand, at this point, how any of these characters managed to be born, or any of these long family lines survived long enough for these characters to exist, with all the bad things that constantly happen and how evil and rotten 90% of the people in the world seem to be. I felt really uncomfortable reading a lot of this. Even right from the very prologue, I was just sickened. But it really set the tone of the book. So, if you start it up and find the prologue off-putting, keep that in mind. I'm annoyed with this story, annoyed that I've invested so much in these characters to only watch pointless, horrible things happen to everybody.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Enthralling storyline! Couldnt put it down! The HBO Series follows pretty well! Almost done with book two and ive already bought book three because I dont want any downtime! Im a huge Brent Weeks fan but I would.have to say that Martin is a little bit better! I would suggest this book to anyone who is a fantasy fan!
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book.  I can't wait to read the rest is the series.  I would recommend it to anyone!
1440503257|5.0|We absolutely love this cookbook. Not only are the recipes fun for fans, but the whole book is very entertaining to just sit and read. This book actually made me crave Brussels sprouts - Go figure! We now have a weekly \\"Harry Potter\\" dinner night, and my kids look forward to trying new things (because if Harry likes it, of course they would too.) I would highly recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans, and anyone who wants some good homemade British food.

B0067H9W72|5.0|Ive read many different reviews and some people are disappointed with the slowness of the series and that is now becoming a soap opera. In my opinion the series is exactly where it should be and that the producers have timed this series perfectly. I never want to stop watching, the characters have grown so much together and as individuals. Its very relateable and realistic. I am always at the edge of my seat in every episode.I also totally agree that if there constant zombie killing madness it would just get old, they give u jut enough zombie killing to keep u satisfied yet not overwhelmed.
B0055SWM08|4.0|its. an ok game. you will go though the levels quick. its a really fun game to play. some levels are hard to beat. some are really esay .

B004HEXSLI|3.0|The type of stroke this author experienced is very unusual.  The slow onset and the extent of her recovery was due directly to the fact that some of her brain dysfunction was caused by brain swelling which resolved, and not by the complete lack of blood flow to some parts of her brain.  Readers should not think that the authors experience resembles the average onset and recovery from a cerebro-vascular accident.

(I'm not tht bright) but yeah. amazing and very simple. I strongly recommend it to you

0316017930|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's novel Outliers is not the typical story- one that has a plot, important characters, a climax, and a happy ending.  Instead, Outliers expresses the many interesting factors that have contributed to a successful person's accomplishments.  Gladwell illustrates that besides a little luck and being blessed in ways that others were not so fortunate, the big names of those we know to be successful today had other contributing elements.<br />Throughout the novel, readers learn that Gladwell breaks these elements of success down into two groups: opportunity and legacy.  While reading about opportunity, it is introduced that success could be in part based on the month one was born.  To go along with this, Gladwell also found that the year also affects certain opportunities, such as Bill Gates' case.  He argues that had Gates been born years earlier or a few years later, he may have never had the chance to become who he is today.  The Beatles, also mentioned in the novel, were used as a prime example that to become successful at something, there needs to be 10,000 hours of practice put into that success.  Many people realize today that it takes a lot of time and hard work to \\"master\\" that which they desire to master, but they may not realize truly how much time needs to be taken to become successful.  To support chance and opportunity, Gladwell also commences to readers that being a part of a cultural legacy contributes to success.<br /> Where you were born, what your family background consists of, your ethnicity, being born into wealth- all things that are a part of what can add to one's cultural legacy.  In this portion of Gladwell's novel, he shares that Japanese children are better at math than American children.  Japanese children have a more effective and easier counting system and are taught from a young age to understand and thus enjoy math.  Where these children were born obviously plays a role in that.  It was also studied and shown in Outliers that those born into wealth have greater opportunities at a better education and ultimately, a better future because of this advance in education.<br />In Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, success is measured by a number of contributing components, all of which pose questions in readers' minds.  Needless to say, I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about why successful people came to be the way they are today.  You may be surprised.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My kindle fire came loaded with youversion Bible.  I love.it.  I have access to virtually any translation.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|First, I bought \\"Smiley Smile\\" in 1967.  I loved it, although I was puzzled by it at the time.  Without the Internet (obviously) or Rolling Stone, and living in Dallas, TX, we'd heard nothing about the promise of \\"Smile\\".  But, I had been blown away by \\"Pet Sounds\\" and the singles \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Heroes And Villians\\".  Yes, I was a huge Beach Boys fan, and love the way music was expanding and growing at the time.  I loved all of their albums in the '60s, with the exception of \\"20/20\\", which I considered to be very weak. Even then, I loved \\"Cabinessence\\" (as I beleve it was spelled on that album).<br /><br />In 2004, having read of the abandonded \\"Smile\\" project, and the fact that several of the songs had appeared on albums I'd owned over the years, I bought \\"Brian Wilson Presents Smile\\" the day it came out on CD, and loved it!  The brilliance was quickly apparent.  Yes, the lyrics were a little hard to follow, but the sounds were rich and wonderful.  As noted by many reviewers at the time, Brian's voice wasn't as clear as it was in the 1960s.  Truly a shame.  But, the album was fantastic.  (Would \\"Smile\\" have been a hit in 1967?  I don't know.  Remember, while \\"Good Vibrations\\" was #1, \\"Heroes and Villians\\", actually from \\"Smile\\" peaked at #12.)  But, it was worth the wait.  Now, with the patient work of the producers who have gathered the original tracks together, we have the original \\"Smile\\" album.  Or, as closely as can be remembered by Brian.  Again, it is worth the wait.  Using the planning from his 2004 album, and the original tracks from 1967, we have the voices of the original Beach Boys, in their wonderful, beautiful clarity.  Taking nothing from the 2004 album, this is the better one.  Even if you purchased the 2004 album, buy this one.  You will be glad you did.  In addition, there is a second CD which includes a lot of sections showing Brian working on the original \\"Smile\\" sessions.  I find this fascinating.  His attention to detail is marvelous.  He was, throughout the years, portrayed as a man who was a psychotic nut case.  Hearing him direct the musicians in these sessions you realize that, while he is a perfectionist, as any good musician must be, he was in total control of his music.  Yes, he does \\"goof around\\" on a couple of segments.  But, most of the segments show him to be working for the exact sound in his head.  Very controlled in his music making, and not the meandering, psychotic fool sitting at his piano in the sandbox as was portrayed in the made-for-TV movies.<br /><br />I love \\"Smile\\", and consider this a great value.He was, throughout the years, portrayed as a man who was a psychotic nut case.

B004SJ3AXI|1.0|With this game being played by so many younger children I am amazed at the sex ads! This is one game that will be coming off my system not because of the game..it rocks.... but the ads that they allow to be placed on it.<br /><br />Had there been a warning - I would have rated it differently. I understand not all games and ads are geared for children but Angry Birds as a whole is a really popular game with children because even young children can play it on their own.<br /><br />It just really upset me to install this and then sit with my 4 yr old and see the ads that are clearly not for G rated audiences.<br /><br />Like I said.. the game ROCKS... but I can't have my little ones exposed to the ads that are promoted in this game.

B002WY65VU|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />Zombieland (2009) was recommended to me, so I had to see it since I like watching the occasional zombie movie.  It's a horror comedy that stars Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin, with a cameo appearance by Bill Murray.  It's a classic zombie flick, but funnier than a lot of zombie movies made before.  It kind of falls into the same mold as Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004).  Zombie movies usually don't take themselves too seriously, and this movie is no exception.  It's corny at times, gorey, bloody, and above all, entertaining.  My favorite part of the movie is the swarm of zombies at the amusement park and when the two girls are shooting at the zombies from the top of the Power Tower.  Bill Murray makes a humorous cameo appearance.  Watch for it.  Like a lot of zombie movies, this is a movie that I can watch over and over and not really get tired of it.  This movie has a throwback feel to it that reminds me of older zombie movies from previous decades.<br /><br />Overall, a quality zombie flick that I recommend.
0679746048|5.0|This was a very interesting book which led me to look at things in a different light. It takes place in a time period where America was in a time of change and uncertainty. Susanna Kaysen was institutionalized at a Mcklean mental hospital and became friends with a variety of people who came from troubled lives. What are Kaysen's views on life and how did she end up in a mental hospital? What do you do when your locked up in a mental institution? Could this happen to you? All of this is discussed in a very well-thought-out way. This book is not only informative and a great read, but it is also very funny.

1936891026|5.0|This is a book which every author should read. Christian authors might be a little put-off by his use of profanity and his idea of God and angels, and praying to the Muses, but the premise behind the book is sound: There are forces at work to keep us from being and doing what God has made us for, and until we fight off those forces and get to doing what we were created for, we will be miserable.<br /><br />The demonic force which keeps us from doing our work is identified by Pressfield as \\"Resistance.\\" It is anything which keeps us from writing, from sitting down and doing the hard work of putting words on paper. Resistance can even be good things, but if it keeps us from doing what God made us for, then it needs to be defeated and overcome. In this way, the life of the artist and author is a life of war.<br /><br />The book is a hard-hitting call for authors to buckle down and get to work writing.<br /><br />If you need some encouragement to get writing, or you need someone to shout at you to sit your butt in the chair and start tapping out some words, this is a good book. I will probably keep it by my writing desk, and every time I feel tempted to go check the news or my email for the hundredth time, I might pull out this book and read a few pages.<br /><br />...Of course, I suppose that even reading this book could be a way that Resistance tries to keep us from our writing. Well then, read the book when you cannot write, like while sitting on the toilet. That's where I read my copy. Too much information...
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|Diana Ross' self-titled album was a big hit for her in 1976, thanks to the disco smash \\"Love Hangover\\" which hit #1 on the pop, R&B and disco charts.  Also, the inclusion of the #1 hit \\"Do You Know Where You're Going To\\", the theme from the previous year's Ross film Mahogany, attracted music buyers. The entire album is excellent, and thanks to Hip-O-Select, fans can rediscover this classic album in remastered form, in addition to single versions, alternate takes and unreleased tracks.<br /><br />The remastered sound is superb.  In particular, \\"Love Hangover\\" and especially \\"One Love in My Lifetime\\" benefit from the remastering.  They sound crisp and clear and there's enough bass to give them some kick.  Diana's vocals on this album are top-notch.  My favourite vocal performance is on \\"I Thought It Took A Little Time (But Today I Fell in Love)\\", which should have been a bigger hit.  Like \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\", it features a superb Ross vocal and reaches a dramatic climax.<br /><br />The alternate takes are a treat.  She sounds very relaxed on these takes, taking different approaches to find the right voice for each song.  It's a little startling at first to hear some of the different takes, particularly on \\"Sorry Doesn't Always Make it Right\\".<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  The cover of this album - dubbed by fans as \\"The Black Album\\" - is one of Diana's most iconic covers.  There are more striking photos inside the digipack foldout and inside the booklet.<br /><br />Like the previous reissue of \\"Touch Me in the Morning\\", this is a must-buy for Diana Ross fans.  The impressive Diana Ross reissue series by HIp-O-Select is finally giving Diana Ross the respect she deserves as an albums artist, since she is more famous for her hit singles.  But this series is a reminder of the high-quality albums Ross has released over the years.  Highly recommended.
B004APVI1G|3.0|This rating applies both to the 3D and the movie Plot.<br /><br />I have watched about 10 different Blu-ray 3D movies on my LG plasma TV (with LG 3D Blu-ray play). This movie had some of the worst ghosting problems. especially as he depth of the object increased. Items on the foreground (mostly the one that had the focus) showed the least ghosting. I Googled for ghosting/crosstalk for this movie and found dozens of posts.<br /><br />I have not read the book but the movie itself wasn't that interesting or fun. The plot is dark and somewhat predictable.

0307887898|2.0|I became interested in this book when it was referenced in an article I read on a new start up. After reading the book I feel it's lacking on substance and is mostly filler. It does reference quite a few concepts that are not new but very useful. The end of the book gives a useful reference to several other books (not by this author). I would recommend checking it out from your local library.

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Wow. That's all I can say. This book blew me away from the first page. It's a type of book to read slowly, savouring every beautiful detail of every picture. I think i loved this book so much because it was different. Different from what is considered good reading in modern society. Hugo Cabret was a hidden treasure that is so clever and beautiful. It tells of Hugo, a young boy, and son of a clockmaker. When his father died, he lived, an orphan, with his uncle. It is a story of beauty, struggle, friendship and magic. It is worth the read and completely unforgettable. It is such a beautiful book. If you read this, treasure it.

B006ISJQ3K|3.0|I am an huge Diana Ross fan from way back in the sixties. She can do no wrong in my eyes.<br />But. . . . there is a reason why the alternate versions of songs were not selected as part of the original albums-- they can't hold a candle to the real release.<br />I find it hard to listen to some different version of a song I've loved for so long-- it is interesting, don't get me wrong, but I think I don't want to listen to dry runs of her fantastic recordings.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|When I finished the first book, I wrote a pretty bad review.  I thought that Collins left out a lot of important details and focused too much on the love story and the games.  It all seemed a bit silly, and frankly insulting, for this woman to fancy herself someone who considers herself a writer who explores themes of war and violence as it relates to children.<br /><br />Well with this third book, all of those complaints that I had are erased.  Finally the full scope of the world is explored, and in detail.  Katniss finally evolves as a character, and through her eyes we see the world as it really is.  As it always has been.  As it likely always will be.<br /><br />Up until nearly the end of this book, the one thing that has frustrated me the most about the entire narrative is that Katniss herself never really evolves.  All she ever thinks about, really, is herself.  Even when she does something that is supposed to be selfless, her own wishes and desires are her motivation.  And she only harbors those desires out of some sort of perverse obligation that she feels towards returning a debt.<br /><br />Throughout this third book this is seen whenever Peeta faces significant adversity.  All Katniss can do is whine that President Snow has stolen him from her.  Or that one embrace they share will the her last opportunity for the comfort of his arms and his warm heart.  Not one genuine consideration for the boy that would do anything for her.<br /><br />Another frustrating aspect of the books is that Katniss is a brat.  She is not spoiled, as she has had to earn everything she has ever had, but she is a brat nevertheless.  Endlessly she complains about how other people inconvenience or trouble her, most significantly Haymitch.  He is just a drunk, one she cannot stand to be around.  One she has no sympathy for.  Yet whenever Katniss has some issue she must deal with, she acts like a complete diva.  She wants people to give her a wide berth, and she expects nothing short of their tolerance and understanding for her idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />It was really frustrating to continue reading this third book, watching Katniss continue to be a completely insufferable person.  One almost wants her to die so that everyone else can just get along to the business of building a society that is not completely screwed.  Yet, finally, Katniss comes around.  She finally realizes that she is a horrible human being.  And how does this happen?  When her spell over Peeta is broken by Capital hijacking.  No longer the subject of someone's undying and unquestioning love, she stops being a special little snowflake diva and realizes she is an utterly soulless person.  She hits rock bottom, succumbs to the same flaws that plague Haymitch, realizes she loaths him because they are so alike, and then moves forward.<br /><br />I do not want to spoil the story, but I found this to be a completely satisfying ending to the story.  War is not always good.  Revolutions do not always produce freedom.  Trauma does not heal.  Humanity should not necessarily survive as it cannot necessarily overcome its problems.  Yet people reflect on what has happened, deal with their scars the best way they know how, and try to move forward.  When I finished the first book I thought nothing like this would be explored, as I thought this was some superficial love story about another princess.  An \\"anti-princess\\" to be sure, but a princess all the same.  With this third book, I have found that is not the case at all.  Hopefully, unlike some of the reviewers here, people find some value in this.f their tolerance and understanding for her idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />It was really frustrating to continue reading this third book, watching Katniss continue to be a completely insufferable person.

When I finished the first book I thought nothing like this would be explored, as I thought this was some superficial love story about another princess.  An \\"anti-princess\\" to be sure, but a princess all the same.  With this third book, I have found that is not the case at all.  Hopefully, unlike some of the reviewers here, people find some value in this.
B0061S073A|5.0|I use Kids Place with Child Lock on my Kindle Fire.  I really like having the ability to keep my young children out of the settings.  Drawbacks: You have to have all your settings ready (volume, brightness) before you start the app.
B003O86FMW|4.0|In my review of the first book, I offered a lot of criticism for perceived shortcomings.  I stand by that review, as I think it is an accurate take on the first book.  This second book, though, makes up for many of those shortcomings.<br /><br />Although the arc of the trilogy moves along as expected in this second book, much time seems to be devoted towards answering questions and lingering on certain themes that were simply alluded to in the first book.  Where the first book centered entirely on the games and left me wanting to know more about the universe of Panem and the back story on some of the characters, the second book takes time to flesh out a lot of those themes.<br /><br />As the saying goes, I wanted to see the forest instead of the trees.  In this book we find out a lot about the politics of Panem, much about some of the integral characters, and see the seeds of rebellion taking root and growing, in spite of Katiniss' efforts.  That is about all that I can say without spoiling anything.<br /><br />Finally, other reviewers have apparently found this to be rather boring in that regard, complaining this book does not live up to the first book and that the games portion is much too short.  I found the opposite to be true.  This book is a good bridge from the first to the second, and I found it more entertaining than the first.  This could be attributable to the fact that I'm not exactly in the target audience of this series in terms of age or gender.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I was hurt just watching this movie  I been to few military funerals and I hope I do not have to go for long time. I only watch 10 Min's of this movie and like I said it was to painful for me to continue.  Why ? because having family and friends in the military and knowing that 9 young men  who served in Iraq are buried near my father's grave who served in WWII made me very sadd and also greatful that we have freedoms today because of their service to us.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is an amazing singer and this album most definitely shows it. So many brilliant songs on this record. I highly recommend it. It can be a little bit depressing at times though since every single song is about how she's single. :/
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I highly recommend this keyboard. It recently displayed a message to me that it has saved me over 10,000 keystrokes ... and I believe it. The auto-complete and next word prediction are very good, and they learn your style as you use it.  For some texts, I only need to begin to type the first word, and the app then auto suggests the rest of my sentence for me. Very convenient!<br /><br />Also has multiple languages, which is nice, because I often type in more than one language and it is nice to not have to switch the keyboard between languages as with the stock keyboard.<br /><br />The voice to text with this app is very nice also. I like that it gives you 3 results to choose from. What I said is usually listed as the first option, but occasionally, when it isn't sure about the exact word I used, it is nice to be able to choose the correct text out of the three options, instead of having to re-do the dictation or edit it after the fact.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this app!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Everything you love about your Kindle is now on your Android phone! I love this app because it allows me to pick up reading a book where I left off reading on the PC or other Kindle device.<br /><br />The recent addition of access to public library books is great! (However, this still needs to be done via the Internet outside of the app - hopefully they will integrate into the app in the future) I can borrow books from my public library for free for 2 weeks at a time! I love this, I will probably save a good deal of money in late fees because when the lending period expires, the book is automatically returned! No need to worry about getting to the library to return a book in order to avoid late fees!<br /><br />This app is constantly updated and improved as well, but it has been extremely good for quite some time now. I love that the reading background colors, brightness, text size, and word spacing can all be adjusted to fit your needs or preferences.<br /><br />A great way to make good use of my time while in waiting rooms!

B002BWP49M|5.0|OMg the wolf scene where they are reading each others minds is AWE INSPIRING! The transformation at the end was AWESOME! Cant wait to see the final movie.<br /><br />If you have read the books you know what this movie is about.<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br /><br />Basically Bella finally marries Edward, goes on her honeymoon and finds out she is pregnant.<br />The lore says that the rarity of vampire pregnancy leads to DEATH!<br /><br />Bella wont give it up. So she is slowly dying as Jacob and the Cullens watch on.<br />Rosalie and Bella form a bond over the pregnancy as Rosalie's big regret is not having a baby.<br /><br />Jacob and the wolf clan split over the pregnancy as the wolves fear the baby is a demon and Jacobs love for Bella wont allow anyone to hurt her.<br /><br />Bella gives birth and \\"dies\\". While Edward is desperately trying to save her, Jacob, grief-stricken, decides to kill the baby.<br /><br />As he approaches the baby, he FINALLY imprints.<br /><br />The wolves try to kill the Cullens when Jacob comes and lays the news on them about the imprinting.<br /><br />The wolves can not under ANY circumstances hurt the one imprinted on.<br /><br />The Cullens are safe for now and Bella \\"wakes up\\"<br /><br />But are they safe? The Volturi want what the Cullens have!<br /><br />I dont usually do spoiler reviews but people seem to want the details so this time I did.<br /><br />PS the movie score is the best so far too.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I've had the BluRay version for over a month, but was not really interested in watching it. I only bought it because people at my workplace kept telling me to go see it in the theater. Well, today was a free day for me, so bored, I  put the movie in. I am sooooo happy I watched it! It was a pretty good movie, and had me in tears most of the time. Not tears because it was a sad movie, but tears of happiness every time the two - I mean three main characters (the kid, the father, & the robot) overcame an obstacle. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I got the Amazon special one-day deal, just $25 for the Ultimate Collection on Blu-Ray, so it was a no-brainer to upgrade from my old stadard DVD version. Yes, it looks great on Blu-Ray, but it isn't so spectacular that I'm going to rush out and replace all 500 of my standard DVD movies with Blu-ray versions. Most standard DVDs upgrade very nicely on the Blu-Ray player, but some films really pop in HD, and The Matrix Collection is a good example. Avatar also looks great in HD, if you haven't gone all the way to 3D with your TV yet. The Matrix films bear watching over and over because you see or understand something new every time. The visuals and content are so deeply rich that you can't possibly appreciate it all in one or two viewings. The special features here also offer hours of in-depth enjoyment.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good game, a lot of fun to pass time. Pretty nice way to pass time. Highly recommended. I am glad I got it for free.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I have had this for about a month, and so far so good.  The case itself is thin, which I like because I can thrown it in my purse and it doesn't take up too much space.  It's not a thick plastic, so it might not be the best option for younger children who have Kindles. But overall, for the price and the level of use I need, it's been great.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|It is pretty messed up when you download a free app for your 9 year daughter, on her own kindle, and adult oriented ads pops up.  I thought Angry Birds was for kids too.  Amazon is messed up.  I will not let her play this game anymore.  Not being cheap about having to fork up the $1 to purchase the ad-free app, just pissed off about the marketing crap.  It does not take a rocket science to figure out that they are probably saying \\"lets put adult content on kid's apps to force them to pay\\".  This goes back to the cartoon looking camel on the Camel cigarettes to appeal to kids.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not going to revisit the synopsis of the book nor include any information that may give anything away or contain spoilers. As far as I'm concerned, this is Stephen King's masterpiece.<br /><br />It's suspenseful, gripping, heartwarming, romantic, tension-filled, joyful, sad, mesmerizing, engaging, haunting...and I didn't want it to end. I purchased this to read on my Kindle, immediately after I read the sample. Stephen King had me at hello with this one. I read it in doses...not by choice, but because I had to...I wouldn't have gone to work otherwise. Don't miss it.<br /><br />Bravo Mr. King!

B0068CEH5S|5.0|Wow! I just got the new Criterion release of ANATOMY OF A MURDER, and the improvement over the old Columbia DVD release is astounding. The new DVD and Blu-Ray give us a beautifully restored print in the original, correct aspect ratio (1.85:1). There's also a new Dolby 5.1 stereo remix of the soundtrack, in addition to a clean new recording of the original mono. And the second disc has several revealing, informative docs about this film's history, its importance in world cinema, and its rule-breaking director, Otto Preminger.<br /><br />As for the film itself, all I can say is another \\"Wow!\\" It's a literate, well-acted, controversial and important film version of the bestselling novel (based on an actual murder trial) by a Michigan Supreme Court justice. How controversial? Well, AOAM and several other Preminger titles (THE MOON IS BLUE, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, ADVISE AND CONSENT, and especially BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING) were instrumental in the formation of the MPAA ratings system that is still in use today (G, PG, R, NC-17). How important? The film and the novel are still required viewing/reading in many, many American law schools. There's a good reason for that--just watch it, and you'll see why.<br /><br />The American justice system is imperfect, but it's still the best system in the world. AOAM shows us both sides of that fact, the good (presumed innocent until proven guilty) and the bad (juries can only decide based on evidence presented, not \\"common sense\\" or even \\"obvious facts\\" that are not entered into evidence). The lawyers are obligated to do their best, no matter the circumstances--that's their job. Unfortunately, innocent people are sometimes convicted and guilty people sometimes go free. In 1959, Preminger and his brilliant cast and crew gave us a perfect example of this. And the new Criterion package is the one you want, trust me. It's gorgeous. Highly recommended.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Nice little time waster, good game. I have several mahjong games, but this one is very nice, like the wild tiles and the quick game finishers. I'd like it better on a tablet, but that's certainly not the developers fault, now is it.

It's a collector item.
B00022XOAO|2.0|Normally, I love Carlos Kleiber.  But here he does not take the repeats and his pace is, ah, rapid.  So rather than a stroll through the countryside, poor Beethoven is trotted along.  Your heart bleeds for him by the end.  You worry about his health.  You think, oh this can't be good.  Heart attack any moment?  Why are they abusing the man?  Stop for a breath!  No repeats are taken.  No one is allowed to enjoy the view.  No. Only between the movements when some souls dare to clap.  Is it over?  Is it bow time, was it really that short?  On to the next run, the next lap.<br /><br />Listening to the end, the audience doesn't know what to think.  Did he end it?  Did he chop it up, was this Beethoven?  Oh, Carlos, what were you thinking?<br /><br />And no cheers for Orfeo.  An abbreviated 6th and that is it on a full price disk?  Grrrr.
0439023513|2.0|So...After reading the first 2 books I was in high hopes for the last book,thinking that MockingJay would sore above all the others with a satisfying conclusion. Instead, I saw the MockingJay try to fly then sadly could not get enough wind under it's wings before crashing to the ground. That being said, the storyline was interesting but Katniss' character changed. *I understand she has seen and been through war + hell, but come on - did she have to change that much! I was expecting her character to remain strong and take control of her life and fight for what was right, which did not happen. She cries and hides most of the time in the book. The first two books had action and heroics, while this one was full of anti-war and political views. If you are the type of person that is obsessive and compulsive about reading all the books in a series, even if you did not really like them that well, then finish this series by all means, but if you don't want to be disappointed about Katniss' character then perhaps you should make up your own ending after finishing the second book and forget about there being a third.

0688014291|1.0|There are a lot of great management books out there.  This is not one of them.<br /><br />Managers who follow the guidelines in the book will be far removed from the goings on of the business.  They'll be disconnected.  They won't form true relationships with the people working for them.<br /><br />This book teaches a crippling minimalist approach to dealing with people.  But dealing with people is the most important thing a manager does.  It shouldn't be minimized or marginalized.<br /><br />To be fair, the book isn't all bad.  It's just mostly bad.  The few gems it has are very basic and covered in more much detail by other, better books.<br /><br />If you want something better, look at something along the lines of The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Crucial Conversations, or Good to Great.  These are all examples of good management books, IMO.

B005LAIIRQ|3.0|I was disappointed. Why? The Grey had been touted as an action thriller. One reviewer extolled its amazing crash scene. These are pure lies.<br /><br />First, the crash scene. You don't really see much, just flashes of what's happening. I wouldn't get all excited about its supposed realism.<br /><br />Next, the action. Here's where it is a serious disappointment if you went into this (as I did) expecting something along the lines of The Edge. The \\"action\\" is nothing much. Characters get killed randomnly, one by one, whether by wolves, falls, etc. There's no logic to it, no smart, resourceful comebacks (except maybe one, making a boom-stick). It's just \\"we have to keep moving\\". Those who can't or don't, die. Some deaths are more creative than others, but not by much. This is not \\"action\\". It's more like another sequel of Final Destination.<br /><br />So, why all the rave reviews?<br /><br />Well, you have to watch it from another vantage point - Liam as The Grey, too. We see this mirrored in the movie. As the alpha wolf puts down a challenger, Ottway, too, must defend his alpha status. Starting off as suicidal, The Grey Outdoors makes Ottway struggle to live. Others - well, just one, really - die from losing that will to survive. (Actually, the others die, as I said, randomly. Not much in the way of intelligent plot there.)<br /><br />Does this really save the movie? Not a whole lot.<br /><br />The other thing that may have critics swooning is Ottway's challenge to God to save him, in the face of all the random and senseless death. Of course, there is no heavenly answer - just The Grey Sky. \\"I'll do it myself,\\" he concludes. All kinds of chatter about how philosophical this is. But is it really? Seriously? He makes a deal with God - if you save me, I'll serve you the rest of my life! Now, it would take a pretty poor philosopher to think that makes any kind of serious point. The same question has been asked in worse times, e.g. the Holocaust, and Gethsemane. The answer is only for serious questioners.

0545165067|5.0|These are YA characters but the story is very engaging with real emotions and an ethereal tone.<br />Grace is dependable and strong, a good student and reliable teen. Her parents are mostly absent as her dad is at work and her mother is an artist absorbed in her studio. Grace was bitten by wolves as a child. No one knew they were shifter-wolves because she did not shift. What made her different?<br /><br />Even though Grace survived that trauma she looks to the woods and almost yearns for the wolves. Especially the one with the yellow eyes.<br /><br />Sam has been a winter wolf for a long time. His parental situation is so sad but it brought him to Beck, the wolf leader,  who has raised him to lead the pack when Beck is gone.  Sam writes lilting, emotional songs that fit the loneliness and confusion of a boy caught between two worlds.<br /><br />Sam has been enamored of Grace for several years. He saw her in the bookstore where he works in the summer but she didn't recognize his interest ... until now.  They spend a glorious summer together but as winter approaches, when Sam will shift again, they struggle for a way to stay together. There are dangers facing the pack as certain members of the community hunt the wolves in the woods. Some other teens have disappeared and Beck has brought some strangers back to renew the strength of the pack.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that this may be Sam's last year of shifting. The wolves only get about 15 years of human shifting and then they remain in the wolf form. Sam doesn't want to be separated from Grace but what can they do? Can Sam and Grace find a way to be together?<br /><br />I really like the Audio version of this book. As the chapters rock from Grace to Sam there is a female and male voice. Both narrators do a wonderful job portraying the gentle kindness of Sam and the strong minded but tender Grace.  They also capture the other characters: Grace's parents, Beck and Grace's friends, the wealthy and somewhat arrogant siblings, Jack and Isabelle, and Grace's curious friend, Olivia, who loves to photograph the wolves.  I also enjoyed that Sam reads poetry and his song prose is haunting. I highly recommend the Audio version!gant siblings, Jack and Isabelle, and Grace's curious friend, Olivia, who loves to photograph the wolves.

0446573019|4.0|John Puller is an army man from a family of famous and infamous military men. Puller could have advanced in rank but instead served as a combat soldier and now serves as a dedicated Army investigator. He is sent to a small coal town in West Virginia to investigate the brutal slaying of a visiting family. The father of the family was a military officer with high clearance and possible sensitive information.<br /><br />Puller teams up with the local sheriff, \\"Sam\\", a strong minded woman who is making her way in a man's field of work and authority. Sam knows the community but the investigation is clearly beyond her small town deputies and resources. Puller is able to bring expert skills and access to government resources.<br /><br />Puller thinks it is odd when his superiors indicate that there are a lot of eyes on the investigation but they won't allocate more assistance. Then he is told of some terrorist threats to the area that were picked up on air waves. As Puller pushes he discovers the threat and secrets are much larger than anyone expected.<br /><br />There are several suspects to consider as you try to puzzle all the known clues and the hidden secrets. Sheriff Sam brings along her tenacious character but she is burdened with family issues including a brother-in-law who is the main wealth and employer in the community and a brother who drinks to drown his depression. I really liked Puller's strong, intense, character and his interaction with Sam. I wasn't thrilled with Baldacci's handling of all of the characters but you have to remember that he is a mystery writer, not a romance author so don't be looking for a HEA. The mystery is a good twister with layers to dig through. I would like to read more stories with Puller as the main protagonist.

0316056863|4.0|I don't watch a lot of TV and it has actually been years since I watched Saturday Night Live (SNL) so I didn't recognize Tina Fey as an actress.  I actually thought this book was comedy fiction.  Instead it is real life shared with great wit. The author sets the tone immediately by jumping into very up-beat humor. The attitude is very positive and tolerant on many subjects, especially liberal and moral issues.<br /><br />Ms. Fey is an actress who became the head writer and a performer on SNL during the late 1990s to 2006.  She then became the producer, as well as a writer and performer, in 30 Rock (a show I have never seen.) Anyone who has watched and enjoyed crazy SNL skits can certainly appreciate the wacky and satirical level of humor and entertainment that are reflected in Bossypants. I could picture Ms. Fey in the SNL sketches where she portrayed Sarah Palin with Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />The book covers the author's childhood with her protective and penny-pinching father, her early employment trying to break into some of the \\"male\\" jobs, including the early years at SNL when women were not given prime roles. She also shares fun views on Photoshop (note the arms on the book cover), being thin, being fat, mothering issues like breast-feeding and differences with the nanny, and more fun snippets of her life.<br /><br />I was turned off at times by swearing and some graphically blunt descriptions. And sorry, but I really don't want to know about men peeing in cups or fecalists at photo shoots... although I guess these are interesting and little-publicized tidbits. For me some of this falls close to what I consider \\"toilet\\" humor which I don't enjoy. (Okay - I admit, I'm sort of a prude.)<br /><br />The book moves very fast both in print and on Audible.  Ms. Fey does the narration and the same upbeat pace carries in her fast narration. [What did disturb me on the audio was the almost vitriolic use of a phrase taking God's name in vain. That is personally offensive to me and I switched back to the print to avoid any more negative from that.]  If the language won't bother you and you like audio, you might very well enjoy her energy in the audio version - although you might want to get the Audio book which includes a pdf. Otherwise I would say go with the book which includes pictures that add interest.onally offensive to me and I switched back to the print to avoid any more negative from that.]  If the language won't bother you and you like audio, you might very well enjoy her energy in the audio version - although you might want to get the Audio book which includes a pdf.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|A great cover for the Kindle Fire.  I'm not sure what some of the comments regarding fit refer to -- maybe the product has been updated recently.  Regardless, the cover fit the Fire perfectly out of the box.  It required a bit of \\"break-in\\" as pointed out in other reviews but closed perfectly after being used for a couple of hours.  The cover looks classy and makes the Fire easy to hold when reading.  The only drawback is the lack of any clasp or fastening device.  This isn't a factor for me but may concern those who travel with their Fire in a bag or briefcase.  I imagine it would be easy to fashion a tie or band to keep the cover closed for those applications.

B007B8GI28|2.0|I am sorry but I'm gonna have to agree with other critics that this show is no longer the same. It's just a soap opera with zombies. It is really no longer about the zombie apocalypse, survival, being on the road or trying to figure out what happened. All that urgency is gone. As someone stated, it is about the petty quarrels of a bunch of people who seem to have missed the memo that the world has come to an end. I mean really who cares about who slept with who and who is the father of whose baby, or the ex lover going ballistic. There is just a whole set of petty dramas surrounding these people like that whole Maggie confronting Hershel about his drinking again thing given that he is an alcoholic; crying about her sister and reciting an old story between them to Andrea, as if we are supposed to care about a character who is a notch above an extra in terms of acting presence and never uttered a sentence in the show.<br /><br />Look, we've seen this type of stuff done million times in day time soap and Lifetime Television for women. So how is this unique? It is in so far maybe in that it takes place in the zombie context as opposed to some other disaster. By firing Darabont the focus of the show has starkly shifted from surviving the apocalypse and just THE apocalypse to one about the characters and truly trivial quarrels. This show has taken on a whiny, cranky soapy tone with zombies thrown in to appear original as soap operas have some sort of a negative stigma of lameness and chick flick associated with them. But really, it is the same, just different packaging. All that crying and wheeping and being caught up with personal love triangles when the world has ended seems out of place and ridiculous.  This show really is no longer about the end of the world but about people under pressure, which could easily then be a myriad of situations in which people are under pressure. When you reach a point in your story where one of its main premises (i.e. zombie apocalypse) can be easily exchanged with something else (like viral outbreak or flood or nuclear blast) and nothing about the story and the characters within would change, you know you are in trouble and have met a dead end in terms of originality. I don't care for Lifetime TV for women.

B005G0ETV0|5.0|Since I've spent the last 20 years listening to and chasing down Sviatoslav Richter CDs (244 CDs on 30 different labels) my exposure to Arthur Rubinstein has been minimal.  I couldn't pass up this bargain box of Rubinstein recordings, and I'm sure glad I got them!  He was truly one of the greatest 20th century classical pianists, and I am especially appreciating:<br /><br />1.  His combination of fire tempered by steadiness in timing and technique.  Richter the great Russian Romantic tends to play the great romantic composers with slow exploration in the quiet places followed by torrents of thunder in the dramatic parts.  Obviously I love that, but in perpective and as a contrast I am deeply appreciating Rubinstein's more balanced and steady approach to these some of these works, which is still never lacking in fire when needed.<br /><br />2. Most of the Rubinstein recordings are from studios, so the sound whether mono or stereo is generally outstanding.  Again in contrast to Richter, who generally (but not totally)shunned the recording studio and whose live recordings literally include casette tape recordings from stage right, 5 rows back.<br /><br />3.  Finding most of Rubinstein's output in ONE PLACE should not be underestimated as a tremendous gift!  I've enjoyed chasing down my Richter collection over many years, as I am a collector at heart and enjoy the chase.  But receiving this Rubinstein collection is like sticking your shovel in the ground and pulling out a chest filled with priceless treasure.<br /><br />5 stars, and the highest recommendation.  (PS, I like the pink box).
1595141715|5.0|Hannah is ending her life, but not before making sure thirteen of her peers know exactly how they contributed to her making this drastic decision.<br /><br />The main character, a teenage boy who has only begun to really get to know Hannah, is brought into the drama of the teenage girl's life, after she has died.  He learns of the many high and low points of Hannah's teenage life, and comes to understand, although he doesn't agree with Hannah's decision to end her life, why she decided to do so.  He is very upset, and he wishes that he and the rest of Hannah's peers had been able to help her; he wishes they had seen her drastic decision coming.<br /><br />Jay Asher is no stranger to teenage suicide, having had a cousin who attempted to commit suicide as a teenager.  He writes about this sensitive subject in an insightful, and altogether moving, way.  In addition to being an excellent novel, \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" really causes the reader to think about, and understand better, the subject of teenage suicide.  I think it is important that teenagers (myself being seventeen) have a good understanding of this subject, and learn how we might be able to see the signs, and help to prevent suicide among our peers.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I use to be so against SciFi shows and books but this series has totally changed my mind. After watching the first episode I was hesitant to give it another go, but I did and I was HOOKED by the third show! It's such a good show. There's lots of action, scenery, crazy cool wardrobes, love, and of course magic. I definitely recommend this show. Some people have complained that the show is different from the book but that is the case with any tv show based off a book. I read the books after watching the show and I still like the storyline of the show. If the show was exactly like the books, what fun would that be? This show is amazing. I give it FIVE STARS!

It's also one of the few tv shows out there that has a deeper meaning about the good of humanity in every episode. I must admit, I was one of the biggest critics of SciFi shows before I saw this. I still think I am to some degree but this show captured my attention and kept me hooked! It's so much more than a SciFi show. it's all around great. I definitely recommend it. five stars!

0553386794|3.0|As someone new to science fiction/ fantasy genre let me say that though I did in general enjoy this book I didn't find very it particularly fanciful.  I deem a 3-Star rating as acceptable, not terrible, not wonderful.<br /><br />The last chapter aside and the brief encounter at the Wall, there wasn't much there besides very fictional, historical fiction.<br /><br />I enjoyed the way each chapter moved between character's points of view and have always found that shorter chapters seem to keep the book pace moving so it got an A+ in that aspect.<br /><br />I found the similarities between the main story line and the actual historical event of the War of the Roses off-putting. It seemed lazy. The family names Lannister & Stark vs. Lancaster & York.  Eddard Stark had a father named Rickard Stark, Edward, Duke of York's father was Richard.<br /><br />If I want to read about the War of the Roses I will.  Also the Dothraki's resemblence to the Mongols under Genghis Khan was too extreme. Khal vs. Khan, semi-nomadic horseman, fierce fighters... If you enjoyed that story line you'd probably enjoy Conn Iggulden's excellent Genghis series.<br /><br />He frequently just changes a letter in common names to make a new one, it got old.<br />Examples:<br />Eddard - Edward<br />Joffrey - Jeffrey<br />Kevan - Kevin<br />Rickard - Richard<br />Petyr - Peter<br />Walder - Walter<br />Marq - Mark<br /><br />The animals perplexed me a bit too, the were very familiar with lions, wolves, stags, ravens and many other animals but then call a zebra a strange black and white striped horse.  If they call lions, lions then why not zebras, zebras?<br /><br />The storylines I wanted to hear more about were the least addressed; whatever is going on North of the Wall, and the Targaryens Family.  I hope those are further addressed in the other books if I decide to read any.
0307957934|3.0|Robert Harris gets a 3-star rating? It isn't fair, because he is an excellent writer. And yet, it is fair, because I read for my own pleasure, which involves not just the skill of the writer but my reaction to the story. No spoilers here, I am being very general:<br /><br />This book is like a well made movie that leaves you deflated and depressed. Our hero does and says things that make him seem crazy. His behavior is completely believable given his nature and what is happening to him; doesn't mean I have to like it.<br /><br />His wife is not particularly admirable.<br /><br />The inexorable destruction of his world that seems to be closing in gives me that suffocating feeling you get reading Kafka.<br /><br />The science is not believable or convincing, but the old &#34;Evil AI&#34; trope can either be explained in excruciating detail, or, in Harris case, you just &#34;go with it&#34; suspend disbelief, and get on with the story. So that didn't bother me too much. I also don't know much about high finance (as my stock portfolio endlessly reminds me) so any inaccuracies there would not bother this reader one bit.<br /><br />So, a dark story with (possibly) an action-packed turnabout at the end. If you can drink of the bitter wine, the quality of the writing will not disappoint.

1466401885|4.0|I know there are over 400 reviews for this book and mine is likely to be lost in the shuffle, but I still feel compelled to offer my .02. It's definitely true that after reading this book it's hard to shake the characters and the storyline. It's angsty, over-the-top, and hard to put down. At such a low price, it's a worthy indulgence, but do prepare to roll your eyes, shout in frustration, and feel downright irritated from time to time, especially if you're over the age of 25.<br /><br />What's good about this book: The writing style is fast and hooks you right from the start. Abby Abernathy has secrets, and is trying to start a new life at college. When the story opens, she meets Travis, a prolific fighter who is as promiscuous as he is troubled. The attraction is immediate, especially on Travis' side and the best part of the book is the first half, when these two circle around each other and grapple with their feelings. The sexual tension in particular is very well done.<br /><br />What's not-so-good: The book is too long. Some may say that's a blessing as I agree that it is hard to let these characters go once you're pulled into the story, but still, it's too long. It loses its way about halfway through and never regains the momentum of the beginning. Once Abby and Travis are together, the story gets more convoluted and over the top. I also didn't like the way everyone was in love with Abby and talking endlessly of how hot she is. This is something that generally irks me in young adult romance novels. I know it's wish fulfillment, and I also know that the point of Abby's hotness to others was as a vehicle to display Travis' extreme jealousy and possessiveness, but it grew tiresome very quickly. (For instance, it was ridiculous that Parker would still be mooning over Abby after the way she treated him).<br /><br />Abby and Travis are young, and they act young. I wouldn't go so far to say their relationship is wrong or bad for them both, but it is immature and exhausting, and sadly, I don't feel like the author convinced us that when Abby and Travis have trouble down the road, they'll be able to weather it. Travis, in particular, has self-destructive tendencies that don't appear to be resolved by book's end. To that end, the author shies away from having the two really grapple with their issues in a satisfying way--they're either apart and miserable or back together and ecstatic. The lesson seems to be that Travis can't keep a lid on himself or prevent himself from doing stupid things (namely sleeping around, getting drunk and getting violent)unless Abby is attached to his hip. That's not romantic; that's co-dependent. And although one character does call their dynamic exactly that, the author fails to resolve it in any satisfying way, depending instead on a denouement that's meant to be romantic, but is really more of a cop-out.<br /><br />All that said, I read this book in two days and enjoyed it. It's very readable and there are some memorable angsty scenes. But overall, it doesn't quite rise to the level of a YA romance classic.
0199601348|3.0|This book, part of the extensive Very Short Introductions (Oxford University Press), is about Ancient Greece, which was characterized by its several city-states while lacking a central organization. The author took a potentially interesting, but also challenging, approach to organize the book chronologically in terms of 11 towns: Cnossos, Mycenae, Argos, Miletus, Massalia, Sparta, Athens, Syracuse, Thebes, Alexandria, and Byzantion.  The several important facts about Ancient Greece are developed respectively to each of these city-states.  For instance, the customs of the Dorians are described in the chapter about Argos, and greek colonization as part of the chapter on Massalia.<br /><br />I felt the chapters read very differently, some being very engaging (such as Sparta) while others tend to be somewhat arid, perhaps even academic (e.g. Syracuse and Thebes).  The manner, as well as the level of details, in which the several subjects are presented vary considerably.  Several of the included figures are not referred to in the text and seem to float isolated through the book.  I believe the book emphasizes history too much while providing less substantial description of important contributions from ancient Greece, especially arts and philosophy/science.  Also, as several issues need to be covered in a given city, the text tend to be fractioned and heterogeneous.  This is perhaps why most of the alternative approaches to ancient Greece are organized along themes such as history, religion, arts, philosophy, etc.<br /><br />All in all, I believe the choice to organize the book along some main cities worked only partially, mostly in the cases of more self-contained city-states such as Sparta and Athens.  The Appendix includes some nice material about the panhellenic sanctuaries, with emphasis on Delphi.<br /><br />The reader should be aware that this book was also published as \\"Ancient Greece: A History in Eleven Cities\\" by Oxford Univ. Press

0385738773|4.0|The Death Cure was an absolutely fantastic end to the series. Now here's some reasons why:<br />1) Tons of heart-pounding action<br />2) Very little romance<br />3) Sob-inducing moments<br />4) An ending I could live with<br /><br />1) If life hadn't gotten in the way, I think I would have finished this in one day. And that never happens for me. You might think all action all the time would get a little old, but it seriously doesn't. I was all tense and on the edge of my seat for basically the entire book. And the zombie-like Cranks were pretty darn freaky, but not too scary for those who aren't fans of horror.<br /><br />2) Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good romance, I really do. But sometimes, I just want to read something that isn't all about the romance. The Death Cure is absolutely perfect for that. There's tiniest, slightest, minutest about romance, but it doesn't overpower the story at all. It's more like a tiny little footnote that still manages to fit into the story perfectly.<br /><br />3) Fans of dystopia probably realize death is pretty common, but you know what, it gets me every time. And that is all I will say on the subject. You have to read it to find out more :P<br /><br />4) I really, really enjoyed the ending. It answered enough of my questions and left me with a good overall feeling. And that's all I'll say about that as well so double :P
B006ISJQ26|3.0|I could only make out about half the dialogue in this stylish thriller. Most of the Cockney accents are all but impossible to decipher. I kept turning up the sound. hoping to make out what they were saying. In the end, it didn't matter that much because the plot is fairly standard for a gangster flick, and things turn out pretty much as expected, with the usual Godfather-esque litany of brutal murders of all the enemies as the grand finale to the pent up violence we endure to reach that point. Colin Farrell is pretty as the recently released convict who gets a bodyguard job for a star of some sort who can't go out of the house without papparazi trailing. I was mystified by her handyman who seems to be a nut job and who happily assists in a couple of unrelated hits. The conclusion may annoy you a bit, but it keeps you guessing a little.
0525423656|3.0|I really wanted to love Crossed, but it just didn't happen that way. I still enjoyed it overall, but it certainly wasn't my favorite. So, let's do this thing list-style.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />1. Cassia and Ky's relationship. Somehow it just didn't seem real. It was almost like more of a learning experience than real love.<br />2. Even though most of the story was spent as a journey, it often felt like it wasn't really going anywhere.<br />3. It seemed as if Cassia had taken a step back in her growth since Matched despite all the risks she took.<br />4. We didn't actually learn that much more about the Society or the world's past.<br /><br />Likes:<br />1. Xander. Crossed completely solidified my stance as Team Xander! I really admired him for not completely giving up on Cassia and trying to win her affection in a respectable way.<br />2. Though it seemed Cassia had taken a step back in growth through most of the book, she took leaps and bounds just in the last chapter or so, in my opinion.<br />3. The duel narratives. Sometimes this bores me, but I really enjoyed hearing the story from both Cassia and Ky.<br /><br />The Nutshell: Though I didn't enjoy Crossed as much as Matched, I'll still be finishing the series when the next one comes out. The duel narratives add a new dimension to the series and I found it quite enjoyable. Also, Team Xander. Just sayn'.

0545259088|3.0|I'm really, terribly sad that this wasn't everything I had hoped it would be. Maybe I put it on a pedestal, but no matter what the reason it really fell a bit short. I felt as if I was continuously waiting for something else to happen. And let's not even talk to me about that ending (quietly grumbles to self).<br /><br />First, the writing. Stiefvater's writing is what first pulled me into Shiver and caught me again in Linger. It's the sort of beautiful writing that just takes your breath away and leaves you wondering \\"why can't I do amazing things like that?\\" There were pieces in Forever that completely recaptured that feeling and others that just felt a bit...odd. Sometimes the characters seemed to say things or talk in ways that simply didn't fit. The teenagers talked and used words I couldn't even hint at the meanings of. And Officer Koenig talked in a formal way that I couldn't put with my image of him.<br /><br />I still quite enjoy the science behind the wolves instead of the simple \\"BAM! And then he was a wolf.\\" I liked getting a little more into the science with Cole this time. I almost wish I could have learned more about. Speaking of Cole. I kept hearing everyone talk about Cole and he was so awesome in this one. I never payed much attention since Cole was always give or take for me. But seriously. I'm not in love with Cole or anything, but I absolutely loved reading about him and all the bits from his point of view. He was an awesome character. If you pick it up for nothing else, pick it up for Cole.<br /><br />I have to say that Sam and Grace have the type of love everyone should aspire to. They're comfortable like an old married couple only they still get those butterflies (and, you know, those sexy-times urges). I hope to have a Sam and Grace love for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I'm quite sad there's nothing left for us in Mercy Falls. I'm also quite sad that the ending left me feeling a little unfinished. Not a happy camper did this ending make.<br /><br />Final thoughts: While Forever wasn't the best of the Mercy Falls books for me, it's still worth the read. There's a little bit of action with a good dash of love mixed in and all the different points of view make for a fantastic addition to the reading experiencebr /><br />Final thoughts: While Forever wasn't the best of the Mercy Falls books for me, it's still worth the read.

1423140591|5.0|Let me just get this out of the way right now: there's no way this will be a very articulate review as it's incredibly hard to convey the awesomeness that is Percy Jackson.<br /><br />Can I just say that I'm officially in love with Percy Jackson? The Son of Neptune is the same deal as The Lost Hero with three different characters having their own chapters. I liked Frank and Hazel well enough, but I kept finding myself going \\"where's Percy? I want more Percy!\\"<br /><br />If you love all the little bits of humor, learning about mythology, ans super crazy action the Percy Jackson books are known for, you won't be disappointed. And if you think you're not interested, I encourage you to read something by Rick Riordan to change your mind.<br /><br />I was happy to see Tyson and Mrs. O'Leary, but I was kind of sad that a few of my other favorite characters didn't get to make an appearance (no, I'm not telling you who because that would spoil things). I also super loved that they were traveling through my home state. Yay for Washington and Amazon! Yeah, you'll have to read it to find out what that means too :P<br /><br />The characters were great, the setting was awesome, there were some fantastic laugh-out-loud moments, but I did have a teeny tiny problem. Maybe I missed it somewhere along the lines, but they kept spending money and I don't remember where it came from. Like I said, small thing, but every time they bought something I thought about it.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: I'm sorry I couldn't write a better review but all you really need to know is this: The Son of Neptune is seriously awesome!! If you haven't read The Lost Hero do that first, of course, but make sure you have this one on hand so you can get to it immediately!

1594203334|5.0|I just got this book and am compelled to write a review.  I love,love this book!  I first read a short review in the Week magazine and immediately I knew I had to have this book.  I am half way done and I already feel less stressed about my baby's sleep and eating schedule.  Druckerman writes a funny, warm, eye-opening book.  It makes so much sense about treating your child like a person and not like an unreasonable blob.  She seems honest about her own experiences which makes her so relatable to me.  I am so excited to have these old but new to me tools to help me raise a good sleeper, good eater, and be happy parents.  Please read this book if you are expecting, or have a child, or thinking about having a baby.  The insightful wisdom she shares is a game changer. I've already started implementing the sleeping part.  My lovely daughter, whom has never napped with out being held has now been sleeping in her crib for almost two hours.  A MIRACLE!
B0063IH60K|4.0|good value. for a free app and the adds are well placed as to not interrupt game play.  screen is a bit unresponsive on my kindle though
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am really happy to have this app. I especially like the reminders, because it has truly helped me to be consistent in my reading. Only issue I have is, sometimes while reading from the plan it will give a scripture at the end, but will open up as a different scripture.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I have yet to play Final Fantasy VII but I bought this dvd a few years ago when it first came out and I have to say the upgrade to blu-ray is worthing buying.  Great HD quality and added scenes.  The action is great and just overrall awesome!!! I hesistated at first with all the people getting to nick picky about all the details.  If you a true Final Fantasy fan this is a SPECTACULAR BUY!!  I loved it!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Honestly...to invest so much time reading this trilogy, the entire last half of the 3rd book was a serious disappointment.  It was obvious the author was tired of the story herself and rushed to finish it.  This completely ruined her for me.  I doubt that I will read anymore of her books.  Why should I?  Only to get invested in the characters and have the ending rushed and not even completed?  I became attached to the characters, only to have some of them to pointlessly die in the end with minimal details or emotion.  And some of them were barely mentioned in the end, like Gale, who was a huge part of Katniss's life.  Yeah...the author said Gale got a great job in another district...but that's it.  Very dry...and it made Gale sound insignificant despite his huge part throughout the trilogy.  Throughout the book, it would have been great if the author let him meet another girl and show alittle interest in her so that we would know he would be okay without Katniss loving him back.  It would have been a much better story if the author had taken her time and included more details and a more complete ending.  I haven't been this disappointed in years...

B0073LWEXK|1.0|This is my first time playing a game like this on my kindle.  I saw that the vendor had several other games before this and was interested in it because it got so many good reviews.<br /><br />Really though there should have been SOME kind of tutorial.  Maybe something like just getting out of the guys house to go on the adventure.  Show them how to pick up the stuff he will need to take and open doors etc.<br /><br />I know the game just cost 2 bucks but it was still wasted on me.  I don't want to struggle to figure out how to play a game.  Struggle with a puzzle yes.  Not struggle with basic game play.<br /><br />And I have played a lot of games.  I was expecting this to be something like Riven that I played when younger.  But Riven introducded you to the world before setting you free to explore.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would not purchase this game until there is a tutorial level added.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I really love this movie. It's futuristic and lovingly animated, and I really really miss animated films like this. I'm tired of all this 3D crap. This movie is about protecting the earth and having the courage to do what is right in spite of everything else. It came out in 84/85 and you can definitely tell by the music lol, but it is in no way an outdated movie. The message of this movie rings ever clearer considering all the pollution that takes place in our world today. Let's take care of our earth before it's too late!!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I love this app, I use it everyday to read my blogs.  easy to go through the posts which I like.

B00632HWOG|1.0|Ok so I tried to update this and it as been &quot;installing&quot; for the past 6 hours on my kindle fire. This sucks! It wont load. And I really need to check my e-mail.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Cover does not stand as shown in promotional pictures. However this cover does protect the unit and is good quality. I suggest buying for protection only, not for convenience of reading.
B004SEUJYG|4.0|i did not have a problem with this movie,for what i payed for its ok,i quest the other buyer payed to much then i quest there would be a problem,but i payed $11.97 great deal if they come out with a better blu-ray,you will pay for what you get ,but its good for other buyers to make there opinion
B000007MVD|5.0|In all my years of buying records and CD's, the live albums were usually the most disappointing. Either the technology was behind the times, or in the case of The Beatles Live at the Hollywood Bowl, the decibel level of the crowd noise made for a sub-par recording. I always enjoyed the 2 disc Live at the Star Club in Hamburg album that came out 35 years ago as a piece of early Beatles history. Then along came the Live at the BBC collection.<br /><br />As other reviews have stated, this disc proves that the Fab Four were a VERY competent live act. The Lennon quote from the Anthology Volume 1,\\"We were performers in Liverpool, Hamburg and around the dance halls... what we generated  was fantastic when we played straight rock, and there was no one that could touch us in Britain\\", is proven on these 2 CD's.I concur with the review that questions why Ringo isn't the number 2 or 3 drummer in rock history. Listen to this disc and tell me that the way he moves the song along and the fills he plays aren't proof of his talent and skill. And all of that with 4 drums, 2 cymbals and a hi-hat. Big drum kits and fancy moves do not necessarily equate with good drumming. You could apply that to all of the Beatles. Not fancy or flashy,no mega solos, just solid playing.<br /><br />Although I like the live performances of songs that also were a part of their studio output, the best stuff is their covers of American R&B, rockabilly and early rock and roll. Makes one wonder why they didn't release an album of nothing but these songs recorded in the studio. Apparently the hours and hours of tape from the Let It Be sessions give evidence that even at that late stage of their career as Beatles they still returned to their roots.<br /><br />John's vocal on \\"To Know Her Is To Love Her\\",\\" A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues\\", \\"I Got To Find My Baby\\" and  George's cover of  Carl Perkins \\"Glad All Over\\" are some of the best on these 2 discs. Their really isn't a bad track out of the bunch.<br /><br />The other thing about this set that is interesting is that much of this was recorded at the zenith of their popularity. While they could have been filling these dates with large concerts, they were fulfilling their obligation to the BBC. Whether that was at the insistence of Brian Epstein, their own sense of \\"doing the right thing\\" or a mixture of the two, it stands out in today's world of selling out to the highest bidder.<br /><br />If you're new to the whole Beatles experience, this collection gives you some good insight as to what it was all about.other thing about this set that is interesting is that much of this was recorded at the zenith of their popularity.

B006RED4GA|1.0|What was sold as \\"It'll make you laugh, then drag you along for unrelenting terror\\" should have been more like \\"Nothing happens, you will pray for it to end.\\" Seriously. I kept waiting for even a smidgeon of fright (or interest in what was happening)... to no avail. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Even my boyfriend, who's the biggest Scary Movie Wimp ever, was whining about how boring it was. Boringboringboring. Atmospheric? Ummmm, nope.
0439023513|5.0|When I first read the book, I'll admit I was a little disappointed. I, like a lot of other reviewers on here, wanted a nice, happy ending. I wanted Katniss to become the leader of Panem. I wanted everyone to rejoice. But after a while I realized that this book made more sense than I first realized. With all of the pain and hardship Katniss has endured, she simply isn't the same person she was in the first. She is sad and broken, still trying to pick up the remaining shards of her life. The series was about way may about which guy she ended up with- that was just a subplot. The series is about how we should never let anything like this ever happen. The ending, while sad, is realistic. And honestly, who would have expected a fairy tale ending for this series?
B004MC8CA2|4.0|you have to have Internet what if u don't have Internet! so its still a great Bible app! :-) I say download it! But if u don't have Internet then don't get it!
B0038QGXHW|5.0|The phrase \\"Sniveling Whine\\" is demeaning to Keith Jarrett.  Music originated vocally and the song from within is where Keith Jarrett's music comes from.  The vocalizations are part of the performance.  If you find this distracting then listen to someone else.  Remember Bud Powell, Paul Bley or Glenn Gould?  All these players are audibly vocal while they play, but it's what they play that's important.  I bought this album from an excellent Amazon Marketplace seller beachesmusic from Ontario Canada.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|This release is much more than I expected.  These guys still have it!  Yes, I was very pessimistic before the release, but after listening to the new release over and over, I can honestly say this the best TRUE VanHalen album since Dave left.
B005VPRF0M|3.0|Lego Super Heroes Batwing Battle over Gotham City 6863 includes Black Suited Batman, Joker, and Joker's henchman, Helicopter, and the Batwing itself. I am a big fan of Tim Burton's Batman and I love the Batwing. I have mixed reviews concerning this playset. The Batwing itself seems one dimensional and flat. A little small. I think that's fine as it fits well into Lego City sets, but it also leaves more to be desired for most AFOL's. Children however, will love the swooshability of this set as the Batwing is easier for them to handle than the previous version. Another small nitpick I had was that Joker's flag didnt have the printed \\"BANG!\\" like the previously released Batwing set. This set is fantastic for children, but a little lacking for AFOL's (adult fans).<br /><br /> Its great that Lego rereleased these VHTF Batman sets however they could have put slightly more attention to detail. The original Batwing was a big hit, and still one of the coolest sets to display with its stand. This is one of the few instances where Lego has quite potentially released an inferior product compared to the previous version. As always though I am reminded that Lego is first and foremost, for the children. With that said, this is an excellent set for the young ones.<br /><br />If you are a Burton fan and simply like the Batwing or 'wonderful toys' of Batman, this is a good set for you! If you want the minifigures I suggest checking out Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I'm a teacher and this is a fun, family movie that I can show the kids on field trips (on the bus traveling).
B006NYQAJM|5.0|Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape, or Joker's Funhouse, is an excellent Super Heroes set for the value. The Price per Brick ratio is fantastic, and it includes 5 main characters Batman, Robin, Joker, Riddler, and Harley Quinn. The play features on this set are above and beyond expectations. A coaster like cart ride, Batcycle, and even an extra Riddler head! This is a Toys R Us exclusive but if you don't have a TRU you can find it at Amazon. Brick and Mortar Lego Stores don't carry it but you can find it online.<br /><br /> Of all the Super Heroes playsets being released in 2012 (including the Marvel line) Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape is the most creative, enjoyable, and engaging Super hero set true to film,comics, and television. This will provide your Children with hours of playtime. Seriously, kids can't stop playing with this set.. there is something timeless about it.
0399159029|4.0|Philip Kerr continues to build and improve on the Inspector Bernie Gunther series with this latest episode in the detective's perilous WW II-era career.  In \\"Prague Fatale\\" there has been a step back in time from the last Gunther book which had jumped to the post WW II period.  It's now 1941 and Gunther, always under suspicion by the Nazi regime, has paradoxically been seconded to Prague by SS Commander and newly appointed Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich.  Gunther is given the task of bodyguard to Heydrich, who claims that someone is trying to kill him.  A posh manor house outside Prague has been filled by Heydrich with Nazi heavyweights, each more loathsome than the other, and one of whom the Reichsprotector suspects of malicious intent.  A seemingly unrelated murder takes place immediately after Gunther's arrival at the house party that sets off a classical police procedural which provides the structure of the story.<br /><br />With a genuflect in the direction of Agatha Christie, author Kerr lays down an intriguing and thoroughly entertaining classic manor house mystery albeit within the Nazi era context.  The characters are well and sharply drawn and Bernie Gunther has never been wittier, better at his craft or more human.  Kerr's sense of Germany and Europe during the Nazi years is keen and wholly credible.  Very few false notes in any of this really excellent period crime piece.  Highly recommended.
1423113454|3.0|This book does not make it on an adult level.  This is because the plot has little substance to it.  The entirety of it is that the evil Egyptian gods are going to strike in 4 days (then 3 days, then 2 days, etc) and we've got to get busy and do something about it.  The two main characters then travel around the globe and encounter monsters and fighting that actually does not advance the ultimate goal, stopping Armageddon.<br /><br />But it works great for the kids, certainly for my 8 year old granddaughter.  She loves the references to Egyptian gods and godesses.  She relates to the two main characters.  She enjoys the Saturday morning TV spectacular of a tough fight between good and evil.<br /><br />The author does a good job of setting scenes and describing action.  That holds attention and interest.  The descriptions of Egyptian gods and godesses are interesting.  This is must reading for any young one with an interest in Egypt.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is the beehive app I have got on my kindle fire. now this is my favorite app on my kindle fire

B0031ES8P6|5.0|Ordered this for my niece for her 7th birthday, as she is really a big fan of Hello Kitty. She really liked it and the price was right!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I decided to get this trilogy/box set instead of the U.S. version because I didn't want the extra stuff such as the dvds I'm not going to use or the digital copies I'd never use. This was all I wanted just the feature movies. I also bought the set because it is much cheaper than buying the American versions of each movie. Each is at the low-end of $20-$25 each for the first two. The third movie is upwards of $30. Too much for me to buy individually so I bought this.<br /><br />This set comes with 4 blu rays. Toy Story 1 has 1 disc that is the main movie and some special features. Toy Story 2 has 1 disc and some special features. And Toy Story 3 has 2 discs one disc is the main movie and some special features and the 2nd disc is bonus materials. This disc is as well a blu ray.<br /><br />The set is well packaged with 3 blu ray cases. This set is region free so it will play on American blu ray players. The movies are crisp and clear and bright. Would buy from this seller agian.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great. You should get it. It's. FREE!!!! So simply click the free button and have some fun!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Fun game,cute back story...increasing lvls of difficulty.  Requires problem solving ability, some planning and thought. Not as mindless as some of the  game apps.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I watched it and within 24 hours bought the CD...which is great to workout to as well!  Cher sounds like she did in the 70s!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Wow, I can't believe PopCap did such a bad port to Android of such a great game. The graphics are horrid - stretched and blurry. There are instances of just poor workmanship in the logo and title screens. It crashes, locks up, randomly decides to plant things when I tap the location I want rather than where I tapped. And I don't mean it comes close - it plants sunflowers all the way up where the zombies spawn! PopCap you need to fire your Android port team and replace them with people who actually care about their work.<br /><br />I'm running the newest Asus Transformer with Tegra 3 graphics and have not upgraded to ICS yet, so it sure isn't my hardware! The Farm Frenzy games - even the knockoffs of those - run great. VERY disappointed and hope for an upgrade that fixes the many issues with this game - soon!!!!<br /><br />Updated my review to 3 stars - today's update seems to have stopped it from crashing constantly and freezing my tablet. But they still need to create a game that takes advantage of tablets. Still a fun game and at least I can get through levels without freezing.
1439153663|5.0|This was a wonderful book that truly brought the time of slavery to life.  It was so full of struggle and heartache yet also filled with hope.  A wonderful story steeped in history that I would highly recommend.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD after putting on a little weight over the holidays. As a novice triathlete, I am used to long workouts with the same, repetitive motions (biking in place for an hour, running on a treadmill, swimming laps), and I was not seeing weight loss. I started using the DVD consistently when an ankle injury kept me from running, and I am SO GLAD I tried it! Each level offers lower impact versions of the moves they're doing, so I was able to adapt for my injury. Make no mistake, these work outs are hard, but consistency really does pay off in terms of them getting easier. I am on level 3 and am loving how great I feel without putting in an hour plus at the gym 4-5 days a week!<br />In terms of weight loss, no I did not lose 20 pounds in 30 days, but I have lost everything I gained over the winter and then some (somewhere between 7-10 pounds since I bought it). My body does not lose weight easily, so I considered this a triumph. Aside from the number on the scale, my abs are more defined, and my clothes all fit better (either that or they're getting roomy). I just bought another Jillian Michaels DVD to try out. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to put in the work.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she was very excited. She was also surprised by the price, as was I and thrilled. Great condition and great show. :)
B0036TGT3E|1.0|Blu-Ray disc did not work for me, not once, but twice on a returned item sent to me.  Amazon was in fact amazing at getting this quick turned for me, but alas, I am returning it for a refund altogether.  It appears that the Blu-Ray discs have a bad batch that won't play on three blu-ray players I own.  Shame...was looking forward to it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game.  my son and daughter 6 and 4 also enjoy the games.  love that you get to choose whet games you want to unlock.  it is a great time waster at the doctor or dentist office.  no wifi needed once installed.  great game.
B005K2XM94|5.0|I was looking for something small and compact so I could comfortably carry my Kindle Fire in my purse without taking up too much space or weight.  This envelope sleeve has worked beautifully for this purpose.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|This movie was really terrible. I have to admit, I didn't exactly have high hopes, but the first scenes with the Delphic Oracle, especially when they were actually speaking Greek, raised my hopes, only to have them dashed when the myth of Theseus was completely slaughtered. Granted I am a Classics graduate student, and didn't really expect any kind of actual adherence to the mythology, but I expected it would at least be visually and narratively interesting to make up for that. But no. Again. Awful.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I have tried other Mouse/keyboard converters. This is by far the best. It is smooth as well when turning especially in modern warfare 3. Also, single shot semi autos like MK14 become fully auto with the turbo button switch. Great investment for a PC gamer if you are using it on the PS3!
0671646788|5.0|This is a great book that inspires you to think bigger, dream bigger, and achieve bigger!  There is power in thinking big!

0545305497|5.0|I went on a quest to find this book trilogy everywhere! after a long and disappointing journey, ok it wasn't that long, few hours, well minutes, it was long for me ok! Anyway after returning from said quest, dismayed and weary I got on this thing called the internet, and found it! and it was the cheapest on amazon. After lots of tears of joy and some embarrassing looks from my family, I realized that it might take some time to be shipped, insert menacing music. This would take patience, not my best attribute I'll admit. Me and patience, we're not the best of friends. But in like half a week a cute little box appeared at my door. It was like the Christmas I never got, you know the one with presents... and love... and happiness, and all that good stuff. And thus was the end of said quest, happy shopping and good day.[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]] though this one is $4 more expensive than the one I got, still well worth it!

B006ON41FC|5.0|Its a good game. Its fun. I play it alot. Good if u just have a mimute or for hours.
B005WMQFOQ|5.0|This is a collection item, not a toy to play with. Comes in a nice box, and the doll outfit is appropriate of that time period.

Its just another poor excuse for one.<br />  Here is a women that has troubles sure,too bad there not of the sifi nature.In the end the women has the chance to fulfill her desire to end it.

0061564893|5.0|In 1421, Chinese emperor Zhu Di, builder of the Forbidden City, ordered a fleet of more than 100 ships and 28,000 men and women to journey the entire world for good will, discovery, trade, and colonization. Within a few years these brave people had traveled to every continent and had established colonies in Asia, Africa, Australia, North and South America. Many years before Columbus, Magellan, Dias, Cook, and other European explorers, there were the Chinese admirals: Zheng He, Zhou Man, Hong Bao, Zhou Wen, and Yang Qing. This incredible true story of the Chinese treasure fleets will amaze you.

057809665X|4.0|Good overview of steps for people starting along the path to improve their communication skills with others.

1594203334|5.0|As a French mom raising 3 kids in NYC, I found this book very interesting. The different situations and points of view correspond to obvervations I made. Like the author, I started parenting (with very little experience with babies and toddlers, for sure) in an \\"American\\" (or is it a NYC?) way, saw my kids doing too much of \\"n'importe quoi\\" and my husband and I getting quite stressed, and moved to a more French style with more \\"cadre\\" and finally less stress. This book confirms some ideas I had from my experience and looking at other families around me and gave me some good ideas.
B005T87QCI|5.0|it is really fun and addicting the only problem is you cant make your own robot like the xbox game
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'fe been looking for a good mahjong game and this one is really enjoyable because of the story mode they've built into the game.  Lots of fun and playable in small timeframes too.

B000001FKY|5.0|Hysteria is one of the best rock albums EVER! The first single I heard was Pour Some Sugar On Me as a child and I was hooked. While some artists tell stories, Def Leppard captures a feeling. Sometimes when I listen to it I feel like I'm flying! The entire album is excellent. Every song is well polished and flows into one another very well. The guitar riffs are hair raising. The drums pump me up! I thank the creator for Def Leppard.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game will not wow you with spectacular gameplay and graphics. But it will pass some time with a variety of games. Bored with one game? Move on to the next. Perfect game for children.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|I think this is one of those books where the \\"sample\\" function on Kindle comes into its own - I can easily see why some people might not get on with the book, and how the main character could easily grate on a reader. It's definitely worth having a taster, because if she gets on your nerves, then you probably shouldn't download the book! That said, if the sample grabs you, this book is definitely well worth a read. It was one that was on my wishlist for a long time, but I almost wish I had downloaded it at the higher price and read it sooner - I enjoyed it that much.<br /><br />While I'm talking about Kindle-related things, the conversion to Kindle is great. A very few times when words have ended up jammed together (\\"tome\\" rather than \\"to me\\") which seems to be a recurring problem with Kindle books in my experience, but otherwise perfect: TOC works brilliantly, references every chapter... basically, no problems that are going to get in the way of the reader's enjoyment.<br /><br />So... the book itself. The story is told in first person from Victoria's point of view. She is a young woman on the eve of emancipation, having spent most of her life being shuffled from foster home to foster home and then through a succession of group homes. There are two parallel storylines: We see Victoria turning 18 and leaving the welfare system and the safety net of sorts that her social worker has provided over the years. We also see her aged 10, in the last foster home/possible adoptive home chance before she was officially labelled \\"unadoptable\\". For much of the book, these two storylines intertwine, a chapter of the present time followed by a chapter of the past.<br /><br />It's not an especially comfortable or easy thing to spend a whole book in Victoria's head. She is angry, distrustful, dislikes being touched, lies, steals... she's a bundle of flaws, traits and characteristics that make her a difficult character, especially as she spends considerable energy trying to repel those around her and is incapable of loving or trusting anyone, or of accepting that anyone may love or trust her. It may seem unrealistic to some, but anyone who is or has known someone who has any kind of problem (whether or not it could be categorised as an actual \\"attachment disorder\\") will realise that the prickly exterior is exactly that - an exterior, a protection, a defense, a hedgehog's coat of spines to protect its soft belly. Basically, behaviour learned in childhood and held on to even when it's inappropriate, unhelpful and downright damaging.<br /><br />Whether the reader enjoys the book or not, I suspect, has much to do with whether one identifies with her in her attempt to keep the world at a distance - so that she won't get hurt, and so that she won't hurt anyone else. She comes across as pretty unsympathetic on the surface, but under that there is a deeply hurt, broken young woman. Personally, although I have little concretely in common with her, I identified with her so strongly that at times lines from the book made me weep.<br /><br />There's a certain flavour of magical realism in how Diffenbaugh uses the language of flowers. I've noticed some people dislike that, personally I love a little magic sprinkled into my fiction so I loved it.<br /><br />Victoria's story is one of redemption, of learning to live and to love, of failure and forgiveness. It reads, to me, as a deeply personal work for the author, which is not surprising given her history of fostering and her involvement with The Camellia Network. This is not a light read - certainly not chick lit or a beach read. It is, however, a deeply involving novel which touched me deeply. Definitely one to at least give a chance to: and to return to my original point, one of which it is well worth downloading the sample.se around her and is incapable of loving or trusting anyone, or of accepting that anyone may love or trust her.

B006ZEDZNY|2.0|Obviously this was supposed to be a Fear and Loathing extension, but this fails to live up remotely to the original.  My friend and I ended up loathing the ending of this movie.  It was decent the first 80 minutes, but the last 40 minutes were a huge disappointment and let down to say the least.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Recently I left a fairly scathing review of the [[ASIN:B000R2PC2M Sennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphones]], as they disappointed in most of the areas that I bought them for in the first place. I decided to hang on to them long enough to give them a second chance, and then I discovered this here E6 amp. When I plugged it in it was as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders; every gripe I had about the PXC 450's vanished with the application of this little black box. The bass is now strong and the distortion is nonexistent. The third EQ setting (blue light) especially makes the music shine again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is freaking amazing. if you enjoy playing solataire then you should definitely download this app!!!!! Well worth the download!!!
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I have been having an absolutely splendid time getting to know all the new, young artists who re-interpret the master on this album. One could wish for more extensive liner notes introducing and giving us some background on them, but it has been fun and informative to look them up on the internet and in many instances be able to watch videos of them performing the covers they do on the album. I especially enjoyed thus discovering Flogging Molly and We Are Augustines, two of the best-done covers in my opinion. Also terrific, and fun to get to know, are Dierks Bentley, Sussan Deyhim, and, of course, Adele. Oh, and Kesha and Ziggy Marley. I'm still working my way through finding out more about some of the others. I also think the weakest performances are the older, more familiar folks: Patti Smith, Joan Baez, Jackson Browne, and the Dave Matthews Band, although Taj Mahal does a wonderfully droll take on \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" and Kris Kristofferson has good fun with \\"Quinn the Eskimo.\\" (Poor Pete Seeger sounds as though he expires on the last bar of \\"Forever Young\\"!) Share this album with your kids and grandkids; everybody can feel good about buying it, and I hope it introduces a lot of new young listeners to these wonderful songs. Thank you, Bob, and Amnesty International!

B003DT19F0|5.0|Of the two Tinkerbell movies we have watched thusfar, this is by far the favorite of my 4 Year Old Daughter.<br /><br />I won't go into laborious detail to try to explain what \\"I\\" thought of the movie. Complaints about plot points, predictability...blah. It doesn't matter. It's a movie for little girls. Don't take this more seriously than you should.<br /><br />Let me tell you what my daughter loves about this movie: Lizzie. My little one likes to imagine she also meets the fairies and befriends them. So the whole experience is strengthened by the idea that if one little girl can fly (Lizzie flies with the fairies), so can she. She also enjoys the music and the fact that Tinkerbell is a \\"tinkerer\\", meaning she can make and fix things. I doubt old Walt was thinking that when they created the character way back when, but my kid will someday appreciate that modern twist applied to her name. For now, she loves it because she also likes to tinker around.<br /><br />We've watched this movie a lot, and we don't watch much of the tube. It's just her favorite \\"treat\\". If you have a little girl in the right age range, they will eat this movie up again and again. Make sure you keep it nearby.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I ordered this little FiiO D3 unit as a low-cost, temporary placeholder in my recording studio, until my new \\"professional level\\" (= expensive) DAC was delivered.  (I was switching from a 'high-end' PCI sound card in a tower computer to an external digital-to-analog convertor, in order to eliminate various issues I'd had over the years with the sound card.)<br /><br />Anyway, I disconnected the sound card from my mixing board and plugged in my my new gadget, and then connected it to the SPDIF output on the computer.  I powered it up and got a red power light and a blue \\"lock\\" light right away.  Then, without playing music, I slowly raised the volume and couldn't hear anything.  I raised it more, and then more, and still not hearing anything, I went to full volume on the entire signal chain.  Finally I heard some hiss. Intrigued, I brought the volume way back down and played some music.  I could not believe my ears, the music sounded really good and it was plenty loud.  The little FiiO, for a fraction of what my fancy 192khz sound card had cost, was sitting there with a noise floor 10's of dB lower than the \\"premium\\" card I had been using for 3 years.  In addition to low noise there was no noticable difference in frequency response, distortion, phase response, or stereo imaging.  It just sounded good.<br /><br />Very impressed indeed.  The buld quality of the unit is good too.  I can't wait to do an A/B test with my new professional-level DAC; but I am scared to death I won't be able to tell the difference. I can sure tell the difference between the FiiO and the PCI card however.<br /><br />By the way, the FiiO comes with its own 5V power supply even though the description does not make that clear.

Better than what one is limited to in most chain stores.  I do however wish it had come with a way to prop it up while watching videos.  Since I don't watch too many and use it mainly as a reader I would buy it again.

0553582038|3.0|One reviewer does a great job of breaking down the percentages that characters are in the book.  Two of my favorites: Jon and Tyrion aren't even in it!  Arya and Dany are barely there as well.  There are too many slow, unnecessary side stories that seem to go nowhere in really advancing the overall story.  Jamie's story is good in this book, but like I said, there are a lot of fillers.  I hope the next one gets back on track because I LOVED the first two and really liked the third as well.

0316113506|5.0|Dr. John Ratey and Eric Hagerman have collected solid scientific research pointing out why exercise is good for the brain, far beyond the widely recognized \\"runner's high\\" or physical health benefits like toned muscles.  Explaining the cutting-edge research, the authors emphasize precisely how exercise generates new cells, important for numerous reasons at every life stage.  They discuss the biochemical interactions between physical activity and brain function in easy-to-follow terminology, relating the effects to learning, to staving off dementia and depression, and also including information that applies to parenting or developing curriculum.  All in all, really fascinating information in a very readable format!  I bought copies for my kids' schools.  I hope these neurological studies and this book that compiles them start a revolution in our society's understanding of how important it is to be physically active.

0385344228|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB is my hands down favorite book, so far, this year. I flew through this book in just a few days, staying up until 3 a.m. on work nights because I was so engrossed. I just HAD to find out whodunnit! I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Author William Landay has created a relatable character in assistant district attorney Andy Barber. The story is told in a conversational tone that makes the reader feel as if he is part of the story. Although this is a serious book, there are welcome moments of levity that break the tension. In one passage, Andy Barber is describing his nemesis, Neal Logiudice (pronounced la-JOO-dis): \\"Which is to say, , I had known Nils since 1986--when Neal Logiudice was in high school struggling to maintain a busy schedule of A.P. classes, band, and compulsive masturbation. (I am speculating. I cannot say for sure that he was in the band.)\\"  These incidents of wry, unexpected humor make for some interesting storytelling.<br /><br />The other characters were all very real, especially Andy's wife, Laurie. How the murder accusation against her son affects her is monumental. Andy very realistic. The reader can almost see her physical and emotional decline throghout the course of this book. The real star of this book, 14-year-old Jacob, is drawn as a flawed, but very average teenager. This book is about what can happen when extraordinary circumstances befall an ordinary family. It could happen to anyone of us. This is perhaps the draw of this book. When I finished it last night I said to myself \\"whew, I'm glad that happened to THEM and not ME.\\"  Highly recommended.
B0068RHGJM|2.0|I want to like this CD but I think I'm just Nightwished out for one lifetime.  No disrespect to any members of the band but I'm just kind of bored with them now.  Most of the songs on this new CD are &#34;OK&#34; not great but not awful either.  Ever since I saw them live on the last tour I have been a little turned off by how much they sample at the live gigs.  I think the &#34;Once&#34; cd was the best, everything after that has been kind of boring (I'm not blaming the new singer, I like her a great deal actually).
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I have just finished reading Child 44 by Tom Rob Smith. It is an intense thriller...physically and psychologically violent. Clearly written for adults, the plot unfolds as quite graphic. This is not the kind of book i normally gravitate to but as I got into this book i found I was riveted to it and could barely put it down.<br /><br />Most of the story takes place in and around Moscow in 1953, the year Stalin died. The protagonist is a Leo Demitov, a former military hero, now in the secret police, known as the MGB. His wife, Raiasa, also figures prominently in the story. There are secrets and lies, trust and distrust, plot twists and turns. It is all very exciting.<br /><br />I found the book spellbinding in a way books very rarely are.. The characters change, develop into wiser, more mature people as the layers of the story play out. By the end of the book Leo and Raisia may look much the same but they are so different on the inside.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all who enjoy adult mystery/suspense novels and thrillers. i can't stress enough that they need to be mature adults themselves to appreciate this book. This book is violent, in a physical sense and a psychological sense. It is in places very disturbing. I think this book is well written and the plot well thought out.<br /><br />(less)
B004EPZ03O|5.0|The Muppets successful relaunched themselves into the 21st Century and being dormant from theatrical movies since 1999's Muppets in Space underperformed at the box office due to summer movie competition from Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, American Pie, Tarzan, Big Daddy and Inspector Gadget; and being kept towards direct to video movies and television apperances were kept limited and became viral hits on Youtube. Now, Disney successful gave The Muppets a second chance to shine and turned out to critical acclaimed by critics and fans all over the world and a box office hit which as a result of an Academy Award nod for best original song as Man or Muppet is the favorite to win and the time of writing this they would have already won the Oscar. See this movie either with the family, friends or yourself when you buy this on blu-ray and dvd. If you had seen it in theatres or missed out on it, now's your chance!
B000FBJHEO|4.0|The first time I picked up Cosmopolis by Don DiLillo, I was only able to read a few pages before sitting it back on the shelf I'd picked it up from. I found what I'd read tedious, pretentious, and I had lost interest quickly.<br /><br />In the next few days I thought about the book and how I hate to start any book and not complete it. I needed to see where this tedious, pretentious story went. I started reading and found that it was the main character, Eric Packer who had those particular traits and more. One of his first pretentious and narcissistic utterances was, \\"When I die, it is the world that will stop, I will keep on going.\\" He was a very pompous man, I thought.<br /><br />As I continued to read I adjusted to the story and the character. I began to understand Eric and those around him and why they acted the way they did. I really grew to appreciate the story and feel for the characters.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who like contemporary writers and characters who think'beyond the box'. It wasn't an easy book to read, but it was extremely thought-provoking for me.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|Supurb writing, acting, cinematography and editing.  Excellent series!  Shot (and set) entirely on location in beautiful New Mexico.  After watching the first series pilot, you're hooked.  Like a junkie, you just can't wait for the next episode.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|There are many fun game in the mix that will keep you amused for hours, however, there are others that are almost impossible to figure out and complete.

They are all located on the Android Market an Kindle Users do not have access to this resource.
0307279189|5.0|A thoroughly intriguing book about a group of runners I never knew about: ultra-runners. I also had never heard of the Tarahumara of the Copper Canyons either. A fascinating story about the evolution of humans as runners, barefoot and healthy without the aid of Nike, Adidas, etc. McDougall tells an interesting story that only came about because his feet hurt when he ran!
0439023513|5.0|I'm actually surprised by the number of people who were disappointed. Though I understand some of their concerns as this addition was not perfectly polished, I still think this book was a FANTASTIC ending to an excellent series. I wished she made the ending maybe a little longer to tie up some loose ends by the end, but I think even that serves a purpose.<br /><br />Though some things were predictable, Collins took a lot of serious dares in this book, and I think she meant to. Her point is to reveal that war is unpredictable and numbing, chaotic and cold, devastating and life-changing. Mockingjay didn't seemingly carry as much heart as the previous two books, probably because the focus shifted from building relationships to testing them. This book was true to its purpose.<br /><br />Mockingjay was a battlefield book. I give it 5 stars for taking the alternative route and making it work.

B00008G9JM|5.0|Everything that Tull were aiming toward in the early 1970's is present here. This is as far out and fully realized as Anderson's vision ever got, and the peak period lineup of Tull (Barre, Hammond, Evans, Barlow) provides the perfect accompaniment and encouragement.<br /><br />Miles of ink have already been spilled concerning the supposedly \\"impenetrable\\" lyrics, so I will only say that if you refer to the mock \\"playbill\\" included in the CD booklet, you'll quickly get the idea. No need to make things more complex than they already are! Simply put, if you love Tull, if you love classic 1970's progressive rock, and if you love the idea of Ian Anderson at his most free ranging, both lyrically and musically, then, by all means, get this.
0783226845|5.0|I had this movie before but lent it out. When I had the urge to watch it I bought it again. After seeing this movie you'll know why. Al Pachino is at his best. Playing a blind retired Lieutenant Colonel that is rude (to say the least) to a young man just looking to pick up a few bucks during Thanksgiving Vacation from college you wonder if he didn't wear solid contacts to \\"make him\\" blind. If not, he plays a blind person very well. Sometimes you'll \\"feel\\" for the student but mostly you'll laugh at some of the things Pachino takes him through. All in all, you'll realize why Al Pachino won a \\"Best Actor\\" Oscar for his peformance. It's a great movie with an ending that may or not leave you crying. Not with sadness but joy. A movie you HAVE TO see to \\"really\\" enjoy.

En Vivo Desde Paris lives up to the greatness that Shaki exhibited during the Fixation and Mongoose tours on the following tracks :<br /><br />Pienso En Ti<br />Nothing Else Matters<br />Despedida<br />Gypsy<br />Underneath Your Clothes<br />Sale El Sol<br />Ojos Asi<br />Antes De Las Seis<br />Je L'Aime A Mourir<br />Waka Waka<br /><br />On these tracks her vocals are powerful, emotional, moving, gripping, and in short everything a fan would expect to receive from a Shakira dvd.  Shakira is a full fledged theatrical performance; every note, facial expression, and movement are integral to the finished product.  This is clear on the above listed tracks, and, despite valient efforts made on other tracks by whoever filmed and edited this dvd, the above setlist simply could not be ruined.<br />If you are a long time Shakira fan, and thus familiar with the evolution of Ojos Asi, from MTV Unplugged, to Mongoose, to Fixation, then you will most likely delight in seeing Shaki continue to thrill her fans with the dance moves she brings to this rendition of a beloved track.  If you loved \\"No\\" in the red dress and wish it were in this setlist, Antes De Las Seis and Je L'Aime A Mourir are the \\"No\\" of this tour, only this time in blue.  If you loved MTV Unplugged, then the Nothing Else Matters, Despedida, and Gypsy segment will allow you to reminisce.  If you are looking for the new Hip's Don't Lie, it's Waka Waka.<br /><br />The marvelous costumes and the exquisite lighting are nice touches in this performance/dvd.  The lighting is in my opinion the best of any of her tour dvd's, especially for Gypsy, Antes De Las Seis andJe L'Aime A Mourir, and Underneath Your Clothes.  In these tracks particularly, each type and color of lighting perfectly complements each song and constume.  As for the costumes, the rich pink and blue look stunning, and the way the costumes layer over one another is marvelous.  Per the usual, the costumes perfectly complement Shakira herself.<br /><br />The Bad--<br /><br />First, what I mainly do not like about this dvd has to do with the production aspects rather than with Shaki's performance.  There is slow motion editing which I really could have lived without.  A concert dvd, ideally, is a front row seat at the show, with a minimum of distractions.  Shakira's fans want to see shakira in the purest of forms, and by that I mean as she actually appeared in concert, not as she appears in slow motion.  Altering the reality of Shakira's movements distracts and detracts from the magic that is Shakira, and whoever made this dvd failed to realise that.<br /><br />Second, the set list of old songs would have been better with some variety.  The Ladrones era songs that appear on this dvd are the same ones that Shaki always sings :  Si Te Vas, Inevitable, Ciega Sordomuda, and Ojos Asi.  Ojos Asi is to me Shakira's trademark song and MUST be included because it embodies the arabic sound that defines Shakira's music.  Furthermore, the Ojos Asi dance has been completely revamped and enhanced to become a new product for this dvd.  As for Si Te Vas, Inevitable, and Ciega Sordomuda, I would have prefered to have Shakira sing No Creo, Sombra de Ti, or Moscas en la Casa, which are only available on the MTV Unplugged dvd, or Tu, which hasn't been included in the concert tours since Mongoose.  The Laundry Service era songs suffered from the same lack of variety.  I love Te Dejo Madrid, but this tour dvd would have benefited from including the other spanish version only track, Que Me Quedes Tu, which isn't available on dvd rather than Te Dejo Madrid that is on the Fixation dvd.  Orif Shakira wanted a non-mellow song, then Te Aviso, Te Anuncio [spanish Objection] would have been much appreciated, and is also unavailable elsewhere.<br /><br />Third, Gordita.  It is boring and wastes a slot that could have been given to either a better new song or a much more worthy old song.<br /><br />How I self-edit to make the viewing experience enjoyable--<br /><br />I start with Pienso en Ti, and then skip directly to Nothing Else Matters, thus bypassing the entire gold costume section of the tour.  This allows me to eliminate Te Dejo Madrid, Si Te Vas, Whenever Wherever, and Inevitable, all of which I prefer the versions avaible on the Fixation and/or Mongoose dvd's, and get straight to the good stuff which occurs throughout the later portions of the concert.  I also skip Gordita.  So overall my advice is include this dvd in your Shakira collection, and, if you have a dislike, decide for yourself which segments of the concert aren't your favorites and skip those.  Don't let the flaws in the set list or slow motion editing deprive you of the truly wonderful performances Shakira gave here in Paris.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a great way to pass time I like how it teaches. you to develop. strategy. I love playing
B0054JZC6E|5.0|couldn't stop playing...it is so great...difficult to earn all the points though..had a lot of fun...cant wait to play more
B006ON41FC|5.0|I am stuck on a app then I bought going nuts I liked It. and then it became addicting. I bought every. suit then I got abunch of stuff to do I recmend this game for anyone that likes animal's and that like a puzzleing apps
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is an excellent app that is powerful for those on the move. The ability to access your files from the cloud is an amazing one. It is also nice to not feel so spyed on by the other cloud options. We all know who those offenders are :) Its very simple to use and can be put to use for a lot of tasks. I am able to transfer documents from multiple devices to my girlfriend. We use it when we are doing group projects and on the move. Definitly a recommeneded free app to try out. Wish it would climb the Amazon free app ladder because it really is a lot more deserving then most of the clutter.
B000002JAX|4.0|This is a nice collection of songs done very well by good musicians and a lady with a lovely singing voice.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Roxio reinvigorates an already great franchise!<br /><br />As easy to pick up and play as the original. Entertaining and finely tuned as those that came before it as well. An amazing value for your entertainment dollar. The new playstyle and challenging levels will keep you coming back for more. In a market filled with less then stellar game designs this one is a marvel to play.<br /><br />Be careful its just as addicting as the other titles in the series :)
B0002NRRAG|4.0|This is very nice music.  Easy and classy.  I bought this for my wife for a gift and she likes it a lot as do I.  If you haven't ever listened to Madeline Peyroux, you should check her out.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Hot! Sexy! Couldn't put it down. I was up until 2am reading this book. The series doesn't disappoint. I give it 5 stars.
B000A2GREQ|4.0|This is a nice collection of Police songs.  If you are a fan of The Police, you'll like this album.  If you are not a fan of The Police, you may not like it as much.  Perhaps, in that case you should consider becoming a fan of The Police.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love reading the Bible. It has a lot of history and everything else. Once you start reading it. You cant put it down.
B0000508U6|4.0|Overall, this music is nice and easy to listen to.  Sometimes, some of the songs get a bit whiny sounding, but overall, it's okay.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is a whole lot better than the first installment.  Nothing of the boring chapters at the start; mystery, action and thrills all the way through.  Now I understand why the girl is in the title role.<br /><br />It was hard to imagine Lisbeth's talents and abilities, until her history was revealed.  So it is also not hard to imagine how people can genuinely care for her.<br /><br />Even if Stieg Larsson is not here anymore, he left behind a legacy by which he will always be remembered.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have same issue as others. it will not let me download the update. says there is an error. worked fine before that.  does anyone have a solution
B00632HWOG|5.0|This Yahoo app works perfectly. It definitely does not deserve only a *** rating.I have been using the app since the Fire was first released and it has worked flawlessly.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love all of the different tiles and being able to complete the round when the gold tiles are matched.  It is a great version of mahjong.
B004UHSB5A|2.0|Controls are not intuitive and less than stellar graphics.  Game play is OK.  But then again, how to do you update Dominoes?<br /><br />Would have liked to see a little more graphics, maybe contrast from background to dominoes themselves.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|I'll admit going in that these films are a little dated, but being able to get all five Dirty Harry movies for a bargain price is definitely awesome.  I won't go into detail about each film because that's been done ad-nauseum.  Suffice it to say that each of these is a great movie, particularly if you are a Clint Eastwood fan as I have been since his Rawhide days.  The big gun, the tough talk and the cliches that became a part of American slang make these a must have for true videophiles.  Five terrific films for a bargain basement price.  How can you go wrong, I ask.  \\"Go ahead, make my day!,\\" you won't regret it.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|This movie is terrible from the word go, the soundtrack is even more terrible!  Can not believe I spent my hard earned money on this terrible movie.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Just saw \\"J. Edgar\\" directed by Clint Eastwood.  It was a movie, however I'd argue it would have done better as a play. There's more internal conflict than drama.  DeCaprio does a superb job portraying the former F.B.I. founder.<br /><br />Hoover has been credited as one of the founders of forensic science and for that matter stealing the credit for many findings from his own agents. Through his clever manipulation of people and the press; he got the results that benefited his image in history.<br /><br />I can't say it was a well paced movie. It was very slow in some instances. It's one of those movies you can watch a few times to understand the subtle motivations of the characters. Like J. Edgar Hoover, the movie is a very complex back and forth journey through different periods in his life. We see that his mother was very power hungry. She indoctrinated her son into believing he would be a great leader someday.  Hoover came from a very well to do background.  It didn't stop him from becoming a ruthless leader of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Eastwood shows us the good, bad and the very ugly of a man that changed the face of America.<br /><br />We get to see how he kept files and destroyed them throughout his fifty years.  Presidents feared him and wanted to see him gone.  It wasn't until the Nixon administration that he passed away while still serving in office. There was a very pivotal and poignant  scene where he orders his secretary to destroy all of his files.  You can see the loyalty he inspired with his secretary of over fifty years.  We get to see all of his excesses that drove him to the brink of madness.  Be prepared to sit through this film a few times before you absorb all the information the director intends you to see.  I'd have to recommend this film. If your looking for a dramatic and action film first, you be disappointed.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Downloaded fine plays great.  The game is worth the 99 cents.  Very easy learning curve and enough puzzles to see that it could get really difficult at a pace that wont lose a lot of people.  Will look forward to getting the additional content.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is so additive.  would recommend. it to everyone. all ages are able to enjoy. well worth the money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is amazing.  It really is a heart wrenching story at times, which is part of what makes it so awesome.  The characters are well developed and relatable.  They can be so frusterating sometimes, but that is what makes these books ring so true.  The characters are just people in an aweful situation trying to make the best decisions they can, plus most of them are still kids, and kids can be frusterating.  I recommend buying all three at once, because once you start you will just want to keep going.  I can't recommend this enough!!!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Pretty much sums up what I had already suspected but did not have any evidence for.<br />Now I have something to point to when I happen to get into a discussion about food!
B000OLV97I|2.0|My sister recommended this movie on the basis of the books, which I've never read. After watching this, I'm afraid reading the books would be a waste of time. What a yawn-inducing movie. Even at the film's climax I wanted to turn it off. Please say the books are better than this.
B006ON41FC|1.0|wont let me bye STUPID<br />it said that it wont install try again and still wont work,<br />How stupid, And for 99&cent; Whatever
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|solid app that syncs with multiple cloud storages like google docs, Box, drop box. only complaint is you can't email files straight from the app.
B005LRWRZ8|1.0|I thought, after reading Mustaine's comment that he had never seen an album with a lot of great songs since Guns N Roses released Appetite, wow, the songs in this album must really be that great!<br /><br />After listening to it, I thought then that Dave's only said the great crap thing to sell more copies!<br /><br />This album is crap. I have all of Megadeth's album, and this is comparable to their .45 album. Could these songs be all B-SIDE from their previous albums!???<br /><br />Disappointing! All same sound, boring guitar riffs and drumming. Megadeth is spiraling down fast. They should fire their lead guitar and drummer and plead for Friedman or Pitrelli for lead, and DeGrasso on drums!<br /><br />Disturbed has overtaken them gazillion miles... tsk! tsk! tsk!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Bought this for my daughters Kindle Fire - fits perfect and is very durable. Great product and looks better than any picture you'll see advertising it!
B000W91RUG|5.0|JUST THE BEST THING EVER - BESIDES BOOKS OF COURSE. I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS IF I COULD. 5 JUST DOESNT SEEM LIKE ENOUGH.<br />MY NEW VERSION OF CRACK LOL. SOOO OBSESSED WITH THIS SHOW. ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH AND SMILE. LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS. NO MATTER HOW TIRED OR HOW BAD OF A DAY, THIS SHOW IS THE BEST FIX OUT THERE FOR  ANY DAY. YOU TOO WILL BE JUST AS STUCK TO THEM AS I WAS WITH JUST WATCHING 2 EPISODES. CANNOT BRAG ENOUGH! I WILL BE BUYING ALL THE SEASON DVDS. YAAAAAYY!!!!<br />BAZINGA YALL..........BAZINGA!!!! :)<br />TAM IN TENNESSEE
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought this case for my Kindle Fire to help keep it safe from bumps and scrapes. I also was looking for something lite weight and didn't cost an arm and a leg. Its exactly what I was looking for. However I bought it at the same time I bought my device and should have thought a few things through. Like what if I drop my Kindle Fire from a distance higher than a foot off the ground and I needed an extra spot to keep the pen I use when my finger is to big! It fits snugly into the space provided and covers the screen great and the strap keeps it shut. I never have to take it out of the case to charge it and sits up well on its own.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is one of those rare books that makes you want to hug everyone in it so tightly that they'll have no doubt about how much you love them...and beyond that, it also makes you want to reach out and hug the whole world. It's an upbeat, humorous, life-affirming story that deserves to be read--and it's one that may just change its readers, too.<br /><br />If you remember how terrifying it was to be a kid on a day to day basis, you'll appreciate August's story. 10-year-old Auggie is going to school for the first time in his life, and he has to navigate new rules, learn to interact with teachers, and figure out how to make new friends. In addition, he also has a severe facial deformity that stops strangers in their tracks, so all the usual perils of the fifth grade take on even more heightened stakes.<br /><br />With the matter-of-fact wisdom that warmed Beverly Cleary's books, this story about growing up is full of heart and humor, and written with a clear-eyed intelligence that never descends into cynicism. Auggie's smart, funny personality will win over readers who will agonize with him over the complicated web of friendships and family even as they cheer for him as he learns some of life's big and scary lessons.<br /><br />Even with a positive attitude and smart, loving parents, however, Auggie's story is not an easy one to read, and my emotions ran wildly from sadness to hilarity to terrible anger at what happens to him. Not all kids are nice. Some kids behave one way in front of adults and another way in front of kids. Some adults are downright cruel. And just when you think life can't possibly get any harder or more challenging, sometimes it does.<br /><br />Although the book is primarily told from Auggie's perspective, it was a surprise to me when it switched to a few other points of view. With a total of six different voices, I would normally say this is far too many, but in this particular case every person offered an insight into August's beautiful personality and amazing life in a way that would be impossible to otherwise know. Reading about Auggie's 27 surgeries, rejoicing at his vibrant inner life, hurting for him when he felt lonely or misunderstood, and seeing his life from various different perspectives, it's impossible not to be moved by his story. And how can you not love a boy who understands that sometimes his mom might need his precious teddy bear more than he does?<br /><br />Tears were streaming down my face as I finished this book--and the funny thing is, they were primarily tears of joy. Wonder is written with the kind of sensitivity and insight that I had hoped for when I read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and it went the extra mile to be an uplifting story that made me want to embrace life and the people in it, too. I also very much appreciate that this middle grade book is written for its intended age group, not just a book for adults in the guise of a children's book, even though it's certainly one that can be enjoyed by readers of any age.<br /><br />A story like this comes along just a few times in a lifetime, and I fervently hope that readers will find their way to it. This short book that doesn't waste a single page in squeezing your emotions so tightly you feel like you can't breathe, but when they're finally released, you may find that your heart is full of even more empathy, compassion, and love than you thought possible. We expect to be surprised by cruelty, but how wonderful it is to also be surprised by kindness.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of [[ASIN:0060737573 Suicide Notes]], [[ASIN:0763655597 A Monster Calls: Inspired by an idea from Siobhan Dowd]], or Beverly Cleary.<br /><br />*An advance copy of this book was provided by the publisher for review.*
B002BWP49C|5.0|Nothing went wrong when ordering from you! Still in all its casing, with the wrapping on it. Shipping was super fast and that's not something you see everyday :) I love this movie, so I'm so happy to have been able to buy it for such a great price! Thank you :)
B003DT194G|5.0|I watched this in my Film & Literature Of The American West class in college. When the professor described it, I didn't know what to think. All the actors sounded good (Henry Fonda, always good; Charles Bronson, so good; etc.), but then he mentioned that Henry Fonda was the villain in this particular movie. I didn't understand how it could work.<br /><br />Henry Fonda is always the good guy. You can just see it in his eyes. How could he ever be believable as a villain? Well, it turns out he can. He turns his good-guy eyes into a fierce, piercing gaze for this film.<br /><br />The film starts out with a really funny scene with some lesser-known entities (unless you're huge into westerns), including one man fighting a fly which keeps landing on his face. It's silent and deadpan, and funny. Until a train bearing a mysterious stranger arrives; then it's an immediate showdown.<br /><br />The movie is slow at parts, but the characters and music keep you wanting more. The music in the movie is absolutely amazing; some of the most powerful music I've heard in a movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is a classic western that any fan should see.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|It has been 20 years since Joey Belladonna left the band and his return proves that the chemistry in Anthrax with Joey back on vocals is pure, intense and DAMN GOOD!  There are many familiar riffs of the old days present on this new album (i.e. \\"Fight 'em til you can't\\" has various similar elements from \\"Misery Loves Company\\" from the album STATE OF EUPHORIA)which is very appealing as I still listen to ALL of my Anthrax collection from SPREADING THE DISEASE to PERSISTANCE OF TIME.  A very big heart felt WELCOME BACK from Kansas City and the rest of the world...MOSHITUPE!!!
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|Great CD... I love all the alternate tracks... The unreleased track Harmony is great.<br />All Diana fans need to run out and buy this one.  I am so happy with these deluxe versions of Diana Ross' cds.  Can't wait for Baby It's Me.  Hope it's next.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|has the potential to be great app.  Author needs to work the bugs out and add some options for different styles of play.  Really looking forward to an update.
0316113506|5.0|well, i have been damn depressed most of my life time.<br />when i was 18, i was seriously depressed, and i found taekwondo.  i practiced it really hard everyday with all my will power (forced exercise; i didn't like exercise for its own sake) for next 6 months, and my life started looking up.  my face started beaming (people could tell) and i found a girl friend, etc...  however, i started not exercising (i lost motivation), and now, i am in 40s with big belly fat, 40~50 pounds over-weight and not motivated to do anything.  i think what i needed was some reminder how exercise can benefit your life and improve brain function. I exercised back then, not because i wanted to, but because i was so miserable and i needed some outlets. this is a great book that can change your core beliefs in exercise.  exercise cannot solve all your problems, but it can definitely help out, and i will give it a sincere try this time.  i started exercising a few days ago, and my mood is up.  i can greet people with smile.  forced exercise isn't really effective as the author pointed out.  this book gives you tons of reason and scientific research to make you \\"WANT TO\\" exercise.  great book for those who want to change their lives and get moving toward success.  i think this book is better than most self help books out there which just pumps you up for a few days.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Love it! Funny, entertaining... a light read.<br />Sophie Kinsella always delivers!  She can be counted on to add a little humor in a rather ordinary day!
B005VTSX22|5.0|the Bee Gees  are one of  My all time Favorite Musical  Acts and not only did they have the grooves, but the vocals and more importantly they had the songwriting which complimented all of the other parts and made it all work as  one.  this  song is timeless and still feels good to jam to.

B006UG90RM|3.0|i use to  really  dig me  some  VH back in the day and they were a sure Hall of  Fame and top tier Band that seemed to be on course to be debated there place in history with other  great  bands, but Ego and change  wrecked a sure fire thing. now its  been almost 30 years  since the Original VH were together and still you notice the absence of Michael Anthony and his distinctive background and tone.  some of the  tracks are cool in a  2nd cousin to 3rd cousin kind of way,however that is more along  the lines of  tracks being older and keeping in tradition to there  familiar sound,formula etc..  problem they run into is  that some stuff  feels crammed and stuffed together and it covers some shortcomings on the songwriting and production.<br /><br />also expectation to hear VH drop another Musical statement because back in the day you knew Eddie Van Halen wanted to make a  statement with either His Axe or  Keyboards or when they ran Musical chairs at the Lead vocalist on there  projects.<br /><br />this album is easily  there best in a long time,however it is fairly predictable and works if you want to jog down memory lane as to run and expect what you got in 84 all over again. Diamond David Lee Roth is  not quite the same voice, however you know his pressence because it has been missing.  not a bad project however i expect more from the live show.<br /><br />the Musicianship is  still tight and some things work in places.

B001CZVVVY|4.0|As you may gather from the (currently) seven other reviews on this Amazon page, this is a rather idiosyncratic production of Mozart's first operatic masterpiece. Most have hit on the most noticeable aspects, namely  the sparse setting (usually all in white with stairs leading up or down), the extra character (the Puck-like \\"Cherub,\\" undoubtedly used as a fairy-like parallel to Cherubino), and the unusual tempo choices (usually much slower, giving the music a ponderous weight I don't think it's used to carrying). What it all adds up to is a Figaro played with a postmodern aesthetic and a quite serious sensibility. It's certainly not the comedy of errors interspersed with sweetness and longing we've come to know and love. Harnoncourt and co. seem to view the opera as being closer to the tragic profundity of Don Giovanni (or, God help all Mozarteans, Wagner) rather than the buffoonery of Serail (or Rossini's \\"prequel\\").<br /><br />But it must be said that however controversial the production it doesn't take away from the talent of the performers, and this is a very talented Figaro cast. I've been somewhat skeptical of Anna Netrebko in the past, but in a cast that's solid from top to bottom, her Susanna is the undeniable star. Even without her good looks, her velvety voice manages to traverse the complexity of Susanna's character, from the playfully sexy and charming, to the more introverted and uncertain moments. Sometimes she manages both, such as the sublime \\"Deh, vieni, non tardar.\\" That aria is taken at a slightly quicker tempo than usual, highlighting the contradictive forces in Susanna, namely both the desire and apprehension for the night to be over with. She's one of the few Susanna's that plays the character as \\"knowingly\\" as I think she was written, as opposed to just rendering her as the pretty-voiced, somewhat naïve victim of the Count's advances. Or, to put it another way, Netrebko gives her brains as well as beauty (and a beautiful voice).<br /><br />Itcould be argued that the rest of the cast doesn't excel quite to the level that Netrebko does, but I think what they do is a deliver a consistently strong ensemble performance. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is an appropriately dashing Figaro, but perhaps slightly less charming in voice than in looks. If anything, he seems to play Figaro as more of an introvert than the usual gregariousness with which we're used to thinking of the character as possessing in spades. Although he has a vocal richness that's well suited to his pairings with Netrebko. Boje Skovhus is a rather raging count, bringing more of the darkness of the character out rather than the more usual buffoonery. I think his approach works better for the Count as opposed to D'Arcangelo's for Figaro. Christine Schafer is a sweet Cherubino, and the character whom I think most benefits from the modern production. Her \\"Voi che sapete\\" is treated with a rapturous sensuality, (not to mention the nigh-orgiastic \\"Venite\\" three-way between Susanna, Cherubino, and The Countess).<br /><br />If there a slight weak spot in the cast it's Dorothea Roschmann. She's certainly not a bad Countess, but I simply don't think she can generate the pathos necessary to make \\"Porgi, amor\\" and \\"Dove sono\\" the transcendental pieces of musical drama that they are. If I had to argue why, the simple answer would be that she plays them too one-dimensionally and melodramatically--perhaps an irony since this is, literally, a \\"musical drama,\\" but Netrebko is a model of how to be both natural and \\"musically dramatic\\" simultaneously. Watch the exaggerated hand gestures in Dove sono, especially, to see what I mean. With all that said, she's still spot-on vocally, and she does get to shine more in the finale.<br /><br />As for Harnoncourt's tempos and dynamics, I think anyone going into a Harnoncourt production with any knowledge of the maestro would expect some risk-taking. Right from the opening of the overture it's obvious that Harnoncourt is in a more meditative mood, as opposed to a lively one. Say what you will, I find this approach to Mozart fascinating enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, especially in an age where most conductors seem to agree that Mozart liked his tempos to be rather brisk, slowing them down gives us another perspective. I already mentioned the \\"Venite\\" three-way, and one can see the affect of this approach most vividly there, where it creates a much more luxurious, even licentious feeling to the music. It certainly helps that he's aided by the impeccable Wiener Philharmoniker, who do manage to play with a sense of dramatic urgency.<br /><br />The production, much like Harnoncourt's tempi, is love it or hate it. I'll guess I'll be contrary and say I neither love nor hate. I guess I might say that the style doesn't innately appeal to me, yet it's different enough to keep me interested. While most have noted the sparseness, I think everyone has missed the abundance of details, like the fact that the stage floor is strewn with leaves, or the abundant feathers, or the stuffed birds in the windows. All of these elements gives one the sense of characters whose emotions are merely feathers/leaves in the wind, free to be blown about with little control over themselves. The birds are symbols of escape and flight, yet their \\"stuck in the window\\" lifeless, frozen positions seem to mirror how the characters are emotionally stuck. I'm surprised one reviewer thought that Susanna's lack of a \\"hat\\" in the opening scene was signs of cheapness in production when it was obviously a conscious artistic choices. By Susanna \\"pretending\\" to have a hat it highlights the fact that Figaro is off in his own world and ignoring his wife, something that's frustrating enough to Susanna that we begin to sense that maybe she would consider giving in to the Count's advances. It's one little touch that, in my opinion, adds to the conflicted depth of her character in this production that's absence in others.<br /><br />The Cherub character is likely the most controversial aspect, and one can't help but get a sense he's somewhat of a knockoff of Shakespeare's mischievous Puck. But Uli Kirsch plays the character with enough physical talent and charm to sell me on the choice. He's paired visually, in terms of costume, with Cherubino, significantly highlighting the fact that it's Cherubino's own baffling, misunderstood, uncontrolled love and lust that's equally controlling the other \\"mature\\" characters. Thematically, it highlights the fact that these are all still adolescents in love. Personally, I think the more postmodern, \\"metafictional\\" touches (like characters freezing in mid-song, or moving like puppets, or whatever) is less successful than Cherub. It gives the feeling that the director, Claus Guth, wanted to go for something more knowingly artificial while Harnoncurt preferred the more naturalistic drama inherent in the opera. Although, I did appreciate the inverted staircase towards the end that reminded me of Escher's famous lithograph, as well as the movie Labyrinth.<br /><br />So what does all of this add up to? I think it adds up to a solid production that's worth seeing if only for Netrebko's outstanding Susanna and the bold choices made in both the conducting and production. Obviously, these choices have not pleased everyone, but I would think for veterans of the opera whom have already seen dozens of \\"traditional\\" productions this might come as a breath of fresh air as it did to me. If nothing else, the video and audio quality of this blu-ray is superb, and should set a nice benchmark for other opera-on-blu-rays to live up to.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|The product is an excellent and clear recording, unfortunately the material was disappointing. I stopped watching LOST after the 5th season and after a couple of years had passed I was curious about what I had missed.  When I watched this final season it reminded of the convoluted and ridiculous storyline which prompted me to stop watching after 5 long and tedious seasons. I started out loving the show, but each season became more and more bizzare until I could not stand it any more.  At least this set reminds me that the nonsense is finally over!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good because you get a lot of games, but the graphics aren't that good and overall the games are easy. Download this game if you want to pass the time, otherwise don't bother.
0312576463|4.0|That was my first meeting with this author.<br />I had some problems to get in the book.<br />The first 100 pages were not that interesting.<br />Maybe because the main character of the first part, Patty Emerson, is hard to like.<br /><br />But I was reading only few pages at a time on first days.<br />When I found time to advance in it, it seems much better.<br />I really liked Walter Berglund.<br />His universe is unique.<br />And like great American novelist, Franzen is able to make a social comment on our society while using family stories.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|Her voice is above all loud, in the Bette Midler category. Her songs have meaning, are well written, but I found that after listening to all of them, I asked myself if this was worth 6 Grammys? My honest answer is no. I played her album alongside Adam Lamberts \\"For Your Entertainment\\", Lady Gaga's \\" Born this Way\\", Madonna's \\"Immaculate\\" and the superbe \\"Dive\\" by Sarah Brightman. Adele will one day be in their league perhaps, but not yet. Im 64, have eclectic musical tastes and know excellence when I hear it. I hope she succeed s (and Im sure she will!), but the Grammy's went overboard in a kind of mass hysteria over this. I think that these and others ought be judged stricly by sales, not by judges who's motivations for selecting someone may be no better than who decides the next Miss America.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is very addicting, and very Challenging!  It's an app that you will keep :)  Rotating the items can be a little tricky, but you will get the hang of it.  I play this on my pandigital Supernova Dlx tablet and it works awesome.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I was not sure I could trust the glowing reviews or the specs on this flashlight, so I decided to test the \\"throw\\" power myself.  I went to a street corner near my residence at night from which a street sign could be seen at a distance.  I used a very accurate map to determine that the sign was definitely more than 1/4 mile (440 yards) away.  My best estimate is 460 yards.  At that distance, even though the printing on the sign was large, it could not be read without binoculars.  Although there was street lighting, because of large trees and the positions of the lights, it was impossible to read the sign even with binoculars because it was too dim.  I then pointed this Fenix flashlight toward the sign, and to my amazement, it was lit up very well and was easy to read with binoculars.  If someone had told me that they had a flashlight with this throw power, I would have thought they were fibbing, because it would not be technically possible.  I would guess that with powerful binoculars and this flashlight, you could recognize a person in total darkness from a distance of 450 yards.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this knife after doing (too much) research. I thought I knew what to expect. i had read reviews claiming that the knife came dull, the finish wasn't great, and the grip screws would all fall out during moderate use. let me be clear in the fact that I have NO PREFERENCE when it comes to knife brands,names, or manufactures, this is the 1st K-Bar I have ever owned, or quite frankly, been interested in. i have several family members that are retired or active armed forces, and they all sing the praises of the USMC K-Bar knives, but I just didn't see the attraction to what i saw as an antiquated knife design. i was looking for a good general purpose knife, made to last, in the $50-$70 dollar range, that was no-frills, not flashy, and simple. this knife was in the running, and i made my decision based mostly on the simple design of the knife. i am very impressed with this knife. i do not think it is \\"too heavy\\" or \\"too bulky for smaller tasks\\". it is, at its core, just a great knife, strong simple, easy to maintain. i did opt for the Micarta Scales (expensive, but worth it). if you take away the fact that it is a K-Bar, and was designed by Ethan Becker; on its own, it is a good knife. it has held up to any use i have put it too, and i would consider that use to be very realistic, no tourture testing, i didnt break any windows with it, but the fact that this is a great knife for the money, in my opinion, cannot be disputed in any way..
B003O5MO2A|5.0|Certain things never change! First live release from this Classic Rock band, played with energy and enthusiasm by these (now) veterans of Rock And Roll.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun game with large collection of variety. Good for all ages, with many of the games providing tough challenges. Enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are great but when I first downloaded it my security feature told me my kindle fire was at risk from the creators from an unknown file, its probably just from having to many permissions but it would still be nice to have it do that plz fix. also it wouldn't hurt to increase the coin value for replaying games after you completed them to aid in achieving the other swell games. other than those it's really thought out and pretty challenging, great time waster!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. definitely takes a long time to unlock everything though. definitely helps kick boredom though, especially in class haha. definitely glad thatbi downloaded it :)

B004EPYZV2|5.0|I think this was one of the best Mission Impossible films!  It had a good plot, it was exciting, edge of your seat action.  I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time!  The scene where Tom Cruise is on the side of the tallest building in the world is a nail bitter!  This is a great one, don't miss it!

0385342063|2.0|Having read most of Sophie Kinsella's books with enjoyment, I was excited to give \\"I've Got Your Number\\" a try. Unfortunately it just didn't hold my interest.<br /><br />I became rather annoyed by Poppy- she's supposed to be a likable, quirky heroine, but she comes off as a whiny, impulsive, and lets her fiance treat her like a child. I'm sure Kinsella eventually redeems her, but I just never got invested enough to want to find out how.<br /><br />The concept was a bit annoying and far-fetched, even for this type of book. Poppy loses her engagement ring at a hotel, then has her phone stolen. She needs to be reachable, so she takes a  phone she found in the trash and gives that number to the hotel. The story rides on the premise that Poppy can't change give the phone back to the [turns out handsome] stranger because she  the hotel has that number. If she changed her number with the front desk once already, why can't she get her own phone and change it again?! Give the poor guy his phone back! Or call your service provider and have them transfer your number to a new phone! If this woman is as addicted to her phone as she claims to be, I find it hard to believe those thoughts never crossed her mind.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this, but I don't feel like this book is worth forcing myself to finish.
0061353248|5.0|Dan Ariely is a living example of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. He nearly died in a fire caused by a lab accident when he was in university. In the years of healing and therapy that followed, he started asking more questions about how we perceive pain in ourselves and others. These questions -- and an amazing curiosity -- eventually took him to the pinnacles of academic research in economics and psychology, or what is called \\"behavioral economics.\\"<br /><br />I read his Predictably Irrational just before Christmas last year; it's a fascinating book that makes you think more about our individual views of the world and how those views affect our interactions with others, which means that anyone interested in policy formation and implementation should absolutely read this book. People in advertising, marketing, politics and business should also read it during \\"work hours\\" but anyone interest in improving their understanding of \\"reality, the construct\\" will benefit from it.<br /><br />The chapter summaries at wikipedia give you a good idea of the contents, but they are no substitute for the book, since Ariely is a good -- and entertaining -- writer. I was particularly impressed by these points:<br /><br />  His citation of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer as an early example of using framing to make a chore into a privilege, i.e., how only special people should be allowed to paint a fence.<br /><br />  His discussions of price anchoring. An iPhone for $399 looks like a deal compared to its old price of $499. We see this in action with water prices, when the price of tap water moves from $2/750 gallons to $4/750 gallons. That move may be from nothing to trivial, but people pay far more attention to the 100 percent increase.<br /><br />  \\"Free\\" is much better than $0.01 for a product, not just as a means of lowering transaction costs (I saw a woman use her debit card to buy a $0.85 stamp yesterday), but also as a means of manipulating consumers. Two for one offers can be dangerous.<br /><br />  Along the same lines, he has an interesting discussion of how we are happy to give our time for free, but offended when offered payment for it (my neighbor just took an hour of his Sunday to help me move; payment would have been a bad idea). Ariely reminds us just how socially autistic some economists can be, as when the \\"busy\\" professor offered to hire a moving crew for a friend who needed help so he didn't have to stop doing important research (I can't remember his name, because he's not that important).<br /><br />  Sexual arousal does not lead to good decisions (he used some particularly graphic experiments to confirm this).<br /><br />  Money is a useful means of exchange, but money for the sake of money interferes with human relations. Ariely is also a burner :)<br /><br />  People are more likely to share a \\"free\\" good (so that others have a chance to get some) than a good that costs $0.01. That's either because they assume payment gives them the right to buy as much as they want (satiating their demand) or that a price signal means a replenishment mechanism exists.<br /><br />  His interesting discussion of associating good feelings (watching a movie) with unpleasant tasks (taking your medicine), to make them easier to stomach (literally, in his case).<br /><br />  His exploration of the \\"too many choices\\" problem, using an experiment in which a person faces changing probabilities of payoffs at different doors. Many people cycle among the doors instead of choosing a \\"decent\\" stream of payoffs, even when cycling burns up profits. This happens to \\"optimizers\\" who try to find the BEST outcome, rather than \\"satisficers\\" who stop when they get a decent outcome. I am more happy as a satisficer.<br /><br />  His discussion of \\"taking\\" a pencil from work vs \\"stealing\\" cash from work. The former is easier to rationalize, even if it's the equivalent. Apply this lesson to stock options (vs. cash withdrawals) or lobbying (vs. bribery), and youwill see how people justify corruption in businesses and politics.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I give this book FIVE STARS, for its clear, knowledgeable and interesting exploration of why we do what we do -- and how to improve our choices.will see how people justify corruption in businesses and politics.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I give this book FIVE STARS, for its clear, knowledgeable and interesting exploration of why we do what we do -- and how to improve our choices.
0061134007|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but found it confusing. It jumps back and forth in time, and I found it could have done a better job of explaining to the reader the politics in Norway at the time. That being said, I think the plot was intriguing and I found myself liking the character Harry Hole. I also felt like the ending left some things unfinished.
B00092ZL80|5.0|One of the greatest shows i've seen. The paring of these two legendary bands was a stroke of genius,the way they interact and harmonize you can see how much they enjoyed it.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Although I have followed Whitney Houston's career since her first big break, I never bought her records or had the pleasure of hearing her in person.  Nevertheless, I recognized her remarkable talent, admired her grace and dignity, and was concerned when she stumbled both personally and professionally.  \\"I Look to You\\" represents a mature and gifted Whitney that maybe can no longer sing with such flexibility in vocal range as she did in the past but she gave this collection of songs her all - singing from her heart and soul.  \\"I Look to You\\" and \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" gospel songs are two fine collections that I will fondly remember Whitney Houston by.
0525478817|3.0|TFiOS is good but far from great or genius. John is lucky to have a loyal, enthusiastic fan base. He is a great person who deserves it. The book reviews here, however, are biased. It was okay and I would recommend it if you are looking for a quick, easy novel to read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game really is one of the most fun apps I have! It barely even asks you to buy anything!

B000HL2D34|4.0|T'Pol faces her demons--in the flesh.<br /><br />*Semi-Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The Enterprise has entered a vast field of tumbling rocks which obviously don't obey any of Newton's laws, certainly not gravitation. Shuttles are launched to explore the rocks for a particular mineral and to board a Vulcan ship that is adrift among the rocks. The Vulcan ship contains the erstwhile crew mates of Sub-commander T'Pol as it was her latest posting before joining Archer's command.  Something has gone wrong, for the crew lives but doesn't seem willing to save themselves.  The away team including T'Pol finds the Vulcans in a disturbed, violent state and wholly incapable of reason.  The away team ventures deep into the Vulcan ship only to be overrun and cut off from their shuttle beyond reach of the transporter.  What can they do to help the crew?  What can they do to elude the deranged Vulcans in the meantime and prevent T'Pol from degenerating too?  T'Pol's character is not just pushed to the limit, it's warped and strung up.  FIND OUT!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|This book sort of disappointed me. I mean, it was a great read, but compared to the other two books in the trilogy, this one was kind of annoying. I didn't find myself aching to read it as soon as I got home. Definitely ready for August for The Kill Order to come out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|when you play the winning round sometimes you dont win. that is because in the game,you probably didn't move anything when it was supposed to move. sometimes, your card in the pile went on a match that might have a different match. I love this game a lot. I would recommend it to someone who knows how to play. I would consider playing the game on real cards first.
B004Z4LVZK|5.0|I'll be honest, at first, I HATED this book. I got so frustrated with the author for not giving more details in the beginning of the book. Then, halfway through the book, a light bulb went off in my head. This author is genius. He actually placed me in the story and had me feeling the same emotions as the main character, and I didn't even realize it! The things he does describe are very vivid and easy to picture. After reading this on my Kindle, I immediately purchased The Scorch Trials. Definitely recommend reading The Maze Runner!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome for everyone to play. it has a game for everyone. this game I a great family game
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The Scorch Trials was wonderful follow up to The Maze Runner. Now that you have a little bit more insight into what's happening, it's easier to follow and get wrapped up into the story. With every flip of the page, I empathised with Thomas, felt every emotion he felt.

B006AX6ONI|1.0|What we have here is a collection of old blog posts warmed over to make a so-called book. You must be kidding me. Just go to Cuban's blog and read everything for free.<br /><br />What is soooooo terrible is the writing. This is not writing--it is typing. A high school kid could write better than this. The reason that he looks so serious on the cover is that he is sad that he has to charge for this computer file called a book. Pleeese. What do you take us for fools?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this app but once your points get low, it gets tedious to try to replenish them by replaying games you've already beat. Yeah, you could just buy more points, but why pay for points on a free app?
B006UG90RM|4.0|Wow!  I grew up in the 80's and knew all of VH's music from day one and this album comes close to those first 6 albums.  Never was a big fan of the Hagar era.  I liked some of that music, but I didn't buy any of those CD's.  I may have missed something there, but in my opinion nothing comes close to the chemistry created with DLR at the helm.  Sure, he's not a great singer, but that's not what VH was ever about.  They were about attitude, great rock n roll, and the unmistakeable guitar work of Eddie Van Halen.  I liked this CD from the beginning and it continues to get better the more I listen. I don't know how long this reunion will last, but I am thankful that they made this record.  Classic VH!

Write secret UV messages to a coworker, classmate or friend. The led us a uv light that reveals the message.

B005LQ6UE8|5.0|I bought The Long Walk as a Kindle Daily deal for 99 cents but would have happily paid full price. The Long Walk is a gripping story of human endurance and the overcoming of seemingly hopeless adversities. It is a story that you walk intimately and emotionally with each character. You deeply feel their pain, their happiness, their triumphs and their losses. Is it a true story? I cannot say for sure but in the final analysis I think it does not really matter. It is the story and the emotions it stirs that really counts. Personally I am inclined to believe it but maybe that is just the romantic in me :) What I do know is that this is a wonderful book, a short read but a very compelling and fantastic one and definitely recommended!

1439102813|5.0|This isn't my usual book genre, but so many people had raved about it, that I thought I'd give it a try...and I'm glad I did! Genova's writing style is amazing. I find it hard to remember that it's fiction as it is highly believable. It was so gripping that I almost felt I was losing my mind while reading it - it was very easy to feel emotion for the narrator and her family.
B004X80QNG|2.0|after testing several calendar apps, I was ready to make this my default calendar app. as I started using this as my primary, I realized the sync with gmail is grossly inconsistent.<br /><br />why do weekly recurring events only show up some days? I verify the recurrence settings, set to end never. yet informant shows the last recurrence as two weeks ago.<br /><br />why do some events added (in gmail calendar on PC or on tablet informant app) show on both? others don't sync at all.
B004UID2LC|3.0|at first it worked but then it stop and to told me to cheek things out so I did and I still doesn't work :(
B002ZG98FU|1.0|This film is terrible. From the opening scene I was sympathizing with the characters who were being ugly to Rachel McAdam's character. I felt like being ugly to her , too!  She was trying to portray a character a la young Diane Keaton/Meg Ryan-type ingenue with spunky dithering cuteness, and it was intensely irritating.  With that cast it should have been an entertaining movie. But it wasn't. I don't think Rachel McAdams is that great an actress. But at least she was ok in \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". In this film she is annoying. Diane Keaton is not bad. Harrison Ford is doing some bizarre imitation of Darth Vader with laryngitis. Just unsatisfying in every way a movie can be unsatisfying. We weren't able to watch until the end.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is a bit too challenged for a ten year old and too much. things going on for me.

B00516ZWRE|5.0|Simply stated, this is one of Saxon's best efforts to date. Every song is superb here, no fillers. A nice nod to Deep Purple in the track When Doomsday Comes (sounds a bit like Perfect Strangers). This is just a fantastic release from these veteran musicians.

0316017930|5.0|Outliers is a must read for anyone who enjoys outside the box material. It certainly makes you think. After I finished it, I spoke for 2 hours with the friend who recommended it. I finished it in 2 days with a pencil in my hand so I could underline parts that I felt I had to remember. Even though Outliers is a stimulating, thought provoking work, you don't have to be a doctoral candidate in philosophy to understand what Gladwell is saying. He's not trying to show the reader how \\"deep\\" he can be, he just makes his points clearly & distinctly.<br />I'm going to buy his 2 other books, The Tipping Point & Blink just as fast as I can.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome best game I ever played in the whole intire world. I love it so much thanks for making it the best
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Title: Mockingjay<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />My Rating - 3.5-4 Stars<br /><br />I'd like to begin my review of Mockingjay by saying that I laughed my butt off when Liz Lemon of 30 Rock made a comment about sinking into Peeta Mellark's embrace -- his arms that 'smell like bread'.  Hilarious.  Nice to know that those of us reading YA who are not that Y ourselves are not alone.<br /><br />SPOILERS included.  Do not read if you've not read the book.  This is a late review, not a new release...<br /><br />GOOD STUFF<br />I have to give this book a 3.5 - 4 Stars for overall satisfaction.  It ends in the manner that it should and it wraps up all the loose ends nicely and believably.  Like the other books, the author is true to Katniss throughout.  It is clear that Katniss did not ever want to be a revolutionary, she just wanted to keep her little sister from harm as she began doing when her father died and her mother had a breakdown.  Throughout the entire story, this is Katniss' MO.  Even though she agrees to be the Mockingjay and serve as the symbol of the rebellion, she disobeys their orders and wishes as regularly as she does the Capitol's.  Neither faction can control her and she realizes that the rebel leader, President Coin is as much a danger to her as President Snow in the Capitol.  In the end, a great injustice is done to Katniss as her only mission fails and Prim is killed.  It is clear that Coin allowed her onto the battlefield.  What is unclear is whether it is Gale's trap that ends her life...or the Capitol's.  Unable to be certain, and sure that Coin and Gale are nearly as wrong as Snow, Katniss makes her choice at the execution and shoots Coin instead of Snow.  It is her last act as the Mockingjay.  The war is over, she  is pardoned and she returns to a newly rebuilding District 12 with Peeta, where they live out their lives with their children.<br /><br />Favorite Scenes<br />Katniss' visit to District 8 hospital and subsequent battle<br />Katniss sings The Hanging Tree to Pollux and the Mockingjays<br />Finnick and Annie's Wedding<br />Katniss and Peeta at peace, their love in balance, their children safe<br /><br />CRITICAL STUFF<br />After Catching Fire, I expected to be blown away by Mockingjay and for the first 60% of it, I really was impressed.  However, when they get to the invasion of the Capitol, I have to admit, she started to lose me.  The revisitation of the Hunger Games finally wore me down.  The idea that the center of the city would have hundreds of intensely diabolical booby traps seemed off to me.  Would those never have gone off in the course of everyday life and caused some type of disastrous accident?  I guess it's supposed to underscore how messed up Snow is, but it felt a little unrealistic somehow.  I also think it dragged.  My capacity to focus on yet another violent trap waned.  Also, she introduced the new character, Tigress, in the midst of this section and I found her hard to relate to as well.<br /><br />Media Stuff/Propos - I did get a little tired of Katniss being dressed up, made up, and followed around by cameras.  The whole media angle is interesting, but it may have been too much for me.  That being said, the single strongest moment in the entire book for me is when Katniss is filmed in District 8 after the bombing and declares, \\"IF WE BURN, YOU BURN WITH US!\\"  That gave me goosebumps.  Dead on!<br /><br />Gale - In this book Katniss and Gale connect more than they ever have (while conscious) in the previous books.  To me, it was the chance to finally understand this great love story...and then it seemed to fall apart before my eyes.  Though a handful of times Gale and Katniss share a kiss or engage in some act of kindness toward one another, the reality is that Gale chooses the rebellion over Katniss and she knows it.  She is shocked by his bloodlust, particularly when she gets to see it in action.  When she connects his double-bomb to Prim's death, she cannot unthink it andthe tenuous thread of their love is permanently severed.<br /><br />Peeta - Lots of bloggers took some issue with Peeta's 'hijacking'.  I actually found that compelling and believable.  It's like A Clockwork Orange...psychological conditioning is an old idea and she just took it to an extreme.  It worked because it forced Katniss to live without an utterly devoted Peeta and think about what that was like.  Though it's Finnick that points out that she obviously has some sort of love for Peeta, Katniss seems to be finally figuring that out for herself.  It was so obvious to me throughout that Peeta was going to recover and that Peeta was going to be 'The One'.  Who in the heck else could it have been?  He devoted his life (and nearly gave it over and over) to save her because he loved her, not because he had any agenda.  In fact, he is the only character in the entire thing that has no other agenda besides saving Katniss' life.  Everyone else manipulates her at some point.  In some ways, this even includes Prim, who pushes her to use her power as the Mockingjay.  The idea that Peeta would not be the One in the end was just never believable to me.<br /><br />Coin - The author never once gives Katniss any positive connection with Coin.  From the very first time she meets her, she dislikes the perfection of her hair and tension rules their relationship.  For this reason I never saw Coin's targeting of Katniss in the final scenes as much of a 'secret twist'.  Katniss knew Coin didn't like her, she just didn't realize Coin wanted her dead...but for the reader that is not a stretch.  Also, Katniss' decision to kill Coin in the end.  I saw that coming a mile away.  She knew that the others would kill Snow.  Everyone wanted to kill Snow.  But she thought that Coin arranged Prim's death and so she took her revenge.  That is one thing I do like, the fact that Katniss stuck to her love of Prim to the end.  Though she saw Coin as dangerous, Katniss has seen enough of humanity tohave decided that any leader could be or become evil.  That was not why she killed her.  She killed her because Coin killed Prim, period.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen - The Hunger Games Movie Poster<br />I loved Katniss, I loved the story.  I don't know how they will make these movies because the story is so incredibly violent, but I know I will be right there to see them.  For your enjoyment, I included this promotional movie poster for you.  Katniss is played by a relatively new talent in Jennifer Lawrence.  Good bye Bella Swan, Hello Katniss Everdeen...
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I sold this set after forcing myself through 5 episodes.  I really, really tried to be patient, but there were just one too many laughable lines of dialogue.<br /><br />Trust me, I am no prude and tend to watch the kinds of movies that can be pretty violent, profane, sexual, you name it.  But it's just so painfully obvious that this show puts 95% of its merits on the gore and sex scenes.  To be honest, that was really the only redeeming aspect for me - the visceral, primal satisfaction of being voyeurs to impossibly beautiful-looking people nail each other in multiple positions as well as witnessing the carnage of the gladiator pit.<br /><br />But I mean, seriously, how many times do they have to work the word \\"cock\\" in to every episode?  It just gets really lazy intellectually after a while.  I guess if you're a teenage boy, a testosterone-fueled older guy, or any guy or girl with a fetish for soft-core porn and graphic violence in the same setting, then you'll eat this up.  If you value story, character development, exposition, originality...forget it.<br /><br />I do give the creators, the network, and the ratings board kudos for upping the ante on what can be shown on premium cable (this stuff would be edited out of an R movie), because I think sometimes it fits to get realistic and visceral.  The problem with Spartacus is that it pins just about all its hopes on just that.
0062060562|4.0|Very well written and holds the reader's attention right to the end. Found, however that it was somewhat repetetive about halfway through. I wanted to shout to the author 'get on with it already'. But then I thought it was understandable given that the main character awakes each morning to find that she remembers absolutely nothing of what came before that very instant.<br /><br />All in all, the characters are real and the author presents them with all of their strengths and as importantly, flaws. A thoroughly enjoyable read, and much better technically than much of the fiction being offered today. Looking forward to her next effort!
B002ZG997C|1.0|I can't express how hideously violent, shockingly cruel, and stunningly wrong every moment of this film is. It belongs in the deepest part of the trash heap.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I don't really care if this book is fiction or fact.  Either way, it is an amazing read and would recommend it to any of my friends!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I thought that the actors should pay everyone who spent even a dime for this movie back.  If it was supposed to be some type of artistic look at life it was a complete bomb.  Anyone who gives this thing a rating more then one star is trying to sound as if they are above everyone elses level of understanding art.  This was CRAP without any redeeming value whatsoever.
B000FA675C|5.0|Read this book years ago and it is still to this day one of my favorites!!  It is a definite page-turner!

0525478817|5.0|I confess that I spent the last hundred or so pages of THE FAULT IN OUR STARS crying nearly nonstop. I'm hesitant to admit that, because it makes the novel sound sad, like a \\"cancer book.\\" And as narrator Hazel would say, \\"cancer books suck.\\"<br /><br />I wouldn't want to give the wrong impression of the book --- Hazel surely wouldn't want me to --- so let me assure you that although the novel is, at times, almost desperately sad (rightly so, I would say, given its subject matter), it's also lovely and hopeful and extremely funny. The reason I was crying nearly nonstop, after all, is that I had to pause my tears every now and then to laugh aloud.<br /><br />Even if this is emphatically not a cancer book (or at least not one of those cancer books), the specter of cancer haunts each of these characters' lives. As one puts it, \\"What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They're made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war...with a predetermined winner.\\"<br /><br />Hazel, for one, sees herself in some ways as living on borrowed time, ever since the Miracle, when she barely survived a cancer crisis and continued to live with the help of drugs and her ever-present oxygen tank. Her friend Isaac, who has already lost one eye to cancer and is in danger of losing the other, is engulfed in fear and anger over everything he's already lost and all he still has to survive.<br /><br />And then there's Augustus Waters, the boy Hazel starts to fall for in spite of herself, in spite of her heartfelt desire not to hurt anyone else the way she knows she'll destroy her parents when she dies. She keeps her distance from Augustus at first, or tries to, but Augustus --- with his endlessly questioning nature, his smart-aleck comments and fondness for metaphor, his muscular arms and amputated leg, his desire to make a mark on the world in as much time as he has allotted to him --- is able to find a way through Hazel's defenses. \\"Augustus Waters read to me while Mom, making lunch, listened in.... As he read, I fell in love with the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\\"<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus are nearly perfect together; like many John Green characters, they are nearly impossibly perceptive and witty, like the kinds of smart kids no one actually knew in high school but everyone wishes they did. In a typical cancer book, their insight and unvarnished way of looking at the world would be a noble side effect of cancer; in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, though, it's just part of who they are. Part of the novel's heartbreak is that readers will find themselves wishing for more time --- for Hazel and Augustus, with Hazel and Augustus --- just as the characters themselves do.<br /><br />John Green shatters expectations with this novel, turning assumptions about \\"tragic\\" books --- perhaps even about the idea of tragedy itself --- on their heads. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is painfully sad, for sure, and it pulls no punches in its often gruesome depictions of late-stage cancer. At some points, readers may even wonder why, if pain and love are so intertwined, we should bother falling in love at all. But, in true John Green fashion, even that question is answered, right at the book's close, in a character's own words that are tender and wise, hopeful and true, just like the novel itself.<br /><br />Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|Best movie of the series by far and possibly best movie ever.  Look at the ratings, either five star, loved it, or 1 star, haters.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is my 5th case for my iphone 4 (all others have either broken or lost). This has quickly become my favorite, and knocked the \\"Speck Pixel Skin HD[[ASIN:B003U4IN2U Speck Products PixelSkin HD TPU Case for iPhone 4 - Black]]\\" into second.  The two cases are very similar but the AmazonBasics case has better openings (see below for further description), and it is only $9!!!<br /><br />What I Like:<br /><br />1) The case is slim and fits very snugly. This makes putting it on a tad difficult, but it will not come off unless you want it to.  This also should make the case last longer as most of my other cases broke at weak points where the case tended to slip off when i pulled it from my pocket (My In Case \\"Snap Case\\" would even stay on the phone any more because the corners could no longer hold my phone).<br /><br />2) I love the TPU material.  It is hard enough to slide easily in and out of pockets, but soft enough to absorb impacts.  The material also comes up around the face well for extra protection.<br /><br />3) All openings for ports and functions are generously sized.  I have not met a headphone cable or 30 pin cable which doesn't fit with this case on.<br />The Volume and silence buttons are easy to use. I have large hands, and many other cases make the silence toggle nearly impossible for my fingers to use. The sleep switch is slightly less easy to reach but its not bad.<br /><br />4) PRICE! this thing has to be the best deal on the internet.<br /><br />Not so good:<br /><br />The sleep button is slightly difficult to push because the TPU material is high around the button<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1) Seeing as this case is only $9 there had to be compromise somewhere.  The edges/corners feel a little sharp like the material is fresh out of a mold.  I used a little sand paper to give it a cleaner feel. this leads to my second gripe:<br /><br />2) The outside of the case is glossy and shows fingerprints.  The TPU material doesn't scratch easily but the gloss still bothers me.  I'm going to try and lightly sand it to take off the sheen.  The inside of the case (the surface which touches your phone) is slightly texture/frosted. I wish they had applied this finish to the outside as well.<br /><br />Overall this is the best case for the money.  This case and the Speck pixel Skin HD are the only cases which combine good look, slim profile, and protection so well.gloss still bothers me.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I was very disappointed with the last book of the trilogy. It seemed to ramble on and on without a plot. The first two books were beyond \\"good\\". This was a total disappointment.

B00005ASHM|5.0|This collection is my time machine.  When listening I clearly recall the \\"where and with who\\" these songs bring back to memory.  These thoughtful lyrics and thoughtful harmonies are the best of the Beach Boys.....no goofy fillers or bubble-gum, just straight to the heart songs of being in love.  Forget all the hype about SMILE....Pet Sounds is the crowning achievement of the Beach Boys.  Surf's Up !
1612130283|5.0|How do I begin? This is a fantastic book. The relationship between the two main characters is so hot, both emotionally and physically, that it is a great read. You will not be able to put it down and you will need to read the next two in the series almost immediately. While is isn't going to win any literature awards, it is chick lit with a touch of erotica at its finest. Now if you can just find a hard copy to purchase.....my advice - it might be time for a kindle.

B0000630BT|5.0|Judas Priest is one of those bands that I've always liked, but never remembered to get a hold of their CD's...  Well, a recent sale on Amazon changed that for me.  I finally got around to buying this album, and the only bad part of the purchase is that it didn't happen YEARS sooner!  This CD has been in my CD player for weeks now.  It is hands down one of the best metal albums in my collection!  Every track is simply amazing.  It certainly sounds different from the Judas Priest that I was familiar with.  Here are some (in my opinion) standout tracks:<br /><br />Painkiller:  6 minutes of godly metal; complete with sweet-ass solos...  This was the perfect opening track.<br />Leather Rebel:  Very melodic and \\"proud.\\"<br />Nightcrawler:  Sounds a little closer to old-school Priest<br />Between the Hammer and Anvil:  An anthemic arena-rock song<br />A Touch of Evil:  Another anthemic track.  Very catchy bridge and chorus<br />One Shot at Glory:  Classic 80's metal sound.  Extremely catchy tune<br /><br />This album is a must-have for any metal fan!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was a wonderful dvd! My Sister purchased this after seeing it last week.  I will recommend it to all of my friends and family.

0142419400|5.0|It's been a long while since I've read a good YA novel.  Good thing I found this one!  I had actually wanted to read this when it came out, and was appearing on everyone's blogs, but I never got around to snagging a copy for my own.  But my last trip to the library, I was browsing the racks in the YA section, and there it was.  So I snagged it and just finished reading it today.  Let me just say up front: it was excellent!<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is about a girl named Anna who is sent to an American boarding school in Paris for her Senior year because her father thinks it's a good idea.  She's not overly fond of her father, and she hates the idea of attending school in Paris.  But it's too late, because her parents have made up their minds and have left her there to fend for herself.  Eventually though, everything changes, and Anna no longer hates Paris.  She has made new friends, even a new best friend, the handsome Étienne St. Clair.  There's betrayal and drama in Anna's life, of course.  There has to be some strife to make the story interesting, right?  But I did kind of see the betrayal coming, ever since that first phone call.  By the end of the novel, Anna is sad to be leaving Paris, but happy to be on her way to college.<br /><br />Whenever I read stories about boarding school, it makes me wish I was able to attend one.  And with this one being in Paris, I wish I could've gone to a school like that even more!  Anna got to explore Paris everyday while she was there.  The descriptions of everything was lovely, and I could really picture the setting, as she explored the city around her.  But of course, boarding school is probably not as fun as these novels make it out to be.<br /><br />Anyway, Stephanie Perkins writes the voice of a teenage girl really well!  I was able to relate to Anna, who became quite real to me, with everything that she felt for her friends, family, and the guys in her life.  If I met her in real life, I would totally be her friend.  Also, she's a great narrator.  However, she does have flaws, as do her close friends.  But that just makes this even more real to me.  And even though they have flaws, I must say that I totally love all the characters that were a part of Anna's circle of friends in Paris.  Especially Étienne.  I could just imagine him, speaking in his British accent. *swoon*  He's really very handsome the way I picture him, haha.  The author is totally right!  American girls LOVE hot boys with British accents.  Well, at least the American girls that I know (self included).  It just multiplies their sexy points by a million! lol.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book!  It was a cute, fun, quick, and easy read, that's also quite realistic.  It had me chuckling quite a bit.  I really like the author's writing style, and can't wait to read more of her work!  I think the fact that I want to read more from this author can speak for how good this book was! :)
B006M4RN3U|2.0|We Are Young got me excited. I listened to it again and again. It's a great song.<br /><br />None of the others on this album are. I really regret buying it - the autotune is embarrassing and so unnecessary given the high calibre of the lead singer's voice. All of the songs bar We Are Young are infected with a bit of it. Really repetitive, meaningless lyrics ruin what I can hear under the electronic distortion. I loved fun.'s first album so much, and this is such a massive disappointment - it feels gimmicky and rushed.

0553801473|5.0|What's with all the crying about this book? Most of these 1 or 2 star reviews are from fans who are just angry that it took GRRM 11 years to write the last 2 books. They are letting their anger over the wait and their anxiety that Martin will die before he finishes the series to bias their reviews of this book. I guarantee that if AFFC and ADWD had both come out by 2004 this book would be much more highly reviewed. My perspective is as a fan who discovered this series because of the TV show and read all five books during Summer 2011. I agree with many of the negative reviews of AFFC, mainly because I did not care about many of the characters that book focused on (seriously, who wanted to read 10+ Brianne chapters?!). That being said, I feel ADWD is on the same level of excellence as the first three books because:<br /><br />1. It brings back the characters that people actually care about.<br /><br />2. Although the haters won't admit it, it advances the story far more than AFFC did.<br /><br />3. TYRION FREAKING LANNISTER.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|This works great. I had the free version, and liked it so much I got the paid version just to support the developer.<br /><br />This gets the audio and video from my camera and lets me watch and listen to my foscam camera. works just fine as a baby monitor.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|If you could have a superpower, what would it be? That's a popular icebreaker question and you can tell a lot about a person by how they answer it. Though there are numerous answers, flight and x-ray vision are two that often come up. Often those who answer \\"flight\\" are those who are extremely altruistic while those that answer \\"x-ray vision\\" are usually very self-centered and conceited. The possibility of humans, particularly teenagers, gaining such abilities is the plot device that drives the movie CHRONICLE.<br /><br />The movie is a \\"found footage\\" movie; it's a movie that portends to be actual real video footage that has been edited together into a movie. In CHRONICLE high school senior Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan) has been a virtual nobody his entire high school life. His father is an alcoholic who beats him. His mother lies in bed, slowly dying from an unnamed disease. Her illness has increased Richard Detmer's (Michael Kelly) drinking and in turn the frequency of Andrew's beatings. Andrew only has a few more months until graduation and he's clinging to anything that will see him through until then; if he can graduate he knows he can escape. Andrew's only friend in the world is his cousin, Matt Garetty (Alex Russell). Matt and Andrew are in the same class, but Matt is a popular student. He's the guy all the guys want to be like. Matt does small things to try to get Andrew out of his shell and says hi to him at school, but that's about it. Andrew buys a video camera to begin taping his life and it becomes an outlet for him. One night, Matt brings Andrew along with him to a rave. While there, Matt and his friend Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan), who happens to be THE most popular student in the entire school, discover an underground cavern. They drag Andrew along with them to film what they have found. As it turns out the cavern ends up leading to a strange underground crystal and when they boys touch it their noses start to bleed and the Earth starts to shake.<br /><br />Weeks later, the three boys are best friends. They do everything together and it soon becomes clear why: there experiences in the cavern have bonded them and given them super human abilities. They seem to possess powers of telekinesis and impenetrable skin (forks and knives been when jabbed against their bodies). As the film progresses, the boys discover even more abilities. However, as they do so, they also begin to struggle with their own emotions and beliefs. Steve seems unchanged by what's happened to him, Matt begins to realize that he gave up his core beliefs to become popular, and Andrew struggles with an internal rage that threatens to consume him.<br /><br />I was surprised by how much I enjoyed CHRONICLE. I'm not a big fan of found-footage movies, for instance I hated THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and I thought the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was laughable. However, I did like CLOVERFIELD. CHRONICLE is more akin in tone and style to CLOVERFIELD with a touch of M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE thrown in for good measure. Until the latter part of the movie, CHRONICLE feels like film taken from a teenage outcast's personal camera. Andrew has a really difficult life. He uses his camera to show the world what he has to deal with: the beatings from his father, the bullying at school, his deep love and devotion towards his dying mother whom he can't do anything for, and the flippant way his cousin Matt treats him. As the movie progresses, the focus begins to change. Instead of being a chronicle of his life to show others his innocence, it becomes a chronicle of how Andrew changes and becomes the very thing he hates at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />The overall plot of the movie is fairly predictable, but for a smaller-budget picture the director did a remarkable job of making the special effects look realistic. Also, there's some really great writing in the movie; the script allows for some very solid character development as the movie progresses. The effects and script are helped by some great acting. If this wasn't a sci-fi/action-drama, Dane DeHaan would probably be nominated for a bunch of acting awards for his portrayal of Andrew. Also, notable are Michael B. Jordan and Ashley Hinshaw as Matt's girlfriend Casey Letter. These are some actors whose stars will soon be rising fast.<br /><br />Overall, even though CHRONICLE is a found footage movie, it avoids many of the pitfalls of those films and through some solid special effects, exceptional writing, and impressive acting, it makes one believe that not only can a man fly (at least in the movies), but forces one to think about what the consequences of having such powers might be.fects and script are helped by some great acting.

B0035V35PI|2.0|I'm being pretty generous with the 2 star rating.  To begin with the featured lead, Rain, has no chemistry what-so-ever with his co-star Naomi Harris.  That would have been helpful because none of the acting is.  Yes, of course there is some well choreographed stunt work but it isn't enough.  I think this movie was supposed to have some sort of graphic novel feel, but it played more like a video game given the massive amounts of blood squirting everywhere.  This just isn't very good.  There are better options out there for this genre.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer and the DTS HD Master Audio is very good.

B0062P332Y|2.0|This perfunctory action film opens in Mexico with a hit squad comprised of Jason Statham, Robert De Niro and Dominic Purcell taking out some high ranking guy in a limo.  We don't know who he is (politician?, drug lord?) but the scene closes when Danny (Statham) comes face to face with the young son of the guy he just killed.  I guess this is the critical point when Danny decides to retire.<br /><br />A year later in 1981, Danny has moved to Australia and taken up housekeeping with Anne (Yvonne Strahovski, TV's \\"Chuck\\").  She's gorgeous of course, but you wouldn't know it here.  She is pretty much wallpaper in a roomy cotton dress most of the time.  Danny must travel to Oman to rescue his friend Hunter (De Niro) who is being held by a sheik.  So here's the deal.  The sheik will release Hunter if Danny will fulfill Hunter's original job.  That is to kill 3 British SAS (Special Forces) officers that were responsible for killing the sheik's 3 sons during the conflicts in the late 1970's.  This is never clear when or why.  Just that they are dead and the Brits did it.<br /><br />But, these guys can't just be killed.  They must confess first and Danny must provide proof.  Danny gets his old buddy Davies (Purcell, the best thing in this movie) and another guy (Aden Young) to help out.  There's a $6 million reward if they pull it off plus the release of Hunter.  My head starts to hurt trying to figure out who is on which side.  Something about a double top secret SAS squad controlled by some old farts in suits.<br /><br />Somehow Clive Owen is involved as the main foe of Danny.  But then Spike (yes, that's Owen's character) is all for Queen and country.  Spike is also the only one who has a chance of beating Danny in hand to hand combat.  This movie is a convoluted mess.  Even with a stellar cast this film is just  a time waster.  Statham is as good as it gets in action adventure and Owen is always good.  But De Niro is miscast and is obviously here for a paycheck.  They are not the problem.  Based on true events, the entire concept is just an incoherent bore the way it is written.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc is sharp and clear.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is solid if not spectacular.  I was expecting a bit more for this type of movie. Special features are spare.  Some deleted scenes and not much else.e not the problem.
