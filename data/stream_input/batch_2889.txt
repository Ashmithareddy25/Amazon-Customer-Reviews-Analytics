B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing uno.  It is great for passing time when you have nothing to do.  Uno has great visuals and doesn't lag at all.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Well pleased with all aspects of this order. &#34;Tongue tied and twisted&#34; - just an earth bound mystery hits a chord with me..
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Such a simple song about everybody's favorite concept SEX. Very cool sound and lyrics have a good flow. We need more quality music like this!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I loved the book, it was funny and touching at the same time.  I loved the connection to the past, in terms of the present.<br /><br />I felt a connection especially because I just visited my 101 year old aunt, who is in a nursing home.  I remember her as taking care of everyone, so full of humor and so full of life.  It is sad to see her old.  Even in her 90's she was full of life and worried about how her hair looked.  All her family and friends that she grew up with have passed.  When I see her, it is hard to reconcile her with the Aunt that I knew and loved.  She is nothing like her anymore age has taken away her youth and vigor.  I certainly identified with a major component of the plot- that people who are very old, have had wonderful brilliant pasts.... even though age has taken away their vigor.<br /><br />This book was a wonderful fun book full of laughs and events that make us look more into our own lives.  I loved the connection to the past and the discoveries that the protagonist makes.  The path that the characters take and their growth is also very well done, and balanced- not preachy.  I was disappointed that the book came to an end.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|u should keep in mind that this set is for MINECRAFT fans like me i just keep it on my night stand for display i love the steve and creeper u can also build 1 more steve  with the extra face peices

B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I have all these HO games and I love every one of them.  They are fun and they are  not to difficult. If you want to play this game I recommend starting with HO Quest 1. You will not regret it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I read the hit first and thought what great book,doesn't get much better. Than I read The Innocent and was blown away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is the great app for it. It is also an action game . I'm in love with it. Especially petting horse
B004SBULWE|5.0|Amazing! Closes everything with the click of a button. You should make widget customizable (plz update!) &infin; Every Android should have this!!!!
B000SEFNMS|2.0|As much as I would like to say I liked the book. I didn't. It's  certainly entertaining, but I see this young man as someone with a lack of common sense.<br />The fatal end could have been foreseen. He was no Thoreau. He did was not a gifted or doing anything with a superior purpose, but rather a foolish young man without guidance and prior preparation.<br />I's true that he stood for his believes, but was silly from his side to think he could accomplish such idea of going to the woods totally unprepared.
B005XN0SGU|4.0|I had a little trouble getting my files together into a folder for PV to find; had to do that with the Kindle connected to my PC. But once I did that it worked very well. I like the fact that there's a PDF plugin, because I already had some PDF comics and text-oriented books I wanted to be able to read. This way they're all on the PV bookshelf, and they all read just as easily as the comics files.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Great character development. This story made me think about the role of values, family, marriage, motherhood, and ethic decisions from your past that can follow you into your current life. There are three story lines that merge into each other. Very cleverly written, thought provoking and enjoyable to read!
1601251831|5.0|I've been very happy with all the Pathfinder resources that I've purchased. The books seem sturdy. The artwork is good. The content is good. The presentation of the material in this book is very good. Flipping through the pages made me remember looking through the original monster manuals when I first got those in the 80s. Good stuff.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|Forget the Netflix remake. It may be ok and I lover Kevin Spacey but...<br />This is the original and it's the original UK version, not the US cut!!!!  A tour-de-force for Ian Richardson.<br />The picture quality is fantastic; but, I'm no expert.<br />Also, I got it on sale for only $20.00!!!!!!!!!!!
1601251505|5.0|If you're looking at this review, chances are you've already read a dozen or more other 5-star reviews. Stop fooling yourself. You know you're going to buy this, so you might as well move it to your cart already and click Buy. I don't imagine people stumble upon Pathfinder products without already having some experience with D&D and perhaps a bad experience with 4th edition D&D. As many have said before me, this is what 4th edition should have been. This is a well-thought-out edition that will enhance your game, especially if you're looking to start a new one. So just stop with the pretend shopping, and equivocating, on whether or not you're going to buy this or not, and do it. You know you want to! I'm just telling you what you already know.
B008469DGY|3.0|There's not much to this game, unfortunately, which is my only complaint about it. The gameplay is flawless, the learning curve is flexible, and the controls are fair and responsive. The only problem is that the game never really goes beyond what you learn in the tutorial. There is little variety.<br /><br />All you do is flick the ball toward the hole and then swipe quickly to curve it toward the hole. It's a very fun game, don't get me wrong. I do like it. But I just don't see myself keeping it for very long because the gameplay is so simplistic. You never actually play a golf course. You never have to curve around an obstacle. You just flick the ball at the hole over and over again.<br /><br />As a side note, the signs in the game have some unfortunate kerning. \\"Flick\\" looks like a different word entirely. i found this pretty amusing, hopefully nobody gets offended.
1601253788|4.0|I've been very happy with all the Pathfinder resources that I've purchased. The books seem sturdy. The artwork is good. The content is good. I have a small problem with the monsters they chose to add in the follow-up Bestiaries. I don't think most DMs are going to find uses for them unless characters are doing LOTS of planar travel or higher-end adventures.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I play it over and over. Sometimes I think I will just watch the first 20 minutes or just the first 40 minutes, but I end up watching all the way through the credits every time.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a great movie with A-list celebrities doing the voices.  What I really enjoy is the music: AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Guns n' Roses.  I get to share the music I love with my kids.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Patrick does a great job of acting the part and one feels as though one is in the scene.  The backbiting and baiting leaves one wondering if that goes on in the big law firms.
0756655307|5.0|I originally bought this for my son, but after flipping though it for a while, I might keep it for myself!  Great artwork from past and current artists covering (what seems like) all major and minor characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game on my phone and play it whenever I'm waiting for someone or something.  This is a game I also will play before bed some times to relax me for slumber.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Adam Johnson deserves the Pulitzer Prize for his intense, eye-opening and extremely well-written novel.  Through his eyes, we gain knowledge and insights into North Korea that are alarming and painful, yes, but he writes of atrocity with an amazingly tender touch - from the first page, I could not put his book down.  I will recommend it to everyone I know.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is a relaxing game I like to play before going to bed.  It gets my mind off of the day's activities so I unwind and am ready for sleep after I've won a few games.  I do kind of get addicted to playing and sometimes play too long but it is one of my simple pleasures.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The book moves more slowly than the first two because it lays the groundwork for our heroine to be vindicated.  It is a peek into not only the Swedish government but all governments when they become so huge the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  There is tension throughout the book as it moves to its inevitable conclusion.  A hard book to put down.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This was a very contemporary sweet film about good people. Rare for this day and age of very BAD movies.
B004UID2LC|4.0|i chose 4 because it shuts down on me all the time and viewing it only you can only hear and not see it
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I like Gary Oldman's acting.  Have for many years.  It's good to see him in a film as the good guy for a change.  I would like to see more.  Don't like Batman movies too much so don't see him there.
0061950726|3.0|This could have been a better book, even a riveting book focused on contrasting today's foster care system with yesteryear's orphan train.  We all know that children in those systems were abused, but occasional success stories do exist, nothing new there.  This book is about two flat, underdeveloped characters abused by the system who find happy, but unrealistic, endings to their stories.  For instance, one character finds her long lost love and even her long lost sister's family and will die a rich old woman. Another character who has been in and out of school systems while in foster care, suddenly becomes an A student, who when she runs away, packs her clothes and her own lap top computer and her own cell phone, and of course, she has a supportive, stable boyfriend who believes in her.  Mean foster mother and all, this was too predictable and boring for me to enjoy.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I don't know of any film I have seen that you know what the ending will be and  keeps you absolutely glued to see what happens next in the story.  Good work Ben Affleck.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|A little disappointed that Smaug wasn't prominent but will be in the final part.. That's the movie of course, as far as the price and the quick delivery without damage.. this was excellent.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I loved this! Everything about this was just cool! So much of the music I grew up with was made in this place so I really got into the narrative. Dave hit the bullseye!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is good. People who want instant gratification will get some, but patience is necessary. Friends are a must in this game. They will help a lot.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|We can not wait until next years season is available.  This is a great show we really have enjoyed watching it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love this! Wish there were more ways to stream right now, but they will come eventually.<br /><br />The Chrome-mirroring is slightly laggish. Even with the settings turned up all the way and an expensive router, this does not work very well. The screen is very choppy and does not update that quickly. Note that I admit I am using my wireless laptop to the wireless Chromecast, but if I am able to stream a 18Gb movie from my wireless desktop to my wireless laptop onto my projector, I think I should be able to cast a screen from my laptop to my Chromecast. Until this is optimized this is almost useless to watch videos off of. Website, sure.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I had this on my iPhone before I stupidly switched to android. It worked and looked better on the iPhone. This version is just ugly and unimpressive.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|This film is visually stunning in many respects.  The dialog and story is also quite unusual and intriguing to follow.  The acting ranges from excellent to silly as the story veers off course into sidelines that were not necessary.  Many complain about the length of this movie.  If the film had stayed close to the main stiry line, it would have been completed within a timeframe that viewers appreciate more.  The dialog is slow and delivered with timely deliberation interspersed with the background music that precisely sets the mood.  Some may not appreciate this style as it allows the viewer to savor every word.  That is an unusual quality with current films that usually keep action and dialog moving at a fast pace.  The subject matter requires this slower pace to ponder the situation and fully appreciate the circumstances.  The movie is uneven in parts where it shifts from highly personal and intimate exchanges to contrived business settings that seem like they belonged in a TV show.  I loved this film, but cringe during the cheesey parts that should have been left on the cutting room floor.
B005V20JKI|1.0|the latest update has removed progress in order to milk players for all their worth.  why should an update put previously unlocked progress behind a pay wall?  terrible terrible terrible...
B000002WPH|3.0|This is the album that got me into hip hop. I love every last song. I also love vinyl pressings of my favorite albums because of the crisp audio quality they offer. This is simply a sub-par pressing. The mix seems off and all of the snare hits on the album become very annoying over the course of almost every song.  This is not something I noticed when listening to the album on mp3 or cd. I have listened to other hip hop on vinyl and none of the others did this. I don't regret the purchase, I just wish the pressing was better. I am not an audiophile, just a hip hop fan that was slightly disappointed with the sound quality.
0143113100|5.0|An interesting and informative book on the plasticity of the brain.  Well written and engaging, it is an encouraging account featuring personal stories that attest to the ability of the brain to compensate for functions that have been damaged in some way.  It goes against the view held for many years that the brain and the neurons within it are incapable of growth and renewal.  I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone interested in how the brain functions.
0762777931|5.0|Reading this book for the third time! It's not just a diet it's a way of thinking, a way of life, it is so inspirational, I LOVE IT! A must read on your journey of health and happiness!!

B009FZFONO|5.0|What I loved about Season 3 of THE WALKING DEAD is that it constantly raises questions for the audience of 'what would I do?' and the more important question, 'what should I do?'  Where else can you find a class of a hero and a villain in a power struggle with so many minute-to-minute ethical issues raise -- against an infinite sea of walkers/zombie who are not good or evil, but before in what we think of as evil -- and these walkers are our friends, neighbors, and family, with a disease that is not their fault? And this is not a talking heads, round table dry discussion of right and wrong -- it is incredibly compelling storytelling, where danger is literally around every corner.  Even going shopping? The most mundane of errands in our real life becomes high adventure and sudden attack in the world of THE WALKING DEAD.  I love this show, and I love the dimensionality given all the characters including the villainous ones.  I won an Emmy in 1991 as a writer-producer on L.A. LAW and we had trouble getting a story filmed and edited with just lawyers in rooms talking. How they do it on THE WALKING DEAD, these production values? Amazing. John Hill
B0087YYHZU|4.0|Gene Kelley, Donald O'connor, and Debbie Reynolds make a great team. Singing and Dancing their way into the hearts of everyone. Throw in a love story and you have a winner.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love all the different tiles in this game.  Doesn't get boring and the levels keep on going up instead of being a dead end.
B008476HBM|5.0|A timeless classic everyone should read!  Wanted to read it for awhile.  Glad I did. I like Jane Austen's books.
B003RNZFRK|5.0|Very catchy music with a feel-good vibe that will brighten anyone's day. Very fun to listen to. Would recommend to anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|For what it does, it does reasonably well and at $35 it is cheap.  Hence the 3 stars vs. 2 or 2.5.<br />That said, for what it doesn't do, and there is a lot, it leaves me a bit cold.<br />From the right up I had the impression that I could stream videos on my devices, so far, no.  It is limited to Netflix, Youtube and well that is about it.  I have Apple devices (iPad and iPhone) so I cannot attest to the streaming from the Chrome browser, or for that matter Google Play.<br />I find it very humorous that this thing was pushed hard on Amazon but does not support the Amazon streaming service, though I do not know why it really should as despite Amazon's claim that it wants to be a player in streaming media, the number of services that support Amazon's streaming service to those that do not are roughly akin to the number of far-right Republicans you find in the overall population of the Burning Man Festival.  I digress.<br />I  believe the device would be significantly improved it supported not just the limited services above but also worked with your home network to stream your other media, either resident on the network or via other services.
B008469DGY|4.0|Love this game from the start of the first course. The graphics in this game are beautiful and challenging. Definitely a game I will enjoy playing for quite sometime. I would have given five stars, but your finger does get tired after awhile from all the flicking.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|The David Tenant specials remain some of my favorite Doctor Whos, well written, self contained adventures that caught the essence of Tenant's take on the character.
B00B9366VO|4.0|The list of people who recorded in this hole-in-the-wall recording studio is amazingly diverse - from Buckingham and Nicks to Kurt Cobain with Neil Young thrown in for good measure. The sound board gets rescued when the studio shuts down and goes on to live a new life recording still more famous artists. A bit long but interesting.

1573229725|5.0|I just finished reading the copy I got from the library. This book was awesome. I loved the story between Maud and Sue. Also that it has both their points of view. It added more dimensions than having it from one single point of view. I have seen the BBC Series, but I was still shocked with the twists in the plot. I have never read her books, but I think I will read some more of hers in the future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy on eyes, easy to play, I am having fun with it. You can choose winning deals or random deals. What else do you need?
B007XF4J66|3.0|Great classic movie. The picture is great. But the audio is not as clean. I'm somewhat disappointed in the sound quality.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a wonderful story about a cat that changed a life.  The book is written in an easy-to-read way.  I finished the entire book in just a couple of days--I just couldn't put it down.  This really is a great story that any cat-lover or animal-lover is sure to enjoy.
B0095P31L6|2.0|I  was disappointed  that there was a bit of off color language add I watched this with my kids.  nit a single swear words of any level belongs in a G  rated kids movie.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|This is a great app for your next camping trip or just an evening in the backyard with the kids or friends.  You can even use the app indoors and can see parts of the sky obscured by clouds on your screen.  Gives locations of satellites too so you know what's up there.  Used this one on my summer vacation in northern Wisconsin and it was a big hit with friends.

B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I consider myself a kindle fire power User. I have not, however, seen any drastic performance enhancement since using this. It do appear to do what is says it will do and maybe that's good enough. I gave it four stars because it is stable and it has a decent uninstall feature.
0439023521|5.0|Book one in the Hunger Games Trilogy, by bestselling young adult author Suzanne Collins, introduces Katniss Everdeen, who, although only 16, has survived and taken care of her mother and beloved sister, Prim - for the five years since her father was blown up in a mine - by hunting illegally with her best friend Gale.  In this fantasy thriller, set in the country of Panem, which is located where North America had been before it was destroyed, Katniss lives in District 12, where Appalachia once was, where coal is mined, and where most of the residents are among the poorest of the entire country.  There were once 13 districts, but District 13 staged a revolt against the Capital and was destroyed.<br /><br />To remind the residents of the power of the Capital and the danger of revolting against them, they hold annually what is known as \\"The Hunger Games,\\" where two children between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district, a girl and a boy, are sent as tributes to fight to the death until one victor is named.  The Capital treats it as a holiday, shows the cruel \\"games\\" on television, and generally makes a celebration of showing that they can take the resident's precious children and nothing can be done about it.  Everyone is required to be in the square at 2:00 on the day of what is called \\"the reaping,\\" where the names of the tributes are drawn.  Unfortunately, Katniss' little sister, 12 year old Prim's, name is drawn, so Katniss volunteers to be the tribute rather than to let her little sister go to her death.  The other tribute will be Peeta Mellark, the baker's son.<br /><br />After being allowed to say goodbye to family and friends, the tributes are transported by train to The Capital, where they are wined and dined (more rich and delicious food than Katniss has ever seen in her life), as well as presented to the country after being groomed by stylists.  Katniss and Peeta have great stylists and make a debut with costumes that appear to be on fire; they draw the attention of the country, but aren't favored to win since there are \\"career tributes\\" who have been training all of their lives to compete.  Afterwards, they go to training with the tributes from the other districts where they learn survival skills.  Once the games start, it is a fight to the death for the kids; the suspense is unnerving, and it is very difficult to put the book down until the surprise ending is revealed.  Both Katniss and Peeta know that there can be only one victor, and even though they are from the same district, they don't want to become friends since one of them may have to kill the other if one of the other tributes doesn't do it first.<br /><br />It's no wonder that this book was made into a movie after hitting the bestseller lists; although it was written for young adults, The Hunger Games mesmerized both young adults and adults alike.  Anyone who hasn't read the book has cheated himself out of a great reading experience.  The subject matter of the book is difficult, and it's not easy to read about likeable characters who are starving, and in peril trying to stay alive.  However, Collins handles it well, with innuendo of violence rather than blatant graphic violence throughout the novel.  The underlying issues of corrupt government power, cruelty, greed, true friendship, importance of family ties, and loyalty are evident in this novel, and when finished it is one that is not easily forgotten.  Obviously the subject matter is not for young children, and some of the incidents during the games could cause a few nightmares.  However, The Hunger Games and the two subsequent books are absolute must-reads.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.tention of the country, but aren't favored to win since there are \\"career tributes\\" who have been training all of their lives to compete.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids age 3 and 9 love this game as much as i do......maybe more!  It's so addicting and they love trying to beat all the challenges.  Great game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like to look for games to interest my older children (10-12) and this one is perfect. Calm thinking game. Plays easily, not asking for additional purchases, I like it!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I love this game.  My kids think it's hilarious when the critters fall off the coaster.  I'm totally hooked trying to make the trains as long as possible AND not loose anybody.  Even my 9 year old son enjoys this game.  Love it!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I really liked the movie. I read the book first and was excited to see the movie. I thought the movie stayed very true to the book, there were a few differences but for the most part it followed the same story line. I'm a visual person so i'm glad I saw the island and could piece it together.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is an exciting adventure that is better than the film version. There is far more details than the film makers could have put into the movie version. I agree with Mr. Brown's thoughts about how symbols can change over time.
B003YYKPMM|5.0|What mind created this is certainly my first thought. It's like being that fly on the wall of a bizarre motel on the outskirts of Las Vegas. International mystery, magic, sensual art, quirky comedy.....and slow so slow which in a movie is usually something said in a negative way but this is the best exception to that rule I've ever seen. So full of wonderful characters just living life, nothing special but oh so special. One of my very favorite movies of all time.
1587143879|4.0|It's Awesome! I am currently at chapter 8 and am actually getting it.<br />I'll tell you more when am finish.<br />Good job.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the classic, iconic version of Pride and Prejudice...the one by which all others are measured, even the original with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. (Sorry, Larry. You can't compare to Colin).  It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I am very happy to have it in my DVD  collection.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love the battery app for the KindleFire. It shows how much battery (time and percentage) is left to use or when charging how much is done toward the full charge.
B006PAV1XO|2.0|The main character was a little unrelateable and the plot was subpar for a modern film. I can see how it could be a good movie for a certain demographic, just not mine.

0061692042|5.0|For the Parsons family everything began not with a crime, but one crime has forever changed their lives. Dell Parsons was a 15-year-old boy at the time when major events of the book happened. He remembers every detail of the events of that summer, when he is already 65 years old.<br /><br />From the first page the narrator tells us what has turned his life and the lives of his twin sister and his parents upside down. Della's parents, Bev and Neeva, robbed a bank, although, according to Dell, they were probably the last people on earth, of whom one might have thought that they would be armed robbers.<br /><br />Della's father, Bev Parsons, was a military pilot, participated in the Second World War, and after 1945 was transferred to a desk work, in the rank of captain. Della's mother, Neeva, was the daughter of Polish immigrants, a teacher with a Jewish appearance. Together with two children twins Parsons did not stay anywhere for long. They lived in small towns, where military bases were located, and where he Bev served. The family was so used to wandering, and that no one really thought that they would settle in one place.<br /><br />Dell's sister, Berner, was the opposite of his brother. She was taller that him, with boyish good looks, intelligence and self-willed. They never had friends; they were friends only among themselves. The family stopped in the town Great Falls in 1956, where they lived until the spring of 1960, when the central events of the novel happened.<br /><br />This is a great book, not crumbling under its own weight. Richard Ford paints his picture slowly, but the main part is known from the beginning - an armed robbery would be committed, and will forever change the lives of one family. Thus, here is more important \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" rather than \\"what will happen next.\\" Details, that is what matters, and Ford is just a master of details. The protagonist Dell recalls the smallest details of that fateful summer, with such precision and certainty, asif it was he who kept a diary, not his mother.<br /><br />The narrative about the past from the present results here for a stunning effect. 15-year-old boy at the time knew nothing, understood nothing and didn't know what to think. This ignorance is what Ford transfers matsrefully. But at the same time telling the story, as a 65-year-old man, the protagonist knows the causes and consequences and adds in the narrative a judgment from adult's point of view. What then seemed a trifle, and there wasn't obvious, 50 years later it is quite obvious. So, uncomplicated adolescent mind is clouded with doubts and regrets of an elderly person. At the same time, 65-year-old Dell does not allow sentimentality and anger in his story. He does not play the game \\"what if ...\\". There is no if, for all that had happened, it is already happened. Dell has never been the kind of person that changed his own fate.<br /><br />Looking at Dell and his sister, we can easily view the differences between them. She is more experienced, close to the living, sentient life, but not tending to the material side of life. Dell is a much more passive, obedient (in response to his father, he always calls him \\"sir\\"), he is interested in bees and chess, those things, which are unlikely to ever be useful to him in life. When after his sister's escape he is still waiting for a mother's friend, he has no hope for the best; he just gives himself to the discretion of fate. However, in the final part, we see that no matter how different are brother and sister, how they seem dissimilar, their fate is about the same. According to Ford, the fate is God, from whom there is no escape. We try, wrote Ford in the final sentence. We try, but all happens how it's needed to the fate. We can only try. It's ineresting to see that neither Dell nor his sister had any children. Childhood trauma has left its mark. Brother and sister did not take responsibility for future generations.<br /><br />Ford chose such method of storytelling that allowed him to reveal the possible motives of his characters. The author first describes an episode from the point of view of 15-year-old Dell, so much remains a mystery in each episode. And almost immediately, Ford once again describes the same scene, already with all the details that the 15-year-old boy could not have known. This structure keep a reader always in tension (the main thing here is motive, detail, depth of style), and gives the author place to think about fate.<br /><br />Canada in the novel is a kind of metaphor. Dell's escape was against his will, Remlinger's escape was a conscious choice. But they both are the same people as they were before Canada. \\"Canada\\" is a state of mind, an internal runaway. But on whatever side of the border a person stands, he remains what he was. People do not change because they do not govern themselves. They are in the hands of fate.<br /><br />This story is so emotionally gripping that it is hard to imagine anything more perfect. Ford actually had given the name \\"Canada\\" to hitherto not named state of the soul, and for this we should be grateful to him.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have used the calendar from Fliq on my Kindle, but would have to buy a ;piece of software to sync with my PC, so I decided to try the Google calendar.  It was very easy to set up and figure out and it syncs quickly.  I like being able to &#34;forward&#34; it to family as well.<br /><br />I expect to print pout the monthly calendar instead of buying one for next year.  This is my only complaint--- it prints out using  a pale font when I do it in color.  I will try black and white next time in hopes that it will be easier to read on the fridge.

B001GXF2YY|5.0|This novel starts out with the murder of a very controversial black attorney, whose main target in the courts just happens to be the LAPD. Harry and his crew are brought in to solve the crime, which puts him in to investigating an old partner, and partnering with a long time IAD adversary. As is that isn't enough, his home life is falling apart.<br />The novel is non stop in the suspense department, with unpredictable and disturbing outcomes. Another great novel in the Bosch series, that won't disappoint fans.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|i was having trouble with heat on my new 2.8 dual core upgrade so i decided after reading some reviews cooler master<br />212 plus so i gave it a try after reading the instructions and watching some tutorials on youtube i gave it a whirl and the product<br />ruined my motherboard . quite litterally i had to buy a new motherboard and a processor. i found a used motherboard which cost<br />$70 and and put my old 2.2 cpu back in, my new one was 60 sent from hong kong so all in all im out $130 and no help from cooler master to replace my money . the instructions givin are not complete before mounting the heatsink reinstall the motherboard so it wont flex as much or when you see thermal paste oozing on each side do not tighten anymore . so no i do not recommend this product. i suggest you to use something else.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Even if you are not an Eagles fan, you will thoroughly enjoy watching the history of this band. Spectacular footage, some of which is 40 years old.  If you are a baby-boomer and grew up in the 60's and 70's, the Eagles will take you on journey back through time. And if you happen to be an Eagles fan, sit down, buckle up, for you are in for an incredible ride!The people who put this together put a lot of time, thought and love into it.  I always loved the Eagles' music, but now I have much more respect and admiration for Don Henley and Glen Frey!  I have watched the DVD set twice now, and will watch it over and over again. I have recommended that my son, who is a musician, watch and learn from the hard lessons the Eagles learned over time.  The story, the film, the personal comments, are all impeccably put together. Absolutely a masterpiece!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This Season of Downton Abbley had many twists and changes.  1 cannot wait to see what Season 4 will bring.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|Even though I've heard many of the songs from this album over the past 18 months, this is the first time since Depeche Mode's 'Violator' that I've listened to a new release from beginning to end about 20 times without skipping a single song.  This is a truly amazing album.  The vocal layering, the instrumentation, the timing, and the flow is all perfect.<br /><br />I think we are witnessing the start of a brilliant career for this band.  Even though they have been buzzing in the indie scene for quite a while, the excitement is still there.  If you are a fan of great vocalists, you WILL love this album.  Dan Smith leads this group with foresight and savvy, and his last name even hints at some irony.<br /><br />Buy this album, put on your headphones and get lost for a good hour.  Just make sure you have time to do it all again, immediately.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you liked Temple Run, you'll LOVE Subway Surfers! Since this game has more depth than Temple Run (it takes longer to unlock all characters, but it's TOTALLY worth it), you will definitely be coming back for more! In fact, why am I writing this review when I could be playing Subway Surfers right now? You MUST get this game - it's worth every minute of play time! Oh, and one more thing: the in-app purchases could be cheaper. Thanks for such a great app. But for now, goodbye. I'm gonna go back to Subway Surfers now, since I'm done typing this review. *grabs Kindle Fire and leaves*

B004IDG97S|5.0|Great classic film! Better story line than the new one. At least we get to see the judges faces. Special effects are not as corny as other movie of the se time frame.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is an exceptionally entertaining TV series. Great drama with Perry Mason endings. Be sure to watch the previous seasons first.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love this app because it is utterly simple to use unlike some calculators, you click a button and then 74%8493002;#83:!;39. It's a free and a very good app.
B00CNEVHMG|2.0|If you're going to go to the trouble to remaster for SACD, you'd think you could do a better job. What a disappointment! This is a great Yes album but the SACD is not worth the bucks. It sounds like it was mixed on a cassette.
0452295548|5.0|I got this book after my disables daughter's second stroke.  It is very informational.  I recommend for everyone, either for themselves or like myself for a loved one.
0316201545|5.0|I've read all of his books and watched the movie he wrote and everything is just as amazing, if not more so than the last. The prequel to this got my sister to like reading, and she has dyslexia and ADHD but she was able to not only concentrate, but vividly picture the story in her head.

B004ADF7RO|2.0|Would be rated PG-13 if released today.  I thought since it was PG I could show it to my 8 year old, but we turned it off after only 10 minutes due to frequent obscenities and a reference to &#34;sexual torture devices&#34;.

B00846REIS|5.0|pretty fast read, kept you hanging in never knowing where the author would take you next, I would recommend it.
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|This would be a great game, but you are able to play up to level 24 and then the game goes haywire.  What am I referring to, the levels stop loading!  When you lose the level it will ask you if you want to restart the same level or quit.  If you happen to choose to restart the level it won't reload. It will try to reload the level and then you get a blank board and then it takes you back to the screen that ask you if you want to restart or quit.  Sometimes it will reload after several attempts.  I was able to get as high as level 29, and it won't even rel<br />oad.  This from my Kindle Fire.  What a bummer! Fix these problems and you get 5 stars the game and the makers deserve it.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I have a free version of business calendar on my phone.  One reason I love it is because i can copy appointments to different dates and not have to retype everything week to week.  Just a couple of clicks and it is done!  I dont see that on this calendar.  Im going to continue to check it out but honestly see where anyone would ever pay 9.99 for this.  I just dont see any great advantages of this calendar versus other calendars.

B00CO8D3G4|2.0|This is the first book I read for James Altucher. I was influenced by the extremely positive reviews and rating here so I bough the book. First of all I found tips and advices included in this book are very shallow and pretty common seance I found nothing original, new nor unique about it.<br />Second and most important: this book has nothing to do with Entrepreneurship at all I wonder how Amazon listed it in such category!! I can hardly classify it under motivational books but it has nothing to do with business at all.<br /><br />If you wonder how this book got all those wonderful reviews you should read what James wrote on page 133: \\"I've sold my books on Kindle for almost nothing. I've given away books for free to people who showed up at my talks or signed up for my newsletter. Does that sound stupid? Maybe. But it got my name out there. I've now given out more than one hundred thousand copies of my books, on top of the sales. This will have lifelong effects for me. I feel them every day.\\"<br /><br />Conclusion: If you already read other 2 - 3 motivational books. buy this one, you will find nothing new.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|great tv show, i love it, I'm totally addicted to it. I wish the season lastEd longer. I can't wait for next season
B004J09ONG|5.0|I was looking for something my 5 yrs daughter could also watch ... she LOVES lions and all kind of animals... but she gets very touched and she scared easily... this movie was PERFECT.<br />Good story... True story... helps to teach how to respect animals...<br />We watched it few times!
B002RI9X8S|5.0|really appreciated my warm bed and lovely stocked kitchen after reading this!!  What a hard life some people have had to live and even sadder to think how they were treated. a great reflection on  the times and hopefully in reading we can learn to be more compassionate to those less fortunate.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Oh man, I was so let down by this book.  Really enjoyed the third book, but nothing happens in the fourth.  There is nearly no plot development and nearly all the characters are completely one dimensional and the writing is dry and boring.  Don't want to give anything away (though there is little to give away), but just so disappointing.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I could not find this movie anywhere locally and am very pleased with the DVD.  I love this movie and it has great graphics.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|So I'm a big fan if happily ever after so I was a little pissed when they threw that curveball on the last episode. Other then that it was pretty good. If you watch the whole season in a couple days like I did There's some continuity problems with the way Castle acts throughout the season but that's TV. If your a Castle fan you'll enjoy this season. Plus Beckett is smoking hot this season.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show is fast passed and a lot of fun. I am looking forward to season 3 being available with prime!

B00E3VTR1K|3.0|Galactic Energies is a collection of science fiction short stories, many of which have themes related to modern communications technology. This is the English translation of an Italian original.<br /><br />I always find reviewing collections of short stories difficult because, inevitably, the reader will like some more than others. I might also add that I think writing a good short story is very difficult. The stories I enjoyed most were `Rewind' and `Maciste'. For me, these had the most interesting plot twists. `Kingdom of Turlis' I found somewhat messy and incoherent, although it had some interesting moments. `Life in Prison' I was enjoying, but I was disappointed with the ending. `Forms of Love' I did not find particularly imaginative or original. `Lactodectus Mactans' had potential, but didn't quite reach it. `Arcot and the Queen' didn't really engage me. `Perfect Family' was quite good, but could have been so much punchier. `Clouded Emotions' irritated me. It chopped and changed, jumped from scene to scene, and didn't really finish. I only found out after reading it that this was intended to be an interactive story, and that I could go to a website and contribute to the story's evolution. I felt cheated by that. It wasn't what I signed on for. I also wondered if the choppiness of the story was the result of earlier interaction. Not a good idea, in my opinion.<br /><br />The erotic element in some of the stories is well-written and lifts those particular stories somewhat. Foot fetishists out there might be particularly titillated.<br /><br />In short stories there is little opportunity to really develop characters. For the most part, Rossi does well enough in this regard. But for me it is the plot and pace which are most important. My overall impression after reading the collection was that most of the stories fell somewhere between the `not bad' and the `quite good', with nothing really standing out. I might also add that I find the title quite mystifying. It is not the title of any of the individual stories, and it does nothing to capture the overall theme or flavour these stories. If I could I would give this 3.5 stars. As I can't, and as I certainly don't think it is worth four stars, I give it three.

B00BOXZAG6|4.0|I don't write movie reviews often because most movies today are repetitive with boring stories.  A good movie should entertain as well as incorporating relevant story lines.  Upside Down is one of those movies; it is entertaining from beginning to end.  The visual aspect of the movie is very beautiful and creative but it doesn't overshadow the story.  Very well done!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Did not think I was interested in this series when it first aired.  My sister watches it and said that it was really good so that is<br />why I decided to check it out.  So glad I did.  It a great mixture of fun and drama.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This one has a good story line, very good acting, and the fantasy base that makes it fun to watch.<br />Highly recommended for those who enjoy good SCI-FI

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Primarily known for their electronic music. this composition is a departure only in the mix of disco beat surrounded by electronica that Daft Punk is famous for.  A genius fusing of the two, spanning the old and new decades for a fresh look at both.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Great movie. Lots of action and excellent special effects.Dwayne Johnson is a nice addition to the cast and characters. If you enjoyed the first one, you should enjoy this one just as much.

0307271609|5.0|I'm ashamed to say I'd never heard of Cixi before picking up this book.  China's early history (at least before Mao) is not something I've delved into quite a bit.  But having read the author's \\"Wild Swans\\" I decided to give this book a try.  And I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />Plucked out among many other girls as one of the royal concubines to the then emperor, Cixi was a normal Chinese girl.  Well, normal insomuch as royal concubines are.  Not even the Empress, she had to use force of will to climb up the ladder and become one of the most powerful figures in China's history.  Ruling for the better part of a half century, a woman, in a land that oppressed the female gender, she had to be intelligent and cunning.  According to this book, she was progressive and brought in a lot of modern improvements to China despite being wracked by rebellions, hostile foreign policies, and other hazards.  And since she couldn't rule in outright name because she was female, she had to maneuver politics and emperors around to best direct her needs.<br /><br />Cixi is a strong person, and that comes through in this book.  Few women (or even men) can claim to do half of what she did in a lifetime.  And she had to overcome a myriad of obstacles just because of her gender to rule.  This book paints a pretty optimistic picture of her, but refers to the notion that she is not always portrayed this way.  Having experienced this book about Cixi before anything else, I of course am disposed to lean towards the fact that she did the best she could in leading China, and when she made mistakes, she admitted them.  So I admire her.  And the author does mention several other people in this book as well, but to be honest, there's so many of them it's hard to keep track.  It's obvious that Cixi is the main focus in this book, and that's just fine.<br /><br />I learned a lot about China's history from this book.  And about Cixi.  It's amazing how many things can happen over the course of a few decades.  There's even a good bit written about the Boxer Rebellion since it happened during Cixi's rule.  But it wasn't dry as some historical books can be.  It kept me riveted the whole time and even though it lagged a bit in parts in the latter half, I still found it hard to put the book down.  It's the kind where you can probably go back, read it again, and discover new facts you may not have noticed the first time around.  Really, the parts that made it lag were some of the politics, but the book can't be faulted for that as it's a book about a country's leader and politics go hand in hand with that.  And from what I can tell it is well researched.  Wild Swans was also well done and both books have had a lot of care put into them.<br /><br />An excellent book and one I'd recommend to anyone interested in history or China.  It's a powerful biography on a very interesting woman.<br /><br />Empress Dowager Cixi<br />Copyright 2013<br />373 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013des.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Much better than the other 2..more excitement and action ( besides the sex talk!) Cant wait to see the movie!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun and challenging game, hard to put down! Could use a bit more explanation on how to get the most out of it. Had to have a kid show us how to do that!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Still in beta, so there is very limited use right now. Very well made, although the usb cable tends to be annoying if it sticks out at the side of your tv.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|I love this movie. In fact, I bought it to share with others. MM did a terrific job and looked perfect for the part. It was reminiscent of growing up in earlier times and the way things and people looked and acted. The values expressed by the parents gave it depth. I give this movie four stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I installed this game in my Kindle Fire. No regrets, it work very nicely, there are no problems and the card movement and placement works fine all the time. Highly recomended
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Im 14 and i luuuuv mlp as do many peeps but there should be an easier way to get coins without buying them... im on level 24 and i only hav 1000 or somthing but other then that its the second best horse game evrr!!!!! First is derby days wich btw should be able to play on kindle fire.... im angry that it cant...
B00008H2LB|5.0|a Gift for my son. Hubby and son fight over tunes in the car, and this is one requested a LOT. a must buy
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Probably the tenth!!  Great movie for Star Trek fans. Those not familiar with the series will miss a lot of the implications of dialogue and characters
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game that you can keep you entertained for hours unlike some other similar games. so far verry happy with the game
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book had it all.. As a flower lover this was interesting, and the action and mystery was very well done. The subject of foster care and mental illness was very well done..Main character reminded me somewhat of The Girl with The Golden tatoo. I highly recommend this book.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Best series ever! I got hooked from the first episode on! I enjoyed everyone! SOA is my all time favorite series! I don't think there ever will be another series to beat it! GREAT show! Absolutely loved it!!!
B00181MHQU|5.0|Great Tape - A real classic. Will be around for a long time. This is a real collector's item. A must buy!
B007HGPBRC|3.0|than what I received from this book.<br /><br />I found it to be a little disjointed in its flow.  Not being familiar with Hitchens, but captured by this book's subject and the high ratings it has received, I would have appreciated a few editorial insertions along the way.  This, to me, would have helped bridge some of this disjointed flow.  This would have been especially helpful toward and after the passing of the author.<br /><br />I surely disagree with his lack of faith, but his struggle with cancer provides insight valuable to all readers.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I read a lot. And mostly I read fantasy. And I have got quite used to reading and paying for stories which have the structure, character and attractiveness of a text written by teenager.<br />Then once in a while I suddenly stumble upon sth like The Name of the Wind and am reminded once more why it is the fantasy genre that I absolutely love most. Because when the writers get it right, a fantasy novel is without compare the most beautiful read. This book is one of these kind of reads.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|Not fair you lack the update here.  Please give us an update too. Update this app.  I paid.  Be kind to your customers.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This was a great afternoon girlie flick.  If you need a break and a few laughs this will fill the bill. Love Amazon Prime Movies.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|Good Movie. Stayed interested throughout, surprises and excitement. The actors were great, good choice by casting. Waiting for part two.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's free. it's fun. Short but good. Ten levels. I wish there were more. This is my first escape game download.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|When we downloaded this game it came with a warning  that a virus was attached.  I deleted  it from my table t but am not convinced it didn't damage the  tower because coincidently the tower died that night.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book was very enjoyable. Favorite is still the 5 People You Meet in Heaven. And much better than One More Day. I would recommend this book.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings stories are simply amazing. The books opened an entire world of diverse characters from the Elves & Dwarves to Man & Beasts. J.R.R. Tolkien introduced a world so detailed, it actually includes family trees of characters and their lineage, as well as a full scale look at the plants and trees and their origins, uses and so much more. It's almost unbelievable. As shown in the Lord of the Rings Movie franchise, a lot of content is not included that was in the books, but the story and diversity of time and locations is not missed. the LOTR Movies are amazingly depicted. I found that was also carried over to the newly introduced prequel: the Hobbit. In some ways, I actually liked the Hobbit movie more so than the LOTR Trilogy. It's not as action packed as the LOTR Movies, but there is so much emotional power which is so well displayed by the characters (a great cast of actors was used for this movie)and scenery, whether its animated or not. The animation is top notch (for now anyway) and it blends in so well it's incredible. Most importantly, Bilbo is played by an amazing actor - not sure what his name is - but oh man, he does such a good job in this, there are times you just want to pick that little hobbit up and squeeze the life out of him (in a nice way). If you haven't seen it, and liked the LOTR books or movies, you will undoubtedly love this movie. I have yet to see the 3D version, but without 3D, this movie is too good! I want the 3D version since I have the set up to view, but I already bought the standard blu-ray edition and don't want to fork out another $35 bucks for an extra blu-ray copy, dvd and digital copy only to see the 3D version and think to myself, that could have been way more 3D-ish! This is the kind of movie that I can watch over and over. 5 Stars all the way.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Unbiased research just the facts (ma&#34;am) intelligent details not a emotional biased interpretation of the BIBLE. Mr.Reza Asian respects all religions.
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|My family and I went to see this movie at the drive in movie theater. We brought our family gear (chairs, blankets, etc.) and had an amazing spot, loaded up the popcorn, soda, and other must have movie snacks, and waited for the movie to start. When it did, expectations were high, I was ready for fun, for laughter, and even some light hearted excitement. I did not get that feeling in the beginning or the end of the movie. In fact, I did not get to experience any of those feelings in the intensity I thought I would. I love the whole Disney universe today - Pixar makes such amazing movies that are truly moving and unforgettable. As many have probably mentioned in reviews for this movie, it felt a lot like a sloppy version on cars with wings. What I didn't like was that this was another underdog story, that has a cast of characters that was too similar to the Cars Movie. The big difference is that in Cars, Lightning McQueen was already at the top and needed to win the Big race to get his Piston Cup win and new sponsership, but had lessons to learn. In this story, the main plane, Dusty, is essentially running through the same story line in respects to having to win \\"the big race\\", and having an old geezer mentor (like Doc in the movie Cars) that had a bad experience with flying in the war that brought him into a life a solitude and sourness, blah, blah. It was just too typical and didn't have anything distinguishable that made this movie special. The characters are forgettable, the story is just ok, and the feeling I had when the movie was over was \\"that was disappointing\\". Every other pixar film I have seen (pretty much all of them), I have bought the movie as soon as it came out for sale on video. This movie, not too sure I will have this in the collection. I would rather take my chances on a rent to see if this movie grows on me after a 2nd viewing. I gave this 3 stars since it still looks good, decent voice-acting and the animation still looks great; it's just thatthis movie looks pretty on the outside, but no real structure and feeling inside, which is too bad.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|What a great cast! The storyline is unbelievable. I've recommended this show to all my friends. I'm excited for season 6!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|in order to download it you have to to android drawer and download it from that site..its really easy ..its got the old one up to the new ones..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is fun but gets a bit tedious as it goes since the challenges increase but the trainings do not.  Make sure automatic updates are on with the kindle or you will have issues with the game loading that will then mess up everything else as well.  Other than that it's fun I spend a lot of time on it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I would recommend this app it's a great alarm and wakes me when my cell phone doesn't and its free!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I was expecting a sci-fi or paranormal program and this came out of left field. The idea of a secret agency chasing aliens is not original but Captain Jack Harkness and his wonderfully flawed cohorts make it a watchable program. Captain Jack is a cross between Kenny in South Park, Mulder in the X-Files and, well, you have to watch it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I looked up sex words and I got very horny with \\"sex\\" and \\"sexual intercourse\\" and I'm going to hump the pillows in my room

B00C2C637I|5.0|The language Ray Bradbury uses in this novel is amazing. He paints such vivid images with his words I felt like I was there in the story -feeling the same terror as the boys.
B00499NHLC|5.0|...but we decided to go ahead and watch since we had Amazon Prime streaming, which made this free.  Deeply addicted!  When we finished season two, we were actually mopey for a few days!!!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|The usability and flexibility of this note app is the best so far!  It needs a sync option for other devices and PC/chrome to make updates across multiple devices and from the PC.
0553801473|5.0|There are a lot of characters in this book and the last.  Sometimes i get a little confused but overall I've loved the series and I can't wait for the next book.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Yay, I found the rest of Chuck!  Thanks for very quick shipping.  I am stretching this out over years if I have to.  Glad I missed the series on TV so I can watch it in my leisure.  A show even my husband likes.  Great price, too!
193700788X|5.0|I've been a fan of the tv series so these books have not disappointed me.  I do wish the tv series followed the books a little more closely but oh well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've been using this app for months without problem on a kindle fire hd 7. Stays out of your way and gives you the right information.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Really had only heard one song on this CD (Wagon Wheel) but the rest of them are just as good.
B00AXXTR7Q|5.0|For years I didn't watch \\"The Good Wife\\"...because of the title...really, it seemed subservient and condescending to me. I was not paying close enough attention to the commercials, the Emmy nominations or Golden Globes. SHAME ON ME!<br /><br />I had the opportunity to see the first season, and have been hooked and watching on Amazon ever since...it has been a great series, and I will for sure DVR the 6th season  starting this Sept.<br /><br />Thanks for a show where the Viewer, me, can care about the characters and what happens to them from week to week. This criteria is paramount in my TV viewing!
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|#1 photo app for serious photogphy; get it. Great for both beginners and advanced who want to learn to improve their photos by improving their interpretation of their own work.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love this game. Very challenging. sometimes I feel like I'm never going to get through a level and come back the next day and figure it out.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Sci Fi/Fantasy with a sense of realism that seems to over write the fact that it's fantasy. No one leaves conflict unscarred, emotionally or physically.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I HAVE JUSST BEGUN THE BOOK SO AM NOT SURE WHAT THE VERDICT IS BUT SO FAR SO GOOD! JUDY M. BOWERS
B0074VTHKM|2.0|I have read most of Gresham's books and this one was so electronic elementary and so boring and so basic that I thought it was written by a kid and for kids.  Will try again with future book but if it's like this one it will be the last one of his I read.
B008469DGY|2.0|This game is not golf. I liked the tee off well enough, but it failed to follow through with any fairway play or putting.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I just want to review a book that l have just finished reading whilst getting over hand surgery. The author Karen Moriarty had such a wonderful insight as far as Michael Jackson was concerned. As an avid Michael Jackson fan l enjoyed every word and l am sure that if you were not sure about rumours etc that were spread about Michael, mainly from the press and anyone wanting to make money from him, you should read this book. It tells you the truth about this wonderfully, talented and loving family man.<br />Do yourself a favour and read Karen's book, you will be glad you did.<br />Thank you Karen,<br />Jenny Crawley
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Well written, keeps you interested.  I am moving on to book 3 in the series.  I actually started reading this series after I got hooked on the HBO series.  I can't stop reading.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I would recommend this movie to people of all ages. It teaches that good manners are indeed good. Not lame. And that we need to be happy about the little things.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this down once I started reading.  It's not a book I would normally read but based on reviews and how many people read it I decided to give it a shot....... It's worth it
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|Great game.The AI will copy your strategy and use it against you.Great concept very difficult.Wish you cam play against a human player sometime
B00003Q43A|5.0|The movie is a well worth watching the cast and movie are great I enjoy watching a very good action movie.
B002APU580|4.0|A well done movie of a very good story.  It was shortened, but had all the main action of the storyl
B00005JMXX|5.0|The movie is a well worth watching the cast and movie are great I enjoy watching a very good action movie.
B00DURGZHW|3.0|Too long and not enough focus on the main character. The writer/director(s) should have concentrated on jus the 3 main characters and made the stakes higher. It was an interesting setting though and the acting was good. Amazon's streaming quality was great, no issues there, but I wish it had been available to rent when I watched it because I won't really be watching this one over and over again.
087033039X|5.0|Seems to be loaded with different types of braiding yet appears to be quite complicated. I'm sure that it should get easier as I practice.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I bought this smaller version to tuck inside my camper with limited space. It offers everything the larger model does, its just smaller which is fine for the smaller size (go-anywhere) grill I got to go with it. It's riveted together so there's no bolts to rattle apart or corrode away over time and the whole thing is really sturdy and will stand up to very high heat no problem. The main thing that makes this model superior to others is the little conical coils inside that support the charcoal in a way that lets you mash paper beneath and the heat will get to it more efficiently to that the coals will light quicker and more evenly.<br /><br />Note: if you have a full-size home grill, get the full size one, not this compact model.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just figured out that I can play Amazon Prime on the Wii system.  It streamed very well and didn't have any issues.  Very happy.
B00A8FXT8M|4.0|it's one of those books that one starts and you think,  'so what',  quite boring.  then you get caught up in this simple 'life'  and the guy grows on you.  what broke my heart most is how he 'endures' his wife. I got quite frustrated, hoping that he would leave her. but in the end he does react in a way and you can't help liking him. In the end I was in tears and the book remained with me for many days.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game and easier than I thought it would be for a free game. I highly recommend this game.and thinking about buying the other games.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app! Best free app I've ever owned. I use it daily and you cant beat it when travelling. I recommend this to all my friends and anyone else who'll listen! Love<br />love love it!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|A gift for a friend of mine.  Her favorite movie of all time.  (she uses that word to describe it).  also, she loves the music.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl may just be the last real rock star out there and he is doing more than his fair share to support the rockn cause!  Just a really well done documentary about a place most people would not know about.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved book 1 and book 2 was pretty good as well. But book 3 didn't seem to have the depth and passion at the conclusion as the first two books. I'm hoping that means a 4th is coming…
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed immensely!<br />I would recommend this series to any English history buff, Or anyone who enjoys history.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very strange story written by a good writer. It kept me interested to the very last page. The author has a vivid mind and will be recognized as one of this century best known writers.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I like the option to split the keyboard in half when you type in landscape. No other keyboard has this. Also the themes are kinda neat.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|needs to have more puzzles . so far is over for me. more puzzles are needed for me to keep this game
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Not very interesting, story line was boring. The ending blew along with the beginning and never once got excited.  I found myself asking why I was still watching it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a great calculator, everything you need in a basic calculator. It looks great and works as it should. A must have app.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game was fun and still is but guess what? A recent update includes a change in privacy policy. This now requires you to give your DOB to play. The fine print states that it's to tailor the game experience to the proper age group as mentioned in the privacy policy. So,I decided to read the privacy policy and it says they won't purposely collect data on persons under the age of 13 in section 2, however it also states they collect &quot;anonymous data&quot; from persons over 13 AND will also collect &quot;personal data&quot; including unique identifier for device installed on,your email address and much much more.<br /><br />Say goodbye Backflip. Uninstalling! And anyone else who installed the recent update, I hope you realize your personal information is personal for a reason. Backflip does not deserve to know your personal life.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Stereotypes are a bit overplayed and the drama is a bit unrealistic at times, but the acting is overall pretty strong. Teens will like it.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|If you like the 'Roaring' 20's and a quick, witty, fast paced , well written story... 'The Great Gatsby' is a pleasant surprise to watch!  This updated version is good in that it incorporates a vivid visual effect and musicality to attract a broader, younger audience. As much as I loved the original version with Robert Redford...I must say, I was equally impressed with Leonardo DiCaprio's take on Gatsby's character.<br />I liked it, and..I am not usually a remake fan!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Kindle for Android is good, but far from perfect.  I recommend it, and its far better than not having this app.<br />However, it requires changes to it to become great.  Synching between multiple devices and the Amazon repository is ok, but when<br />there is not a way to synch to the page between your device and your other device, its a failure.<br />No one wants to go searching page by page to find out where one last stopped reading...no matter which device one had been using. For this reason alone, its just above mediocre and I rate it a &#34;good&#34;.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The writing of this script was great. Although, I pretty much guessed who the 5th horseman was in the middle of the movie, it never led me to want to stop watching this movie through to the end. The characters portrayed in this movie were a group worth watching! Just a good Friday night movie to watch with the family... I would watch this on again!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I cannot wait until I read, The Hit. The Innocent was exciting and riveting from the first<br /> Page to the last.
1451695195|5.0|it was a very interested book to read. especially because it was a true story and written by a doctor
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have had trouble putting down this set of books since I started it!<br />I feel that this booked help to bring together some of the characters.  The author promises that the next one will bring in some that we have not seen or heard from in a while!  I am excited for this.  My only complaint is my favorite characters keep being killed off...
B006PERRMY|2.0|If you don't care about thinking, or a movie making sense, or are a sucker for anorexic actors, then this movie might not bother you.<br />The trailer to the movie intrigued me as a social commentary, so when I sat down to watch this, I was expecting something that was both thought-provoking and action-filled.  Quite a disappointment.  The opening tries to give background on this complex future and it turns out that really what happened is that the screenwriter and/or director thought that a plot that made sense wasn't really important.  So why do people stop aging at 25?  Because the creators of the movie wanted to show off the sexiest, cookie-cutter models and actors they could in one movie.  Only one body type shows off- unhealthily skinny women, and equally unhealthily skinny men with just the right amount of facial hair.  Seriously, this movie looks like an extended Calvin Klein commercial.<br />The acting isn't great, and it's hard to empathize with either of the lead characters, they just aren't very believable, likable.  Very two-dimensional.  JT should stick with his music or comedy, he doesn't come across as the working-class type.<br />So I would have been fine if the action was just ridiculous fun.  But it wasn't.  Some car chases, weird arm-wreslting and crappy shootouts.  Not worth my time.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|This series is definitely worth watching, if only to introduce you to a happy, singing Hugh Laurie before he became a grumpy doctor.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|a complex love story.  my favorite adaption of the book<br />when you think love was lost because you made a bad decision, think again.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I really enjoyed this reboot, and thought it was extremely well cast. Zachary Quinto is a fabulous Spock, and Karl Urban nails Dr. McCoy. Watch it.
1449437524|5.0|Cute little book. Actually brings up some good points in regards to dog logic.<br /><br />Book is made of quality material also.
159448385X|5.0|Amazing story of women and survival. This story has opened my eyes to the horrific circumstances women in Afghanistan have and still encounter. Incredibly sad but true.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|From my understanding this movie was filmed in 3D.  If you are looking to really get the most out of your 3D setup do not pass this gem up, well worth it!!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|i watch just about every day, i would recommend this to family and friends.picture clear sound is good the best for old movies
B00CFA222M|5.0|We've all seen different versions of Jack and the Beanstalk, but this one was truly fantastic. Great characters, great storyline with the war between giants and humans, and great special effects. There's not much else to say about the film, other than buy it, watch it, and you will love it. Very entertaining and very exciting!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|First of all, put Tommy Lee Jones, Mary Steenbergen, John Goodman & Peter Sarrsgard in front of a camera and one is nearly guaranteed a hit.....ELECTRIC MIST will not let  you down.  The Detective Robichauex novels are unique in their writing.  They capture numerous complex principals and the reader is enveloped in the heat & humidity of the bayou.  The film production and direction with an outstanding cast captures  and sustains well this same intensity and involvement.  If you are a fan of mysteries that continue to evolve with unusually well drawn characters then don't miss ELECTRIC MIST.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Statham is good at being the underdog for some reason. He's always playing someone who's been wronged or betrayed etc. He's good at the revenge face, though, and in this film it really works for him. Great action scenes, a cause you want him to fight for and awesome death scenes. It's graphic, but not too graphic, if that makes sense.<br /><br />This one is definitely worth watching
B004X80QNG|1.0|Does not match screenshots but is a decent app.<br /><br />Nothing different than using Google calendar and has interesting permission request s
0446547654|2.0|Item came in bad conditions Book Jacket was bent and torn.<br />When Specified to be &#34;new&#34; do Not recommend, Packaging had absolutely no protection.

B000GOVU3G|4.0|Simply put, it was a cute story. Diane Lane and Luke Wilson are always a joy to watch. Cute dog too!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app works really well it helps me go to sleep every night it has a lot of sounds to choose from and also has a timer so your kindle won't die out after you fall asleep. I would at least try it it's free and well worth the  tiny amount of space it takes up in your memory card.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I have had an old case for my kindle since i bought it new and didn't like the kindle. After buying this case for it to sell the kindle i realized i did like the kindle but it was visually unattractive. I pick it up more often now since buying this awesome case. 5 stars

1476712042|1.0|Got half way through and could not stomach it anymore. The amount of woman on woman hate in this book is mindblowing and sickening. Here are some terms used to describe ANY girl thats not Abby or her best friend:<br /><br />*Slut<br />*Bimbo<br />*Skank<br />*Bottle blonde<br />*Clueless Bimbo<br />*STD infested imbecile<br />*Vegas threw up on a flock of vultures<br />*Bar fly<br /><br />Every sexually active, well dressed, sexy woman in this book is so worthless and disgusting, its ok to drop them on the floor like a used condom wrap, treat them like garbage and call them names (see above) as if they are not human beings but wastes of skin made for Travis's penis. He wont even take them to his bed but \\"bags\\" them on the couch of his living room because they are so worthless.<br /><br />Travis suggest that every man around Abby or is possibly interested in Abby is a rapist and he threatens all of them with death and/or violence. And if he is not a rapist or suggested rapist, he is Gary Sue (Parker) and nothing but a plot device to angst up Travis & Abby's messed up relationship and bring more drama. And to stir up Travis more because anger & \\"murder eyes\\" are hot, right? I could go into billion other details to describe Travis and all I come up with is a dangerous, violent, CONTROLING psychopath who needs to be locked up. He is a danger to society.<br /><br />This book is disturbing and dangerous. Girls, there is a difference between a bad boy and Travis and author cleary missed the mark on capturing a real alpha male that turns your stomach into knots but doesn't endanger your well being. Christian Grey is a fluffy unicorn compared to this psycho. Obsession, controling and violence are NOT signs of love or even temporary passion. If you read this book, let it be your warning tale if nothing else because love and romance, it is NOT.<br /><br />The world is less good for having this book in it.<br /><br />MINUS ZERO STARS.

Because your day is going to be much better than the &#34;Dude's&#34; his day starts out rocky but he manages to come out on top.<br />Jeff Bridges is the &#34;Dude&#34; the part had to have been written just for him because he nails it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Well written, good research, and many good ideas to think about.  A long section at the  end of the book outlines and documents various viewpoints - some agreeing with the author and others diametrically opposed.  This section adds a lot to the book and provides some direction for further research.  The author picks and chooses sections of the Bible to believe or toss out without distinguishing clearly what makes one passage so much more believable than another.  I disagree with his conclusions of who Jesus of Nazareth was and what his mission was, but learned a lot from the book and it opened up many new ideas for consideration.
B003UMW69I|2.0|It was unsatisfactory because it was not possible to play this Blue Ray DVD in Australia. I have returned it to Amazon. I was not able to retain its packaging in order to open and play it.

B00CF2UORK|4.0|We started watching Shaun with one of our 3-year old grand-daughter.  She was just fascinated with Shaun and his claymation friends.  But unlike most kiddy shows, my wife and I actually enjoyed Shaun so much, we would watch episodes on our own.<br /><br />So we introduced our other 3-year old grand-daughter, and she kept saying as she watched, \\"This is funny.\\"<br /><br />Rare to find such a clever and funny show like Shaun.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|this is a great show, loved watching it once again. I believe this was the first pilot that bombed and they needed to create a new Pilot
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This series is just terrific for the beginner, good reader. My 9 year old is reading it aloud to me and he is able to inflect the voices and mood to the point where I am hysterical laughing at al of the real life kid situations!! Excellent for the new curious young minds!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm pretty happy with this app. I like the size on my Kindle Fire. It is very readable. It is just enough for my needs.
B0001AUAU4|4.0|i heard Carla Bruni on the radio (npr) one day as i was driving, and i was captivated.  even though my total French vocabulary is maybe 30 words, i love this CD.  Ms Bruni's voice is seductive in a way that i find friendly rather than sexual ... i feel as though she's welcoming me into her world.  my only regret is that i don't know what she's actually singing about!  an English lyric sheet would be appreciated.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|If you own a Nexus 4, you don´t have a lot of options for a phone cover. This one looks good, works great and doesn´t make the phone look bigger... buy it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|You need it, but amazon keeps working to make it useful.  I prefer the books, but this is a pretty friendly reader.  Probably better than simple pdf reader for bigger works.<br /><br />Mike
B003TML0VO|3.0|Was looking forward to this cd, but there are only 2 or 3 tracks that I like. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is by far the best track and Riders on the Storm is good, but I've heard better. The cover looks like those cheap wannabe official Santana products that contain early unfocused musicianship. Perhaps that is appropriate b/c Carlos should have picked more worthy material that he had more passion for.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Why, when Amazon refuses to allow Kindle users to get apps from anyone but Amazon, do they regularly offer Kindle users apps that don't work on a Kindle? The description of this app is quite long. Only the very last sentence, kind of a throwaway line, tells you that it won't synch if running on a Kindle.<br /><br />I use a Kindle HD 8.9. But maybe not for much longer. Apps that don't work offered by Amazon are one of the reasons. Developers who have two versions of an app, an old one that won't work on a Kindle, and a new version that will are another. Developers, PLEASE put a note in the beginning of your description that your app won't work on x, y, or z and there will be far fewer poor reviews. Especially if you want $10 for it.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I thought this was a really good Dan Brown book! Suspense down to the last moments of the book! Could not put it down!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second album made the world take notice of this outstanding band from the UK. Released in 1969, this album has many songs that would be classic Rock-Heavy Metal standards. Whole Lotta Love, Living Lovin Maid (She's Just a Woman) really rocks Thank You, just to name a few of the hits. Led Zeppelin's albums were outstanding but this one is a cut above as is Led Zeppelin IV so if you just heard of Led Zeppelin and like their songs but don't know which CD to get, then I definitely recommend this one. It's the perfect introduction to this Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Band! Highly Recommended!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I missed this series when it was on TV and could not wait to see it.  Now I'm addicted and trying to catch up before Season 4 starts.
B000002H97|5.0|Before this legendary album/CD was released in 1990, only Heavy Metal fans really knows how good Metallica really was. Then \\"The Black Album\\" was released and the world took notice! The band hired a new producer, Don Was I think was his name and took the band in a new direction for this album. \\"Enter Sandman\\" was the first release and the song rocks! The video which is also outstanding was shown on MTV, back when they actually showed good music videos and the album reached #1 on the charts. \\"Sad But True\\", \\"Unforgiven\\", and \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" which in my opinion is their best song ever shows how fantastic this band was and still is to this day! This is Metallica at their best and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

B00B8WXG9G|4.0|This CD grew on me. I had to listen to it several times before I could decide if I like it. I found the melodies very soothing. The different artists rendition was also good in combination with Paul Anka's style. I would recommend you listen to it several times before you rate it.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean's iconic album Channel Orange dropped in July of 2012 and has since reached critical acclaim. While it hasn't won any awards, the album has sold over 500,000 copies and effectively launched Ocean into a lucrative career in the hip-hop industry.<br />The album followed his self-released debut Nostalgia, Ultra., which followed a quiet background career as a song writer for other major pop artists. The album included such hits as Swim Good and Novacane, which landed on the billboard charts. Ocean is part of the rap collective Odd Future, a group of underground artists started by Tyler, The Creator, who often collaborated early before the days of Channel Orange. Their dark, somewhat disturbing lyrics are complementary, yet in deep contrast, to Ocean's troubled poetic outlook on his own personal life. Their influence is seen throughout the album, normalizing tragedy and heartache by contrasting emotionally tolling lyrical content to smooth, even flowing tempo and music, a staple in Odd Future's music.<br /> Channel Orange was released with five singles. One of these was \\"Thinkin Bout You,\\" a hauntingly beautiful song that garnered immediate attention to the album. Ocean's lyrics, however, received the most attention due to the insinuation of feelings directed at a male counterpart.<br />Ocean later disclosed that he had had unrequited feelings for a man at the age of 19, which is deeply reflected in the album. He was highly praised for being so open with his sexuality and making headway in an otherwise close-minded hip-hop community.<br /> As previously stated, the album touches on deep feelings of love, rejection, longing, and pain. Ocean uses stark contrasting styles, from the minimalist instrumentals and smooth falsetto of \\"Thinkin Bout You,\\" to the elaborate musical styling and profoundly metaphorical lyrics of \\"Pyramids,\\" which regales the story of Cleopatra, from a disgraced queen who broke his heart, to a modern day stripper who is just constantly outof his emotional reach.<br />Ocean brings in several major artists, including Andre 3000, Earl Sweatshirt and even John Mayer, to accentuate the painful truths in the thought-provoking album. Sweatshirt, a fellow Odd Future alum, drops a verse on Super Rich Kids that describes the two-faced nature of privileged youth who, despite having impressive means and opportunity, act out by using sex, drugs, and violence to cope with the lack of intimacy and discipline in their lives. The music is often delivered in melancholy tones with simple rhythms as a harmonization to the feelings of Ocean relinquishing his feelings to a stranger in an allegorical criticism of his unrequited love, comparing it to the confines of a religion in which the love for a higher power is one-sided and detrimental.<br />The album mimics the sound and style of casually changing radio stations, which plays well with the shifting style of each song. It begs the listener to continue on the journey, constantly questioning which facet of Ocean's intricate mind they will transcend next.<br /> Channel Orange has led to collaborations with monumental names in the hip-hop community, including Jay-Z and Kanye West. Ocean's roots with the rap collective Odd Future are often revisited these days with multiple features on several of its alum's albums. Ocean has transcended the life of a frustrated song-writer to pop icon, and has left the hip-hop world salivating in anticipation for his next album.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I like this serious.  All the books so far get my attention.  Cant wait ti get to others then movie
B000V39KDO|2.0|Well, sometimes historic things could be pretty boring - after all, if I would like to watch historically correct movie, I'll be watching some documentary movie. But not this far as in 300 :)
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It's the best book I've ever read. The book is a more detailed description of the book \\"BUCK\\". I recommend this book to everyone who wants to read an awesome book.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|I liked this story very much. And I live near Detroit.<br />This is a very amazing story.  I loved it.
B00BB8UJKG|2.0|I really didn't give the movie a chance. From the beginning scene it was &#34;f&#34; this and &#34;f&#34; that, so I  said, &#34;f&#34; it and watched something else.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing, I couldn't stop reading it. I really felt is if I were actually IN the book! I loved it and recommend it to any age reader.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great puzzle game. It's not too hard and not too easy either.  There's some funky music playing in the background too which makes for nice ambience.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I have been listening to John Mayer for years and seem to have all of his CD's on constant rotation.  I was a little apprehensive since I didn't particularly like Born & Raised, but I was pleasantly surprised and now have been listening to this one pretty much non-stop.  John's vocals, song-writing and guitar playing are always great and these songs are no exception.  I agree with one reviewer; I did not think the Frank Ocean \\"rap\\" had anything to do with this CD, so I usually just skip past that one. But all of the rest I listen to and enjoy and as I learn more of the words, they have a deeper meaning for me.  This one will be in rotation, along with my other favorites, for many years to come!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Kept your interest going throughout the book - I like the way Harlan Coben writes - Doesn't use what I call &#34;filler&#34; to fill up the pages.
B004YLCKEU|5.0|Simply a treat to watch.  The extra mini documentary of fan interviews was nice, and the entire concert experience was poignantly beautiful and nicely produced.  The performances, too, were terrific.  Morten's voice was impeccable and both Magne and Pal were suberb.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The acting is superb. We are enjoying the series immensely and often watch several episodes per night. So interesting and powerful.
B006C45CFG|5.0|I know that there seem to be a lot of people who panned this film, but I really enjoyed it in the theater, and on the small screen I have enjoyed seeing it again (and again!).  The special effects were very well handled, and I the vision in bringing this odd melding of Western and Science Fiction was excellently handled - very artful.  And, what can one say about a film with both Daniel Craig AND Harrison Ford?!  Fun pairing.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I chose to read this book because I knew nothing about it.  I was looking to start a book that I had not sought out, and was wanting to be pulled into a story from the very beginning.  Needless to say, I fell for this story and really enjoyed falling in love with the characters.  I've recommended it to many.

B001V3SV9C|5.0|This volume from a vast musical valise contains what some consider the finest compositions of music. The New York Times, in an obituary December 21, 1982, described these sumptuous expressions of Chopin delicate expressions from an artist who could make the piano breathe.
B0091W7MP4|2.0|Storyline is idiotic.  Hopefully, they won't make a sequel though the movie ending is set up for another one.  Weaver will be using a walker by then.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|love the way the characters are developed. Great book for readers who like getting inside the mind of a person committed to a mission.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I haven't never written a review before always thought it was pointless but I am unbelievably impressed this is a instant classic record. This band has grown with each album and this one is no exception its very polished and the homage to the influence of the bands they love and respect is ever strongly present. I know some will call this a would be cover album or a sell out record. yes there is a metallica black album feel to this album but its not a rip off its a artistic respect of the people who helped mold there love for music. Everyone called Metallica sell outs and said they were washed up when black album was released.  only to change the landscape and the viewpoint of metal music in general.  and its also one of the biggest selling albums of all time. So with that said if u like classic hard music you will not be disappointed with this album its a behemoth of 10 tracks.  and the old style progressiveness to A7X is still here just listen to last two tracks \\"planets\\" and \\"acid rain\\". This is one of those albums that will stand the test of time have been a big fan since City of Evil but bands have to grow and evolve or stagnation sets in and then when a new album comes out all u get to say is \\"well its another record\\". I hope this may help for someone to add this to there collection its a must.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Incredible versatility in the selections on this with many of their hits in the past year, including the current &#34;Bruises&#34;.  Having just seen them in concert recently, this is a real keeper.  They are the best!
0316236535|5.0|I bought this book for my 4-year-old twins after teaching pre-school with this book being read everyday during circle time. It is a very simple and visual book but it has that magic something that makes kids giggle and laugh. They also learn facial features and building up to a whole image. The cut outs in the pages and the bright colors against black make this book fun to look at! Be prepared to read out loud...I mean LOUD!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We absolutely love this movie, have watched it as a family over and over again! Jack Frost is a delightful character and Santa is awesome.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I am a boy and honestly really like this app its great on long drives and never gets old.100% regimens this game
B00499QUK2|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch? I mean, hello? He's brilliant! And Martin Freeman is amazing as well. They're both fantastic actors that portray Sherlock Holmes and John Watson perfectly.<br /><br />The show if humorous, nerve-racking, action-packed and just, well, sensational. I couldn't stop watching it, and found myself on the edge of my seat at the end of the season. I totally recommend it to anyone!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A great app for me, l like knowing what's ahead for the weather, this app suits me just fine.  Nice Job.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This movie was well made, and the setting, acting and production quality were beautiful.  Matthew was superb.  However, it  entered the &#34;stupid zone&#34; with the shoot out at the end.  It would have been perfect if they had just left out the &#34;cowboy and indian&#34; stuff out and let the story take a more natural course.  The kids in the story were wonderful too.  Very natural.  I especially liked the way the parents  and uncle interacted with them.  It was nice to see parents who care about their kids, despite the poor living conditions.  And I am dying to know, how did the boat get in the tree?
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This game is very addicting. Make sure to take you time at aiming. This is not a times game. Yeah
B009346RSS|5.0|Love that this unit does not require big clunky AC adapters but simply a usb power cable, this allowed me to hide this behind my LED TV.
B000P0J09W|4.0|Granddaughter loved it. It was very entertaining for our family vacation to Ga. from Pa by car. This movie helped the time by go faster.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! I had a hard time getting any of my school work done. In two weeks I'm already up to the fourth book in the series so hopefully they'll keep getting better. There were a few parts that were pretty predictable even for that style of writing, but all in all, very good.

B007UB3NAQ|5.0|You won't believe this, but over the years I have had several copies of this book in book and soft cover format. I'm giving this one to my nephew, who wants to fly helicopters. I have read this book 4 times and I'm now reading the kindle version again.
B00509OFE8|5.0|If you like SG-1 and Atlantis, you'll like this one also. Personally I liked this series more than Atlantis, although that may seem like blasphemy to some. I prefer the dark nature of this series to the flash of Atlantis.<br /><br />Too bad it was cut short by a bad economy and an even worse network. (SyFy is a joke now)  Hopefully another network picks this series back up, it would beat the junk most of them air by miles.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Despite the bad reviews, I figured I should probably see A Good Day to Die Hard since I've seen all of the other Die Hard movies and liked at least one of them. Okay, maybe two of them. However, I went in with low expectations. This is the series in which the protagonist survives the explosion of a boat by jumping into the water next to the boat. Because, you know, being in the water totally protects you from explosions in the water. So, not only do we have that, but this one, the 5th (and I'd totally lost track, at this point, that this was the 5th one), was actually getting pretty horrible reviews.<br /><br />It seems I did not lower my expectations far enough. Good Day fails at pretty much every level of story telling and movie making. Well, except for the explosions. It has plenty of those, which, in the Michael Bay theory of movie making, is all you need to make a good movie. I have to suppose John Moore and Skip Woods (the director and writer, respectively) are Bay disciples.<br /><br />The first real mistake the movie makes is having the movie open with McClane's son instead of with McClane himself. It's Die Hard; we're here to see John McClane, not junior. To make it worse, they just throw the audience into the middle of a situation for which there is no context. This is one of the reasons I hate that whole \\"start in the middle of the action\\" \\"rule.\\" They definitely did that with this movie. However, not knowing anything about the characters or the situation, there is no way real way to know whom we should be caring about, so we don't really care about anyone. Of course, this all ends, as we come to find out, with John Jr. (Jack) in a Russian prison. And, as my wife said, \\"What? I didn't even know he had a son.\\"<br /><br />The issue here is that there is an expectation that we will care about Jack because John cares about Jack. Except we don't have any context, really, for John caring about Jack since he's barely mentioned or seen in the other movies. Conveniently enough, John has suddenly chosen this moment to care about Jack, whom he has not spoken to in years, and has had one of his old cop buddies track Jack down for him just at the time that Jack is arrested and thrown into a Russian prison. Of course, there is no good reason why McClane's cop friend should be able to find out that undercover CIA agent Jack McClane has been thrown into a top Russian prison. Especially within what seems to be hours of it happening. Not that McClane even knows that his son is CIA.<br /><br />Being John McClane, he just jumps on a plane to Russia with some vague expectation that he will be able to connect with his son when he gets there. His son that is in a top, possibly top secret, Russian prison. And, of course, without planning it, he happens to arrive on the day that his son is going to appear in Russian court as a witness against the guy that Jack is supposed to be saving. And, also of course, he stumbles into the middle of a prison break/abduction of the guy that Jack is supposed to be saving (and also testifying against).<br /><br />This is where we expect, I guess, John McClane to become \\"yippee-ki-yay\\" John instead of old, tired John that we find at the beginning of the movie. But we don't get that. No, what we get is John chasing his son around during the middle of a fire fight trying to talk to him about how sorry he is that he wasn't there for him when he was a kid. I think it was supposed to be funny. I think. But it didn't even rise to the level of ludicrous as John meanders through the bullets and explosions and, eventually, when his son takes off in a vehicle without him, steals a truck to follow his son while yelling, \\"I'm not through talking to you!\\"<br /><br />And through all of this we have been given no real reason as to why this guy Jack needs to save is so important other than that the CIA want him and that some muckety-muck Russian wants him dead. Or abducted. And the guy's daughter is involved, except we'renot supposed to know that, but as soon as the dude tells McClane that he has a daughter, I knew it was his daughter that was the woman in the group trying to capture and/or kill the dude. And also of course no one turns out to be on the sides they're presented to be on except McClane, the sadist bad guy, and the dead people.<br /><br />Possibly the worst bit, which is saying a lot considering how terribly the movie began, is when Jack overhears John telling the Russian dude about how bad a parent he was and how bad he feels about it and how all he wants to do is make everything right with Jack. But, since, Jack hears John saying this, we are spared any action or work on the part of John to repair his relationship with his son, because his son, now, understands that his dad worked all the time because of how much he loved Jack. And, then, of course, they bond over killing the bad guys and everything is okay.<br /><br />I'm not making it out to be as bad as it really is. It was bad enough that, before the hour mark, my wife decided that she was through with the movie. I'm not actually sure why I finished watching it other than the fact that I have a hard time stopping something once I've started it no matter how bad it is. That this movie was bad wasn't even the worst part about it. It just felt completely inauthentic. McClane's actions didn't feel authentic (Who, really, just jumps in a plane and flies to Russia with the vague plan of getting in to see someone in a Russian prison? John was a cop; he, theoretically, knows how this stuff works and it's beyond far-fetched that he, even being John McClane, would just hop in a plane without contacting the State Department or something). The fact that Jack refers to his father as \\"McClane\\" didn't feel authentic (Seriously? \\"Damn you, McClane\\" is the best they could come up with for Jack to say? I buy him calling his father \\"John\\" but the whole \\"McClane was a stretch the rubber band couldn't take). The whole conflict of themovie involving Russia and nukes didn't feel authentic. It's not the 80s anymore.<br /><br />So, yeah, give me more of escaping explosions by jumping into the water next to the boat that's exploding. At least that was just a brief moment of stupidity unlike the stupidity that was this movie from beginning to end. And that doesn't even cover how dumb the title is, because, if you're going to use the phrase \\"a good day to die,\\" you need to actually have it be relevant to the movie, but no... no relation at all. Just a cool title. But, then, a cool title doesn't make a cool movie.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|Love it. Too bad it was cut short. Would love to see another network pick this series back up if that is even possible.
B004X80QNG|3.0|So, first of all, I have to say that it is not too bad of a planner.  I like the different views.<br />I will start by saying to those that are complaining about the view of the app not looking like the screenshots... that is because you are viewing it on a phone.  If you install it on a tablet, then you will see the screens look the same as the screenshots that you see on the page.  There is, obviously, not enough room to put all that extra eye-candy on the screen if you have a small view of a phone... that would make the data look small.  I use a 10\\" tablet.<br /><br />As far as the app is concerned, I have only started to play with it. I doubt it will replace what I currently use (which is Calengoo).  This app doesn't seem to sync my google tasks with the system, which bugs me.  I think it looks nice, but feel that with how great Calengoo is, I don't see it being great enough to pushing me to using it over that.
0307593312|1.0|I am amazed that there are such positive reviews for this book.  I have rarely read a book that I found to be actually agonizing to get through. I kept reading because it is supposed to be a great, best selling book and thought there would be some redeeming quality if I stuck it out. There are so many repetitious passages, a perpetual reliving of events in the character's lives. We may do that as human's, but in literature... we get it already, if we are paying attention. There are so many inane conversations throughout that it actually became exhausting. It has been touted as genre free.  Correct.  It is not a love story, it is not a thriller, it is not a fantasy, it is not general literature, it just nothing. I HATED this book. No, really, I HATED this book. I don't care how it turned out.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|A good book to read.  I liked it a lot.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Absolutely loved it. I did accidentally purchase the electronic copy from the Amazon  Kindle store. It was the one click of doom, because once you buy any software or electronic movies, returns, and refunds are not allowed according to the rules and regulations agreement you sign when you agree. I actually thought I was buying a DVD, not a download. Since I only have a wifi Kindle Reader, I couldn't watch it, or even download it to my device. I read every support related article, and saw that I could stream it to the Amazon App on my PS 3. I installed the Amazon App, and was asked to sign in. I don't have Prime, so I signed in using my Amazon user name and password. After watching the circular &#34;PS3 I'm busy&#34; icon, the App was installed. Great, yeee haaaa, I can watch it, but nooooooo. I was prompted to enter a 5 digit PIN number. Since my kid gave it to me for Xmas, I didn't have a PIN. I finally (after 15 minutes), received on-line help. That person needed to transfer me to someone else, and I was able to create a PIN. Moral, let the buyer beware. As exciting, and awesome this movie was, I was barely able to stay awake due to all the red tape!
B00002MV1V|4.0|I love when Duke grooves on jazzy Brazilian or Latin flares.  Sometimes there are vocals that I don't care for, but they grow on you it you don't listen with too critical of an ear.  Very upbeat, albeit old school fusionish.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The high scores listed they compare your score with are intimidating and seem impossible to achieve I also have had trouble with cards turning over to the next three when I was trying to pick the one turned up But the game is fun to  play and goes fast-  especially since they shuffle for you.
B008469DGY|5.0|It's fun to beat your score. Holes in one take some effort. Great graphics, lots of fun. The game is addictive.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I had read both the good and bad reviews. The good were so good I wanted to believe them. Well I am on my 4th mp3 player from Finis and still do not have a working one. The first would not be recognized by my computer. I called customer service and they sent me a second one. This one was recognized but would not play any music. I called customer service again and after a bit of trouble shooting they upgraded me to the next model,the Neptune. This one worked for 15 minutes in the pool then stopped working and the screen had separated. At this time I was frustrated with the time spent and was ready to give up. They sent me an e-mail with a coupon and I responded, why would I want to buy another product from them if I could not get three to work? They then sent me a 4th mp3 player and this one will not work because the battery will not charge. The 15 minutes of music I had while swim was very good but it was not worth the time or money spent on it. The people at the company were friendly and supportive but that does not help if they can not send out a product that works.
1401938906|5.0|had a hard time putting down the book down.  the first excursive worked the next day I got a humming bird to stand in front of my hand for a few minutes.
159463176X|5.0|I bought an unabridged audio copy of Khaled Hosseini's novel at Costco. At first, I had trouble keeping track of all the characters that at first didn't always seem connected. Eventually I discovered that the characters were not the real story.<br /><br />The novel starts and ends with a young rural Afghan brother and sister who are devoted to each other. Soon, they are separated when the father sells his young daughter to a wealthy Afghan couple living in Kabul.<br /><br />As the scenes and chapters move along, there is a kaleidoscope of characters that may be confusing at first, but the real story is a multi-generational history of Afghanistan that covers decades with a multitude of characters linked to one another--even when they do not know each other there still is a tenuous link of some kind--starting well before the Soviet invasion and ending with the American led Afghan occupation and conflict that still rages today.<br /><br />If you are interested in the transformational and violent history of Afghanistan and its traumatized culture, I highly recommend this story.<br /><br />I found that the accents of the actors who produced the audio book were sometimes hard to follow but that did not stop me from enjoying the story.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good, clear, simple directions. what more Is there left to say? I do not know, but I am required to.
B008I43DYU|3.0|Just a standard calculator.<br />Not great, but cheap enough.<br />Works well enough for my purposes, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Would be great if it had a &#34;tape&#34; feature!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It took a while to get into this book. There was nothing about it that stayed with me other than its more like a fairy tale.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was great!  It is unique and origional compared to many show I've watched. I can't wait for next season!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I found the album to be very classic in feel yet with the modern beat I can get my younger children to listen to it.  It also works in the gym to lift to.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I had not considered the effects from this perspective.  I enjoyed the various story lines and characters in this book.  I wanted to read it because I loved The Kite Runner.  I was not disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is one of the best sources of information at the touch of a fingertip. Never boring and hours of entertainment.
020530902X|5.0|I found this book to be very easy to comprehend. And the size makes it very easy to carry around if I every need a little &#34;help&#34;.
B000Q67876|5.0|This is a great film to have in my Blu-ray collection. Although the guilt or innocence of the primary character is never explained in full, his persistence in dealing with the &#34;system&#34; is inspiring.
B008469DGY|5.0|Kewl!! FunTime-Waster, Looks Purty! Loads And Plays Super fast On My RAZR. Definitely My Favorite Free Game App By Far. Stay Classy, Amazon!
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great game. Most addictive trying to conqueror three decks atm. Do I want to give up, not ever! Even have myself on a schedule to beat Spider, read books, beat Spider, etc. Try it the first win feels good. ;)
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Me and my nieces and of course my sister love to play this one. they have actually liked it so much they down loaded it on there IPAD'S tablets and also phones. Not much to it but just boxing but you have a two player option which makes it fun.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Really love it.  The only search engine I use to search for apps, stories, purchases, books, products and much more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have not gotten the hang of this one but it is enjoyable. Not a bad game at all, my son like it too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and gives mor options in your search for scripture especially when listening to a sermon and searching.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is fun although sometimes after playing it for a while the screen goes black and I have to close the game and open it up again.
0399159347|5.0|I haven't read any of Liane's Moriarty's other books, and I'm not even sure how I learned of this one, but I'm so glad I did!  Like others have said, it IS an easy read, I love the way she made the characters in the book, and the way she ended the book REALLY makes you think.  I now plan to read her other books, and I highly recommend this one!
B0068TJLSY|3.0|The pace and the cinematography was good but the story was a bit weak that ended up, for me, as just another &#34;only the kids understand aliens&#34; movie.  Perhaps all the special effects and surround sound would have made for a more exciting viewing on a big screen but on my small iPad screen, the experience was just so-so -making the story line and character development much more important, which I thought was lacking.<br /><br />That said, this movie is a satisfactory way to idle away an hour and suspend your world for an hour.
0399160450|4.0|I do enjoy a book that will take me away for a good while! In this case, the 800+ pages kept me occupied for a couple of days and each time I put it down, I looked forward to going back for more.  What fun!<br /><br />I can only image how much research goes into creating a story that includes governmental intrigue, political pressures, bureaucratic input, military procedures, weapons systems, and so on.  I sincerely appreciate all the effort that it takes.<br /><br />I've not read any of the other books in this series, but I quite enjoyed Clancy's taking me on this espionage/spy thriller adventure.  There are so many parallels in the story to things in the headlines (or perhaps hidden in the interior pages) on a daily basis.  The story really made me think about those entrusted with keeping us safe--their history, ideology, integrity--or lack thereof, experience--or lack thereof, qualifications--or lack thereof, and so on, and so on. . . .  So, in the end, while I don't generally tend toward horror stories, this one had a way of dishing up a bit of that as well.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|This is powerful morality play wrapped in the guise of a really cool scifi premise - what more could you ask for??
B007M45PMU|3.0|Let's face it, Amazon shoved this down our throats.  Non-stop push for these guys.  Good record though.  A bit too &#34;happy&#34; sometimes maybe but that's not always a bad thing.  I think the trend and the push of these guys might have turned me off a bit so we'll see if this record holds up months from now for me.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|It's good to see Bruce Willis in this type of role for a change.<br />The whole group makes this movie fun.
B009P13RQY|4.0|Another great release.  Think I liked the previous effort a bit more but this is still solid.  Great riffs, great grooves
159463176X|5.0|What can you say about a deal like this than can i get another book?  everything was as advertised and hassle-free.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|one of the best shows out there and they have relesed the books that are written in the show the Nikki Heat series. plus it has the great Mal Renoylds- Nathon Fillion who is a great actor.
B002CSC5EC|4.0|The production was done well. Can't say the film footage is BlueRay quality, but the music is. Great to think back on those times with this movie.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|Intricately plotted, written with verve, the novel must be read to be believed.  I just finished my tenth rereading and it remains a miracle.  What makes it so?  First, there is the palpable sense of place - you feel New Orleans come alive, even though this reader has never been there, and even though it is firmly anchored in the New Orleans of the early 1960s.  The dialect is amazing, even when it could easily become offensive.  It is reflective of the time and place, not patronizing (and this goes for every character).  Second, there is the breathtaking speed with which incidents are misconstrued and recast.  Ignatius J Reilly (IJR) has a worldview that is constantly at odds with the century and his pronouncements are so thunderous and articulate that his listeners fall in line.  The doddering Trixie becomes a sage, Mrs Reilly becomes overly dependent on her wine, and Darlene becomes a devotee of Boethius.  None of this makes objective sense, granted, but the intricacies pile up to a conclusion that is revelatory in its brilliance
B00802EYDO|5.0|I have this album on cd and enjoy it a lot, but I wanted to hear how it sounded on higher resolution Blu-ray. Man, it is impressive! The sound is more believable and clear, and the percussion really snaps. There are two mixes available, high res stereo or high res surround sound. The surround mix is subtle but pleasant, but most of my listening has been two channel. If you enjoy her music and have the set up to play this from your Blu-ray player, grab it! You will enjoy it and you will support the high resolution format of Blu-day Music.
B0026NBZDU|5.0|Maybe I could have, but I didn't want to put it down.<br />Victorian life, high and low, brought vividly to life.<br />Wildly improbable, but wildly enjoyable plot twists and turns,<br />plus a bit of titillating Victorian porn thrown in.<br />Ms. Waters is an amazing writer. I'll be back.
B005DD7H50|5.0|-It has been a while since I have seen this movie. If you need a little pick-up in your world, watch this movie.  Sad that it is no longer available for unlimited streaming on Amazon nor Netflix.  This is one of a kind stuff!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This move kept my attention from beginning to end. I watched it with my grandchildren and we all enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Had it two days on my Kindle that is only a year and a half old and MAYBE has a total use of 3 months and it killed the KIndle!! not sure if he played to long and the Kindle got over heated...just bummed!! Not sure if I will be purchasing another Kindle after reading about this happening alot! Looking at other options.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is good because you can make a world with your mind.  You can use your imagination and creativity.  It is fun to play for hours.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I always play it. I play it when I'm bored and make many maps. I recommend it with 5  stars
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|I literally couldn't put it down and really didn't want it to end! I wish there was a follow on story! I bought this on my kindle and am now going to go buy a hard copy for my bookshelf. You won't regret buying this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Best app for books and apps on Android or Kindle, with  large variety for both.  Easy to use. One is able to switch to Amazon in an instant or from Amazon to Kindle. Recommended to me by a friend, now I'm recommending to others! Thanks Amazon & Kindle for creating your partnership!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|finished it in two sittings. Now my husband is reading it and he doesn't like fiction.  He's a slow reader but can't put it down so I think he'll be through today.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun. Love playing this app. Wish you could win more coins or loads of bananas. But still very fun funfun game.
B0072NWJRK|2.0|It wasn't my cup of tea.  Had to read it and had a hard time staying interested.  I wouldn't recommend it even though other book club members liked it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cannot read another book although I tried shortly after finishing this one. I felt as though I have not properly mourned the characters, have not given them the time to seep in and give them my due respect. In case you can't tell...this book got to me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game the kids love it as well as I do ill try the next one when you get more.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Yes, excellent.  We want more! The best sci-fi series of all time needs to have more episodes.  Everybody grab your pitchforks and torches so we can demand more Firefly!
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Great physics-based, cool animation, strange but funnystory.<br /><br />Needs more enemies and stages, some other special things to \\"tennis in da face\\".<br /><br />This is a game you won't regret.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The start of a great series. I had seen bits and pieces of it before but now I am happy to see the entire series from the beginning. Michael Chiklis' character is a very likable guy.
B00AFEY354|5.0|After reading the book I wanted to see the movie, and once I did I was so impressed. I love the actors, music, story and literally everything about it. I have watched this movie many times since purchasing it.
B004KA9UXO|5.0|Even better 2nd time around - I first read it in 1966!  I'm looking forward to also re-reading the sequels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book it is much better than the movies,it was fun to read when there was a power out or a storm
B009KCUX3S|3.0|The book seemed excessively long. The pictures, verbose explanations, and cutesy names became more of an annoyance after a few chapters. The authors &#34;sideline&#34; details/aspects of Java that don't necessarily apply to the music box program. Nevertheless, these details/aspects are important, especially if you're not going to be making a music program!<br /><br />If you're new to Java, I recommed Herbert Schildt's Java A Beginner's Guide. It explains the foundational aspects of Java in a relatively straightforward way.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|No more erasers. Learn the game without pressure or aggravation. Learn and then get better, beating your own time/scores. Fun!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this genre to get its big screens dues and this whole effort is hitting on the mark. Add in for a bonus of direction of Joss &#34;The Man&#34; Whedon....I am a happy viewer, and reviewer, and review :-) Well done!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Some things are too small to find. If you could zoom in it would be easier but some of the objects are literally impossible to find.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I love this movie.  I got it for my co-work who had never seen it.  It's a must see especially if you work in corporate America.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|My school-age son loves this game. He likes being able to choose being the Samurai or the zombie, and being.able to choose different players of each. He also likes the features such as mini-games, leveling up items and bonus waves. As a parent I like that it is not graphically violent; zombies just disappear when defeated.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|The movie started off well. Over time, it really, really did fall in love with itself and everyone involved seemed to believe they were making the most brilliant movie ever made. I think around the teleportation scene, I stopped taking the movie seriously, because everything started to get really contrived and confusing. It honestly is one of the most pretentious movies I have ever seen. I have no idea how it made it into theaters. It should win a Razzie, but thanks to the large amount of pretentious intellectual wannabes out there, I know they will overrate this movie to kingdom come.<br /><br />Stay away, you've been warned.
0345803485|1.0|I downloaded this when I was stuck at LAX because of all the hype, and when I got on the plane and started reading, I wanted to stand up and start screaming at the other passengers because I was SHOCKED at how horrible the writing was. I could go on at length about everything I hated about it -- boring, repetitive dumb phrases, juvenile writing -- but beyond all that, the lead male character was not the least bit interesting or attractive and was, in fact, completely creepy and revolting, as well as abusive. Nothing about him was compelling enough to make me want to continue turning the pages and though I tried, I could not press on. There were 50 Splendid Reasons on almost every page for the reader to feel cheated and irritated, and I ended up wondering how it is that well-written books are sometimes overlooked while a schlubby bloated spatula-sex gigglefest like this one becomes a bestseller. Makes me wonder about the intelligence of the general reading public. So, no redeeming qualities here. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad idiotic stupid, oh my. And that sentence I just wrote is a better effort than most in this book. Skip it for sure.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this again.  It's the classic love story, boy meets girl, boy and girl hate each other, boy and girl fight, girl realizes she just blew her best chance for happiness, runs into his arms, and all is forgiven.  Too bad life doesn't work that way!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars is because it lags sometimes causing my run to end. Other than that it is a very fun game and helps when you're stuck somewhere and bored.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great series, its fun to read and then watch the book come to life on HBO, too bad it's gonna take until spring 2014 to see the second half of this book
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Wow! What insight into our world. Sheryl Sandberg offers a funny and deliberate look into how we can all make a difference in our future. As a mother who has worked and stayed at home, it gives me hope that my daughters can achieve any goal they set!<br />stephaniefink811@yahoo
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Addictive, fun, found out there are a bunch of other versions out there, checked out a few on the apple app store and they were crap in comparison.
0345803485|5.0|All my friends and family have given this book great reviews. Therefore, I had to purchase it so I could read and give my opinion of it.
B009NPLIFE|5.0|Gossip Girl, the series, was so enjoyable could not stop watching the episodes.  Casting was great and story line was so enjoyable.  only problem was that I watched it on Netflix and they stopped at season 5.<br />that is why I had to order season six from Amazon and find out the rest of the story.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I bought two of these devices one for me and one for my wife. They worked for awhile but now they have stopped syncing. We have both separately contacted the manufacturer and they have not responded. It has been 3 days without any support. For the price paid it seems like this is becoming a bait and switch.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I found the silly British humor and scifi nature of this show to make it quite good. And the acting wasn't half bad either
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Have to unlock whole game too early but fun to play.  Will try others by this publisher.  Hopefully the quality Will be the same.<br />Www.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I really like this game. You'll find yourself thinking this is so easy, it will show you. It's a little more crafty than you thought!  Really think it's lots of fun and keeps you on your e toes.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I like this CD.  I ordered it and didn't bother to notice it is the the &#34;complete confection&#34; which includes more songs.....I hate when artists do this.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|My first Kindle Paperwhite, bought at London Gatwick Airport a couple of weeks ago. Enjoyed every chapter. Read it by the pool every morning at my Spanish residence
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this and I must admit that I am known to play it as well. Wonderful game and the fact that it was free make it a must have for anyone who enjoys Despicable Me.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Its a cool physics game. But different levels and blowing things up is cool. The graphics are really good. Like it a lot.
071815780X|5.0|I have watched his cooking show numerous times and I finally decided to see if it's really 15min. Everything he whips up looks so easy and delicious.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Okay, I'm a pvz fan already - this version is a little different from my pc version, but has the things I know and love and I enjoy it.  Great game, worth every cent.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|So-so. Some good effects (however derivative), some good actors, but it's basically a Norwegians-in-distress exercise with an American actress in the lead and, following the standard feminist template, she is the only level-headed one in the group.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|A nice twist on the game &#34;memory&#34; - making it more fun and the graphics are a blast - especially appealed to my young son.  Fun, increasingly challenging, not your average 'memory' game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Since Comcast xfinity removed Season 3 from its On Demand program, Amazon Prime streaming is the best way to watch this fabulous show
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Bought for my two year old boy who loves rockets.  It really is very durable and easy for little hands.  just the right size.  The top of the rocket twists off and the little man sits or stands inside (when standing, you can see his face through the windows).  The man's helmet does not come off and the arms and legs are not posable, but his head twists and he bends in the middle - really those are downers for older kids, but perfect for a toddler.  It is just a great toy - and quite a bargain for the price!
B00E978FGQ|2.0|The movie started off great with all the grandness and lights and hoopla!!! All of a sudden it fell to....blah! It was long and drawn out and something was missing. Seems they were trying to fill out the time frame and just added more and more to the movie. There was so much in it and it could have ended sooner. I was expecting a better movie and I was sorely disappointed. I would recommend others watch it, but I wouldn't tell them 'it's a GREAT movie'....I'd tell them to watch it if you are bored and have time on your hands! All the hype over this and frankly I was quite over it after 45 minutes......what a shame with such great actors too.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book has a different vibe and plot than the rest of the series.  I like it a lot - it and the first are my favorites, but while it flows seamlessly from the previous novel, the tone and problems and BELLA are all soooo different that it really may not appeal to all fans.
B00640UICA|5.0|It's a very fun game! You will have a ball playing this game! Fun,fun,fun and more fun!  Don't have more to say!
B0085MNZ66|3.0|The graphics are uninspiring.  The concept clever and challenging.  But it just fails to hold my attention.  I've played several games like this - this one is unique in that you can (and HAVE TO) mix the colors - but it's not my favorite of these types of games.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I played with this app for a solid ten minutes and still couldn't figure out how to get to a month or week view. There are buttons up top that look like they would do it but they all take you to same menu to edit the event you are on.  Glad i didn't pay for this POS. Uninstalling
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett astonished the literary world with The Pillars of the Earth, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England that centered on the building of a cathedral and the men, women, and children whose lives it changed forever. Now, two centuries after the townspeople of Kingsbridge finished building the exquisite edifice, four children slip into the forest and witness a killing-an event that will bind them all by ambition, love, greed, and revenge...
B000O77SOK|5.0|No idea what the studio heads were thinking by the time this series wound down but THE WORST decision the network made was to let this stellar cast of characters and writers slip from their fingers like water through a sieve.  From start to finish, this show outshined the lot and I was deeply sorry and hurt for the cast members near the end for all the controversy that swirled around two main actors/characters in the end - namely Dylan McDermott & Lara Flynn Boyle.  Word on the street was that they found out that they were being let go through the media and not directly from their bosses.  Incredible!  And harder yet to believe was that I couldn't find it on store shelves anywhere when I fully expected a box set release. This has truly been one of the best purchases I've made this year with no regrets.  Fans of the show will be watching this one over and over again for it's character portrayals, storylines and sheer entertainment of some of the best closing arguments ever filmed.  After purchasing this I found a full box set offered elsewhere on the net.  No problem laying my money down for it - it's worth the full E ticket ride.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am very disappointed! Finally set it aside for another book. Life is too short to waste on an uninteresting book. Disappointed
B003M6EAXM|5.0|good series,  Plenty of suspense and action. Must be watched closely as it jumps around alot. all actors play their roll well
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really enjoyed it. It was intriguing, well-written, and full of twists. Esp if you're from MA :) highly recommend !
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|A beautifully written Hosseini masterpiece , punctuated with typically insightful and thought provoking reflections on the human condition . This author has such a gift for writing that he could make a Sunday afternoon tea party sound enthralling . A must for anyone who has enjoyed any of his previous novels .
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Although this game seems competitive, it is quite relaxing. Things tend to float into position based on the angle the dotted line goes in. Nothing is what it seems and gravity, or non-gravity determines whether you make your mark. There is more concentration and strategy to this game with a slow fizz for added elevation.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is one of the best thrillers I have ever read . It is credible , realistically disturbing and unpredictable . A very &#34;out of the box&#34; thriller . The author makes some disturbingly honest and thought provoking observations on marriage . A most memorable read !
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This is not only a weight loss program, health also. Its all done with alittle fun. Ferriss is such a good writer.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This serie is full of actions and fears. I like the way the casting is made. Actions are so real you feel you are in action (!).
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My 4 year-old (almost 5 ) daughter absolutely loves this movie with the singing and dancing. It's wonderful! It isn't scary at all which is nice to have for a movie option these days.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Took awhile to get into it, but then I was hooked.  Best if watched all in one sitting, no interruptions---and it's long!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|It was a very entertaining movie. Made you want to keep watching it and really watch to know what was going on.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Everyone loves Forrest Gump!  One of the best all time movies.  And Tom Hanks does a suburb job!!  And how true his famous saying, Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Plot twists never end, and I enjoyed reading every page of this book. It's a little different from the other tow. Without giving anything away, you might find yourself hating a few of your favorite characters for a while, but that's what makes it a good book.  If you read the first two books in the series, you will like this one as well.
0062255657|5.0|There are books are you read for pleasure, and then there are books that leave a lasting impression and change who you are at the core of your being. This is definitely one of the latter.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Loved this book as much as the first three in the series, and will buy the ret of them as well (#6 and 7 as soon as they get published).
B003NX76BM|5.0|Made me laugh, then made me get tears eyed! Suspenseful and found myself reading faster and faster to find out what happened next! I love dogs, so this book was one of the best!!!
B005KJ6ECY|1.0|Well, I'm sure I would have loved it, if only i could have actually watched it. USA is in Region 1 and Region 2 products don't work in Region 1 DVD players. HOwever, the company I purchased the set from was EXCELLENT to work with in returning and getting a refund!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My 3 year old grandson love playing this on my Kindle. Some of the shark attacks are a little graphic, but he doesn't think so.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Was a good game, not my favorite; however graphics were good hint good, very short game though. Took quite a long time to download. I had to uninstall 3 times but I was determined to play it. I am running out of games.
B003GK21OE|3.0|I love this author - but this book was confusing and, at times, boring!<br />Did not find it an easy read
B008KYWMZO|5.0|True size. Weightless! Very comfy and nice looking. I ordered gray/silver for my mom to fit most of her clothes. They came within 2 days! Thank you!
B000JJRIO8|5.0|ANOTHER 5 STAR ALBUM; TO ME THIS ALBUM SOUNDS LIKES WHAT IT WOULD SOUND LIKE IF PAC WAS STILL ALIVE. (5 STARS EASY).
1439110123|5.0|I think that this book came in extremely good condition.  It also is quite interesting.  I didn't think I would enjoy the history of oil, but it is in fact written very well.
B009F7ORQW|4.0|Fun color, lots of other action figures fit in it, too, so my son is as happy as my daughter. Only drawback is that the mirrors are little smooshy plastic pieces that come off all the time. Would be a chking hazard to a little one - once removed, though, it is fine.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Used to read documents, perhaps it gives option to modify also.<br />very simple local file explorer,<br />Most useful for the people deals with documents in cloud
0920668372|4.0|My husband is convinced it's creepy... I can't say I blame him. Who sneaks into their grown child's room? Seriously. Cut the cord.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|Simple setup to connect to your desktop in the same network.<br />would prefer connecting desktops without any software installation in the desktop or laptop.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you want to get caught up in a web of mind of moves that keep you thinking this is it.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|This is move than I hoped for, and developed the main characters much more. It is a very satisfying season.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Can check the local weather and weather in other parts of the country via my kindle.  Good app that I use daily.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This whole series jumps all over the place, and doesn't feel grounded, like the subject says it's too simple but i'm so far i just keep trudging through to the end.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Bought a new tail light assembly for my van via ebay that I found while surfing with my kindle.  Very easy to use.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great writers and great actors. Never boring, sexy, and fun.  My husband and I enjoyed the whole season.  Compared to Boston Legal.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|If I have to use my kindle for business this app should be helpful.  Haven't used it as of yet.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I am used to more action in a book, and so this seemed to drag a bit, but the twists and turns were intriguing.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Loved this show when it was on the air and now getting to watch it again on my kindle.  Love my kindle.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I. Love bingo blitz but when I updated it Iost all my points,levels,etc.  And I do not like the  New formats. My rating  now 2. I don't know if I'll keep it.  Unless I get everything back.
B0033CTKHG|3.0|You have to have previously seen at least four or five of the original Sean Connery James Bond movies to appreciate this flick.  It very successfully spoofs every Bond cliché ever committed to film.  I'm sure the cast (and a great cast it is) had a blast doing it.
B004X80QNG|3.0|This seems to be a pretty decent app. It does synchronize nicely with my Google calendar, but was not user friendly in setting up. The colors were extremely bright, which made it look cartoonish, but in a few minutes I got the colors looking ok. I never really got it looking as good as the default calender that came on my Galaxy S4. The month view just looks clunky, but the selection of view styles is nice. Although the functionality seems ok, after downloading a patch to prevent losing data, it just looks childish to me.  Not at all what I'd want a business associate to see. It really is a shame, because I had high hopes for it. For a Free App if the Day, it's definitely worth a look, but  not worth the big price tag otherwise.
140006922X|5.0|I love History and the study of Religions.  Reza is able to look at Christianity and Jesus of Nazareth from a Historical point of view.  who the Historical Jesus was and How and the Roots of Christianity, the Who The Why The When!!!<br /><br />This is a History Jesuits are taught in Seminary Colleges.  It is NOT and attack on Christianity as a Faith.  Reza does NOT attack Jewish or Muslim Faiths he gives us his interpretation of the Historical Data relating to them!!!<br /><br />Fast Reading Excellent writing well documented!!<br /><br />Reza Aslan is a Premier writer with the ability to write the History of Ancient History and make it read like a Novel a truly gifted Writer!!!<br /><br />I am looking forward taking a Class with Reza I am sure he is a very special Teacher and Human Being!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really don't play, however my son and his maw maw (my mom) can't seem to put it down.  They even have a quick link to an incubation website to see which Dragons will hatch from which eggs.  It's addictive!!! Or maybe it's just that fun.  I guess you will just have to try it out for yourself.
0307730700|5.0|When I first received Fearless by Eric Blehm to review, I wasn't sure it was going to be \\"my style\\" of book. Honestly, I had seen it before and always thought it seemed more like a \\"guy book\\" since it is about a Navy Seal. I will be the first to admit that I was wrong. It is a book anyone can pick up, be sucked into, and enjoy.<br /><br />Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. In fact, it even accompanied me to work one day because I couldn't bear to wait until that night to pick up where I had left off. The book chronicles the life of Adam Brown, a Navy Seal Team SIX Operator. Adam doesn't have the typical start in life that one would picture for a Navy Seal as drugs and alcohol take over his life after high school. In fact, as I read I thought, How in the world did this guy end up becoming a Navy SEAL?<br /><br />This book wasn't what I expected. It was more than just the story of a Navy SEAL. It was a book that paints an incredible picture of just how radically the Lord can change your life when you let Him. The book chronicled his spiritual journey alongside his professional journey in the Navy. The spiritual aspect of Adam Brown's life had me hooked. No matter what was thrown his way, when Adam sought the Lord first, it was amazing what happened in the life of him and his family.<br /><br />You need to read this book. Yes, need. Adam Brown's story needs to be spread and I promise that you will be glad you read it. I'll warn you now though; if you take my advice, have a box of tissue ready. This book could make a grown man tear up.<br /><br /> I am so thankful for the opportunity to read this book and to learn about Adam and his family. I can't wait to pass it on.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed in this review are my own and may differ from yours.
0679731369|4.0|Flaubert's Parrot made for quite a split opinion in our book club.  Some felt the experimentation with structure (chapters structured as chronologies, dictionaries and even exam questions were reminiscent of our earlier read of A Visit from the Good Squad), and the interaction of principal \\"characters\\" (Flaubert, Braithwaite and even Barnes) from different levels, more than made up for the lack of a traditional narrative.  Others felt that what was interesting for some -- the development of the narrator from unreliable to intrusive to likely unstable, the adultery/suicide parallel between Emma Bovary and Ellen Braithwaite, the irony of irony on LitCrit and celebrity culture, and the metaphorical question of which was the real parrot being parroted -- were obvious from a kilometer away.  The mediator was sympathetic to both views, and graded it on a spectrum from C for entertainment to A+ for intellectual engagement.  All-in it got around a B, but with a standard deviation as big as Flaubert's ego or Barnes' ambition.  And all-in it was more \\"interesting\\" than a breezy read.  The discussion was enlightening to all in understanding others' perceptions of an unusual piece of artistic work.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the detail on this app but can get a bit busy. The hour by hour temperature forecast is really nice!
B000ZP813S|5.0|they arrived today they fit perfect haven't wore them yet they are for work my 12 hour shift tomorrow will tell me how they hold up thank you.
142311339X|5.0|I love these stories by Rick Riordan.  This is the first one of this series and I can't wait to read them all.  I wish they came out sooner
B005I6EVUG|5.0|love the kindle fire cover. fits perfect. sturdy and protects my kindle. love the color and feel of the cover
0143038419|5.0|I was shocked to see the ratings at anything less than a 3 stars.  What are people thinking?  I wonder what element the negative reviewers have in common...I'm thinking ANGER, or maybe JEALOUSY?  Here's a newsflash... the reason the book is ME ME ME as some criticizers say, is because it's about HER HER HER.<br /><br />This was an honest and personal account of the author's experiences in her attempt to get over depression, a divorce and another broken relationship and ultimately get in better communion with God.  Set against a backdrop of Italy, India and Indonesia, the author's progress is presented with an informative and interesting infusion of the foreign cultures that she was visiting.  She got her fill, so to speak, of what she needed at each stop with the help of a colorful cast of characters and then moved on.  And each place and new friend was instrumental in contributing to her growth.<br /><br />The author reveals her human weaknesses honestly and combined with her quirky personality traits, make her very likable.  A delightful book!
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Everyone has already said it......probably the best release from the Beatles.<br />But a lot of Beatle fans would be very surprised to learn that they argued in almost every session after the first two albums.<br />I've been listening to the out takes from their last five albums, and tensions were high then. Paul and John always butted heads on who sang what....since they wrote most of the songs.<br />In one session you can hear George say \\" that's my song and I'm gonna sing it..period.<br />I found these cd's in a yard sale more than 10 years ago and they pretty much showed how things went in the studio. John walking out, Paul walking out, George saying hes not getting any respect and even Georges wife saying \\"I love to hear George sing, so let him sing............Then came Yoko and all H broke loose for the band. Many say she didn't break up the bans...but listen to the session tapes and its clear she had input that the others did not like.<br />But they put most aside and created the BEST music that rock-n-roll ever heard.<br />George later showed his tremendous talent with the WILBURYS and make history with them.<br />He also went on tour in JAPAN to get away from it all..........but he didn't know the music and Eric Clapton went with him and kept and did all the back up, including<br />wooing away Georges wife.........who has also wrote a \\"kiss and tell\\" book.<br />All in all.....The Beatles can't be beat.<br />ABBEY ROAD tops them all.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved how the three stories mixed together and yet they were still separate.  The characters were great and makes you realize you don't always know others like you think.  Great stories!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It's interesting how lawyers have to create and present their case. And I thought how clever and convincing the story was of his client, and a very good ending!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I absolutely love Ariana. I've been looking forward to this album ever since she announced it would be released. The album has amazing vocals as I would expect from her because she is crazy talented at singing. One of my absolute favorites on the album is Tattooed Heart. Not only are the vocals amazing, but the song is extremely catchy for a slow song. Love the whole album overall and would recommend to everyone.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|It should be read it by everybody who are interested to know why we are in the mess we are right now, here and there. His approach to solve the problems sounds naive, but maybe it is worth to try?
B00DLKXF3A|1.0|Terrible, Terrible, Terrible,,,really expected something original and progressive like there previous albums.. too bad....btw metallicas black album was the beginning of the end for them, as well
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My granddaughters love all of the Dr. Panda games.  I have them on my phone and my kindle.  Have gotten most of them as FAOD so I really like them too!
B00AEFYCL4|1.0|Git this movie, said it was new, still in plastic...plastic was done poorly.  Half way through the movie, the movie started flickering and eventually shut off!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This story about Jesus of Nazareth, the man behind Jesus the Christ, is fascinating. Aslan's is able to present his logic and deduction in a way that is (most of the times) easy to follow by the layman reader and his arguments are convincing. Thank you Mr. Aslan, for sharing your views and adding to my knowledge about Jesus and Christianity in general!
B00000I5Y6|3.0|I was never really a huge Kansas fan.  In fact, this disc is the only disc by them I own.  But to compare them to Queen as did one reviewer...honestly?  No, I wouldn't do that.<br /><br />Kansas had a few songs most people know.  Carry On My Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind are the two most recognized.  Yes, they are here and represented just the way they were on the radio.  That's nice enough.  And for the price of this disc, those two songs are well worth it.  Can I remember anything else about them or this album?  Sadly, no.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Drama, joy, romance, despair, anger, conniving, tragedy, laughter, love. With bonus Americans. You just can't go wrong with Downton Abbey.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This was a terrible app. If you want A fun hair doing game then download toca hair salon best salon app ever. Anyways this was a crappy game and ZERO STARS
B000MQCSBQ|5.0|It was an excellent movie. It wasn't a boring movie. I would recommend anyone that likes action movies to purchase it.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would enjoy this game, but I loved the storyline and the game was full of moments where your jaw is left hanging open! It's full of twists and turns. There is a lot of dialogue, so if you usually like to skip over dialogue then this isn't the game for you, but if you enjoy a great story and a game that involves a lot of decision making .... this game will provide hours of fun!!! I loved it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Being a Christian I was somewhat hesitant about this book but it was really interesting.  It explained a lot of the &#34; disconnects&#34; I've noticed between different parts of the New Testament.  Definately worth a read whatever your religious background.  I loved it.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|At first, I hesitated to buy this sticker pad because there are so many loose pieces to keep track off.  Now that I bought it, I think that worry is no-biggie.  If one piece is lost, use another.  They are pretty interchangeable; even between scenes.<br /><br />TIP 1)<br />- remove white borders and discard for all sticker pages; be careful not to discard some stickers by mistake<br />- this helps little ones to select and take stickers off page easily; easier for storing them back onto the sticker page afterwards also<br />TIP 2)<br />- remove scene pages from the pad<br />- this eliminates flipping back and forth between stickers and scenes<br />- keeps sticker pages in pad for ease of storage; loose stickers come off everywhere if you fling the sticker pages<br />TIP 3)<br />- bring out one or two scenes at a time<br />- do not need to overwhelm them; also keep this pad refreshing<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this sticker pad for little ones (4yr+) that love to use tons of stickers every day.  This pad will save you money.  Would stay away from this pad if your little ones (and/or have siblings) that still put things in mouth.<br /><br />I removed one star because I am not sure of the educational value and the shoes are too plain (need to have more design).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first it was a little weird because it was very erotic but after a few chapters, I got really into it and enjoyed the book! The story line is great and you really get to know the characters :) would definitely recommend it
B0071BGOJC|4.0|History told in a very interesting and entertaining way. Hopefully future generation will remember and not make the same mistakes again. I wonder about the next book maybe a view on Asia?
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I hadn't heard of Jack Reacher until someone mentioned the books on Twitter. I was intrigued so I bought the first book. I really enjoyed the plot twists and interesting characters. I'm a big fan of a mystery and everytime I thought I had it figured out, I'd find myself guessing again as a new twist developed. It's a little gruesome with the murder descriptions, but considering the nature of the killer, not unbelievable. Great read!
B00C5R8364|5.0|All-out action, a clever plot and lots of technical detail on boys' toys. This book is fun to read and that is why I bought it.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I loved the movie and the music soundtrack is great.  The music is great to listen for all ages and all music types.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the Husbands Secret.  It kept my interest from the first line.  I liked it so much I ordered 2 more books of Liane Moriarty books.  I saw it advertised in People magazine and it sounded good so I ordered it.  I see she is 3rd on the bestseller list.  That should tell you something.<br />Kathy Steele
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|The book opens with a horrific scene of Stephen taped to the bed with his wife.  A stranger looms over them, taunting and terrifying them before brutally murdering his wife.  From there, the book turns to Max and Jesse, a newly paired set of detectives working this case.  They don't see eye to eye on most things and the complications of their relationship make an interesting backdrop for this tale of a man gone insane.<br /><br />I want to go on and on about the twists and turns this story takes, but I'm afraid I might get carried away and spoil some of the best parts!  The tone of the story and the interesting characters reminded me a bit of NCIS, which is one of my favorite shows.  I think people who like NCIS or anything like that will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Be warned, there are scenes of graphic violence, somewhat gross descriptions of mangled body parts and the usual sort of crime drama gore.  Not everyone will be able to sit through these sorts of scenes, but they are brief and the author handles them as tastefully as possible.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Reading this to my 5th grade students and they love it! They beg me to read more every day. Such an awesome message for young students.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Having just recently read and loved Mr. O'Brien's other book, [[ASIN:B005JTAP4S Peter: A Darkened Fairytale]], this collection of poems was a lovely addition to the world I came to know in the first book.  Some of them were taken from the story of Peter and reminded me of parts of the book, taking me back into the story in a really cool sort of way.  The new poems were enchanting, engaging and the turns of phrase used for some of them just blew me away!<br /><br />Even if you haven't read the other book, this is a delightful collection from a truly inspired writer.  I have the eBook edition, and I am keeping my fingers crossed that there will eventually be a physical book because I believe all poetry should be on paper!<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of fairy tales, William O'Brien's work or just those who love good poetry.<br /><br />**I received an ARC in exchange for a fair & honest review**
0425263924|3.0|Sylvia Day is a good writer. I like her characters and I like her dialogue. But I initially picked this book up because I wanted a romance. And it still is, but I also feel like there have been so many additional characters and throw in a murder scandal and I feel like we have a bunch of odd plot devices just to keep extending the series. Maybe this is where she intended to go all along, but it just felt like this book was \\"filler\\" and not really leading us anywhere. Big things happen, don't get me wrong, and the big issue that happens in book number 2 definitely needed a book to be hashed out. But there was just so much urgency in this book and with no definitive details on book #4, I was just a little disappointed with how this was left. I will of course continue the series, but this was a bit of a disappointment for me.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked how the book was in letter form. And how you never actually find out who he's writing to, it made me feel like he was writing to me. And all the events in the book was really realistic. It made me feel for Charlie and the way it was written made me feel what he was feeling. This is my favorite book now! :)
1476715904|4.0|This is a hard book to categorize. It definitely skews to a younger \\"new adult\\" audience, but an older YA audience. There are no graphic love scenes, so I am more inclined to call this a YA, but the subject matter is a roller coaster, and the hero is in his twenties so that is where I have a hard time categorizing this as only YA.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover definitely sends her reader on an emotional ride in SLAMMED. Will and Lake have both had huge tragedies occur in their lives, but they seem to be doing better only when the have each other. Fate steps in in a bad way, and as quickly as they come together they are torn apart.<br /><br />This book is filled with angst, harsh realities, but hope and family are ultimately at the core. The slam poetry angle was completely different and a great way to capture a more \\"literary\\" reader.<br /><br />Lake was often times hard to deal with, but she was a teenager and she had her reasons to be angry at the world. I guess being in my twenties I'm able to be a little more retrospective on my own senior year.<br /><br />Overall, great series. And I look forward to getting into POINT OF RETREAT.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I wasn't clear on the fact that this wasn't the game when I downloaded. My fault, I should have read more carefully. Still, it was annoying. I wanted the actual game not help playing it.
030758836X|4.0|Holy hell was this a mind twist. Gillian Flynn did a superb job at making anyone and everyone nervous about their current or future relationship. It was spot on with people pretending to be something else for a significant other, their parents, even themselves. It was spot on in introducing characters and seeing them revealed in a much truer (and harsher) light later. It was spot on with family dynamics, social and societal norms or lack there of. Lies, betrayals, and so much more fills these pages. The first part of the book was by far the strongest. You truly had no idea where this story could go. You are led astray on several different avenues, forced to pick between two unreliable narrators, and forced to seek a truth that may not even exist...or does it? The whole thing up until the very end has you going \\"WTF!!!!\\" This was a thrilling, awesome read. Many people complain about the ending, but after being introduced to Nick and Amy the way we readers were in the first part of the book and seeing everything (or so you may think) they have been through/were going through, I thought it was extremely apropos. Truly a gem and if you have not read it, GO. It is literary, smart, witty, intriguing. If you needed a break from the monotony of romance, this is where to lose yourself...and your mind. WOW!
B00821OX98|5.0|If you're sick of the zombie apocalypses try aliens on for size.... This show packs a great punch with some super characters and top notch writing. Noah Wylie is well within his element as the leader Tom Mason and the supporting cast supplied breadth and depth of story lines plus potential for so many tangential stories.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For all of the New Adult and mature YA I read, I had kept Colleen Hoover on this pedestal where I hadn't really read her yet, but being a pioneer in this genre, I knew I was saving her for a special occasion.<br /><br />That special occasion was HOPELESS and I am so happy/frustrated I let myself wait this long to read this book. HOPELESS was not at all what I expected it to be and that made me like it even more. Sky and Holder, they were really fantastic; their banter, their constantly evolving friendship, their obviously deep connection that seemed to confound everyone and even themselves.<br /><br />The story innocently weaves you through these two jaded souls coming together with little hints here and there that there is much more brewing under the surface. Hoover effortlessly glides her reader through the couple's journey, and the difficult story that ties them inextricably to each other in a forever kind of way, as sappy as that may sound.<br /><br />The story was beautiful, heartbreaking, maddening, sad, lovely, redemptive, and in the end about acceptance and forgiveness done in such a subtle way the reader never feels bashed over the head with candy hearts, flowers, or prescriptive messages.<br /><br />Everything about Sky and Holder was real and I can't wait to read LOSING HOPE. I didn't want the story to end, but it did in the best way possible.<br /><br />For every New Adult, YA, or romance fan, you are truly missing out if you do not pick HOPELESS up...NOW!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Ariana Grande is a great singer, you won't be disappointed if you buy this. It's got a great retro feel to it in some places and modern in others. Fantastic music.
1416955070|2.0|In all honesty, I did not love, nor did I particularly like CITY OF BONES. I have been holding out for years on starting this YA series mostly because of the hoopla surrounding the author and Harry Potter fan fiction, etc. I knew people were/are pretty polarized about their feelings regarding Cassandra Clare and if I was able to pause on a YA series, I let it be this one.<br /><br />I quickly read this installment because I want to see the movie. I haven't yet gone to see it, but I am glad I read the book first. Even seeing the trailer I was able to better understand what was going on or what was missing or added. This book/movie pull and tug is always fun and frustrating at the same time, so in a long-winded explanation that is how I came to this book a few weeks ago.<br /><br />I am glad I waited to read it. It did not pull me in like Harry Potter or my other paranormal YA series. I know it is completely unfair to compare this series to HP, but I couldn't help it. It is fantasy/YA/urban fantasy that for me just did not deliver. I didn't even like most of the characters. Clary, Jace, Alec, Isabelle, were all supremely annoying at times. I thought Jace was a bit of an arse, Alec a lovesick fool, Isabelle a baby harlot in the making, and Clary just plain dumb sometimes. The events felt like suspended plot points and nothing really led me anywhere.<br /><br />The only redeeming thing was Simon. He and Clary's banter was the best part of the book because other than that, the conversations were awkward at best. The demon hunters/Shadowhunters world did not seem real to me and isn't that the job of the best fantasy series? To make us feel like somehow we missed the bus stop on this magical journey that should have led us to that world? I swear for years I looked in the mailbox hoping my Hogwarts letter just \\"got the wrong address.\\" That world was so beautifully imagined and I had hoped to feel the same in this series.<br /><br />I read ahead on Wikipedia the summaries for the remaining books. And it all just got too weird and too unbelievable for me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy paranormal and hidden worlds, but this world just didn't cut it. The characters, the places, the Institute just didn't work for me personally.<br /><br />And the big reveals and betrayals that came in the last quarter of the book left a bad taste in my mouth. I wasn't expecting them that is for sure, but instead of them being intriguing plot twists, they felt like a nuisance and one just grossed me out. But I give the author kudos in creating such a world. Writing a book is not easy, especially a paranormal or fantasy where you are creating worlds from scratch, and I hope many other fans love it in a way I cannot.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try #2, maybe I won't. But I'm not devastated either way and that in and of itself is devastating...
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Can't wait to see him in October. Purchased the ticket even before the album came out. I do not regret it one bit!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Unfortunately I didn't get to watch the movie! I wanted it for Amazon prime on my tablet and it said that it was not supported on my device.  So we had to watch the movie through the wii. My son watched most of it and we were to try again the next day, but time got away from us.  The rental price was good compared to other electronic rental I found.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is excellent.  It is extremely addictive and fun to play.  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of game.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Mark Cousins' &#34;The Story if Film:An Odyssey&#34; should be required viewing for students of film and film enthusiasts. It covers a hundred years of film making from the early years up to the present. Told in 5 discs, each with three chapters, Cousins outlines, traces the beginning for filmmaking in the United States and Frances, looks at the development of film language, notes the leading practitioners in the US, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Russia, and in Africa, and shows how the Hollywood style, with the development of genres, became the dominant format, and how other filmmakers revolted from the that style or reinterpreted it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My kids love it!!!  My youngest says he likes when the car crashes.  Would recommend.  No violence. Great game.  Thanks
B008133MDK|5.0|Was looking for another series to get hooked on and this one did it.  Love the fast moving and interest story line. Wonderful.  Hope Session 3 is produced faster than current time line predicts
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My daughter (2) loves this game!!  All the Dr. Panda games are a favorite.  They are very hands on & they learn from them!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was amazing! I watched the netflix series first. Then decided to read this and I'm so glad that I did...it's great! I've recommended it to everyone!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost recapture the comedic magic they found in Shaun of the Dead with another Edgar Wright classic.  This movie has it all: the blood, the ice cream, and the best fence jumping ever seen!!
B0012GMW7A|4.0|Leonard Cohen is a classic and this CD has so many of his songs and good quality on the CD.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game a little hard to find some objects, but that's the point right.  Very in-depth game. I like that it's more than just a hidden object game.  Has a plot and everything.  A+
B004ADF7RO|5.0|maybe even the first one I think of mentioning when the 'desert island' conversation starts up.<br /><br />I've seen this movie maybe a hundred times. I have kids of my own now and we've watched it easily 20 times together.  It's our rainy-day go to movie.  A re-watcher for sure.<br /><br />Sloth LOVE Chunk.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|This one of my son's favorite movies. Now he can watch it whenever he wants. We got it for him for his birthday and arrived in plenty of time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|that I bought along with several others, to have handy, if I'm not in the middle of a book, for visits to the doctor's offices or waiting for an oil change, for example.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I chose this rating because of the content of this movie.  No foul language, no sex scenes, nothing bloody etc, and yet kept me on edge waiting to see the out come!  A must see especially  for every man, married or not.  Would recommend it for anyone who enjoys good movies.
B007AL48UK|4.0|for the beach, or waiting in a doctor's office, etc. I got it along with several other separate purchases of games.

0142420891|5.0|Adammmmm, let me love you.<br /><br />If you've read, If I Stay, you know the dilly-o in Where She Went.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, AVERT THY EYES. HERE THERE BE SPOILERS.<br /><br />Basically after Mia's accident, after she lost her family, she moved to New York to go to Juilliard and she cut ties with Adam, which had a devastating effect on him. In Where She Went, we relive the past through his eyes and learn what he's been up to since then. Guys, he is just so, so broken. He's not really friends with his bandmates anymore and he is this sad shell of a manboy.<br /><br />But hark! he runs into Mia when he stumbles upon a concert that she is giving at Carnegie Hall and they spend an amazing night resolving unfinished issues and catching up.<br /><br />This is a book that makes you believe in true love and fate, guys. In my opinion, it trumps If I Stay, which is saying something as that was an amazing book as well.<br /><br />To sum up: If I Stay broke my heart... but Where She Went managed to put it back together.<br />- See more at: [...]
B003W77SGC|5.0|Lara Fabian has one of the best voices around. Rich and strong, it pulls on your emotional heartstrings.  Everyone should hear her!
8866130915|5.0|The planner has a nice layout, good quality paper, small form factor making it easy to carry.  I will definitely purchase again next year.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I usually am more of a mystery reader but this book really grabbed me. Colleen's writing brought her characters to life. I felt every emotion they did. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to know the meaning of &#34;Hope&#34;.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game!<br />it is better than temple run!<br />I really recommend this app to temple run lovers cause its the same concept but much more fun.
0792844890|5.0|THIS WAS MY` GRAND-DAUGHTER`S ALL TIME  FAVORITE  MOVIE, SO ON HER` 31st BIRTHDAY I ORDERED IT FOR HER. SHE WAS DELIGHTED !
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Very good CD, music is nice to listen too, would recommend to buy. I also recommend her nail polish line for anyone who is interested and has not tried them yet..Their beautiful colors!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This is the real story behind the series so it's not as exciting or dramatic. Still, I enjoyed it, and it filled in the blanks after I'd watched the series ,which was addictive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching the first episode of season 1, I became obsessed about this show - romance, drama, and intrigue, what more could you want? I can't wait until season 4 airs. I'll be on the edge of my seat and the kids better not bother me while its on lol
0738735027|5.0|Love the artwork and compact size so I can take it with me where ever I go, so I have it when I need to do a reading.
0786956291|4.0|I decided to buy this so my sons and I could try D&D. I researched and read many reviews of this product before I decided to go ahead and buy it and I am glad that I did. As described, it is a starter set and does very well as such. It comes with everything you need to learn the basics and start playing. My only complaint is that I wish there was an example of completed character sheets, just as the instructions guided me, so I could make sure I understood everything correctly.<br />The complaints that the completed and leveled up characters you create in the kit aren't usable in the \\"full\\" version of D&D 4e is not a concern for me because: 1. There seems to be a way to convert your starter characters (see the official D&D website.) 2. I can make another character for 4e. The positive aspect of that is I will have more experience the second time.<br />As for the additional books necessary for future adventures, I went to my library. Luckily I live in a larger city so I was able to get everything I needed pulled from other libraries to my local library branch for easy pick up. This way I can look through these books and buy only what I need when the time comes. Plus I borrowed D&D For Dummies to help get started.<br />Summary: Great starter set but you will probably need to do some additional research. Younger kids will most likely need some help getting started but once they understand how to play they will do fine. If you decide to continue playing D&D, you will grow out of this set eventually.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Well written, with an unlikely hero in Rex the guy next from door.<br />Harold trip is a series of &#34;Single Serve&#34; friends. A great way to explore human nature.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is a pretty cool game. Wish you could delete some items though. Overall we enjoy playing this game. Kids love it.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|I loved the movie as a teen when it came out.  Bought it on tape for my boys (who are now 27 & 25) and pulled it out for my 2 year old grand-daughter.  She wanted to watch it again and started pulling the tape out.  So, naturally, I had to order it on a dvd!  Love it!
1433502410|5.0|started a new bible study and we needed the ESV version. i researched and found this one. the price on amazon beat the other store so i grabbed two of them. i am very happy with the lay out, this bible is packed with history and info. a must have for anyone wanting to go deeper in their study of God's word.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I can't say.  I ordered this one for my wife for her book club.  I haven't looked at it.  I don't think she was very impressed with it.  We both tend to like more classic stuff.  These &#34;current best seller&#34; things seem rather superficial most of the time.
1476715904|5.0|&#34;Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man.”<br /><br />Awesome...such an awesome book!<br /><br />I loved everything about it! The build-up, the romance, Kel and Caulder, Eddie...and Will, I especially adored Will., Point is, this book isn't shallow or cliché. It's simple, and in it's simplicity is where I found the beauty.<br /><br />Let me explain, even though this is technically a book with many heart wrenching moments, I never felt overwhelmed by anything. Hoover's direct and simple prose kept me riveted to this story, falling in love with her characters and their world, while at the same time I wanted to know all that more about them. Will and Lake's journey was so much more than a love story; it was one about trust and acceptance and learning how to find balance with cards life has dealt you. All in all it was an incredible read and one that has me wanting to devour the next two :D
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting, engaging story lines and I have adored the cinematography and costume design.  Didn't think I'd really like a period piece series, but I admit, I'm a little hooked.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo. It is fun and great for my concentration and memory. I reccomend it to friends all the time
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|Great movie, with nice 3D depth and lots of scenes with nice OOS experience.  Definitely should be part of anyone's 3D collection!
B00008G9JO|5.0|I like Jethro Tull since I was<br />twenty years old. For me they're<br />the classic progressive rock band<br />but also folk, and heavy.
0439813786|5.0|My grandson and I love reading Selznick's books together. He always finds something in the pictures I would have overlooked. They remind me of classics like Great Expectations. I get such a thrill from the look on his face when all the pieces start to come together.
B00687XO1G|5.0|A classic. So quiet and at the same<br />time so intense in his description of<br />a case of murder. This film is eternal.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I have read almost all of Jane Austen's books, and this one is my favorite. Though this book starts out slow, the way the characters develop through the whole thing is wonderful to read. I feel like everyone always likes Pride and Prejudice the most, or knows the most about it, but the love story between Emma and Mr. Knightley can't be beaten. Will always recommend.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I've been a great fan of this classic zombie film for years, and though it has been remade  I still feel that the orig. is still the best. Especially the Directors Cut with all the additional gore scenes added. &#34;The Gore The Marrier&#34;<br /><br />I would recommend this Ult. Edition the any fan of the film. The Documentary's where quite interesting as well.  Several of them I've never seen before.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie was great.  Denzel Washington done a great job on this movie.  I would watch it again. Great movie!!!
B0024HH32A|5.0|I've always loved MASH.  And as our first introduction to these character's whom we have learned to love in the series' and MASH fan will just love this film as well.  Suggested pick that you will greatly enjoy.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I would say it was the worst mcconaughey movie i have seen.  usually his movies are excellent but this one was not great
B002JI94J4|5.0|One of the best Beatle's films ever. And on blu ray the picture and sound quality was amazing, You Will Love It!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Ariana Grande is one of the best young singers in a long time. It is definitely worth it. I didnt think it would be much of anything because she seems so young but I love it.
B0090O07RS|5.0|Not only was this one of the Door's best shows they where able to restore three previously unseen songs to this extended version.  Also in HD on blue ray it looked and sounded better then I've ever seen it. Simply amazing!
B005OK721G|5.0|Hi I wasn't expecting to like it I purchased it for my boyfriend. I really I joyed the action. Yes it went aboveboard expectation.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|This series is absolutely excellent.  My only complaint is I am ready for them to move beyond Red John and would like more back story on Patrick Jane.  Otherwise, this is one of my favorite TV shows.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! It has everything I need! I wish I had found this sooner. Very bright and bold. Plus its easy to understand.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Fans of The Boss should get this album.  It made a wonderful addition to my collection of Springsteen music.  Enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loads of fun and keeps the family busy. My kids buy games on here but I usually don't. I can't help but spend some on this game. Addicted! Lo
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie will always keep you on your feet from the very start to the very finish. A great choice if your into suspense!
159463176X|3.0|The book died in the middle third. Hosseini should have concentrated more on the issues affecting life in Afganistan and less on Paree!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Good dog! I like the fact you can record your play-time and show your friends how much free time you really have...
159448385X|5.0|It brought the problems in Afganistan to life and highlighted why we should be more satisfied with the life we have in the United States.
1609613937|5.0|Together with my &#34;Bitch Coach&#34;, my vegan mentor, I did the Starch Solution in the month of August and lost the weight and had a good time. I know the recipes because I've done so many of them but I concentrated on doing page 216 for maximum weight loss and it worked. And I felt satisfied. :)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is really awesome and fun. Love it. Still don't know how to get energy. Blah blah blah blah
B006BAEQB2|4.0|This book is good.  I loved the history behind it and it keeps moving throughout the book. I do recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. its a great way to pass my quite time. Very easy to play even my 3 and 4 year love this game. :)
0316056898|5.0|This was my son's pick from a high school summer reading list. To his surprise he enjoyed it and found himself reading more. Pages daily than his daily requirement. He found it funny, enlightening, and shared many excerpts with us. I'll be the next one to read her book merely due to  my non-reading son's reading enjoyment!
0143039881|4.0|This book will enthrall you because it deals with a writer who wants to find devil horns on Eichmann but instead finds an ordinary guy that was able to do the most horrible things in stride. It opens the door to the question of what evil any of us are capable of.
B006YZHEB8|5.0|I would recommend this movie to any couple.  The issues this movie deals with are real life.  Doesn't hurt any of us to be reminded of where our priorities & our commitments should be.
B00821OX98|5.0|Amazing to believe that this made it as a series on TV. It could easily have been made into a mini-series or even years of block buster movies with sequel after sequel. Of course, I and everyone else who enjoyed the **** out of it wouldn't be able to wait that long for all the movies to come out each summer!
B001FB55H6|5.0|People are always nitpicking a movie instead of just enjoying what was put together, so, nothing like that from me. The movie did it's job, and I didn't even notice the 3 hour length of the movie. Simple.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|I hadn't listened to the BSB in quite a long time. Their \\" Very Best of\\" CD is awesome and well worth buying. They really were/are the best boy band around. Their vocals are unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and check out this CD. You won't be disappointed!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Challenging HOG with many modes and an overarching story line that will last for weeks if you don't get too caught up and rush progress by buying the micro transactions.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The twist and turns and the corporate back stabbing arre what make the show great. As a native New Yorker thought it's tough to watch outdoor scenes and know they aren't filmed in NY. The give aways are the street signs, if you can catch a street sign you will know it's not in NY.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I seriously enjoy this device! I use this in my car in dash navigation system KW-NT310 works great only thing is that I doesn't charge my iphone/iPad but that's ok, I can just disconnect it and plug it into system itself.<br /><br />This product works as advertised. I recommend this to anyone.
B009YMKL4A|4.0|Very exciting movie I totally enjoyed it.  The ending was a surprise but it does bring you into wanting to watch the next series
B00AE1P8UM|4.0|Makes sense. Have experienced this phenomena in my own life. Can get to be a tedious read, but worthwhile.I recommend this for anyone looking to improve themselves.
B009EE4K86|4.0|Hugh Jackman is always special to watch.  He is among many of my favoriate actors.  This movie was well done and interest me into watch the others in the series.
140006922X|4.0|Easy read and vey enlightrening!  It enspired me to further research! A nest read for all zealots! ESP. Catholics and prostistents !
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Excellent overview of Film from its beginnings to present day. A world view that introduced me to both films and Filmmakers I never even heard of( and I have a collection of hundreds).<br />  Not a dry, linear history but told with the poetic insight and intelligence of Cousins who is clearly<br />a lover and great teacher of the subject. You'd be hard pressed to find a collection this good that's worth your time and money!
B005544V6A|5.0|Excellent acting--fast paced and very true in the real world as to how law is applied. Love the cast !!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome and a great brain challenge some levels are hard but with enough looking around you find everything needed to moveon
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful show!! We could not wait to watch season 3 after being addicted after season 1 and 2. Can't wait for season 4
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This book seemed appealing to me when I purchased it but it did not live up to my expectations. I found it a laboriously slow read and lost interest in it mid way through. Unkept chugging through it thinking it would get better but it didn't. I didn't like the &#34;flashbacks&#34; nor did I care for some of the more contrived character or relationships. Overall, this book just didn't work like it should have based on the surface premise. I won't be recommending this to friends.
0741470314|5.0|\\"Defending A King ~ His Life and Legacy\\" is an excellent book, written with much honesty.  Dr Karen Moriarty talks about Michael Jackson, showing us the real man he was -- simple, pure, honest and lovely.  I've read her book with much interest and love.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have used TripAdvisor before and have found it to be so useful.  Real people who have experienced the various lodging options give an honest opinion.
B0095P31L6|5.0|just another winner, don't miss out. If you do you'll be SORRY. Rango isn't just another pretty face. I've got a new favorite.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great game to play for all kind of people,I love this game so much you should try it
B004JN1D2I|4.0|It is so fun to read these books from the Kindle Paperwhite!! Great X-ray information... It helps a lot ! You must try it yourself
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book thinking that with it being so very popular that at least the story line had to be half way decent.  Instead, I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of the wordage, and storyline to the extent I was calling my friends and saying...\\"REALLY!\\".  This book was absurd and I can't imagine reading ANY sequels.  Read the other reviews and do some addition, there are more negative comments than there are 5 or even 4 stars!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Interesting came.I can stop playing it. Always play and play for hours. Killing so much time. Great game and lovely toy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love my accelerated. When weather channel changed so did I. It's so easy to get around. No problems.all you weather channel fans give it a try!!!!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|keeps me updated on weather at home when away...on places I want to go and places I have been...whets not to love about it?
B005XR3K5M|4.0|I just received these.<br /><br />The art and prints are amazing. I love the back of the cards and each suit has a different Zelda game theme which is beautifully done. My only gripe is the card stock feels pretty flimsy. I can easily bend the whole deck and was a little surprised when I first shuffled and dropped half the deck as I was not expecting that much play. Time will tell if these will hold up, but they don't feel like regular somewhat rigid playing cards.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|The movie reminded me so much of moulin rouge. It was in  NYC this time but so familiar. Baz hasn't seem to change styles much. We still enjoyed the movie and the cinematography and would watch it again.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I have used this app befpre, I paid full price for it from the Play Store.  It's way to confusing to use imo,  all I needed was something simple, not all of the settings and other stuff that this app has going on.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|We let my wife go after 10 days in coma as we feared that she will be left in vegetative state if she comes back. There are aspects in the book which make me think if I took a wrong decision. However there are aspects which make me think that she must have got her angle and one with infinite love and compassion. It also strengthens my belief that I will meet her one day.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|Be aware that the winder is on the left of the face making it awatch you need to wear on the right hand.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This was a really well written book, which challenges a lot of the belief systems in Christianity.  I found it to be extremely interesting and thought provoking.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Fantastic characters! It really draws you in. My co-workers and I are hooked!  The entire four seasons are wonderful.  Serious bits mixed with downright funny bits makes a perfect blend.
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|Unbelievable story line.  Very unexpected ending.  Just when you think it is all over, it has just begun.  Very strange.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It doesn't give me any new information that I know already.  It's a bogus app that no one needs!  What we do need is the actual Candy Crush game app!
B009AMALLM|5.0|Amazing series of movies.  Love how creepy these movies are.  After it was over, I was peering around my house on high alert.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love mahjong games and this one is easy to play. It has multiple layouts and I like the summer pictures on the tiles.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I really like this game,I have always liked games where you had to find things or tell the differences in the two pictures.  I would definitely recommend this game to others it's a lot of fun!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Stallone never could act and every role that he does is Rocky in a GI Joe suit, cop suit, whatever suit....Blow em up, shoot em down, kick butt in the air and the ground...YAWN, YAWN, Yawn.  They should have had Willis doing more at least he can bring some excitement.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is really fun.  I end up wasting hours playing it.  I have to limit myself.  Just have to beat that high score ;-)
0811879542|5.0|My 3-year-old nephew loves this really cute book. Simple and good use of the imagination. I recommend for any child.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great to kill time with. I play when ever I'm bored. Didn't think it would catch my interest but it did. I play with my grandma now.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love being able to see what they &#34;think&#34; is coming next.  Weather is unpredictable so nice to see what the temps are right now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very fun and very entertaining for when someone is bored and its like owning a horse in real life
B00447G2T8|5.0|I admit that I'm not a fan of modern European power metal that started around the time of HammerFall's debut in 1997, which is ironic since I like that album. The European power metal scene soon became glutted with speed/power acts and I quickly lost interest, especially with the bands that are obsessed with lame dungeons & dragon lyrics.<br /><br />Although I owned Helloween's mediocre 1985 debut WALLS OF JERICHO and the superior KEEPER OF THE SEVEN KEYS PT. 1, I strayed from them for the next decade due to my interest in other, more extreme, styles of metal. But 1998's BETTER THAN RAW turned my head with its dynamic energy, refreshing lyrics, positive aggression and new singer Andi Deris. But it was hard to keep up with Helloween because they're so prolific. Regardless, I own four of their last six releases and 2010's 7 SINNERS is easily one of my favorites, along with KEEPER OF THE SEVEN KEYS: THE LEGACY (2005) and their most recent STRAIGHT OUT OF HELL (2013). Heck, even GAMBLING WITH THE DEVIL (2007) kicks total axx.<br /><br />7 SINNERS starts out with one of Helloween's best songs ever, the meaty &#34;Where the Sinners Go.&#34; From there we get one great song after another highlighted by &#34;Who is Mr. Madman?&#34;, &#34;World of Fantasy&#34;, &#34;Long live the King&#34;, &#34;Smile of the Sun&#34;, the moody short piece &#34;Not Yet Today&#34; and the creative closer &#34;Far in the Future&#34;. (There's also a bonus track). There are other good songs as well, like &#34;Are You Metal?&#34; and the bulk of &#34;You Stupid Mankind&#34;.<br /><br />The Helloween boys stumbled on a great find in 1994 with Andi Deris, as he wrote the best songs on this album -- &#34;Where the Sinners Go&#34;, &#34;The Smile of the Sun&#34;, &#34;Long Live the King&#34; and &#34;Far in the Future&#34;, although &#34;Who is Mr. Madmen&#34; and &#34;World of Fantasy&#34;, two other great songs, were written by one of the guitar players and the bassist (Sascha Gerstner and Markus Grosskopf respectively).<br /><br />The only time I don't like Helloween is when they go into hyper Happy Metal mode, which was the case with too much of 2007's GAMBLING WITH THE DEVIL (although, like I said, that's an excellent album). On 7 SINNERS they only commit this sin a few times, like on &#34;If a Mountain Could Talk&#34;, &#34;The Sage, the Fool, the Sinner&#34; and &#34;My Sacrifice&#34;, three songs in a row. Still, I don't mind this side of the band as long as it's in small doses, like it is here.<br /><br />Helloween is so mind-boggling ultra-talented and prolific that it's incomprehensible they're not more popular in the USA. Be sure to check 'em out; 7 SINNERS is a great place to start.only time I don't like Helloween is when they go into hyper Happy Metal mode, which was the case with too much of 2007's GAMBLING WITH THE DEVIL (although, like I said, that's an excellent album).

B0063GORYU|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE  Solitaire game. So happy to have it for my Kindly Fire. Just  another thing to enjoy about my Kindle. YEA!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Maybe I tried this with the wrong device but the game did not install. I'm running Htc One X. Adding more words to meet the limit.
0345529057|5.0|Pick up this set for $13 dollars, so I wasn't expecting too much quality.  The pages are very light and the books themselves are sort of small for my hands.  But the content is phenomenal! I love the mix of Fantasy, Adventure, Intrigue, Politics, War, and Sex!  Gotta pick up the next volumes!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Good as always this is my third time but yeah still fun and I enjoyed it ,and you should :)
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It's amazing how the author is able to convince the reader that she's a 5 year old boy.  Wow!  Very good.  I loved the characters!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|it is a good item. but , i just use it. I don't know how long it will work. it is expensive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it!  One of the best series I've watched in a long long time.  Beautiful scenery, costumes, and people and accents.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I started using this app for my android phone. I was excited to see that it was offer as an app for the kindle fire. Great App!! It does exactly what the description says. No complaints
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This product does everything it claims to do.  I am very pleased with the protection and stand up capabilities it provides.  The color is exactly what I wanted although it did not exactly match the color in the ad.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a very fun me! :) I get addicted to playing this game! I love this and I can't stop playing! :)
0812973992|4.0|I liked the way the characters weaved together throughout the storyline. I would read another one of the authors books.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|Great book, with a wonderful original plot line. Nice easy read that you can put down and pick up easily
0670026638|5.0|I really loved this book.  It was beautifully written, well-researched, provocative, quirky, engaging, humorous, poignant, had a great story line and interesting/multi-dimensional characters. Quite ambitious to pull all that off and do it well.  The story managed to be simultaneously very spiritual and very down to earth; to colorfully interweave issues of culture, relationships, environment, history, ethics and science in a thoroughly entertaining way that wasn't at all preachy.  One of the book's central premises - the concept of parallel universes - was deftly handled, and the way it continually asked \\"what if?\\" reminded me a lot of \\"Under the 'Ulu Tree\\".  The only \\"negative\\" thing I can say about the book is that it had a lot of footnotes, and although I appreciate their relevance, I wasn't fond of continually having to look down to read them (and lose my place).  Bad enough having to do this while reading research articles.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|great collection cant b topped imo comes with everything needed to know the series in detail and if u dont want to play one or 2 cuz it older then theres comics for u
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Such a great movie! It came out when I was 5 and I still love it and quote it today!
B007MJT1K2|5.0|This movie brought back really ood memories from original cartoon. I would recommend it to anyone who liked the originals.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|So much of the same kind of action over and over again. I am 66 and for me it was sort of boring for someone younger it would be a great movie for them.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|While the second season is not quite as good as the first, it is story telling at it's best.  There is more deviation from the books during the second season, but in almost every case it aided the story and, actually, improved it from the book.  Highly recommend it.  Will be buying the third season as soon as it becomes available.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Combination of drama and humor. This show gets you the inside information of possibly how the law works. If not true, the show is absolutely entertaining anyhow.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|We get Dr. Panda apps for doctors appts. or any place my 6 year old needs to be super quiet.  What is great is when a Dr. Panda is so good it attracts her 11 yr old sister and 12  1/2 year old brother.  Airport really is like the airport!  They have a \\"security\\" area.  Mine like to race through the airport \\"maze\\" to get to the suitcase.  With multiple devices in our house but airport only on 2, they get upset when everyone wants to be at the airport at the same time! :)
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I loved the first book... now just waiting to see if Clary & Jace are really brother and sister which is nerve wrecking!
B0098460O4|4.0|I would have given it a 5 star but all songs except the first one are in Italian and I bought the English version.
B007NVJ7NU|2.0|I missed it on the big screen, so there wasn't much weight to the effects and editing. Without the sensory impact, the story felt thin and way too long.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having served time in the United States Army, this book is something I can relate to. I'm glad I got to read it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|A very touching and well researched look into early onset Alzheimer's.  It is not overly sentimental and touches on all aspects of the impact of this terrible disease from the viewpoint of the victim.  The author avoids being maudlin while the reader experiences the progression of the disease.  Definitely worth the read.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|If you like science fiction, action, movies, this is a good one to see. Great actors in a good setting with a very bad alien. Date movie? Probably not. Kids movie? Nope. Viewing with spouse? Probably not.
1932100385|5.0|This book was written by a research scientist who grew up on his parents' Dairy Farm.  His research revealed startling findings about the perfect food.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Not a DiCaprio fan and did not see in theater but this movie is so visually sumptuous, I willing to say a \\"must see\\". Acting, actors? OK, even DiCaprio. Movie is long but in retrospect not sure I could identify any scenes that did not contribute to story. Date movie? Yes. Movie to view with spouse? Yes. Guys only? Ah, no.
0307477479|5.0|Excellent book to read. Would recommend to others as well as family and friends alike. A must read for all.
0545265355|5.0|This series was recommended to me by a friend, even though it is classified as &#34;young adult&#34;. It was quick reading, and I enjoyed it very much. I had read some poor reviews from people who were finding fault with some of the broken abbreviated sentence structure in places and why the scenario behind the series had been allowed to exist for such a long time without a backlash from the people, but you need to consider a couple of things here:<br />1. This is a work of fiction, not a historical documentary.<br />2. Take an objective look at the world we currently live in and tell me you can't see a lot of parallels, sad to say.<br />3. To those who want to dissect these books into tiny little pieces and view them under a magnifying glass to look for flaws, get a  grip. Sit down in your chair with your beverage of choice, relax, and just read. You might accidentally enjoy yourself.
030758836X|5.0|Excellent book to read. Would recommend to others as well as family and friends alike. A must read for all.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really enjoy Hill Climb Racing. It has enough variation on of play to avoid getting boring with just the right amount simplicity to allow an old-fart like New to play and enjoy.<br />It plays well on my Kindle and on my phone.
0812550706|5.0|Excellent book to read. Would recommend to others as well as family and friends alike. A must read for all.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Great!!<br />I strongly recomend it!<br />Anthony Hopkins is the best!<br />Good suspense and love the ending. Second time I watch it
0525953728|5.0|It was good to read the truth about what happened...as a family member of people within the Armed Forces, many different branches, this is the most truth you will get!  They even show inserts of pictures of the Seal team's gear, the compound and more...I have already loaned it out to others....get book and would def recommend you read this!
B00EH49DXA|5.0|Katy Perry never ceases to disappoint...her new pop beat, &#34;ROAR&#34; has a terrific vibe. Fabulously empowering to all the Girls!
B009WUBERW|5.0|Mindless fun. No Jet Li but Bountiful action and Jean Claude Van Damme doesn't get any better for me. Must see.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Terrific new single by Lady GaGa! Great lyrics and beat! Smoother than some of her other pop hits; but, wonderful!
B000TEPEJO|4.0|I found this album to be a beautiful collection of songs that soothe, settle and create a sense of serenity.  Our family was especially comforted by the song, &#34;Someday.&#34;  We recently lost a member of our family who was much too young to die.  Sometimes, for us at least, the perfect piece of music can give voice to the grief and bring it up and out of that place deep inside where it gets lodged upon the loss of a loved one.  This album assisted such movement of critical emotions for us.  Definitely worth owning, in my opinion.
B00969PR18|2.0|The maps seem to work fine but it is not able to locate my position. I'm connected using WiFi and i can select manually.<br />Also does not pick up suburb street names.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|First of all this book is beautifully written. The characters are very &#34;real&#34; and the<br />storyline moves quickly and rationally.<br />I had never considered what dealing with a terminal illness would be like from the<br />perspective of a young adult/teenager. Death and illness are always tragic, but<br />how does a sick teenager relate to healthy kids who typically feel they are invincible?<br />I appreciated being led through a scenario of setbacks, hopes and dreams with limited<br />yet unknown time frames, and what's futile and what's not. How do sick kids deal with parents<br />who are sacrificing everything to keep their child alive and as &#34;normal&#34; as possible?<br />This book opened my eyes to struggles I pray I never have to encounter, but awakened<br />me to the dismal but also potentially joyful realities of others' fights with terminal disease.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|haven't proceeded very far but has been okay so far. could use more hidden object areas- I like looking for the hidden objects more than the story and adventure aspects.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|It is absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen with some great extra features.  i strongly recommend for any movie lover!  Big Al is awesome.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A classic:) This review requires eighteen words so I am typing this! But seriously this is a classic story well worth reading on a rainy afternoon:)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wonderful, I enjoyed this book so much. it's great to have it with me when I find myself with spare time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|the book is good awsome the cx who will read this book will enjoy a lot to innovate the test cases the innovative cases thw way the autor has represented life is really awsm to read
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|First Neil Gaiman book that I've read and I enjoyed it. It's a fast read with little twists and surprise.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|I love it ! All the songs are good and I play it for anyone that like Robert plant like my old sister as alway am happy with my CD or DVD thank you !
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Thought it would have info on levels, just links to You Tube for SOME levels, not what I was expecting...
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|I could relate to this book from the word 'go'. It has actually allowed me to see myself objectively and change some of the things in my work life. Sheryl is not only inspiring but also convincing and motivating.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are so many delightful turn of events.  I couldn't wait to see the next episode--but the tragic childbirth scenes almost made me come undone.  It was so very, very painful.  Wonderful season with so many experiences.  Can't wait until Season 4!
B005PK57NU|5.0|The acting is always superb and story line intriguing. Hopefully the series will continue for a few more years, please.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|I really liked this book. Its not boring and it is well written. The story line is easy to follow and the book keeps you guessing.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show. Knew nothing about it but friends were raving about it. Now I know why. My family are huge fans now.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a great book but hard to read. The reason its hard to read is because Jaycee tells it all, everything that happened to her. It is very touching and inspirational. I would recommend this book to anyone to wants to read about a real survivor and about finding a way to live again after tragedy.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|For the life of me, I can't find a pdf reader for my Kindle that has a viewing option to rotate the doc clockwise/counterwise.  If you've ever needed to read something that has been scanned in sideways, you know what I mean.  That's the one feature I wish this app had.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|Love all the new songs from recent albums, especially Forevermore. Recently saw them live for the seventh time and Forevermore was the best song that night.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this constantly...planning trips and during trips. Also on a daily basis cuz it's better than the weatherman. Get it!
1451697686|5.0|I like everybody to have this book in the house. Great book. I like to implement in our house. It will help our house.
B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|booted and posted first time. Had no problems so far although have not attempted any overclocking. CPU runs around 29c in my system
B005JTAP4S|5.0|A delightful story that takes us on a breathless series of thrilling adventures which are smoothly and imaginatively described.  Peter, ten years old, already a bit of a daydreamer, accompanies his mother to visit the antiques shop run by old Mrs Kipple. He cajoles his mother into buying a cheap old box which, he discovers at home, has a secret compartment containing an old velvet pouch. In that pouch Peter finds a key with the number 402 engraved on it. Later he comes across a clock in the shop adorned in a similar manner to his key. When his key is inserted into the lock it opens up a world of voyages, fantasy, dreams, magic, enchantment and discovery. We are exquisitely led on a series of adventures which involve spells, dragons, fairy grottos, fairy dust, fortresses, invisibility potions, demons, scrolls, elves, ghosts, and an array of fantastical characters. I couldn't put it down. A superbly-written story suitable for children of all ages.
0307744434|5.0|It made me happy. A good read. Bought another as a gift for someone I loved. I recommend this to everyone.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Story has a fantastic twist, did not see it coming. WOW what a read!!  Can not wait for his next book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! Best book out of the 3! I loved the epilogue a lot. The Last sentence was funny also. \\" You love me\\" \\"Real\\"
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I really like things that glow and are neon Colors! I also love air hockey, so I definetly love this game! You should get this game if you are like me!!!<br />Lots of love,<br />  Me!
B00C2FFJFM|1.0|This is the worst album Selena has put out, by far. She needs to stick to stuff like \\"Kiss and Tell\\" and songs like \\"Whiplash\\". This is the same crap you hear from every other \\"wanna be\\" teenie bopper out today. I suppose if you're 7 or 8, this might be a good album to you. But, there's just no \\"meat\\" to this one. Her former band, The Scene, gave her a \\"sound\\". Now, she's just all over the place. Plus, anyone who's TRULY honest with themselves would admit that she can't sing to save her life. If you've heard her sing live and have actually \\"listened\\" with your ears and not your devotion for her, then, you know what I'm talking about. Anybody can sing on an album with AutoTune. But, at least the songs on her previous albums (Especially \\"Kiss and Tell\\" and \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\") had substance. If you're going to put out albums like this, Selena, take my advice: Stick to acting. You're much better at it.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is amazing. I feel it is better than FSOG. The story about Gideon, Eva and Cary's past is more realistic. People can relate to their past.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this app! It is addicting and fun to play! I would recommend this game to anyone. Download the app!
B008MVPBA8|5.0|Hello, I would like to know what number I can choose for my crocs, my foot measures 23.5 cm, help please
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This version of Gatsby is all glitter and no content.  It had no character development.  If I wasn't familiar with the book and previous movie version, especially the Allan Ladd version.  Also, Daisy was weak.  There wasn't any hint of why he loved her so passionately.  It almost came across as delusional.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great game. A lot like a game on my android. Fun game to practice aims and shots off the wall.
B008JFUN6E|2.0|Good actors some excitement -- good visuals --- I guess I did not really see the reason for the movie -- the cloning was interesting -- & we won :-)  very pretty in blu-ray just not a real catch your interest movie -- but it does have some decent graphics -- just not enough to make up for the story. I was left wondering why I had not read a good book instead of killing time with this & now I \\"OWN\\" it :-(
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love it. Way better than staring at facebook and you can look up anything! FUN. Projects, recipes, and more.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Love love love! Enjoyed being able to see this series again.  I have missed it!  I'm on the fourth season!
9380480016|4.0|This is a rather technical book describing the research results of how our brains influence the physical activity and health of our bodies at the cellular level.  It has affirmed what I have learned in the study of metaphysics and religion.  This is not a book for a storybook seeking reader.  Some of this book needs some background in biology and other more advanced science to comprehend.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|dvd does have some small scratches. cover isn't the best. Super fast shipping. GREAT Story-line, great movie, recommended for scary suspense thriller lovers!!!!! (:
B000TERG6S|5.0|When you just want to 'chill' out, there is nothing finer than music from Jesse Cook. This disc is the solution.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|John le Carre has lost the plot. This is, as with his other books, well crafted but, with each successive novel, he is more determined to bore readers to death with his blatant political views. Who cares?
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The young actors were absolutely amazing.  Both my 12 and 16 year old also enjoyed this movie.  It has great twist and turns and plenty of excitement that keeps you interested in the story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|How do our largest or our most minute decisions change the outcome of our entire life. We may never know in our own lives but in her book &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34;, Liane Moriarty allows us a glimpse into the lives of three women, each of whom have made decisions in her life that eventually lead them to in some way effect the life of the others. It all begins to unfold when one woman finds a letter addressed to herself from her husband, to be opened in the event of his death.<br />This book will keep you reading one chapter after another without stopping as each one leads to something you just &#34;need&#34; to know before you can stop reading for the night!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|A great show, fun and funny. Characters are well developed and enjoyable. Eureka is the kind of town we could all use to visit
0765338149|5.0|my wife loved it. she read it in no time at all.  she now wants to read more of the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this because there are unlimited undo's. Also you can move cardsin between the piles ..to clear the columns up. The auto play feature is nice once you've won
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The in-depth look at historical events I lived through often revealed a perspective I never even considered. I learned a great deal about those who were considered heroes and anti- heroes depending on my parents' perspective before I was old enough to learn for myself. Thank you, Authors, for bringing some clarity to much confusion I had as a teen and a twenty-something.<br /><br />I didn't dislike any of the book. I do think, however, I should re-read parts of it to clarify much of what I may have missed. It is a long and detailed historical piece that is quite useful and informative, but the more I read, the better I under stand.<br /><br />I think the two men who amazed me the most were Nixon and Carter. I have always known the nickname &#34;tricky Dick&#34;, but I haven't completely understood what a rogue he was nor did I understand his brilliance. Carter I have always thought was a bit of a milk-toast leader, but I think he was the best example of the president who did more out of the office than when he was in it. Nevertheless, his gifts did not excuse his treachery.<br /><br />All Americans must read this book for clarity about the difficulty of the President's job and, thus be more thoughtful before they cast their next vote.
1439190275|5.0|This is a good cookbook to add to your diet collection. It is especially good for anyone that likes low carb cooking.
B00006GEB4|5.0|Pressing is great.  Nice that it's on Red Vinyl.  Great album if you love this era of Flaming Lips.  Sweet!
0307236722|5.0|This is a good cookbook to add to your collection. It is especially good for anyone that likes Martha Stewart and her beautiful cookbooks.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Just fun to get &#34;lost&#34; and clear my head by scribbling.<br />completely gets me out of m6 head when I'm feeling<br />stressed. I think they call this &#34;Art Therapy&#34;<br />Works for me
1878424114|5.0|This is a good book to add to your collection. It is especially good for anyone that likes to find spiritual ways to deal with daily problems.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is may favorite. I pick it up time and time again and recommend it to everyone. I feel it puts life into perspective
B0001Z37HM|5.0|The product was packaged well and got to me with speed. As for the movie, well, is a terrible movie but I am a fan of the 80's B-rated adventure!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. it is relaxing and enjoyable. the game is classic but has some great features like customizing the card backs and background color. so much better than playing with actual cards, too!
B008NMT684|4.0|This is a great app for hand and eye coordination. At first our kids struggled getting the pieces to stay in the spots but they overcame that very fast and loved all the sounds and actions the pieces made.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|For those times I cant take my kindle, or I have forgotten it.  Kindle on phone is a dream.  Links up to where i am reading and that way I can keep enjoying my book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Interesting book! I enjoyed the way there were several story lines going, yet they they were all entwined.<br />The ending was expected, yet still well written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is another great brain teaser. Simple but not as easy as it looks I have alot of fun with this one and have my son, and daughter hooked
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is the long lost Theatrical version which I have always held to be vastly superior to the Director's Cut.  I can't remember the last time I was able to see it, and it was a sight for soar eyes.  I love this movie, it remains one of my top ten of all time.  Keep in mind that this is the un-remastered original, so it is a little dark and grainy, but I don't care, it remains a beautiful movie.  If you have ever enjoyed a movie about adventure or love, your must see this masterpiece!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I gave this a 4th star because Ken gave me something to think about in some chapters.  It was a significant historic project. He is a good writer but his characters are predictable.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Good story you will enjoy this one I have read eight of them this is the best one so fare
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This era is very interesting, but also very extensively documented and there were few surprises.  Ken is a good story teller, but he wears thin after a few hundred pages.  His depiction of his female characters'  sexual appetites were so similar and predictable that I actually became annoyed.  Yes, for me, this is a remarkable criticism.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my grandkids stay (ages3 and 6) stay occupied for long periods of time taking turns on trying to run the subway....it amazes me how easily they picked up on how to play the game.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|CD arrived brand new from seller. Timely fashion. Basically all of your favorite Katy Perry songs in one CD. Absolutely amazing and recommended for any Katy lover. If you haven't bought the original teenage dream, I would recommend this one instead. Extras are wonderful.
B00H57OXSG|5.0|And that's what adorns Jasmine (nee Jeanette) French as she lands at a San Francisco airport. She has flown west to live with her estranged sister Ginger with the other threads of her Park Avenue wardrobe in her Louis Vuitton luggage. Her philandering swindler husband has been jailed in New York. Cate Blanchett is playing Jasmine brilliantly with aplomb...a character in a permanent fog of Xanax and vodka.<br /><br />We meet Jasmine at the San Francisco airport...muttering to an elderly woman she meets in first class. We follow her to her sister's tacky apartment in San Francisco's Mission blue-collar neighborhood. We watch her reactions to her sister, her sister's two sons, and the tough-guy boyfriend. It's not a life she has been accustomed to living.<br /><br />BLUE JASMINE is not, as a few reviewers declare, a rehash of Tennessee Williams's STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE...nor the imagined life of one real-life Ruth Madoff, the wife of disgraced swindler Bernie Madoff. And it's not a &#34;moral fable of greed and comeuppance.&#34; It's a tale of comedown not comeuppance...too much pride in material possessions. A story of a lonely woman who has lost almost all of her worldly possessions, who tries to cope with circumstance, who musters enough charm to almost nab a younger and wealthy man-about-town; a woman who wanders through a few more weeks of life without luxury.<br /><br />Accompanying Cate Blanchett's brilliant turn as Jasmine is a well-selected supporting cast. The sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) is a spunky young gal, divorced with two sons, who works as cashier and stock clerk in a small grocery; her differing looks are explained as genetics... both Ginger and Jasmine are adopted. Ginger's boy friend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) looks like George Peppard's punk son with tattoos and dark hair. The swindler husband is played straight by a handsome and svelte Alec Baldwin. Andrew Dice Clay cleans up his act to become Ginger's ex-husband Augie.<br /><br />Director Woody Allen, not a personal favorite of mine until lately, has tried to tell us about downward spirals of life. He has his main character mutter about what was, what could have been, and what is now. He answers Jasmine's question of &#34;Where am I, exactly?&#34; with &#34;nowhere.&#34;<br /><br />And perhaps has his audience wonder where they are....exactly.il lately, has tried to tell us about downward spirals of life.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Product arrived in a timely fashion, new and sealed. Highly recommend seller. If you love the original series or the movies, then buy this set. It is clear, sounds great and high quality. I wasn't too crazy about TOS, but the movies with TOS cast are fantastic and what I imagine the TOS would have been like with a budget. Certainly a great buy for any fan that doesn't already have them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed that this book had some real life emotion.  Displaying pain, fear, laughter and resolve in relationships made them come alive for me  I will read this author again.
B001QVPS2W|5.0|Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown is the amazingly captivating and tragic story of how the west was really won, Through broken promises, forgery, thievery, murder and deception of the native peoples who rightfully claimed residence on the land that the U.S Govt wanted and would acquire by any means necessary. This book follows the plight of the plains Indians from the first peaceful encounter up until the final Battle Of Wounded Knee, when the U.S Army attacked a village of peaceful Souix and Cheyenne tribesman performing religious ceremonies in the hopes of reclaiming tribal identity. This is a must read for anybody interested in U.S history, Native History or just the truth of how our country came to be and is an essential part of any historians collection and SHOULD be mandatory reading for high school students nation wide right along with the Diary of Anne Frank for historical significance.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|This maybe a dumb question...but how do you get into the settings? I open the calendar &amp; see nowhere to customize anything, only a blank calendar page.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Probably Mah jong is my favorite game and this version is fun and challenging.  Love the &#34;vacation&#34; tiles.  Makes me happy.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I saw the Jack Reacher movie and then decided to start in on the books.  Pretty good read.  You have to suspend your disbelief from time to time.  But it's entertaining enough.  I'll check out the next book in the series.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great piece of science fiction.  My first exposure to Orson Scott Card and the 1st in the Ender Quintet.  I intend to read the other books in this series.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Don't waste your $$'s on this one. I rarely put a book down, but this one was so bad I had to stop reading it. No redemptive value.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have this game on my iphone and my kids LOVE it!!!  I downloaded it to my kids kindle fires and can't get the thing to work. I have uninstalled it completely rebooted my kindle and nothing. please fix this problem!!!
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Just plain boring. Well written, but boring story... Did not keep my interest. Makes jail life seem pretty easy for women.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found the whole concept of this book fascinating, it took me to a different world, the characters came to life and I looked forward to being included in their lives every time I started reading, as with The Hunger Games, I think this would make a great film.<br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I felt some of the battle scenes went on a little longer than I would have liked personally, but Hugh, I can't wait to read more of your books and am recommending them to anyone and everyone , you are an excellent author, please never stop writing !
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this for my Nook HD, though the product description here did not mention that it fit. I found that out from the manufacturer. Anyways, I wasn't happy with the options sold by B&N, and I really liked the look of this leather cover (though I nearly bought the red version instead, which was also nice). The price was right and I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />Things to note for Nook HD. The elastic straps partially cover the power and volume buttons. I haven't had any lost of usability due to this, but some might find it annoying. Also, I've start using it backwards (spine on the right) so I can fold the cover back and use it as a stand in landscape mode (some apps on my Nook only orient one way in landscape mode). This is a minor thing and the benefit of having it stand up without a separate stand far outweighs opening it backwards.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product if you're a fan of old leather-covered books.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie. Alot of cool magic tricks. Awesome cast of people. Can't wait till the sequel release. Hope it comes soon.
B00005T7I1|5.0|It's fun and the color is gorgeous. Appropriate for all ages, it's a great addition to your collection if you're a comic book/comic strip fan or if you're like a fun action tale. You don't even have to be familiar with the character backstories because you get enough from the script. The whole cast is great, whether it's Beatty, Pacino, Hoffman, Madonna, or any of the other characters. I really got into this movie when I was a kid and I enjoy it as much with my own son now.
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|My 92 yr. old dad really enjoyed this movie and is now going to donate it to his church school for historical &#34;lesson&#34;  ...thank you.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Great companion to the book, even if it diverges here and there. Just seeing the beauty of the world come to life is enough for me, regardless of plot changes. Watch this series on a large screen so you can see the gorgeous details of the costumes and weapons.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Great series.Amazing conclusion.It turned out far better than I expectedSex,violence,political intrigue.This series has it all.I'm truly impressed.One of the best I've seen.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic, clean love story to read.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a faster keyboard than my stock HTC one but I wish they had more themes. I like only a few from theccurrent selection
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie was so off the scale....I LOVED IT!!!  Jamie's character was freed, along with other slaves, by the dentist/bounty hunter, who was on the trail of other rustlers.  During this trek, Jamie admitted he would ride with him, as long as the hunter agreed to help locate his wife, who was taken by DiCaprio's character, the Candy Man.  Along the way, a lot of gory bloodshed appeared and the trail led to the Candy Man, and playing his best slave, Samuel Jackson, who, I must admit, played the living hell outta this character.  He is the one of the few actors who can take a role and take over, no matter what.  HE DID THAT THANG!!!  All in all, he finally finds his wife and will not let anything come in between them again.  I mean, this movie was smoking and I totally loved it!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is the season that really gets interesting! It seems like most series start to run out of story lines by Season 4 or 5, but this one hits even harder. Jax still has hope (which is refreshing) but he's also a realist. If I hadn't already devoured the first 3 seasons, I would say, &#34;now it's starting to get good....&#34; but it started out great and is getting better.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the boys love to play it.... no probs so far..  will definately get a few more games from amazon in the next few days
1250029465|5.0|It was so easy to read, but always interesting.  If you love and understand cats you will enjoy this book.  James Bowen truly loves cats and his writting shows it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After inhaling the first book, this one kept me on the end through the whole thing.  Can't wait to get my hands on the last book.
B000W668R6|1.0|I wouldn't know if these movies were of good quality.  They did not work in my DVD player.  The product description did not specify that they would only work in a certain region.  I had never heard of such a thing, but I am not very electronic  smart.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, and was caught up in it right away.  Hope that the rest of the series is as good.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This show is probably worth 4.5 stars, but if figure plenty of users would give it the five. Definitely worth watching.
B001NLKZUA|2.0|After &#34;City of Bones&#34;, this seemed really slow.  I found myself not caring one way or another after a certain point.  Not planning to go onto the next book in the series.
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|i love all her songs they are great its just amazing seen ellie live was amazing cant wait to see whats next from ellie (: i would tell anyone to buy this anyday.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My 13 year old son loves to play video games.  He liked this controller better than the others because he says it's more comfortable.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|You get the game and its free and don't get me wrong I love that but in the game you have to buy some of the features sure it's not much but I don't like to be fooled and they did just that they said its free when it isn't besides that it's awesome and a great game.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Once you start watching the series you can not stop. My wife and I were introduced to Downton Abby by some friend and had to get our own DVDs. We spent night after night watching two and sometimes three episodes. It is that good. It has a final ending that will having you banging your head against the wall.
0307352153|3.0|when I received the book I saw that each page was off-centered, so that the last line sat right at the bottom of the page.  this book could not have been sold at a full price book store.  i did receive a discount, but was not warned that it would be sub-standard quality.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Great music, great arrangements. These guys enjoy what they do and it is reflected in their music. My only criticism is that there were one or two songs on this CD that are also on their first CD.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is really fun and has a lot of different stuff that you can do. I play this all the time and never get bored.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an amazing series. I cannot wait for the next season to start. Once you watch the first one you are hooked.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like how this game has more tracks powerups and everything than all the other versions of temple run<br />-will
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Outstanding movie I wish that they would do a sequel to this one. The movie was riveting and the action was non-stop.
B00BU18U82|5.0|I have not found a single glitch or thing I would change in this game.I am a farmer in real life myself and this app is very realistic!Well worth every penny!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Ordered this movie because of Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise!  Also because of the special effects and Morgan Freeman. Was very pleasantly surprised!  The movie is thought provoking and compelling all the way through and, at the end, everything falls into place. I loved it!  Don't know why it got mixed reviews. I thought it was an ambitious undertaking that succeeded.
B000063WDH|5.0|great sounding album. One of my fav's in my collection. A must have. i recommend to anyone and everyone. VF
B000SW16M6|5.0|Dark 80's comedy drama. Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast are all great. This could have been just another silly teen movie,turned into a great moody film that has stood the test of time.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It only stayed on the kindle 1 day, then disappeared so really hard to rate....Where did the Angry Bird game go?????
B0034G4P26|1.0|I have loved the Wallace and Gromit shorts and movie as well as Chicken Run all from this same production house.  I purchased this not having seen it and assumed that it was as good as the other productions but was terribly wrong.<br /><br />This movie lacks all the charm and sweetness of their other films and it just seems like the heart was missing.<br /><br />None of the characters is interesting and most of the jokes are not funny.<br /><br />I still love Aadrman but I will have to be more careful purchasing things sight unseen. It looks like Nick Park is the visionary that adds that extra something.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Been playing this game on Kindle and iPad for years. Good game. Only wish I could get rid of ads.
B005RDF2NA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, it has a little bit of humor for everybody in there... The whole family laughs the whole way through!!!
159463176X|3.0|This book revisits themes of other Hosseini books -- for instance, the later-in-life reconnection to childhood relationships.  Like others who've commented on this book, I found that at times the shifts from one set of characters to another were disconcerting.  One shift in particular was hard to understand; why, so late in the book, did he suddenly go into greater depth with Markos, who had been rather peripheral to that point, and launch into a major digression about his earlier years in Greece and a whole set of entirely new characters?  This struck me as a detour included just to make the book longer.
1611761565|4.0|Typically we dont purchase audio books but I wanted to get one for our car trip that I thought my husband would enjoy.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did too.  Very interesting story.  Very much recommend it.  Gives you great insight into the daily life and struggles of a Seal Team member.  Oh, and it made the drive time go by much quicker!
B003M6FGTE|4.0|Lightly touches on many teen \\"dramas\\", but is mostly entertaining.  I wish they had developed more of the other Glee characters too (Puck, Matt, Brittany, etc.) besides the main ones (Shue, Ms. P, Sue, Rachel, etc.)
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Hitchcock at his best. Every signature feature of his films is here. The Hitchcock cameo, the innocent man, the high angle shot, the beautiful, icy blonde, the bossy mom, etc...
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is the first app I turn to in the morning,... and the last one I check on at night.  I don't know how I lived without it for all those years. :)
0345525558|5.0|Beautifully written and wonderful story. Heartbreaking at times but evens out in the end. I loved to learn about the actual meaning of the flowers and to think about how much they can mean.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I had this app before now I screwd up and got it again it wont show the hole newsfeed it stinkin stinks
0446560073|5.0|It is so very cleaver and funny- just like Simons YouTube videos! I'll be getting all 3 of his books!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|In my opinion this movie was very entertaining. I wasnt quite sure if I should rent it or not because of Tom Cruise. I think he is a nut case, however he did pretty good in this. Iv seen every bit of Sci fi out there and this stood out to me. Worth a rental
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Hours of Fun !!  Five Stars !!  Angry Birds STAR WARS is a logical and well-done next step for fans of Angry Birds.  It is by far the BEST AB game for those who are even moderate fans of the movies.  Kindle version works great.  No issues at all.  My only wish would be for Rovio to send out the Kindle and other non-Apple versions same day as Apple versions.  I hate having to hear Apple owners talk about playing the new game that isn't available for me yet.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It was the best thing I had to get my youtube kicks until the update then freezing then breaking completely save yourself the trouble
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hours of Fun !!  Five Stars !!  Angry Birds RIO is a logical and well-done next step for fans of Angry Birds.  Kindle version works great.  No issues at all.

I hate having to hear Apple owners talk about playing the new game that isn't available for me yet.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Having been introduced to the Sylvester Stallone version I wasn't sure what this one would be be like.<br />I was pleasantly surprised.<br />This version was a great reinvention of the chararcter.<br />For a testosterone filled action flick that kept me engaged, it was good.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|Older son played it Cut the Rope: Experiments once and moved on.  Younger son plays it when he's bored with everything else.  Average time filler.  Nothing to write home to mom about.  Graphics on Kindle are good and play is seemless.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't know where to start. The book was so hard to get into.  I almost put it down and not pick it back up. I started the book seeing a little of my relationship in it, you know, typically female thinking and men just not getting it. Wow, not MY relationship at all!  As I forged through, I couldn't pull out a warm and fuzzy for the book.  The ending just made me mad.  Almost wish I could get the time back I spent reading...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Hours of Fun !!  Five Stars !!  Angry Birds SPACE is a logical and well-done next step for fans of Angry Birds.  Kindle version works great.  No issues at all.

I hate having to hear Apple owners talk about playing the new game that isn't available for me yet.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|i think about this book often, it bridges the logical and illogical worlds, im an engineer and usually this kind of book doesn't catch me
B004SBX112|5.0|Hours of Fun !!  Five Stars !!  Angry Birds SEASONS is a logical and well-done next step for fans of Angry Birds.  Kindle version works great.  No issues at all.

B005544TRQ|5.0|enjoying this program..relaxing..cute and serious.  Use streaming media and can watch<br />3 shows or 1 when I want..Enjoy it very much.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Picture is so clear, its as if your looking through a very clean window at the actors. Great movie, they did a good job turning an awesome book into a movie!
B0058VW36U|3.0|This game is kind of boring. I thought it would be a lot more fun according to the 'hype' that Amazon presented.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Did not like the ending of the last episode. :(  But overall it was very engaging and interesting.  I enjoyed watching it very much.
B004X80QNG|1.0|The bottom of the calender is at the very top of my screen. It's a useless app. Don't get it and don't buy it. There are other an  better free planner apps.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|My granddaughter likes this but it turned out to be a total time such that causes my Kindle to lock up. I uninstalled it after a day or two.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This tale of a young English boy's struggle with the world around him takes on some very deeply philosophical issues.  What is existence?  Is there more than one plane of reality?  What makes the monsters so monstrous?  I really liked it.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I think this is the best MOBA on tablet! But I think it should improve its control system. There is a long way for it to catch up with DOTA.
B004EAQNO4|4.0|This was good & spooky. I would watch it again for the 3rd time. I thought about it when I got on the elevator at work.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|Fined not enough content.  Constantly using French and then translating what she has said to show she is working in Montreal.<br />Goes too far in depth about the lab and work and not enough of a story.
B00A27X972|2.0|I suspect that the good reviews of this book might be accurate, but the fact remains that having tried several times to &#34;get into&#34; this book, I have failed dismally and in fact have given up. It's not that it isn't funny, it is.  Once I sit down to read it, it does carry me along. But sitting down to read it is very difficult because I just don't care about this narrator. I prefer to read about people who lead with their hearts--people like Sidney Carton and Atticus Finch.  And though I suspect that the narrator will get there eventually, I simply am unwilling to invest the time to go with him.  I'm too old and life is too short.
B005HSL626|4.0|I have ninja blender so enjoy all recipes that I can do and eat I do this all the time
B00003CXBK|5.0|it was so great, it's time to watch it again. miyazaki is likely the best film maker of our time.
0446547638|5.0|Another great love story from Sparks! His writing always intrigues me! Once I was able to sit down and read the book, I couldn't put it down!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great series.  Fantastic actors and a storyline that just won't quit! Into season two now and can't watch fast enough. Lol.
B00DU4Y0JA|5.0|the dvd itself isn't an original but has English subtitles and makes it enjoyable to watch and the quality is pretty great too. If youre a huge fan of the evangelion and want to keep up with the rebuild series I recommend you get this. It takes place 14 years after the second (2.0) and creates a whole new view of he series tht makes you super excited for the final movie.
1416594787|5.0|His research is impeccable; his writing is prose and is lovely. He is a scientist par excellence. So there we are.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a really awesome game you should really get it. I really really really like this game it's a mind workout.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Cricket has over the years gained a reputation of being a rather boring sport. If, however, the usual game of cricket panned out in much the same way as it does in  Alan Hardy's Gabriella then  it would be a reputation easily shirked. A pleasant mixture of cricket, sex, humour and class war, all rolled into a single English summer afternoon. With Gabriella taking the act of flirting to a whole new level, a little injection of cocaine and a pavilion all set up for afternoon tea , the phrase `Sex, drugs and sausage rolls' has never felt more fitting. A wicket story that bowled me over and after reading just the first page there was no way I was going to bail. Gabriella scored 5 out of 5 and not out.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Part Pink Floyd, part 80's new wave, part Queen-esque symphonic rock.<br />Muse creates tracks that never sound alike, and challenge your ear and your mind.<br />Good stuff.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very engrossing right from the first page. Remarkable twist (actually 2 of them!). A little frustrated and surprised by the ultimate ending.
B005U9REU0|5.0|This movie is great!  I love the muppet like creatures, the singing, the storyline and everything else about it. Even though it is an older movie, the special effects are just amazing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been hooked on this drama since day one. Can hardly wait for series 4. Excellent writing and acting.
1452115567|5.0|Maddie and Theron's mission to bring awareness about rescues is such a noble cause.  Theron's photos of Maddie are precious.  If only she knew what a great job she was doing posing and spreading the word about her fellow animals.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|i looked forward to the finial Clifton Chronicles but when I read it, it lacked the greatness of the first two books
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|A light story and a quick read.  Looking forward to reading the next book in the series. Author made the characters personable early in the story.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|i loved his first two books, 5 stars, but comparing this book to them, this book comes way short and was disappointing
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey last fall...so caught up on Amazon.  I recently visited England and was amazed that this is actually how it looks.  I stayed in a village in England and visited others.  I am totally in love with England, their customs and how they speak.  Watching Downton Abbey lets me revisit England and how I felt when I was there.  As well the characters on Downton Abbey are so well cast and I enjoy seeing the interaction between the social classes and the individuals in their own classes.  People are just people and we can see a bit of ourselves in all of them.  Excellent series.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|this is another great book by a great author Ken Follett, very good war story, he mixes his subjects well and they all come together in the story.
B00486070K|4.0|Have not had it very long but it appears to be well made and is a great addition to my Macbook arsenal of gadgets and adapters. Arrived quickly and works as described
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Started this series just to see what it was about, and loved it. I wish they would have done more seasons. I would encourage anyone to check it out. Most excellent.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys rock!  I have both of their cd's and I love listening to their music.  The sheet music is awesome as well.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game for quick hand eye coordination! Speeds your brain to think ahead and sends signals to your hands to respond
0321934318|5.0|Scott has done it again with clear and consise, easy to understand book. I enjoy all of his books designed for the photographer and not the computer wiz
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pretty easy to set up, terrific picture, and it greatly expands our choices of things to watch with the Netflix subscription.  Can't wait till HBO gets on the bandwagon and let's us buy an independent subscription -- I will drop Dish soooo fast!  I'm tempted to just drop it anyway.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps your brain working. Logical and challenging and sometimes need to join items found together. An interesting diversion to fill spare time.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|What we've got here is a very very playful Bob Dylan.  For all his sometimes austere and king of cool persona he was nothing if not cheeky and the tracks herein contain their fair share.<br /><br />Along with originally excluded Self Portait tracks, the jewels in this box set are the unreleased fleshed out material from New Morning with a bigger band sound. Dylan might have floundered on Self Portrait but New Morning is exceptional. The recording ensemble behind him is completely in tune with the NM material as well, kudos to Al Kooper for its musical direction and some horn arrangements. Dynamite renditions of Bring Me Little Water, If Dogs Run Free, Sign On The Window, and Time Passes Slowly are features. The beefy horn arrangement on the title song, New Morning, is a also blast and predates The Band's use of similar use later and Dylan's own use of horns during his Gospel Years.<br /><br />There are a couple of outtakes from Nashville Skyline that don't reveal much, and a teaser couple from the Isle Of Wight concert with The Band that are fine, but other random gems, especially When I Paint My Masterpiece, Wallflower, and Only A Hobo, have much more sparkle.<br /><br />Another Self Portrait is a somewhat misleading title given the inclusion of so much other material aside from SP outtakes but as a catch-all description of his early 70s period it works. Dylan trolling the folk songbook, strained notes and all, is an enjoyable listen, and along with some tight full band outtakes from New Morning it is a substantial addition to the Dylan recording canon.fiddle being the highlight.  So much for his \\"lost years\\" they are found here to be in great condition.<br />There are a couple of outtakes from Nashville Skyline that don't reveal much, and a teaser couple from the Isle Of Wight concert w/ The Band that are fine, but other random gems (especially My Masterpiece, Wallflower, Only A Hobo) add much more sparkle.<br />Another Self Portrait is a misleading title but I guess they couldn't resist. Dylan trolling the folk songbook is solid and a good listen but he is even more \\"self portraity\\" interpreting his original material. Plenty of that here among a wide range of other material. Despite a few vocal clams, what outtake album does not have them?, this is a hell of an enjoyable listen and a worthy addition to the Dylan recording canon.
0345529057|5.0|Very well written series. Always gets a little bit slow in the middle after the 2nd book, but the story line is so rich and complex with so many characters that you lose yourself. Unfortunately this set doesn't have the 5th book in it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I liked all the different costumes for the minions and also the fluffy unicorn mini game. its verry fun its basically a really fun obstacle course I strongly suggest getting this app
B005LAIH2C|3.0|I had hoped that this would be a great movie.  I watched the whole thing and felt like there should have been more to it.  I do love Jeremy Renner. His sister was very good in Clash of the Titans.  Maybe I set my bar high thinking that these two actors would be great,  only to find that the story left a lot to be desired.  The special effect were great. So all in all I can only say this was a good movie,  just not great.
B002C949AE|5.0|Love this book. I could not put it down after I read the first few pages. The story is so inspiring.<br />The service and shipping is great. I love to buy books from this seller.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Yes I enjoyed watching this movie.<br />Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DeCappri are both very good actors.<br />The story had a few twists and turns that I didn't expect.
B00AW57L96|5.0|A new author for me...you know the reviews are good but will she/he keep me entranced?<br />I was delighted with the insight into love at this time in being...our expectations, dating, religion & family values & empathetically portrayed. The overall honesty the author instils into the story line...and everyday life is reaffirming.<br />I found it overall an uplifting piece of fiction ...because realistically life can deal us all lemons & the message is to learn how to add Tequilla...and retain your integrity!<br />My thanks, Susan
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I like a good love story with sex, but sex was a little to rough for me. Other wise a good story
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is an excellent game. I really love it. Hours of fun for all ages. Reminds me of summers at the carnival. :)
B000K4X5XA|5.0|Excellent movie, all the magic and mysticism of superman is captured in this bluray, is a very good investment for filmmakers
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case worked fine for just over a year and started to fall apart the rubber started to come off. NO warranty of materials for a $ 70.00 case is rediculis . I won't buy another one.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Braaaains! Practice this phrase as you will be saying it with enthusiasm while playing &#34;Zombie Dice &#34;. Great game for adults and kids plus you can pretty much play for as long (or short)  a time as you like. There is an ADD -ON set of dice available to kick it up a notch and seriously ....ZOMBIES!!!! Worth every penny and then some!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Down loaded this game twice and it continues to freeze immediately. Have no idea if it is a fun game or not.
0345803493|4.0|There are way to many reviews to bother with much that would be repetitive.  I agree the writing is a bit repetitive and both characters have way too many hormones it seems.  But I enjoy the story and learning some background of the \\"whys\\".  Now I look forward to the, what I thought was obvious, non-accident to be solved in the final volume.  And I'm pretty sure I know who the culprit will be.  However, it will be a fun ride, as I enjoy the bantering.  I get quite a few chuckles for those.  But that's me.  And it will be a while before I get to read the last one.
B00CT2P6VA|3.0|This game has nice graphics and interesting concept, but I became bored with it quickly. Worked well with no freezing issues.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Great pinball app.  I just wish I did not have to buy each table.  This can get very expensive.  So, if you purchase this get ready to spend money.<br />On the plus side, the graphics are so pretty and the game play is really smooth.  I am playing this app on a Kindle HD.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Granted, I am a real Star Trek fan of anything Star Trek but this movie is the best of all!
B000RLHDUM|3.0|Relied too much on skin - not enough on story line and character development on the more subtle level. Nice throw back to start the movie however.
B008Y768XO|5.0|I Love animals, will probably watch this over and over. My Daughter chose to watch it while she was working! She said she had big alligator tears streaming. So don't watch at work. LOL
B0010T0JBK|4.0|The shoes run small, I normally wear a size 8, But has to order a larger size. Like the shoes
B00632HWOG|5.0|Good engine, updates are offered by my choice. Any updates with their software seems user friendly I like that option.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|Epic film. One of the best in the series. It goes beyond special effects and action and delivers excellent character development and depth.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie became a favorite the first time I watched it! It is so cute, and even as an adult I will continue to watch it over and over again.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|this is my favorite star trek movie by far.  love all the action. couldn't wait to buy it.  hope there iwll be another movie.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|Cute game but froze one day never came back despite several attempts to reload and troubleshoot. Too hard for small children times r short enough to level up
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Good app that's proven to be a better replacement for Google Reader.  Has bugs that default to a category at opening,  and the email share functionality also has a bug during first share of session.
B008HK3S4K|4.0|This is great it keeps my Kindle protected when I am finished ready, Looks quite nice also Thank you .
1781162646|5.0|People who grew up in the 70's will like this coming of age and mystery book.  The mystery is 2nd only to the development of the characters and their relationships with each other, first love break ups, making your own decisions, right or wrong as you become an adult and doing the right things, when no one else will.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great lazy day movie. Really takes you back to when music was &#34;real&#34;. I loved every artist showcased and Dave Grohl is an amazing person/artist. Really enjoyed this AND the soundtrack :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The continued story had you at the edge of your seat; however, there were many times when I had to go back and re-read a few pages several times to grasp what the heck was going on.  The second book was easier to follow - still a great series, looking forward to the movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I first got it I thought it was wack but then I started to let my niece play and she loved it and it's actually a great game for kids
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very good family movie experience. We really enjoyed it. Good enough to watch again. Looking forward to the second version.

B0050DZ8J0|5.0|The UI design is simple and intuitive. This is exactly what I love. It runs stably without ads, which are really a problem in today's android(or android-based platform) mobile apps.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a fantastic show that treats wrong as wrong and elevates family strength through the tough times.<br />I am looking forward to season 5
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is superb!! Can't wait for the new season to start!!!<br />Every single character in this show are great actors!! Right down to Malcolm!!<br />Whom I can't stand...
B004BLTNM0|3.0|I know it's old and campy.  I thought there was more to it,  I really liked the new version,  but you can't beat the thought of seeing this one at the drive-in theatre.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Well acted, great stories, if you were an X Files fan you'll enjoy it.  Glad I gave it a chance.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The dialog can run on a bit, but you can skip through. I like the variety of puzzles and trying to problem solve.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This is the entire motion-picture soundtrack of the wonderful movie that featured Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, and Anne Hathaway, among other sterling performers--including Colm Wilkinson, who this time plays the Bishop of Digne, instead of Jean Valjean as he did when &#34;Les Miserables&#34; was first performed onstage. This is the CD that has each and *every* song that was part of the musical movie version, including the one song &#34;Suddenly&#34; that Valjean sings about little Cosette, and which was written specifically for the movie. *This* is the version that you want to buy; it has two CDs and a small booklet that offers a few cast photographs and some information from the original &#34;Les Mis&#34; authors, Alain Boublit and Claude-Michel Schoenberg, and from Cameron Mackintosh, who more than any other individual was responsible for making the &#34;Les Mis&#34; musical into a movie. Most importantly, the quality of the singing and the music is nice and clear, and this &#34;Deluxe 2 Disc Edition, The Motion Picture Soundtrack&#34; has *every* song from the movie-musical. So this is the one you want to buy, *not* the &#34;select soundtrack&#34; version, which has most but not all of the songs, and which sometimes ends the songs rather abruptly. Spend the few dollars more to buy this one; it is well worth it.
140006922X|4.0|While little contemporary historical data on the life of Jesus is available in the written record (all the Gospels were written decades after his death), Aslan uses documented facts about life in the time of Jesus to derive a startlingly vivid account of Jesus' ministry and the response it drew from the Roman and Jewish authorities. What I particularly liked about this book is that it confirmed many of my own views about the inconsistencies and (in my opinion) even inaccuracies found in the Gospels. I was raised on biblical stories from a very early age, but it didn't take me long to realize that, to give one example, the biblical account of Pontius Pilate as a milquetoast administrator of Roman interests in Palestine is ludicrously inaccurate. Independent historical sources reveal him to be a highly effective administrator committed to brutal suppression of any anti-Roman activity. Rather than &#34;washing his hands&#34; of judging claims that Jesus was &#34;King of the Jews,&#34; and telling the Jews to deal with him as they wished, Pilate clearly sentenced Jesus to death. The evidence? The Roman method of capital punishment was crucifixion, while the Jewish method was stoning. The crucifixion of Jesus could only have been a Roman sentence carried out by Romans.<br /><br />This book is not an anti-Christian work, even though it was written by one who, at least originally, was a practicing Muslim. Rather, it was written by a religious scholar so impressed with Jesus as to have developed an obsession with developing a clearer understanding of Jesus' life and work by studying the social and geographical environment in which he lived and preached.
0061950726|4.0|I am hosting this month's Book Club and selected this book even though it isn't the type I normally read.  It was a quick read, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and am hoping the other ladies in my club are as pleased with it as I was.  I truly learned a great deal I didn't know about the orphan trains and the appalling conditions for the children in general.
B006ANJ4BW|5.0|This movie held my attention and was very exciting to watch.  I would recommend it to all who enjoy action movies.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Fantastic characters, plot and action. If you have the 3d home theater set up, this movie is worth watching with all the bells and whistles.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Interesting to somewhat see into the world of our intelligence agencies.  Enjoyed this video and great addition to the collection.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|This review is for the LifProof case used on my iPhone.  I've used LifeProof cases specifically made for the 4S as well as the case for the 5.  Each iPhone model needs the specific LifeProof case for that model.  Between my husband and I we've owned 6 LifeProof cases for our personal and work phones.<br /><br />This is the 3rd LifeProof case I've personally owned.  Yes, they protect from water, drops, scratches, etc.  No, they are not indestructible.  The reason I've gone through 3 cases, while my husband is still using his original LifeProof case is because I tend to take my phone out of the case to hook it up to different accessories.  When you take the phone out of the case a bunch of times, you tend to wear out the little protective gaskets inside that protect the phone from water.  When this happens, you end up with a weird echo on your phone.  It took me a while to figure out it was my phone case causing the echo, and not the phone itself.  Also, since I would try to jam accessories into the charging port of the phone, I ended up breaking the flap cover of my LifeProof case that goes over the charging port.  However, LifeProof does provide an adapter with the purchase of the case, which enables you to plug anything into the aux jack as you normally would.  It's the charger port I have issues with.  Since the flap cover of the charger port only opens 90 degrees, you can't just plug the phone onto any docking station.  You can purchase adapters from other manufacturers which help with this.  These adapters plug into the charging port of your phone and are the same size as the OEM charger.  They extend out enough that you can then plug the phone into most docking stations.  My problem is I don't always have that adapter with me, so I end up pulling the phone out of the case.  With all that said, I still continue to only use LifeProof cases for my phone.  And I have since swayed many friends and family members to purchase a LifeProof case as well.<br /><br />In general, if you don't take your phone out of the case a lot, your LifeProof case will last you several years, as my husband's has.  It does not add a lot of bulk to the phone, as other otter-box cases tend to do.  This only adds a slight bulk to the phone.  The sound is still supurb, both through ear speaker, as well as through the speaker-phone speaker.  Also a note- if you decide to put a sticker or decal on the back of the LifeProof case, it will interfere with the speaker sound, as this case is designed for sound to permeate through the back of the case.  I have a lot of people ask me if the tactile experience is the same since the front plastic cover completely covers the screen.  It does not change graphics appearance, as other screen protectors tend to do.  However, the tactile response is not as pronounced as compared to no cover at all.  With my first LifeProof case, the screen cover was excellent and tactile response was great.  My husband's LifeProof case, however, had less of a tactile response.  Over time, his screen cover seemed to &#34;settle-in&#34; providing a better tactile response.  With my new LifeProof case, I was very disappointed in the tactile response- and it felt like I was getting finger cramps as I punched out a text.  My husband took my phone out of the case, cleaned up the screen and screen cover of the case and put the phone back into the case.  It was a little more responsive after that, but still not quite as good as my previous LifeProof case.  Hopefully it will get better over time.  If your cover seems too bowed, though, and you can't get as responsive as you'd like, you can call LifeProof and they will send you a new front cover, free of charge, as long as you provide them with an image of your receipt.  One last note, as mentioned above, is with the charger port.  Since the charging port cover only open 90 degrees, you may not be able to easily plug all accessories into the phone with the case on.  The solution is to either pullthe phone out of the case, or use an adapter sold by another manufacturer.  The only accessories that will plug into the charging port with this case on are accessories in which the plug is the same size as the OEM USB cable.  So, not a problem if you only use Apple accessories for you iPhone.  But if you use other brand accessories, you may need an adapter.<br /><br />In summary, I feel the LifeProof case is well worth the purchase price.  I have dropped my phone on concrete, forgotten it outside in the rain, spilled a beverage on it, and dropped it countless times on hardwood.  The case protected the phone from all above-mentioned potential damage.  Yes, there's a trade-off with the less tactile texting... but to me it's worth it to truly protect your phone from drops and spills.  Their customer service is AWESOME!  They sent me a replacement front cover-piece free of charge when my original cover piece was not as responsive as I'd hoped.  They also sent me a replacement front cover-piece when the one I had just purchased appeared to have a scratch on the screen right out of the box.  They just ask for an image of your receipt.<br /><br />As a side-note--- if you break 1/2 of your case, such as the back cover which holds the charging port cover, you can purchase 1/2 of the case directly from LifeProof.  They also sell replacement plugs and adapters for the aux jack plug.
B003YDUUHI|1.0|Don't think I will buy anything from this company again.  Took payment quite enough and I had to wait longer that thought I would for music CD.  The packaging was not nearly enough as the plastic case cover came damaged in 3 places.  I don't return the item as I didn't want to waist my time.<br />MY BIGGEST DISLIKE WAS THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE WORDS ON THE MUSIC TRACKS HAD BEEN CUT OUT BECAUSE OF MINOR LANGUAGE AND I MEAN MINOR.  Didn't say censored.... not that I could see!!!!
B000MV90IU|5.0|gave it to my husband for his birthday an he loved it! he'd been looking for it on blue ray for awhile! great deal!
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I watched this film 4 times within the first week of receiving it.  It was so intricately designed it kept me interested the entire time.  Every time I watch it I become inspired to pursue my dream of gymnastics.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I like this program. Very easy to use and adds some fun effects. It only offers a few effects and my hope is that future editions will have more options.
B004X80QNG|1.0|This is v2. The devs came out with a (almost) completely rewritten v3 app. That means this one is an old, obsolete version and a poor FAOTD offering. Very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this games so much.... hint don't use keys... well it is fun. I love the game I could play all day.
0062278096|5.0|Brilliant companion to the TV Series --- indispensable and wonderful addition to an already perfect addition to the Sherlock Holmes Canon
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is a great app!! Has made me really good in cooking in real life. I deleted the first star because I can barely get any gems. Secondly I get a lot money and freedom before this stupid granny and pheope ruins. Then everything it better
B004132HZS|5.0|Indispensable and wonderful addition to the Sherlock Holmes Canon --- a Brilliant modern take on an old theme that is unsurpassed in it's post-original stories originality --
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Not being much of a dog lover, I started reading this book thinking it wouldn't last much past Chapter Two. Wrongo. It was fun and wonderful. The characters caught my fancy and the plot moved along nicely. I hope to read more by Mr.Whitehead.

B00006HYQ5|3.0|In this case I was wanting the IBM branded mouse in the photo to go with an old IBM ThinkPad T30 (one of the last made in North America).  I received the mouse with &#34;ThinkPad&#34; on it.  Yes it's the same mouse - works fine.  I just wanted the &#34;IBM&#34; logo on it.  Now I need to look on ebay, which I didn't want to do.
B008469DGY|4.0|I'm not even a golf fan and I can see myself spending large chunks of time playing this. Definitely worth a spin.
B003E88TKS|5.0|With an authentic plot twist, Up in the Air explores the culture of artificial values where people are too busy to think about their own existence or values. The movie comes off as reflective and substantial. It is a thoughtful study of shallow characters.
B008SOS63S|5.0|An outstanding effort by Joe & band! With several guests contributing, as well. Overall, the sound quality for a live album is excellent and everyone's playing is superb. Really fine examples of well written material also contributes to the overall quality. If my parents were alive, I would force them to listen to the whole cd...even to the point of holding a gun on them. As it is, I will just listen myself.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a good game. Levels have items in different spaces when u replay them. Loads of fun. This definitely has plenty of replay value.
B004WR125O|2.0|Got this product with high hope to pair with my new Onkyo receiver.  It didn't work but I thought the problem was with the receiver rather than this product.  However, I was able to get my refund back very fast.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A tale spanning from Afghanistan to California, about love, family, about losing &finding contact.  Hosseini is a real magician, giving literary birth to real-life characters, whom I came to love.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Good story with interesting and amusing characters, and wonderful humor in the writing.  I have read and enjoyed John Grisham before but never this much.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very readable and the author makes a very large number of people involved very clear as to character, motives and relationships to Lincoln.  She set out to demonstrate how Lincoln built a consensus of his rivals for the presidency after his election, and she succeeded very well.  She also made clear that Lincoln wasn't &#34;just a backwoods type,&#34; but a person with a very clear ambition, sense of morality, and a clever turn of mind which enabled him to succeed as a leader during the Civil War.  It is amazing he was able to hold the union of states together while suffering some of the most grievous losses a person can imagine----as President, as father and as husband.  Altogether, a very worthwhile read.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I really like this show, but I could do without some of the language that is used on a regular basis!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Good app. All the FX work fine and you can scratch with the software as well. This software is about as close as you are going to get to the real thing using a WiFi touch screen gadget.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love candy crush and have been waiting forever for kindle to have it as an app.. of course it still hasn't happened.. so I got on you tube and looked up a video how to download candy crush on kindle.. it took a few tries but I was able to download google apps then download the game.. I'm by no means a tech guy so if I can do it anyone can do it.. I love playing it now and hasn't crashed one time!!

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Channing Tatum is awesome in this movie as he is in all of his movies.  Jonah Hill was hilarious.  a great movie
1400067820|1.0|Looks like Taleb is still trying to capitalize on his original works (Dynamic Hedging \Fooled By Randomness).<br /><br />This is like Watching StarWars 6 and never gives you the thrill of watching star wars 1.<br /><br />Taleb needs to go back to his roots and write a book on trading all his new books are getting too boring\preachy and missing the sarcasm\orginality of FooledByRandomness.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Love the app. But I love hump day too. That's why I put woooop wooop. It's what t he says in the commercial. 2nd best app ever.
1401307787|5.0|The book has short and sweet chapters that are easy to read at night before bed or to just get a quick thought before starting the day. I find the book inspiring and it's ideas have helped me reduce anxiety.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Got it basically for red eye removal. It doesn't work. Don't waste your money on a gimmick, as that is all it is.
0812986180|5.0|what an incredible cast and storyline! each character is well defined. there are many emotions ellicited throughout this amazing book.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I wear it everyday.I take it off at night when I  go to bed.Even though this watch works from movement,it manages to keep time through the night. You can't beat the price for a Quality watch.For some reason,I can't wear Battery powered watches,so these automatic watches work Great for me.The canvas band works much better than Leather.
0857860801|5.0|SIMON'S CAT vs THE WORLD is really a beautifully published work. The pages are glossy and thick and the whole thing is nicely done... which would make it a nice gift for someone who is into the Simon's Cat videos.<br /><br />The topic of this book is Cat vs the world. The world in this case being birds, pug, hedge hogs, chickens, squirrels, and mice!<br /><br />It helps if you've seen the videos, but I found that I was gaffawing out loud at some of the antics and expressions. (You know how those are :)<br /><br />I think I actually enjoyed this book more than Kitten Chaos. And I'm pretty sure that the artwork is better.<br /><br />Like I said, I think this would make a nice small gift for cat lovers and followers of Tofield's genius.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and interesting game full of puzzles. Especially good for a free game app. I enjoyed escaping each floor via puzzles.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Unpredictable for the most part. Classic feel.  The best part is the cinematography. I love the trip to another time period.
0345533054|5.0|I loved this book.  Don't know how I missed it when it was out in hardcover.  He is a great author, but I don't like his Myron Bolitar series.  I love the serious novels.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I bought this used and was worried that the DVD would be scratched, but nope! It looks band new! So thanks for the great DVD. Also it arrived 3 days early so that was a plus!
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|It was the first time i played such a game and the difficulty was just good for a beginner.There is one thing they have to improve is the quality of the translation because my kindle language setting is French the text are inFrench and the translation is horrible sometimes the first riddle is to understand the texts
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Interaction between characters was corny and over the top. Plot could have been interesting but was carried out poorly. I give it a meh

B002JXK5VU|5.0|i love the interaction of the characters. The humor created from incredible situations is awesome. The conflicts between the characters is an asset to the program.
B000XPOB0M|5.0|Have watched this many times and will watch it many more times! Love Hilary Swank in this movie!! Must watch!!
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|As a die hard fan of Matthews,this movie definately rose above Magic Mike. It reminded me of Huck Finn & Tom Sawyers adventures on the Mississippi,with a modern day twist. Still waiting impatiently for another Romantic comedy.....
B002NJWHHA|5.0|Watched this with the kids. Very entertaining. Good story line and good actors. Kids are already asking to watch again.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Product was promptly shipped and arrived in great condition, exactly as described. This is a time travel movie starring Bruce Willis. It's excellent and twisty.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|On level 16, loving it so far! Challenging yet not to hard and a lot of fun. Glad I bought it, it's a game I would play again after beating it..

140006922X|5.0|Of course there is great backlash to this book from a great segment of the Christian community !  Why shouldn't there be ?  This is a highly intelligent, scholarly researched, historically accurate , and easy to read account on the life of a man that openly and deliberately defied the religious and political laws of his times . And to millions of Christians, historical data, no-matter how accurate or well researched,  much, or most of this book, greatly directly interferes with what they want to believe, period !  A good way to easily define this very important books conclusion would be to just say that the Christian religion, as we know it,  is the direct result of, \\"visions\\", seen by the man referred to in the Bible as  the \\"Apostle Paul\\", a man who's teachings were outwardly rejected by Jesus' own brother James and the disciples Peter and John.  Two thousand years years later the teachings of Paul have muted the factual life story of the man called Jesus of Nazareth.  And that, as the author says, \\"is a shame\\".

B005DJRD80|1.0|This programming is so bad I am writing the shortest review I have ever written in my life.<br /><br />Who This Program is NOT for:<br />- Those with basic codes of ethic<br />- Those with personal goals and standards<br />- Those who are over 20 yrs old or have a maturity (before the 21st century anyway) above 14 years-old<br /><br />Who This Program IS for:<br />- People/Kids who at this point in life \\"Just don't get it\\"<br />- People who think acting shocking is acting funny when it is just plain stupid<br />- People who aspire to little in life<br /><br />It is a very sad day to see such trash is voted 4 stars...then again, I am sure most who did not like or approve of this program did not even bother to write a review or knew not to watch this program to begin with...its just that bad and that much of a waste of time.
B008V0CWSE|5.0|John Kennedy Toole's lost manuscript, published after his death under his mother's insistence, is by far the best book I have ever read in my life. I have the first edition copy, purchased for me by my first husband, while we lived in New Orleans as newlyweds. It was the best gift he ever gave me. If you want to laugh, cry, laugh some more, this is the book! Anyone who has ever lived in or visited New Orleans will relate to the crazy cast of characters in this book, and be taken back to the days when D.H.Homes sold grease-cakes, and little old ladies hung out with their sons in seedy Bourbon Street bars on rainy nights! Buy this book! I have several copies, my current husband buys me one very time we go to a bookstore in a different city!!! I am a writer, and if I could choose one book to have written, this would be it, no question! It's a shame that Mr. Kennedy Toole was driven to take his own life. I would have loved to see his genius continue in other volumes. 10+ stars!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a must read by Sylvia Day. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! You might as well go ahead and buy the rest of the series because you won't be able to stop with just the first book!!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love the way it stands alone so that you can read it with no hands.  The red makes it show up in my  purse.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is an excellent writer and keeps the reader engaged through every page of this book. This is well worth the money.
B000FA6720|5.0|Worthy of re-reading this poignant love story is beautiful - but be sure I have a box of Kleenex on hand!  An all tome favorite.
B00846REIS|5.0|Warning! Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down! I originally started this series because I heard a promo for it on Cosmo radio as being a &#34;must read&#34; for the summer. It is &#34;hot and scandalous&#34;!  This is definitely worth the time and money.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Forgettable reworking of many sci-fi tropes (bug-like aliens, eugenically crafted warrior-genius super-children, etc.) with a few heavily telegraphed twists that would nonetheless probably surprise and entertain younger readers.  For a story set largely in a training camp for teenagers, there's a bizarre asexuality to it.  Everything is just boys, soldiers, war games, video games, and philosophical conflicts about war.  In the future, I suppose, there are only 3 females (a mom, a sister, and a classmate), and no-one goes through puberty or thinks about sex.
0446310786|5.0|I am glad that I finally got my own copy of to kill a mockingbird.  What a  great experience indeed!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|A MAGICAL JOURNEY OF A MAN & HIS ADORABLE CAT. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. jUST WISH IT HAD PICTURES.
B000UD08HW|5.0|David Gilmour puts on an amazing show in this video.  There are few entertainers that can play like David can - so glad I ordered it.
B000025D7S|5.0|This is a great cd of Gershwin covers. We play it all the time and have given it as gifts.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|If you're looking to buy a Seiko to show it off, this watch isn't it. Instead, this watch is a simple workhorse that you'll never have to replace. All it does is tell time as well as give you the day and date.<br /><br />What you are purchasing is not conspicuous consumption, but solid, trustworthy quality.<br /><br />Also, at $58.00 this watch is a tremendous bargain. It actually retails for $185.00
B00APYKXFS|2.0|Totally confused on this....what is it suppose to do again??? I opened it, couldn't figure out what I was suppose to do with it, and deleted it.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I spend many evenings trying to improve my scores so that I have three stars on every level. It is very challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is giving my 3 yr. Old great hand eye coordination. I couldn't believe she knew how to play better than me!! And I'm good.lol would be interesting if you could level up different scenarios. Keep the great games coming!!
B003S6T62Q|5.0|Not sure where to start or whether I'm going to be able to fully give Joe the credit he deserves. Simply put, this concert is off the hook! The sound and video quality are amazing. Given that this concert was performed in Japan, I must say Mr. Thomas has pulled this one off very nicely indeed. The performances just kept on getting better and better as the concert progressed. The selection of grooves that Joe chose to sing on this DVD was just brilliant. All the songs are great but in particular 'I Wanna Know' and 'Majic' will totally blow you away. In short, a priceless performance. Now I know why I own every single Joe album. Miss it at your peril.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love this show! It's soo good, been addicted since day 1! And it doesn't help that Charlie Hunnam is too sexy! ;)
B003L77G8I|5.0|I have all of the series except the 8th season.  I watch the show even though I have them on DVD.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Good idea for those who use Goolge regualrly. Happy I got it. Recommend it to others who have a Kindle.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers,  it was good, i would recommend this show to anyone, this is the fifth time am looking at it
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This does not work without  going through a great deal of work. I am very disappointed. I do not recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps you thinking at all times.  It is very challenging and for a stay at home mom it is nice being challenged by something other than your children.
0670026182|5.0|An all round fabulous book.  Recipes easy & delicious (some more than others), truly spectacular photography -- you could almost eat some of the pics.  The attitude of the book is incredibly inviting -- it's a &#34;cover to cover&#34; as soon as it is opened -- very impressed -- Ms. Quinn Davies is so generously talented.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love this show and this season did not disappoint! I cannot wait until the next season begins! I highly recommend this series and season to everybody.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|My daughter and I love this series and plan to purchase more seasons.  Characters have deep and unique personalities that endear you to many of them and despise others.  The singing is fabulous and we even have added their songs to our ipods!  Interesting story lines, although not always suitable for some younger viewers.  Usually a good moral lesson to take away from each episode.  Love it!
B000HZD168|5.0|truly a one of the Star Trek classic movies, bug in the ear what more could you ask for. awesome
B00932A4XE|1.0|The movie started out slow. Characters were stupid. The story line could have been better. I just did not like it.
B004GJNFHG|3.0|This was an ok movie, a bit slow for me.  They did a very good job portraying the life inside the prison.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I have watching all three seasons in a row and will be sad to have to wait for the next season to come out.  Loved the plots and characters of the servants downstairs and the Earl and his family above stairs!  The scenery and costumes are excellent!  Highly recommend the whole series to anyone interested in peeking into an English country home during the early 1900's.
1451626096|5.0|I loved this book along with all of her others books she writes amazing and gives you a great view of the times and history.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|It is annoying that Mer keeps going back and forth between Maxon and Aspen. I find that I just want to read the last book to find it if she is actually going to make a decision.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|the final episode was the surprise episode of the season.  A MUST watch.  I can't wait til season 4 premiers.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the automated card placement function, and the option to deal a &#34;winning&#34; game when you're fed up with not being able to complete a game.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I found this to be a slow southern all around nice movie.Keeps your interest right until the end.Lessons about moving on in life..any young man Ten or older would love this movie..as truly the main character is Ellis the fourteen year old.Another Matthew McConaughey movie to add to my library.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a great storyteller - I did not want it to end -  I highly recommend this book
1582701709|1.0|1980, Reagan, Thatcher and Wojtila begin the reactionary revolution needed to set things back to their due place for the great thieves of the world, after some years of concessions: welfare state, civil rights... In the sixties and seventies the cool thing to be was to be a hippy, \\"make love, not war\\", or a marxist (or at least \\"socialist\\")... Not any more, the eighties belong to the yuppies, \\"take the money and run\\". Hand by hand with the neoliberalism and social-darwinism as the triumphants Theology (\\"In Gold we trust\\") and Anthropology, it dawns in the human history the last massive religious phenomenom, the so called New Age. Religion for the Western Narcissus, who doesn't want to grow and become a mature adult (quoting Freud, someone devoted to love and work). Each and every one of these millions of Narcissus wants to be wealthy and to live forever in a young body; once stripped of the laughable rubbish that acts as atrezzo (channeling aliens from other stars, and so on), the core of the New Age message is: it's your birthright to be wealthy (=parasite) and live forever young. You only have to choose it. Quantum Physics has proved the validity of this Secret. Stop \\"being a loser\\" (in the USA you'd rather be called \\"son of a b****\\" )... Run to buy this book. Don't blame anyone if you have to work 16 hours a day in two shit jobs to pay the mortgage: you could choose to be a billionaire but you prefer to be exploited.<br />Here there's another secret: you don't choose anything. You know why? Because \\"you\\" doesn't exist. The sense of an autonomous self is the great delusion. Let alone a self that imposes \\"his\\" endless stream of childish wishes to the \\"Universe\\". But \\"Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur\\". The world wants to be deceived, so let it be deceived. That wish will be granted, you'll be deceived. Only when you become completely, utterly frustrated, fed up with the world's lies, you'll be ready to accept the naked truth (no need for capital t). I won't tellyou what that truth is: it's waiting inside you to be encountered.
0385493800|5.0|Grisham does a nice job on this one<br />I'm a fan<br />I loved Runaway Jury and also bought the DVD
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|In my opinion the last good bond movie was Goldeneye with Pierce Brosnen. Every one since then just never measured up to the &#34;original&#34; movies, with extremely sub-par plots and laughable &#34;evildoers&#34;. (Yes this covers Casino Royal....never will know why this is concerned a great Bond movie)<br />Skyfall thrusts Bond into a very real 21st century adventure with great tips of the hat to Bonds of the past. If you are a fan and have seen all the older movies the &#34;inside&#34; jokes will really make you appreciate this film even more.<br />More importantly this movie sets up characters we will see going forward in the series, Money-penny, Q, and M. (all played very well by their appointed actors)
B009POHHRG|5.0|I would recommend this book to people the age of 16 and up. This book shows how dangerous Joker really is.
B005SAP45I|2.0|Just saw this on netflix the other night and left half way through the movie. This movie is too complicated for anyone under the age of 6 or 7 and my 9 year old didn't find it very interesting. The jokes (adults will get them only) are few and far between and the story is something we've all seen before.<br />I really enjoyed Cars but this &#34;follow up&#34; really fell short on originality and can not capture the magic of the original.
0770435726|2.0|I found this a very tiresome attempt to appeal to a generic female audience, where the narrator, once a busy and (self)important CIA agent and now an expat housewife, keeps whining about how boring and demeaning it is to be the household drudge. There she is scrubbing toilets when she was once killing people.  The plot turns on a move to Europe for the sake of her husband's new job paying huge bucks.  It's Europe! They have money! Get a maid! Geez....
B004FP1WX0|4.0|My daughter and I have been watching the tv show and we wanted to see what started the series.  Now we know Nev's story.  Pretty crazy.
0316067598|5.0|Hard to put this book down.  A team of true heros, sad that only one made it out alive.  The world would be a lot better with more Marcus Luttrells and his buddies running around.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I can't get off this game. So much fun! Love it so many levels and very challenging. My husband and I both play together.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love this show.  It has good character development, clips along at a good pace, and I don't know &#34;who done it&#34; five minutes into the story line.  I love the mystery writer idea as well.  Although I have been a Tom Straw reader for years..just saying... and I may be older but watching Nathan reminds me that I'm still kicking..<br />To the crew of Castle:  keep up the good work!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|When I play this game I feel exactly like Tony Stark. After I watched the movie I felt soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo connected to the game.<br /><br />#BestsStoryLineEver<br />Intense action pack combat<br />And best voice characters<br /><br />I am speechless to say how amazing and awesome and spectacular this game is.
B000002N25|5.0|I have all of the Dire Straits album and also all of Mark Knopfler's albums, but somehow I missed &#34;Golden Heart&#34;.  It is vintage Mark Knopfler.  There are some Scottish pipes and even a song in French.  Knopfler's songs are about many different subjects, not just love.  For example: one about Imelda Marcos and one about a soldier fighting in Napoleon's army called &#34;Done with Bonaparte&#34;.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|A reason why I like this game is...I get to play against my friends on Facebook..Also my daughter loves to play it too...
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is one fantastic writer--  excellent prose--great storyteller.  Dark and disturbing book, twisted.  That said,  some things don't ring true (13 yr old girls  don't hang out with 10 yr olds, for instance).  Chacterizations  overall superficial, excepting the main character and her mother.  Ending seemed very rushed, like the author as sick of the book & just wanted to get it over with.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|I just loved the series. Filled with heart break, torture, love, and happiness. He has made a the most perfect series I think I have ever read.
B00005JM02|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughters Disney collection.<br />She really likes it and has watched it several times. Yay!
B004GYY714|4.0|I recommend this app to people who just want to listen to the actual radio... if you want something like the Pandora, get the iHeart Radio app instead; you can get &#34;Your own&#34; radio stations without radio commercials! TuneIn can kind of get confusing to me too.  The iHeart Radio app is much easier to get around in.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Ms Harris ended her story of Sookie's adventures on a good note and a very surprising one. I felt good about leaving Sookie and her friends. Hoping that maybe Ms. Harris will have us revisted them again sometime.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm hooked on these little guys. Entertaining game for all ages; I'm over 60 and have fun with it. Love it.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I did enjoy reading this story. However, it's extremely similar to the &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; series. The only major difference is there's more of a romance built into the plot to this series as opposed to the crude, sexual activity in &#34;Fifty Shades.&#34;
1401937268|5.0|I have used these cards a few times now.  They are large and I find I have a little trouble trying to shuffle them. Maybe it's because they are new.  But they are nice and so far have been correct!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best app ever! Makes typing fun on a mobile device and best of all I got it for free !
031623480X|5.0|This book was given to me for my review:<br /><br />I read a lot of nutrition and health books. Often, I will read a book and be enthusiastic at first, but further research indicates the book may not be \\"all that\\". Grain Brain, by Dr. David Perlmutter IS \\"all that\\" and a bit more. Dr. Perlmutter is both a board certified neurologist and nutritionist, and he knows from whence he speaks. While the title of the book might indicate that the book is all about brain health, I would say that it is a book about systemic health. Perlmutter creates cross links between body systems and shows how \\"wheat, carbs and sugar\\" are wreaking havoc. He clearly shows why a person suffering from diabetes, arthritis and memory loss is not suffering from three separate diseases, but from one whole disease that attacks the whole body, showing up in that individual's most vulnerable areas first but working silently in others. Perlmutter indicates that while one may seem to not be suffering from, say, Alzheimer's disease, but only from thyroid problems, it is likely that the same mechanism is at work in both places. He explained so much and made so many connections that I have been much more diligent about cutting out all of the carbs. As disease prevention and disease reversal, Dr. Perlmutter makes his case for cutting out carbs from our diets and relying on protein and vegetables as the mainstay of our eating plan.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I received the movie in excellent condition, the package has no wear and tear.  I will save this for a rainy night to watch it.
0143122061|1.0|Niall Ferguson is one of the worst academics ever published.<br /><br />This fetid pile of neocon tripe is a fact-free compilation of fascist drivel. It's unbelievable that a neonazi of Ferguson's ilk could hold down an academic post at all.  But in fact not so incredible when we realise that this vile man makes his money providing academic 'credibility' to warmongers like George W Bush and Barack Obama. This is what makes him employable.<br /><br />This book is neonazi trash.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What an amazing show--it has everything and the writing is phenomenal. You will laugh, you will cry--you will be captivated! It's an experience and I am hooked!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This is another solid MegaDave album.  Interesting riffs, melodic yet thrashy.  Great lyrics as always.  Thanks Dave!  Excellent production is an added bonus.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This movie is entertaining from beginning to end, between action scenes and \\"how'd they do that?\\" moments! I honestly can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie. My husband & I kept looking eachother in awe.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|I read the book over 30 years ago while pregnant and remember that it scared me.  Watching to movies ont was not as scary as I remember the book but it it still a disturbing picture.  I did not watch it alone.  I still jumped in some spots but it was an enjoyable experience.<br />I'm so happy we have come a long way in medicine because the suffering the poor child went through is minimized now.  I would definitely recommend this movie for viewing.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|good movie good acting loved Barbra Streisand hope she makes more movies...we need more Barbra in our lives. seth surprised me with really good part.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|This game has great graphics.  It combines two of my favorite things...the Marvel universe and pinball.  The levels appear interesting enough to keep my attention.  Very good app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very good keeps you wanting to play all the time. Hard to quit. Have to see the next screen before putting down..
B0055SWM08|5.0|WISH it lasted longer but it was fun and challenging. I am hooked so I will be buying more games from quell.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|they don't call it the greatest hits for nothing very talented artist  nothing like twisting one up and zoning out listening to DOWN BY THE RIVER.........
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|I love this album. Highly recommend. The first song grabs you, and you can't escape. Also, this tour was amazing!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've just finished the third book of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" about 2 wks ago and my heart is empty because I already miss Christian. It took me less than 2 wks to read all three books. Could not get enough. Does it mean I'm obsessed if I went out and bought a Blackberry and some Twinings English Tea? Christian has many  traits of the man of my dreams! Can't wait for the movie. Great job Ms James!
B00BIT1HM2|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this movie, for some reason it has the perfect blend of suspense and drama missing in today's cinema.  It is beautifully acted, and wonderfully directed with equally effective cinematography.
