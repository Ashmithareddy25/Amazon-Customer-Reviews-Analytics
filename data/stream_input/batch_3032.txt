0385743564|5.0|Sanderson delivers a quirky tale of the overwhelming underdog good guys (Reckoners) vs the completely evil, variably invincible bad guys (Epics).<br /><br />We never really discover how the few otherwise ordinary people gained super-powers across the planet to become Epics. A future installment is hinted. Epics have these mulitudes of strange and supernatural traits but paired with obscure weaknesses that enable the mere mortal to slay them. An Epic's weakness is discovered by careful study, strange logic and deadly trial and error theorem testing. The Epics corral their erstwhile humankind sheep in various cities to be ruled by a mobster-like high-Epic and his minions possessing some level of super power ... but not enough to take on the boss for control. Threats and coercions come at every level and from every direction in Sanderson's tale.<br /><br />The quirkiness of Steelheart is the complexity of Sanderson's fantastically considered Epics and their powers. The underdog Reckoners are an edgy, rather sorry lot on a mission of personal vengeance wrapped in a `Team' strategy.  The twists and turns in this underdogs vs supermen story are entertaining. Nothing is as it seems, ever. The story is a bit slapstick and fun.
B001NHNG64|3.0|These so far read like a dumb action movie.  Sometimes, that's ok though.  but, the amount of information that the author gets wrong is staggering.  His wording is all wrong (He's British and it shows - he doesn't use the right words in situations - that's fine, but not when you are talking about Americans fighting in Montana)<br /><br />If this was a movie - no one would ever reload, only the hero would ever be able to hit his target, and would do so from a ridiculous distance away.<br /><br />Reacher in this book (though he doesn't know it) breaks the world record for accuracy distance shooting at 1000 yards.  He does so casually, with an off the shelf rifle.  This kind of thing gets just...stupid after a while.  The plot is rather flimsy, but as I said - Dumb action movie.<br /><br />He's a lone drifter spec-ops sniper warrior ninja with a MP background that gets all the ladies, loves them and leaves them as he moves on to his next adventure.  He's like an over-sexed Cain from &#34;Kung Fu&#34;.<br /><br />This may the male equivalent of a trashy romance novel.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Thoughtful, subtle but also detailed story of a young woman manipulated by her spy masters .  Excellent reading and a heroine to root for.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Brandt Legg is a tour de force. His work has a powerful New Age quality that packs a mighty punch and a professional quality that will floor you. His first book, Outview, was good. Outin is even better. Highly recommended.
0374275637|5.0|This is a fascinating book. It's well-written and has a nice mix of theory and anecdotes. The illustrations in the book are particularly effective, as well. Kahnemann does an admirable job explaining the work he and Tversky won a Nobel prize for.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|My Kindle is HD and this app works great. A full FB page is clear and easy to read and if there is a downside it's that my fingers are much to large to really pinpoint my desire (and yes it allows zooming too). A scribe is probably in order, but since the ole digits are attached, they get used first. I still like it and would like to see a bit of streamlining the software to operate better with the Kindle. Still recommended though.
B006C45LHA|5.0|Cowboys an Aliens, Quality Western, with Aliens to boot. There are a whole bunch of Indians running around as well...
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Great mix of old sounding KOL mixed with new sound. Great album,  would recommend to all old and new fans of this band
B005T87QCI|3.0|My kids told me that if you want to build a robot it has a fee, if you want to upgrade your current robot it has a fee.  Maybe if they charge a little more more for the app (2 or 3 dollars) and liberate other features it should be a great game.  Graphics are real good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is incredibly addictive and really fun. It's like temple run but better! The only thing I don't like is that it constantly tempts you to buy things with real money in the game. So have self control, get the game, and have a blast for free!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Incredibly touching book that gives great perspective on some of the things we take for granted. Characters are so likable that by the end of the story there is a large emotional attachment to them.
0553801473|5.0|I love this book! George RR  Martin does it again! Cant wait for the next one! I really enjoy the show too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is so AWESOME and addicting! If you are looking for a cool game get candy crush.#Addicting.  CANDY CRUSH RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|it keeps freezing and sometime shuts down...and sometimes it will blank out and come back to where the cards are just the color and no numbers...
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Was great until....it crashed.  I worked my way through many levels only to have the app refuse to run.  Now I can't get in.  Such a shame.  I loved it when it worked.
B009C7JS14|3.0|i live in Saginaw mi and it keeps going with frankenmuth....and i don't live there...that is about an 45 min away from me...i even try to rest it from my school Delta and that is an hour or more from there....
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'm tempted to say that this is the best game on the Vita, but that would be selling this game short. This game is better than any 'Bioshock', it's better than any 'GTA', it's better than any 'Uncharted', it's better than any 'Zelda' game, it's better than any 'MGS' game, it's better than 'The Last of Us'. As much as I try to refute it, the fact remains, this is simply the best game ever made.<br /><br />This particular version of the game is improved in a few ways, and adds quite a bit of content, having said that, all is not perfect, if you played the original PS2 version, and were a fan of Chie &#34;a character in the game&#34;, you'll be horrified to hear that she has a new voice-actress. But other than that small pet-peeve, all is well in the land of Inaba.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what else to say other than 'You need to get this game now!', seriously, buy, borrow or steal a Vita! But get this game! Yes, it is totally worth getting a Vita JUST for this game alone!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|when I try to download it downloads and then goes to install but then fails! NOT HAPPY!!! does this happen to anyone else?
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love everything about this game; the colors, design and challenges. Will tell all my friends about it!  Can't wait to try the timed version.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app is easy to play and is perfect for a beginner or to teach a child with.  The games are simple and the player usually wins every one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app!! please give us more levels!  this app allows  kids to be creative and think and that is great. Can you escape?
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another greatly entertaining read from Neil Gaiman.  I really enjoyed his world and main character.  I had a hard time putting this one down.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I was curious about Chris Kyle's story and bought this book.  It was an interesting read, but at times got into too many side details and tended to get boring.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  The main character was easy to identify with and the setting was an eye-opener into what it might be like to live in a country with an absolute dictator.  Sometimes the similarities between North Korea and the American media were a bit eerie.
B00421IR5I|4.0|There's a series of short stories in several books in France called Le Petit Nicolas about a schoolboy named Nicolas.  This movie uses three or four of them for its plot.  The stories are humorous and the movie does a good job of translating them to the screen.  I like the actors who play the parents of Nicolas, but I think they're both unknown in the U.S.  At the very least, this film gives a look into the life in a French grade school.  Nicolas is not nearly as bratty as Dennis the Menace, but he gets into humorous trouble all the same.
B0031RS44S|4.0|Love his books.  This one is as good as they usually are.  Easy to read.  Yes, you might know that he always gets out of trouble, but it is the way he gets out that is interesting.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Absolutely wonderful read yet again from Jeffrey Archer.... the follow on from the sins of the Father..  Jeffery Archer has delivered another book that is hard to put down....  And yet at the end we are left wondering what is going to happen next... Part IV is to be released in March 2014..... I definitely recommend this book....
B0053O89IS|5.0|I like the way they make it possible to have a good laugh in some serious situations.  Even after all the years they have been together, the two main characters never seem &#34;tired&#34; or overdone!  This series is fun stuff throughout with the odd times that can hit a nerve or two.
0345803485|5.0|While I havent read a paperback in years, it seems to me that the paper its printed on is getting thinner and thinner. This however, is NOT the seller's fault.  Thank you for a smooth transaction.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book is a must read if you really want to understand more about human interactions and cope with the deceit epidemic we see in business and personal life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The only complaint I have is when I give lives to friends they don't always get them. But<br />This is my favorite game to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, They Have This App In My Kindle Fire Hd Amazon Appstore! I've Been Waiting For The Longest! And It's The REAL DEAL! Works Perfectly Fine, Colors Are Elaborating, Everything About It Is Perfect!
B008N1V11U|3.0|I finished the game and then it wouldn't let me back in? Not sure why it did that. [P.S it takes a lot of gigabytes]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for finally making this game available for the Kindle Fire!  I love this game and and was so disappointed when I couldn't get it on the Kindle Fire.  It provides hours of entertainment and is very addicting.  I recommend it to everyone.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline of the book. The author does a great good in details of each character. Loved it
B002CGSYNU|2.0|Although it is written front lens cap for Olympus 14-42mm, it does not fit into my lens. I don't know why, maybe because I have the 14-42mm lens II, sold with the Olympus E-P3...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great read!  The book moved well from cover to cover.  It was interesting, exciting and a bit scary all in one!  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|i cant believe anyone would or could say anything bad about this book! it simple wonderful with an original twist on the classic cinderella story . simply amazing!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to pass time with. Very good way too wind own from a long day. I would play again.
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|Honestly after In Waves my expectations weren't very high but I have been very impressed by Vengeance Falls. It is a solid album all the way through. I can definitely hear David Draiman's influence in a lot of the tracks but I think it had a good impact.<br /><br />Stand outs:<br />As I explode<br />At the end of this war<br />No way to heal
B003ODIZL6|5.0|J,W,D,T,<br />What I liked about the dictionary was the wonderful definitions the the dictionary gave me and I am 22 years
B006S01GH2|5.0|Quirky and pleasant.  It's an exploration of an introverts interaction in society and I truly enjoyed the movie's take on making change happen in your life and others.<br /><br />There is brief nudity in the beginning when they show how the mother's pregnancy leads to amelie's birth, and audible elusions to one or two sex scenes, but otherwise it is a pg-13 movie.  Very funny.
B00EZQJX76|5.0|This is an older book that I had heard of but never read.<br /> A friend suggested that read it and I am so GLAD that I did.<br /> Loved it!<br />A very uplifting book. You have to feel GLAD after reading it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cool game. wish u could get boost for free though.<br /><br />hahaha uahaja uwhwh wjw kw eh ebbs. why whys. ehh euh
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|If you are a fan of Jack Johnson, you must own this album!  It is one of his best, I have not been able to stop listening to it since I got it. I love it!
B00009Z574|5.0|I love this album! A great purchase with many bonus tracks, the remastering on this cd also sound s amazing! YEAH
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited that Amazon finally got this game to work. You will not be disappointed.  It's really fun. Once you start playing you won't stop
B00007LTIC|5.0|I love this album! A great purchase with many bonus tracks, the remastering on this cd also sounds amazing! YEAH
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Marked exceeds all other vampire books! P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast did an amazing job writing Marked. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
B00009Z576|5.0|I love this album! A great purchase with many bonus tracks, the remastering on this cd also sounds amazing! YEAH
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Almost as much fun as Bejeweled Blitz, but not quite.  Actually kind of a rip off of the main idea of Bejeweled Blitz with some variations.  Not as addicting either, it's just because it's newer.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|This album is amazing! I love it! The best thing is the guest artists on the album. Awesome album and I recommend!
B00BT70J7M|5.0|ANYTHING THIS FABULOUS, EXCEPTIONALLY VERSATILE (& OH SO HANDSOME!!!) ARTIST DOES--IS DONE WITH INTELLIGENCE, TECHINQUE, INNER KNOWLEDGE--AS WELL AS RESPECT AND LOVE FOR HIS CRAFT!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Unusual perspective and a good story to tell. It's not literature but it is a good read. I hope you enjoy it too.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|ANYTHING THIS FABULOUS, EXCEPTIONALLY VERSATILE (& OH SO HANDSOME!!!) ARTIST DOES--IS DONE WITH INTELLIGENCE, TECHINQUE, INNER KNOWLEDGE--AS WELL AS RESPECT AND LOVE FOR HIS CRAFT!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Fun game, but it adds up.  Its getting frustrating having to constantly pay. We should be able to earn lollipops and other options by getting good scores...not just paying for it.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|I love the lead actor and actress, but this is so flashy and in-your-face that I was put off right away. Too much glitter, too much of everything!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|My husband and I wanted to complete the trilogy so we decided to watch the last in he Hangover series.  Most of e situations in he movie were rather dark in nature compared to the other Hangover movies but there was still some of the quintessential humor that all three Hangover movies had provided. Overall it was worth the money to rent but I don't think that we will buy it.
0670026638|3.0|At first I was very charmed by the book - Proust, Dogen, the play on Being Time, and a anarchist nun who had many lovers.  But, I found the first half depressing to read.  My wife won't read it because I grumbled so much.  The last half was fun to read and it had an interesting end.<br /><br />If you don't mind reading a depressing story for 200 pages, it might be worth reading.  There is a turn around and there are uplifting parts. I am thinking about giving the book to a friend but I can't say I recommend it so ...<br /><br />I know I am in a minority - despite my years of Zen practice, having lived in Japan, etc. but this book just didn't do it for me.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|Love the music in this movie. Great for kids! Animation is a little dated, but the story line makes up for it. :-)
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was terrifyingly real.  But the act of one madman exposing the reality of the madness of the entire society is still a relevant point.  We may be facing economic destruction rather than nuclear, but the relevance is still there.<br /><br />The movie uses some incredibly dark humor to show that our \\"civilization\\" is a madhouse.  The performances are stellar (Peter Sellers plays three key roles in this one) and it is laugh out loud funny in many places and it is also cry out loud funny in others.<br /><br />The use of black and white instead of color in some ways makes it more real.  Excellent choice.<br /><br />It still cuts with a razor even so many years after it was made.
B00005N6KG|1.0|These are the kind of headphones you buy in bulk because after a while they stop working in one or the other earpiece.<br /><br />They used to be priced appropriately, but now I see the product has gotten literally ten times more expensive since I last bought a pair. I bought that pair back in May.<br /><br />I am not sure what happened in the meantime, but I am pretty frustrated. I definitely do not recommend buying them at this price point.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Well, i dont have to agree with the direction of the Series new incarnation to appreciate the Genius way to have your cake and eat it too with adherence to story cannon...yet having a totally new kirk/spock/scotty/bones chemistry. Will see how next movie goes
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love the movie, love the price for the combo, love that the blu-ray has more extended scenes than the dvd, Love it!
B008JFUNNM|5.0|This is one of the best movies of ALL TIME. The acting was incredible and the sheer terror of reality was overwhelming.<br />There were several times I just couldn't believe this happened and felt the fear in the men.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine not watching this for the first time in a theater. I think it would have been a totally different experience. So if you get a chance, go see it on the big screen.<br />If not, lock your doors, turn down the light and make sure you have no distractions. This movie is a MUST SEE.<br /><br />Total WOW factor.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great app wish they wouldn't make u use gems other than that its a great game if you like horses
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|glad this is finally available on kindle fire! I love candy crush and it's better on the larger screen versus my phone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I find this game very fun &amp; funny because of the costumes for the minions it is a very fun game.5 stars : )
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been waiting for this to be on the kindle to finally play this game. It's fun and I can see why people are addicted to this game.
1400032717|5.0|It is good. The cover is okay and it looks the same as that showed on the picture. Very good
B0000025KI|4.0|Great fun to hear where it all started from. Love the tracks. I recommend it to anyone who likes Bruce and the E street Band.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|I've watched \\"Falling in Love\\" several times, and the charm hasn't let up.  I've never understood the negative reviews of the movie.  Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep don't necessarily fulfill the imagined requirements of a perfect romantic couple, and that's a shame.  The movie is about adults and the ways in which they may find themselves in unexpected, joyful, heartbreaking, and just really odd situations.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I believe this is good , but the  one you buy is even better because  this only for a limited time  , but so far so good
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really worth the read... The reviews are accurate.  First rate author.  Price is just unreal for the quality you receive.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great adventure. All of the action heroes in one movie.  Good team work.<br />Great deal on Prime membership.  Worth watching.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|This is a great movie, especially if you love period pieces.  The downtrodden star rises to live with her wealthier family who don't particularly treat her well.  She is made the invaluable offer of marrying a wealthy good looking man and to her families dismay...she says no.  The rest of the story turns into the usual and uplifting love story where everything works out in the end as it should.... doesn't it in all English love stories!  I adore it!
B008ROG6E0|1.0|bad acting, stupid plot, shot entirely within a shopping mall eeeeeyw!!!!! LBM's Run would be better movie! Now for that much needed POTTY BREAK!  GOTTA RUN
B008YU7IGW|5.0|This audio book is about an hour long, but it's alot to take in so it requires listening to more than once to get the full &#34;bang&#34; of the information.  I find new affirmations each time I listen.  It has really helped me to choose better and different thoughts and improve my focus and attitude.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Captivated me from the first sentence to the last. Move over Dean r Koontz<br /> I do believe I have just found my new favorite  read.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Excellent! I love to rent movie from the comfort of my couch! And this movie is perfect for doing that! Recommended movie for having a nice time!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I like games where you have to use you brain to see your next move before you make it.  Recommend it to everyone.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|i've loved Star Trek all my life, the TV series, the Movies, etc....but these past 2 new movies where the action is grittier and the effects just out this world.  It's an easy 5 star review for me...but again, i'm a bit biased!  Although i must say a co-worker who did see the old movies and didn't like them....really liked the 'new' 2 Star Trek movies.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|No point in having this game free when its nearly impossible to advance in the game without wasting real  money. Don't waste your time or money. All the good guns require real money. Stupid.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This is a very good game, and his history its excellent. Good job Rovio. The tiny thief is fantastic, and like it very much.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|Wow!  Great job with this one! At last, a good example of how games should be delivered to the public.  Well worth the price for really good gameplay.  No fishy permissions an  no need to worry about in app vending.  Looks really good on my KFHD.  Again, great job.  Hope this is not your only  entry.
0671646788|5.0|It is a magical book. Open any page anytime and you start enjoying it. I always carry it in my brief case. Full marks...
0800141660|4.0|A story about love, friendship and loyalty are appreciated anytime, more yummy when set in a slower time. Loved Alan Richman as the painfully in love hero.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome I love the adventure and excitement in this game it's great for kids to play or even teens.
0812550757|5.0|A must read for every Scifi fan.  A friend gave me a copy years ago, and I read it in one sitting.  Finished at 5:30 am
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I started watching the show (2 seasons) and then stopped to start the books, glad I did.  The books are great and it helps that I can visualize the characters since I've seen the show.  Having them on the Kindle is great.  Only thing I wish they did was breakdown the progress (% complete) by individual book instead of the 4 book set.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift and the recipient is thrilled with how well it works.  Well worth the money.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I didn't know what to expect but the epilogue showed just how much this could go on. I recommend this fully
B008GBCMHO|4.0|My kids really like this movie and love the music -<br />Funnier than a hippo in a puddle says my kid.<br />We really liked it.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|Loved it! I almost don't want to watch the movie as I just don't think anything else could live up to this! The creepy images I have in my head.... Mind blown
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The Chromecast Has very limited streaming options, you better carefully read the external reviews. And it doesn't really work outside of the US - applies to both the iOS/Android app and the streaming options.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Well, I am curious about what this nifty thing could do so order one. The first time i ordered it, I was told I won't get one for another couple of months. Ha..So it is really hot. Then a month later, I ordered it again and Amazon shipped it to me in a week.<br /><br />First, I could not do the set up from my iPad. I did everything according the instruction, but when I got to the part that I need to set up the home network, the app refused to accept my WPA security key. So gave up on that one. Then I tried again and ran the set up from my MacBook: it worked!<br /><br />I can then start streaming from my iPad..but only from Netflix and YouTube! OK so what good is it? Most newer TV, media players and some BluRay players already have this capabilities. I have 2 devices that I can access Netflix and Youtube attached to my TV, why would I want to stream from my iPad??<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this and have iOS devices, wait awhile. May be Google will get around to add more steaming apps.  Mine is going up the shelf now and staying there until I can stream to it from my iPad's movie players, Azul, Seagate Media...:-).
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I never watch tv, and people persistently told me to watch it. I broke down and did. Now I can't stop.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good but not as good the shining. It didn't have as much violence as some of his earlier books but had just as much suspence and anticipation. Wish the description of the villains was more extensive, didn't quite understand what exactly they were taking from their victims.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|...but gets rather repetitive.  I liked some of the new changes from temple 1.  Twenty word minimum, Sheesh.  How much can one say about something like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its about time. Finally a Kindle version of candy crush saga. So exciting. Works just as great as the computer version.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|What a great App for practicing with letters!  I bought this for my niece to play with while she was here, and she loved this game!  That's what it was to her, a game... and I love Apps that operate like that for small children.  It is colorful and bright  and very interactive, it helps not only with alphabet, but fine motor skills too.<br /><br />It is geared for toddlers, but my 3 year old niece loved it!  I love it because it keeps her attention, and helps her learn.  A win win.  I have several of the Abby Monkey apps, and none of them have disappointed me at all, I highly recommend to anyone it is such a great value for the price!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I hate how kf also puts apps out there once there old. It's stupid how late this thing comes out with apps...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga.  I am excited and happy it is now available on the  kindle fire. I like how with each level it is a bigger challenge.
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|I found this story to be amazing as well as totally absorbing. It is a book which is difficult to category despite the explicit sexual content.<br /><br />The main characters: Julian and Siris are vivid and complex, both have their hidden desires and frailties. They are very real and their tale is delicately woven. I found it difficult to choose which one I was drawn towards most and wanted them both to be able to find happiness in themselves and with each other.<br /><br />Unlike other books with this degree of explicitness there is a great plot here which is embedded in a world of fantasy and mythology with different characters having strange yet recognisable features. The story is well-written and the characters are brought to life vividly, drawing on the reader's empathy and interest.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the first Fruit Drop and so glad that there is finally another. If you like match 3 games, then for sure you will enjoy these.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|A great story about turning around a tragedy and learning to trust again, lots of good twists along the way that you don 't see coming.
B004WMKXWM|5.0|Great movie that I would definitely recommend any Harry Potter needs to watch!!!  It's the best of the Harry Potter movies by far!!!
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|I was so waiting for this, and I'm pleased to say I am not at all disappointed!!!  This is easily Paul's best effort since Flaming Pie.  I'm so glad to hear that Paul basically threw away his acoustic stuff and really rocks here.  Best song?  Hard to choose here.  I love I Can Bet, and the title track, New, and the opening track, Save Us.  Paul even tried to do a rap-style song with Appreciate.  Didn't work too well, but hey, he gave it a shot.  Paul is never afraid to try new things.  But it was Paul's return to basics that really work out well here.  Love the ballad Early Days too, a look back to his pre-fame early days with his Liverpool buds.  There are a couple of duds here, Hosanna just didn't cut it for me, but what the heck???  Every album has a couple of throw-away tracks....even Sgt Pepper did.<br /><br />One sidenote: A few tracks were written by Paul Epworth, including Save Us.  Love the last song, Get Me Out Of Here and one line in particular...&#34;I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!!!&#34;  Bottom line:  This is not Paul's greatest album.  Band On The Run will undoubtedly always hold that distinction, but pretty darn good.  I think you'll like it.  It is refreshing and &#34;new&#34; :)
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My 7 yr old horse obsessed daughter really likes it. However she wants to buy new horses and is having trouble collecting enough gems to do so. You can of course purchase them for a large fee.
0765357151|3.0|well...the answer is...if you have nothing else to read...sure. kinda like the movie only based in a older period in time. but if you have something you'd rather read...read that first. this is a...well, ive got nothing better to read...why not.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I love Zombies.  Nothing better than the Walking Dead right now.<br />I was so excited to see this movie.<br />First i bought the book and that was a huge disappointment.  Movie and Book are really different.  I should have known that when I hated the book the movie was going to be bad too.  And it was.<br />Watching the movie and not reading the book you had little idea of what Brad's character in the movie did, they really didn't go into his background. The Zombies were sort of cool but they moved so fast in the movie you really didn't get to enjoy them as in The walking dead.<br /><br />I felt this was a waste of time and I would not recommend to zombie lovers.
1573220167|3.0|quick yet good read...even a good movie...im sure if you've lived a little you'll enjoy it. its mainly a book for young male adult, but im sure the ladies can get a good insight to the male state of mind.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The grandchildren and I love this game!  The only thing that bothers me is worrying whether I may have accidentally purchased one of the 99 cent extras.  I realize this is my ignorance not the game.<br /><br />.
0393039765|4.0|i read it years ago...and its still a good read. if you've seen the movie...its almost exactly like it. a short book though...overall it wont disappoint you...depending on how expensive it was.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really cool and not that hard either! It's also alot of fun and keeps you busy for awhile.
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|It was along the lines of the other three. I really think the ending went south on this. I could see it coming.
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|I started this game excited about the cute innovative art and style.  really enjoyed it till the fourth level and ran right into a huge roadblock.  having each level locked until its completed is a huge no win.  after the 12th fail in a row I realized that the experience wasn't fun anymore.  I would have dearly loved to continue and enjoy different levels at my own leisure but I couldn't.  game was over before I began.  my only choice was to repeat over and over a level till I lucked out and beat it to open the next one.  not fun.  at all.  let people play what lvls they like and leave locked lvls for bonuses.  deleted in frustration.  due to it being unplayable for me I gave it two stars. 5 if they adopt my suggestion.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great app for carrying the word of god where ever you go.<br />But Its not logging me in to my twitter to share the verse of the day.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|Download time was too long.  Typical for hi speed connection. Nice for a free pre view of movie being shipped
B001XULSG6|4.0|Great movie about the Borg. Really enjoyed the story and how it brought the story of the Borg together. Thumbs up.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is back!!!!! I've been anticipating reading this even pre-ordered& I loved every minute of it! Great story and character development..it sucks you right in!
B006903GX8|5.0|The characters and lot are complex and ever-evolving.  My husband and I love being able to watch the DVDs at our own convenience since we missed the first years of the series on TV.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Sometimes it crawled along.  Easy for me to love her as the young King did!  In those days women were serviced to have babies and she did it well.  She was intelligent an wise in so many ways.
B00E66C6L0|5.0|This is the real deal!  Nothing compares to this soundtrack recording of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I bought it for my husband for his birthday.  He will love it as much as he loves the show!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|My wife enjoyed the history of the orphans' journey.  I may read it because of her enthusiasm.  I usually embrace the book as a result.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|buffer. buffer. hesitate skip buffer<br /><br />watch it on netflix, at least that will work<br /><br />all day amazon prime has been sucking, all other internet sites work fine
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a fairly good read.  At times it seemed to be a long time to learn the secret.  I think readers will read it as quickly as I did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyable puzzle.  Just when you are about to give up, you will have another avenue of thought and it gets you to the next step!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am really enjoying this ap.  It's not too hard to figure out but is a little challenging. The only problem I have had is getting some parts to work properly with tapping.  I don't know if it's the ap or my kindle fire hd.
1476734941|5.0|This is one of several books I bought to deal with health issues.  It was a great help to my personal needs.  I would recommend it for anyone with a health problem that hasn't been resolved.  Also, much on weight loss too.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great story.  Now I know what happened to young Danny.  The pupil became the teacher, what a great way to pay back that which how owed.  Stephen King has done it again, I hated each time I had to put this book down.  The characters are very well developed.  I could see each one and when not reading the book found myself wondering what was going to happen next.  Loved loved loved this book.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Similar to magic but we'll developed and doesn't feel like an imitation. I have played hours and its quite addictive. Only complaint is it could use a undo button as sometimes a card will get played inadvertently.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Great movie... I wish we knew what was next for the series.  It is one that has a lot of excitement.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This game is georgeous, fun and can be challenging while not being too hard. Its great when you have some time to spare.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent follow up to &#34;The Shining.&#34;<br /><br />Great read! As a huge Stephen King fan I was very happy with the book.  Now I want to re-read &#34;The Shining&#34; and &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; back to back!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and it's so colorful! I can't stop playing it! It's also a great game for my kids even my three year old loves playing it.
B001BANK32|5.0|Very enticing horror novel, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. I loved how real the characters were made to seem and how attached you were able to become to them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's about time that I can play it on my kindle but only one problem I can receive most of my gifts only lives
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Loved it! The filming locations are breath taking. The HD is clear and colors are so vivid! Can't wait for the new season in May 2014.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone always sent me invites and I never played but after downloading I'm addicted. Definitely worth downloading, you'll end up paying till you run out of lives.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Season 8 started slowly for this show and the boys seemed tired and dispassionate, but I found myself enjoying the story without feeling quite as frenetic as earlier seasons and realized that the new pace and calmer (deeper) emotions were part of the storytelling. Dean and Sam's relationship has matured. Dean has grown into greater acceptance, patience, and compassion. Sam has found hope for a different future without demon blood or madness. Castiel is back, as cute a player as ever; the King of Hell explores new dimensions to his personality; and one of our favorite minor characters played by one of our favorite actresses, Felicia Day, is back for two shows! All in all a highly satisfying season!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good puzzles. Love the fact that I don't have to spend extra money to advance in this game. The game is on the perfect challenge level as well. Not so easy a monkey could do it, but not impossible to solve either. Will definitely recommend to my friends.
0440237688|1.0|Not sure how this won a Newbery.  It is incredibly well written but woefully incomplete.<br /><br />Lowry did a masterful job setting up a story, revealing the depth of shock the main character feels as a veil is removed from in front of his eyes.  It helps when he is forced to try to see the world through the eyes of those he loves before making a difficult decision.<br /><br />But then it seems the Lowry was bored or had a looming publish date.  The Giver hatches a hasty plot (a quick shock is exposed about the Giver's past that you want to know more about), and it seems like the book is over 10 pages later.<br /><br />For all of the fanfare, I was hoping for an Ender's Game or Hunger Games or Dune.  What I received was a book that was over when it was just beginning.<br /><br />What happened to the main charcter?  What happened to the town?  What happened to the friends Jonas cared about?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|they finally have the real candy crush on the kindle fire hd<br />and on Amazon and it's a very addictive app
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think this game  is awesome it's the best! Thank you Disney for making the game! I love you nemo!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for so long I was looking for it since I got it it's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I've always loved his books and this one was no different.  He has a way of making you feel like you're just having a conversation with him....like he's talking only to you.  So sad to lose such a great mind.
B009NT0I06|5.0|I bought this largely because my kids are in to Taylor Swift. We saw the Red tour this fall and it was a great show...probably the best overall production of perhaps 200 shows I've seen since the early 1980s. Her songwriting is solid and the production on her CDs is not bad. I ordered RED on vinyl because I wanted the kids to use one of our many turntables (we have three currently active in the house, with some in reserve) because I have a large LP collection and would like them to use it more often.<br /><br />RED did not disappoint. This is the first \\"new\\" LP I've purchased in many years (I either buy used or have been buying reissues on high-grade vinyl). It was pressed on heavy vinyl (180gr?), and happily is a double LP so includes all the tracks from the CD. Lyrics are printed inside the gatefold jacket.  Sound is excellent...the kids said it was better than the CD, but that may be novelty talking for them. I haven't compared on headphones yet but it sounds *good* even on my office setup with bookshelf speakers.<br /><br />Highly recommended for TS fans or those looking for new music on vinyl.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love it and love to read the truth about God If you get a chance to read it will be very helpful in life
B000S5360S|5.0|A nice tongue in cheek approach to rock music. Great, simple drum beats, awesome sounding lead guitar, and fun filled charisma laden lead vocals, this is a pleasure to listen to.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Can't go wrong with Downey and Cheadle! War Machine Rox. I hope there is more Ironman in the future for us all.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I admit that I have the three movies in the series. I became a Matt Damon fan watching these movies and this one did not disappoint me at all. It actually is better each time I see it. While the books and the movies don't quite resemble one another the Bourne series of movies stands alone as a great story and wonderful tale of my favorite kind of &#34;hero-anti-hero.&#34;
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Beetlejuice is one of those movies you must come back and watch every year or so.  It is just so good and funny.  Unlike all the sexual content loaded &#34;comedy&#34; movies of today, this one you can sit and enjoy with the whole family.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This was a free app.  I'd be mighty unhappy if I'd paid for it.  There are 35 levels, pretty much standard match-3 games, and it's over.  Any game enhancements, including more levels, additional moves, \\"lives\\" and boosters must be purchased or cadged from Facebook friends.  As a freebie, it will amuse you for a while if your demands aren't too high.<br /><br />Additional info a week later:  It is possible to achieve more levels without paying for them.  BUT after a few levels, you have to play 3 \\"quests\\" each 24 hours apart in order to move on.  A full 24 hours! And as many lives as it takes.  What lamebrain decided to delay game play for 24 hours after what is, after all, only a single round????
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally I kept looking in Kindle store to see if you finally had the actual game.  It took you guys long enough to get this game, it is addictive!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Fun! Interactive! Unpredictable,.<br /><br />We have been playing for months and we havent gotten bored yet. We love it!<br /><br />Its not as serious or strategic as other games like Puerto Rico (which I love too).
B007EC27QM|5.0|Single best ap I own. You can't buy a calculator of this caliber for less than $100.00, but this ap is far above the crowd. Plus you can print the entries on a wireless printer while you're on the phone or listening to Sat radio.Awesome.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed the book from start to finish. I think I will explore his other works. The ending was unexpected and quite sad.
B000I55YV2|4.0|Action packed, great special effects, riveting. Loved every minute of the movie Can't say enough about Amazom Prime cause free is the best.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is the most addicting game ever. I'm so happy it finally became available on Kindle. It's a lot more fun playing on a large screen than my phone screen. Thank you for making this game available. Now I can sync/play desktop,phone, and tablet
B002COTI64|5.0|My favorite CD by Spektor; so many great songs on this CD and none that I skip over. &#34;Eet,&#34; &#34;Dance Anthem of the 80s,&#34; and &#34;Folding Chair&#34; are some of my favorites. I've been listening to it on Spotify forever, finally got it for myself. Great purchase.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I enjoyed this well written book about native Americans. Having ancestors who were Native Americans many generations back, I learned a lot about my heritage and the Indian culture by reading this interesting book. I especially enjoyed the parts that explained the powers a young person receives at the age of eighteen. Initially, Oria was not thrilled about being a duck, but she soon discovered she had many other powers, too. Oria fell in love with Grey Wolf and she had to fight for his affection with her rival, Yori. As a grandparent, the most heartwarming part of the story in my opinion was the very close relationship Oria had with her grandparents. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading about Native Americans with a touch of romance woven into the storyline.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just love the sophisticated choice of words of this author;<br />I hope many people will reflect her many hints in positive thinking
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|You don't realize at first how these people will end up in each other's lives, for the good and bad. I enjoyed this book so much and feel for each character. We never know how our lives will end up, have faith and hope for the best.
B00AW8UK0K|3.0|I read the article in the paper and saw some of the Horizon series.  I don't eat much so I figured that I would give the fasting a go.  It wasn't hard so I elected to give it a try but without the tests.  I have only tried it for 2 weeks so I have a long way to go.  I liked the book, it explained things well and for me isn't that hard to follow.  Hopefully the weight will some off.  I actually liked the feeling of being in control of my food instead of visa versa.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|This is a great product. I really enjoy listening to the cd. It came quickly in the mail. I have absolutely no complaints. I am very happy with my purchase.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King weaves several threads together as we meet up with Dan Torrance as a child, and then fast forward to him as a struggling adult. We also meet a group known as the \\"True Knot.\\" They travel as a group across America in RV's as they search of substance. We also dip into the life of Abra Stone, growing with her from an infant to snarky twelve year old. The True Knot feed on the \\"steam\\" of children or as Dick Halloran referred to it in The Shining the \\"shining.\\" The tale that unfolds was weaves these stories together keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />I have said this before, but it is worth mentioning again; King is the master of flawed, quirky characters that draw the reader in. Dan is all grown up, struggling and still struggling with the shine. I still see the little boy in this complicated man and loved watching him transform throughout the novel. My feelings for him were like those of a parent; sometimes I wanted to hug him and other times send him to his room. Abra Stone is a brave little warrior whom I adored her. For all of Dan's darkness, she is light. I loved watching them interact and felt their connection. Rose the leader of the True Knot was a perfect villain and King described her perfectly bringing her to life before my eyes. Even the secondary characters impressed me in this tale and added depth to the story.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep was brilliant, and I am so glad King chose to listen to that inner voice that kept asking \\"what if.\\" I am not going to share any details as I fear spoilers. The world was fleshed out, and my understanding of the \\"shine\\" clearer. All of the different POV's and their interaction to one another made this tale incredible and suspenseful. While I was not scared, after all I am no longer a twelve year old, reading this in bed with a flashlight, but I got the shivers once or twice. The tale unfolds at an incredible pace, with moments of tension, and then a slowing as we gained insight. All of the voices and threads came together to propel us towards the climatic ending. I loved King's descriptive voice as he brought both the characters and the world to life. The tale unfolding like a movie in my head and I achieved that book high I crave, losing myself within its pages.threads came together to propel us towards the climatic ending.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|What a joyride it's really fun I like it I'll download this over and over and over again if I can.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Most of this movie we could not see the picture.  I don't know if it was the CGI or the way it was filmed.  Only the close ups on the faces were clear.  THe story was ok.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy it's on Kindle Fire now! I have lots of fun playing it. .....I seem to be using my Kindle more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesomeness<br /><br />but if u dont &lt;3 them dont get this game .cool<br />I &lt;3 them. peace out
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is a Google's attempt to distribute their Chrome browser. If you have a Mac and happy with Safari then you will still need to replace Safari with Chrome to make this player work. This is why this player is so cheap. I see it as a dirty trick by Google. I am returning my Chromecast back to store.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very enjoyable game.  The story was interesting, the hidden object scenes were well done, and the mini games were challenging but not frustratingly so.  The graphics were excellent as well.
B0006B2A42|5.0|I first watched this film a very, very long time ago as a child and I still watch it from time to time. For me, it is still a great action thriller with a fantastic cast. All the actors do an excellent job with their characters. I haven't read the book, yet so I can't offer any comparison.<br />soviet and American forces rush to obtain the film from a satellite camera that rotated in space for a while taking photos of strategic American bases and such.<br />Overall, a great film for any War buff or espionage fan.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Great old movie.  Sometimes it is nice to watch a movie with a little romance, minor cussing if any, and minimal violence.  Plus it was fun seeing the movie that all those memorable quotes came from:  \\"Here's looking at you kid\\", \\"We'll always have Paris\\" and \\"This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\".
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a GREAT game for the whole family!  We all enjoy playing on our devices and seeing who can get the best score!<br /><br />Thank you Disney!  Keep New levels coming!
039916409X|5.0|Thank you Margaret for writing such a fabulous and tremendously helpful book.  I am familiar with Tapping and am a big fan of Gary Craig.  Although not an expert, I've been tapping for a couple of years now and it has really helped me.  Recently I started a new job, and the first three months were very challenging.  Every work day I tapped while on my lunch hour, and it really got me through those first three months.  In reading Margaret Lynch's new book Tapping into Wealth I am experiencing a whole new level of understanding about tapping and clearing out old emotional traumas that are preventing me from reaching my full potential, especially surrounding money.  I am personally going through a major life transition and already had an aha moment upon reading chapter 3!<br />Margaret I have listened to several of your video's and more recently your TIW webinar, and must say you have a very sincere, and kind way about you.  Thank You!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the way it is easy to do and understand what to do.  You can do this even if you are older and your not moving as fast as you did.  Good job game makers!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is omg.  I absolutely love this game. It took forever to get it on my kindle though. The download kept on failing. But finally it got on there.<br />This game is so much fun. I just got this game like two days ago and wow can u hunt a lot of things. Oh and did i mention that i love this game. Luv it!!!!!
0385738765|5.0|This book is an awesome sequel to The Maze Runner, and leaves you filled with suspense at every corner. Thomas must survive new enemies, various troubles, (and a few romance problems) in order to cross the desolate landscape of the Scorch (Why? Well, you just have to read and find out yourself!).<br /><br />  Thomas finds himself in awful situations and battles with Cranks and a few other unexpected enemies, and must rely on a few new techniques and old skills to survive the horrors surrounding him. The plot twists and turns, leaving the reader wanting more, and more importantly, craving answers to the questions at every chapter. Just like in The Maze Runner, Dashner leaves behind clues and hints that tug at your curiosity, and leave you wondering and always asking: \\"WHAT?!\\" or \\"Why????\\". Not only does Thomas have to deal with the real world with killer Cranks and fatal thunderstorms, but now he has to deal with a romance problem between a certain telepathic frenemy and an Almost-Gone Crank. Here's a crash-course waiting to happen.<br /><br />  This book is filled with parts when you want to throw it on the ground in a fury and yell at Thomas, and there's parts where you want to kill a few of the characters for being traitors or being just plain stupid, and of course, there's parts where you want to cry. The vivid language, and intense action, and strong emotions from all the Gladers mix together to make the characters seem and feel alive and human, and you feel as if you're experiencing the event with them.<br /><br />  This dystopian thriller is beyond amazing- READ IT! Dashner has created an awesome adventure, full of mystery, suspense, and excitement, and it always keeps you on high alert as new Variables (hint hint) are added... intentionally and unintentionally.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|really like this movie, great for cold winter day curled up by the fire.  great cast just a good story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i think the game is amazing and fun in mederation but if you play to much it gets to be a little much . other then that its a great game I recommend...
B008MM9630|3.0|The connection and secret box issues are frustrating. Fun game otherwise. Just can't complete some quests without the connection issues being resolved.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited so long for it to come to the Kindle. I played it online for awhile. This game is so fun. I used to play Bejeweled a lot and now this game took over totally!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|When reading the book Paper Towns by John Green you feel a real connection to the characters. The story is set in modern day Florida, where you will find Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman. Both seniors in high school they seem to be living the \\"typical teenage life\\". Margo is the popular one who has everything a girl her age could want. While Quentin is the guy who hangs out with the band geeks before school. Quentin and Margo don't really have ANY type of relationship at school but they are next door neighbors outside of school. They have been friends since they were little, and seen more stuff than someone who has already lived a full life. It still comes as a surprise to Q when Margo shows up wearing all black just outside his window. He is forced to reconsider who Margo Roth Spiegelman really is. Was he in love with Margo or just the idea of her?<br /><br />  As you journey through this adventure with Quentin you won't be able to keep yourself from laughing at the witty language used to express his inner self. John Green does an exquisite job capturing the humor of a teenager. Don't be mislead into thinking that this is a cliché story that's just for kicks. No... this is so much more. You will be forced to see life through new eyes and you will find yourself. Different chapters throughout this book do different things to your emotions. Sometimes you will just want to cry, others you will be laughing out loud so hard, and sometimes you will just feel so hopeful that you will have the biggest smile on your face. If I were to classify this book I would put it under realistic fiction/ mystery. It all seems so real that you can't help but wonder if it is a true story. At the same time you want to figure out the mystery that is Margo Roth Spiegelman.<br />  All in all this is definitely in my top 3 books I have read. It's very intriguing and keeps you interested the whole way through. It is very relatable and you will never grow bored.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|was waiting patiently for it. glad it finally arrived.<br />aggravating at times but as we all know, very addicting.  now I can enjoy my game on a bigger screen instead of my iphone.
B005MLOKXA|3.0|Don't think I will watch season 3. Don't like the direction show is going. Also don't like your &#34;words required&#34;.
B008YJFDQK|5.0|I just love this man. He is so talented. This album takes most of his BEST love songs and puts them on 1 disc. I have loved every single song on this album in the past and loved them all over again on this new album. This is a must purchase for ALL BH fans old and new. The fans who have been there from the beginning d will appreciate an album and remember why they fell in love with HB and continue to support him....even if his newer music has changed throughout the years. And the newer fans will have the chance to see a different, even more talented side of BH. This album will make you want to check out his old stuff and just get lost in his lyrics.
1577314808|5.0|This is a must read!  These last couples of days have been free of negativity in my mind.  I am more connected.  What is in this book is a not a secret, it's just that connectedness has been forgotten.  I urge anyone reading this to get the book and read it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The perfect alarm clock app, it even allows you to play your own music to wake you up! It is incredibly customizable and has a very smooth look to it.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|super super and super is like the five books more cools tahat i read so read it and luke is the only person that you may hate
B005HJWWW8|2.0|It ruins crisp HF5 sound. Otherwise it's a nice piece of hardware, works nicely. Maybe it works better with some other headphones/earphones.
0525953728|5.0|It isn't often that you get to see behind the curtain.  These brave warrior's who do battle in our name and protect us deserve the credit and the accolades, that they typically don't seek.  Of course, one would think that the &#34;hero&#34; in the W.H. was on the lead chopper, as he wore himself out taking the victory laps, but we know the truth.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Arguably the best season so far, this is more of the same. Greatness! 3 disks (Season 2 has 4) with wonderful Special Features, you have to add this to your collection!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great album.  There are some very uplifting dance beats along with some wonderful ballads.  My Mom, kids and I all enjoy listening to Bruno Mars.
B008EL25LE|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It gets harder as it goes and that makes it interesting. Great time killer. It can be addicting and is hard to put down once you start playing it.
039916409X|5.0|I love the way this book is written. It´s so easy to read and digest. I do love Margaret´s style, cause always has fresh and new ways to teach us, seems so simple to change the old programming, love it,love it!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I loved it as much as my kids. They talked about it for many days after watching. Great &#34;moral&#34; to the story.
B00000JRTX|5.0|This is just one of those perfect movies you revisit again and again.  One never grows tired of it. Five more words required.  I can't think of anything else that hasn't been said about it.  Good flick.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very thankful that I don't have to wait for it!  The benefit of being one of the last people in the world to read a book.
B009OCR1X4|3.0|A strange movie, too long,  perhaps too convoluted, but really  a splendid piece of imaginative fiction that requires a bit of mental leaps here and there.  Clunky in parts,  there is some absolutely brilliant acting,  good lines and it is based on a challenging but very brilliantly written novel.  Not a bad movie, not a great move, but a good movie that goes on too long.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I ike how it protects the phone from sratches and cracks however the case is not water proof like it claims.
0312360266|2.0|I'm so torn on this series. On one hand, I think the actual storyline - the mythology of the story - is really good. I think it's a pretty original idea, and it intrigued me.<br />Unfortunately the writing was SO BAD that it was hard to finish the book. If I took a shot every time Zoey said \\"brown pop\\" I'd have died from alcohol poisoning. The constant barage of \\"teen talk\\" that sounded NOTHING like a real teen, was really obvious, and super distracting. The \\"twins\\" were ridiculous - the writing for those characters was some of the most childish writing I've ever seen in a published book. NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. None of the characters felt real, they all felt like caricatures. It felt like a spoof on a real book.<br /><br />I will give the author credit though, because I see a big improvement in the writing, comparing the more recent releases and the first 7 or 8 books. I think the author took the criticism to heart, and stopped with the \\"brown pop\\" and \\"poopie\\" and twin this/twin that stuff, and made it about the story, not about pop culture.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great game if you enjoy hidden object games. It is endless. You dont have to purchase anything as long as you have a little patience.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|as a true &#34;hip hop&#34; fan relieved to hear his progression in storyteling and syncopation of lyrical prose. He's been studying... I have too many favorites on this one and actually listen to this album start to finish with no need to skip. That says A LOT!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and have been waiting to have it on my kindle  since the computer game first began.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to become available on Amazon for forever, glad it's finally here, I can now further my addiction.  And the graphics look great on my Kindle!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|The movie over exceeded my expectations, I thought it was another simple ufc video which i also like but when I saw related real life drama and suspense the intensity between father and son brother vs brother i was moved I recommend, no I require anyone who sees this comment to check out this movie!!!!!! asap!!!
B008JFUNYG|3.0|This movie didn't surprise me at all. It cant compare to the original, but then what remake does now days?  It has a few good bloody scenes and a couple scenes that were taken from the original. Acting is sub-par in my opinion and the druggie chick is something else. If I saw the movie first, I probably wouldn't have purchased it.
B009ME47H2|4.0|IT SHOULD HAVE A NUMBER THAT SHOWS UP ON THE MICROPHONE SHOWING YOU HOW MANY NOTES YOU RECORDED. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A GREAT APP. VERY HAPPY I GOT IT.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This is the best of the Evil Dead movies. Bruce Campbell is crazy in this film and does a great job. The movie has plenty of gore and blood mixed with humor which is kind of demented. I love this movie. Beware the fruit cellar!!
0062218867|5.0|I like almost everything he's written about the Discworld and will be buying more to complete my collection. His sense of humor is hard to explain to someone who's never heard of him, but it's all good :)
B005HSL626|5.0|a little stressed out. I use this thing to stress myself, and it works very well. It only takes about 3 to 5 minutes.
B000002MFE|5.0|This is a simple, no-frills, at-home live performance. It was great to become reacquainted after many years. I'm sure I will pull it out from time to time to enjoy again.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I really like this app. THere are highlight and underline features that make it easy to mark things. It is also very easy to navigate the document.
0451232577|2.0|I gave two stars only because I enjoyed the history. However, the book is filled with the author's left-wing, PC take on human relationships and world events. I'm sorry, but because of the length of the book (the volume of garbage), I couldn't make it to the end.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The app is just as good as the Ted website. It is easy to navigate and download a large array of videos; and fun to watch them on the Kindle.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|The best album by this inimitable band. Mark Knopfler's guitar cries, and the vocals are great. This album is a must have.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I am a fan of the Star Trek movies and not so much the original tv show I like Bly Ray combos that have DVD and digital copy included good deal for 20$
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The only way to own this trilogy.  Perfectly compact, includes all special features, and a cool hologram thing (probably the wrong word) on the cover.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app looks great and plays well on my Kindle Fire HD. Actually has allowed  me to use all lives sent to me rather than just 5 and that's all - which is an issue I have with FB.
B003IMER8S|5.0|Amazing shirt!  The size runs large, but I'd still be cautious when washing it.  The film print isn't the best but I bought this more for the shirt.  Get it before it sells out!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! My cousins and sisters are just addicted! And there already in level 50!!! Anyway this game is awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad that this is finally available on kindle fire!!! I'm already addicted and I like having the larger screen to play on. Next up pet rescue saga!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I'm becoming addicted to it more and more every time I play it! :D  It's awesome!
031606792X|5.0|I was a little behind everyone else reading this series. I'm glad I finally did. What a wonderful story! Even if it is vampires and werewolves!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for the app to be available for while. My friend on Facebook just passed me on the game. Then I tap on the picture, it took me to the Amazon Appstore. I realized its available. Finally! The app is here, now I can finally catch up with my friends and family, playing this game!
0345529057|5.0|Absolutely LOVE it!! This is my second time reading the series!! Can't wait for the 6th book to come out!! Hurry up George!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very addicting game the minions are so adorable you could play for hours. I give this game 5 stars.
B000VI12ZS|2.0|Seemed to have everything from every war movie, and more and more and more, but not put together quite right.
0802473156|5.0|A book for everyone, single or married, male or female, young & old. It will help you determine the love you give and the love you want to receive.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Fun to watch, bit it was an absolutely ridiculous story, stupid scenarios etc. Some of the best CGI ever made, the artwork blew my mind!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Ok I about flipped my crap on how many times people \\"die\\" and I love it. It is better than the first by far. And you will cry and laugh and flip your crap but......You will be satisfied. Nice book. Love it. Buy it.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Lots of 1 liners, plenty of silly cheeky comedy, kinda reminded me of an 80's Michael Keaton movie... Had fun watching it though, it was superior production.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is  good but it's slow to get going in the plot over all its a good game about pony's but I have to say the graphics are amazing
B00D2K40WY|3.0|this Game is ok but  it is kind of you know every  thing it is fun i like it love
B004EPYZPS|1.0|so my disc is scratched and doesn't play. I would love my money back but I'm having trouble figuring out how to go about that. Not a happy customer.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did and almost didn't even start reading it. I am so glad I did though. Very good with lots of twists and turns. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is the best TV series I have ever encountered. You will fall in love with all the characters all the scenes all the intrigue  and especially the acting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is now on 0.7.6 they have a new wool dark gray green wool it looks cool and they added minecraft comes alive and villagers and villages cool but in 1.6 they have a annoying sound like her her her and they added endermen and the nether and the end.
0385350864|2.0|I'm 60. My children are 40 and 41. I would like to find a book where a person my age or even a bit younger have older children. Like most other people I don't see why we must have a tragedy. Is this the only way authors think women can prove their strength?
B003F3NDWG|5.0|If you liked Nathan Fillian as Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Firefly) you should love him as the shallow, brilliant, smitten author who follows detective Kate Becket around.  The writing is fun, the plot twists are often unexpected and the interaction between Becket and Castle are classic and entertaining.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I've had the opportunity to get the Withings Pulse, after already having an UP band.<br />Both do the same thing but in different ways.<br />You can track your activity and your sleep.  However they have subtly different approaches  And the data I have gotten from each has been different as well.<br />Both can sync with WiThings app.<br /><br />OVERALL (short version):<br />Fussier to wear, need to clip on securely, velcroed night strap falls off easily.<br />Easy to hide on your clothing as it is small.<br />Output on unit itself is nice, can get data without sync<br />Good battery life despite wireless sync and data display<br />Data is not portable, limited to use in apps<br />Data on sleep, not sure how to use, no non-pay apps to use this with, except for basics.<br /><br />INITIAL USAGE:<br />This device is a little rectangular unit that either fits into a clip or a wrist band.  They recommend the wrist band for sleeping only (didn't know that right away. I must've missed that on the directions).<br />It charges by plugging into a computer's USB port with a special connector.  The UP (the Jawbone equivalent of this product) and the Pulse use slightly different connectors.<br />Starting this unit up was simple enough.  Charge and press the little button to display data.<br />However my experiences with the SW on the phone (downloaded)  to set-up everything was a bit frustrating.<br />Having started up the app. I kept putting my info in and telling it to save and it kept telling me that it could not locate the Pulse.  I had already verified that the phone had found the Pulse (Setting up the bluetooth itself was easy), so I was mystified why the SW could not.  After enough tries I wondered if it didn't like my sign in data.  I tend only to use my initials for first and last name and some apps don't like that.  Well that's all it took to fix this.  Some better messaging would have been helpful..  I was ready to return the item as faulty, as the message that I keep getting made it look like the bluetooth was not working between the two units, instead that it did not like my sign in data..<br /><br />WEARING THIS ITEM:<br />Since the wristband is only recommended for sleeping it should not impact your day to day wearing of the item much.  However you have to remember to clip it to you.  I found a wristband was easier to remember.<br />The wristband at night since it is attached by velcro and is cloth, can be pulled off.  I have had this happen on many occasions.  Even before where I was wearing it and not sleeping, it came off. This was as changing clothes, putting on jackets etc.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Similar to the Jawbone Up, this device gives you data on your activity both duration and intensity as well as your sleep.  The sleep it defines into awake, sleeping light, sleeping deep.  Assume it does that based on movement.  However you have to tell it when you are going asleep or waking up.  Forgetting this, the sleep data does not get captured.  I used this band with a Jawbone UP at the same time and the data was different.  Not sure why.  So I don't know how valuable this information is.  There is a Sleepio App you can port this to (and costs for membership to do so after the initial period), but I saw no other way for you to look at the data except for the UP app itself.  I never joined Sleepio.<br /><br />For awake you get the frequency and intensity of your workouts.  So if you jogged or walked a mile, it will be well noted. Do Pilates or Yoga and it will be more impressed by your walk to these activities, so obviously intensity is not by heart rate, but by movement of the device.  There is a means of getting your heart rate with this device. However this with holding your finger to the device so it can detect your pulse.<br /><br />I will continue to see if this information can be pushed to a computer, as I would like a chance to push this into an excel spreadsheet and look at trends.  Without that this band becomes less and less useful for me.<br /><br />SOFTWARE ON PHONE:<br />This is very simple and very graphical.  Easy to visualize what it is telling you.<br />For example, if you want to walk 10,000 steps a day, you will get told if you met that goal or not right on the front screen. You can get the exact data within.  Similarly if you get less than 8 hours of sleep, you know that on the top screen (only on weekends for me).  If you think you were up from 3:23AM to 4AM, you can see that too.  I did note, however that there are times I thought I was awake and the band recorded this as light sleep. Not 100% sure if it was right or I was.<br /><br />What I found hard to do, was compare trends in data.  For instance, is my deep sleep increasing from day to day or not.  What are the trends?<br /><br />I don't know how much longer I will wear the Pulse.  I'm not sure what to do with the data.  I had gotten it primarily to examine my sleeping and to see if I was getting the 10,000 steps a day I should (no I only get 6000 regularly and 12000 to 15000 on more active days). I might continue to wear it, to see if I can get regularly up to the 10000 steps.  But as far as sleep data, I don't know whether the ratio of deep to light sleep is good, or since the UP and Pulse got different data, if it is remotely accurate.  I think it was similar, but only 70% so.<br /><br />COMPARING TO THE JAWBONE UP<br />At first I preferred the Withings pulse when I got it since it shows data right on it.  I liked also the fact you could see the time. It also does heart rate on request.  However I found since it was not on my wrist like the JAWBONE Up band (though the Withings Pulse has a wrist strap, that is recommended only for night-time wear), I tended to wear it less and less. The data also that I got for the Withings Pulse seemed less accurate. If you hang it on a belt loop (probably user error in doing this) the floppiness of the belt loop can make 100 steps look like 15.  The velcroed band was bigger and fell off at night a lot.<br />I don't care that the data is sent via bluetooth (on the Withings Pulse) that is actually a bit fussier than just plugging the Jawbone UP in.  The data for all purposes is the same.  Both can go to WiThings, but both are trapped in these apps.s and less useful for me.<br /><br />SOFTWARE ON PHONE:<br />This is very simple and very graphical.

B000002U6E|5.0|This is an excellent Enigma CD. They have the futuristic sound and the voices. The interesting music and the interesting lyrics and sounds. I highly recommend this CD for old and new Enigma fans alike!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best book ever and I think I've just about read it like five times and I'm going to read it five more times
B00000J7RZ|5.0|This was Jennifer Lopez' first CD. It is an excellent one with a mixture of ballads and dance music. Some nice beats and melodies. I highly recommend if for old and new fans alike!
B00D3ZJB1S|2.0|Currently $18.99 (with the bonus tracks) for the CD at BestBuy... not that I buy any of my tunes there.<br /><br />Looks like the higher price point here may be confused with an offer that includes a Sabbath 13 T-Shirt. Look like there's no T- Shirt with this offer.<br /><br />Save a few bucks and look around or wait out a better deal.<br /><br />Awesome Sabbath though!!!! Their best album since the early 80's!
B000001EXB|4.0|Some nice ballads, songs, and melodies. Not as good as some of his other albums, but still good Elton John/Bernie Taupin music. I recommend this CD for old and new fans!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! Great app! So many creative ideas for anyone looking for something new. Recipes, gardening, activities for kids, fashion, holiday ideas and more.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is an excellent CD by Mariah Carey. She shows off her vocal talent. Some ballads, some dance, some faster pace. Great melodies and nice lyrics, very heartfelt. Mariah at her best. I highly recommend it for old and new fans!

B009F7OQ5Y|3.0|Cons: Nice and high quality dress. Overall good and nice looking doll<br />Prons: no joints in elbows so arms aren't flexible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so fun it keeps me entertaind for hours time goes by but so tricky I was on one for a hour but it is great

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great from start to finish! Amazing action scenes with compelling mystery to complete the scenario. A must see movie for all.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|I love Sandra Bullock. she is great. I like a lot of her movies. She is very versitile in her roles
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The ending was sad.  Jobs should have had another 20 years to change the world further.  Isaacson was given a tough job and did it remarkably well.  He managed to capture both the spirit and facts of the man accurately.  It is clear that he also admired the man and struggled to portray both the dark and genius sides.  I did not think that the book would be this good.  After all, Jobs has already been the subject of innumerable articles and commentaries.  What could Isaacson have said that would have been different, innovative, or contributory?  But Isaacson was able to portray the creative process by which Jobs lived and died.  At every step he defied conventional wisdom, even at the end.  At the end, you have to love Jobs.  Every time you use one of his devices, you can feel him.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Not at all like the book, they left out key players and changed the ending and almost everything inbetween.  Hated it.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Author Brad Stone has written a fascinating account of the company - Amazon - and the icon - Jeff Bezos,<br />who have changed the way of life for millions in the last two decades. An amazing story that how can one individual;<br />all with his roaring laughter and volcanic temper; achieve so much for humanity, his company and himself.<br />And if his life so far is any benchmark, there is much more to Jeff Bezos in the years ahead, including his forays into space.<br /><br />Jeff Bezos is not someone you love after reading this but now you know why you love<br />Amazon as a customer- obsessed company.  You take a thrilling ride on the Roller Coaster of Amazon's stock price.<br />Get a bird's eye view on  Amazon Prime, 1Click buying and recently, the Kindle series and many other ideas that failed.<br />While reading it cover to cover (on my Kindle), I was often reminded of the other Icon and a similar biography<br />that came out just a year back.<br /><br />\\"To me, A is a story of a brilliant founder who personally drove the vision. ..J is a classic technical founder of a business,<br />  who understands every detail and cares about it more than anyone. ...J has proved quite indifferent to the opinion of others. ....<br />He is a micromanager with limitless spring of new ideas, and he reacts harshly to efforts that don't meet his rigorous standards. .<br />A's corporate mission is to raise the bar across industries , and around the world, for what it means to be customer focused,<br />but they can be ruthlessly competitive with partners and even partners. \\"<br /><br />The A and J here is obviously Amazon and Jeff (Bezos) but could be easily replaced with Apple and Jobs (Steve) ,<br />Two men with rocky childhoods yet rising up to being Time \\"Person of the Year\\" and impacting the whole of<br />humanity in their own unique ways.<br /><br />These are some nuggets of wisdom from Bezos (\\"Jeffism\\", as sprinkled in the book)<br />which I am tempted to share, raising the bar of respect a notch higher for Jeff Bezos and Amazon.<br /><br />1. We are genuinely customer - centric, we are genuinely long term oriented and we genuinely like to invent.<br />  Most companies are not those things<br /><br />2. When a company comes up with an idea, it's a messy process. There's no aha moment.<br /><br />3. Every time we hire someone, he or she should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent<br />  pool is always improving.  All new hires have to directly improve the outcome of the company.<br /><br />4. You can work long, you can work hard, you can work smart but at Amazon, you can't choose two out of three.<br /><br />5. Look, you should wake up worried, terrified every morning. But don't be worried about competitors<br />  because they are never going to send us money anyway. Let's be worried about our customers and<br />  stay heads-down-focused. We pay attention to our competitors but that's not where we put our energy.<br /><br />6. Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for headcount,<br />  budget size or fixed expense.<br /><br />7. It is far better to cannibalize yourself than have someone else do it.<br /><br />8. These are our Six core values: Customer obsession, frugality, bias for action, ownership,<br />  high bar for talent and innovation.<br /><br />9. Inventing is cool. Explorers are cool. Conquerors are not cool. Thinking big is cool. The unexpected is cool.<br />  Missionaries are cool. Mercenaries are not cool.<br /><br />10. When you are Eighty years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection only for yourself,<br />  the telling that will be be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made.<br />  In the end, we are our choices.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a great charger.  It charges approximately 1% per minute on my iPhone 5.  I am very happy with it, just make sure you use an OEM cable.  I tried an aftermarket cable and it was charging at the same speed as a regular car charger.  I can fully charge my phone on my drive home from work which is great.  A+ product and their customer service is excellent.  They reached out to me via email to make sure everything was good with the product.  They also have an 18 month warranty which I hope I won't need but it's good to know that it is there.<br /><br />A steal at $7.99!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|This movie started a franchise that is still popular to this day.  From serious to campy, the Godzilla franchise has never ceased to entertain.
B00AEFXZ1C|5.0|Flashdance was a leader in the dance/romance movie of it's time.  The characters were just quirky enough to keep them interesting without being schmucks.  Every girl would love to be able to dance like that....and every boy would love to have a girl who could dance like that.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This is a great CD from John Mayer.  If you liked his last CD this is in the same vane.  Not exactly his first CD but still great to listen to.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|Whoopi Goldberg gave one of her best performances as the psychic who wasn't really a psychic until the &#34;ghost&#34; came into her life.....her facial expressions alone can make me laugh.  Great movie and I can let the grandchildren over ten watch it.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This app got a lot of great reviews so I got it.  I'm not sure what the big deal is.  It crashed on me when I tried to navigate the function too quickly.  It has a nice retro look to it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really enjoyable read. Nice to revisit old friends. King never ceases to entertain me as a reader. I hope you enjoy as well.
B00AYB1KHW|1.0|I lost interest after about 10 minutes.  If you want to see a bad horror flick choose don't pick one that pretends to be good.  This was a waste of time.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The mobile version is muchbetter than the app.  It is more responsive, and it is not constantly running in the background eating up memory and battery life.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I use this app on my 7&#34; HD Kindle.  It works most of the time but will suddenly shutdown and it's a little slow.  I prefer Accuweather but I'm not sure if it is available on the Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Lots of people say this game is amazing some say it's bad but it's neither I'm giving it a 3 star review because it's amazing but after awhile the fun fades
B000ID1J5E|5.0|I saw this when it first came out many years ago.  Watched again on an long flight.  Streep and Bacon we excellent in their roles.  Not a lot of plot twists and a fairly predictable outcome but it was still very entertaining.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Very much enjoyed this version of it. I was scared that the modernization of the story wouldn't work, but it was great!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Everyone should have dictionary apps on their phones!  This one is great. Has most words I need.  It's also easy to use.
0316228583|4.0|I loved her other books but this book is not as interesting. Hard to follow and not easy reading. Little disappointed.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is not as good as DragonStory.Mabey you should add some more elements or something like that. so all I'm saying is make it more dragony ok that's all I'm saying other than it's AWESOME!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I enjoy this, makes me think. My six year old likes it too. Cute graphics keeps her attention and interesting puzzles have kept me playing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game, not to hard, not super easy. Can't wait for more levels, good graphics, and have not had any glitches
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|This is an excellent album and, although just as powerful it is still very different from its predecessors. It seems like a vast amount of time and work were invested into this project and it shows with every minute of the composition.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Beach book type reading.  Not a literary  master piece but a good mystery which holds your attention and would recommend this only to a woman who reads very easily understood language.
014241493X|5.0|Although Paper Towns is a fictional book, it's an incredible story of friendship, mystery, self discovery, and love. John Green does an excellent job keeping the reader interested, and personally, I found it difficult to put the book down! The feminine protagonist, Margo Roth Spiegelman, is a very complex character, and you really have to read closely to understand who she is. The other main character Quentin, is just your average high school senior...or so everyone thought. Quentin or Q, has had a crush on Margo ever since they were small children. Unfortunately for him, she was always popular in school, while he \\"rolled with a different crowd\\". The adventure begins when Margo and Quentin sneak out in the middle of the night on one of Margo's famous adventures, to \\"bring justice\\" to Margo's cheating boyfriend, and other people involved. The night ends with Quentin falling even more in love with Margo...or who he thought she was. He finally has some hope that things might be different between them...however when Margo disappears without warning only weeks before graduation, the plans change yet again. One of the things I loved most about this book, is that John's witty remarks and youthful sense of humor actually made me laugh out loud. I also loved that the story was believable, everyone didn't always get what they wanted, just like in real life. The last great thing about this book, is that it shows that there is so much more to a person than what you can see on the surface. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzling mystery and lively adventure. I am more than satisfied with Paper Towns, and I will be looking into and enjoying more books by John Green very soon!<br /><br />THANK YOU John Green for being such a great writer especially for the teenage audience, I thoroughly enjoyed Paper Towns and can't wait to read more of your writing!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The current list of apps are really limited. and there are so many constraints on usage,<br /><br />Hopefully Google will have support more Apps in the future.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|This is a Good movie and it's worth the money.  The movie also has an original story that's a nice change of pace.  Rent the movie if you like these kind if movies.
B001AKTZOQ|3.0|its o.k,a more modern cd with the same song list might sound clearer,early stage ccr is a little ruff around the edges
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Glad I had a Kindle.  Wouldn't want to be seen with this book in an airport or doctor's waiting room.  I paced through it and thought it was trash.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I absolutely love this cd! It's very different from anything I've heard before. I  bought it for one song I'd heard on the radio, but immediately liked the rest of it. Beautiful lyrics and great musicality.
B00821PGUS|5.0|The story line to this show is creepy yet suspenseful and it keeps me watching.  I was mad at some of the civilian's actions though.  The fact that some of them actually think that they could reason with the &#34;skitters&#34; is way too democratic.  If someone kills my whole family and then captures my children, then I want to only learn one thing about the aliens; What color is their blood?
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Meh. LOVE the premise.... liked the book. Despite the critical comparisons, it does not (in my mind) reach the heights of 1984 (Orwell). It's a utopian/dystopia cautionary tale, so I expected a \\"bad ending\\"; but too many avenues are unexplored. Mae's sexual encounters with Francis were certainly being recorded... why did that plot line disappear? Kalden had more tools than Mae to try to communicate a message of individual rights, his defeat was too easily won; Annie's collapse makes no physiological sense and works only to serve up the last paragraph (which is great, btw.).<br /><br />I don't like long books for the sake of being long... but this book could easily have 200 additional pages. I closed 1984 with the sense of \\"I must read this book again\\" and I did - twice. I closed The Circle with the sense of \\" Meh. I wish George Orwell had written this.\\"
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Not much more can be said other than the show as a whole gets 5 stars! Great cast- great season. Good extras and special features
B00F91G5BS|3.0|I loved this book. When I heard it was going to be a movie I was excited. Not so much when I heard Brad had the lead role. Surprise, surprise he didn't ruin the movie. Movie is nothing like the book and the 50mph zombies was ridic. Overall it was entertaining.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|When this show was first on television I didn't think It looked like something that I would like. Well one day I'm looking for something new to watch on my kindle and I thought I'd give it a shot.<br />Well I was hooked after the first episode. I'm now watching season 5 on ABC and I'm loving it.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies this movie weaves a story about life, friendship, love and socioeconomic differences that will touch anyone who has ever had an unlikely friendship that changes your life and creates a different future for you and the people that love you.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent stand alone book that is sequel to the shinning I have read all of Kings books. I thought &#34;Bag of Bones&#34; was his best writing. This book is a little simplistic and predictable but it had some twists and I enjoyed it
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The Chromecast has a couple of really brilliant aspects to it, however some things just make it (currently) unusable. The main benefit of the Chromecast is that it streams HD content fantastically from a laptop to a TV. The only caveat there is that your laptop/source must be able to smoothly play the HD content itself. I tried streaming from an Asus EeePC (1005P) however it was heavily jittery and could not stream properly. When casting from my Chromebook Pixel, however, the streaming was flawless (although at some points buffering was needed, which sort of ruins the experience..).<br /><br />There are a few issues which are known, such as its problems maintaining a connection to the WiFi. I have a simple setup at home - just a WiFi N router, literally 15 feet away from the TV, with direct line of sight (i.e., no walls etc). The connection consistently drops out every 10 minutes or so, even when changing the WiFi band from N (2.4 or 5 GHz) to B.<br /><br />The worst of the problems I had was finding a way to stream media to the device. I really would like to play my own videos/movies onto my TV from my laptop (is this not what the Chromecast is for?). Of course, if you have movies on Google Play then this works OK, however when it comes to playing your own videos you're stuck for options. The easiest way to do this is to simply open up Google Chrome browser (with the Chromecast extension installed), and press Ctrl+O to open a new file. Then simply select the video you'd like to play and it plays within the browser, allowing full-screen playback, and you can then cast this Tab onto your TV. The problem here occurs when trying to play any movies that are encoded in a manner Google Chrome doesn't support. Most files should work but it's annoying when the ones you want to play (such as .mkv's or .avi's) don't work, or only partially work with no audio.<br /><br />Since the product is still in it's early stages, I will wait until Google rolls out a fully fledged piece of software (or firmware upgrades) that can stream my videos from my laptop to my TV. Just not sure why Google removed support for this back in August.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I purchased this as a replacement. It arrived quickly and works GREAT! I LOVE my Kindle!!! I would recommend this item. Word of warning - Don't Vacuum the tip or you too will be ordering a replacement!

B00A2H9X6I|5.0|When it comes to the plot, I'll just give a brief summary, pretty much everyone knows what it's about. Carrie is bullied by some of the most popular girls in school, and they push Carrie too far, then Carrie uses her newly found telekinesis powers to dispense good ole fashion justice.  With all of this going on, Carrie has an overbearing religious mother.  That's all I really want to say about the plot.<br /><br />The casting is amazing.  Let's start off with Chloe Moretz. Chloe knocks the role of Carrie out of the park.  She does such a nice job with the role. Chloe adds such an emotional element to Carrie.  The shower scene was so emotional, my heart broke for her. She was the victim, and she didn't deserve what the girls did to her.  Chloe played it perfectly.  When it came for Carrie to get revenge on her bullies, you can't help but to cheer for her. Chloe is such an amazing actress.  Moore played Carrie's mom, and she did such a nice job. When he was on screen, my heart was actually pounding with uneasiness, it was such a good performance.  As for the bullies of Carrie, we don't like them, and we were meant not to, the bullies played such a good part. When they got what they deserved, you didn't feel sorry for them.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie. If you've seen the original, and liked it, go see this one. You'll love it. Personally, I liked this more than the original.  If you see it, you won't be sorry, I know I wasn't.  Chloe is simply amazing.<br /><br />When it comes out on blu ray, I know I'll be the first one to get it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|thank you its very nice and help alot gooj good job<br />small and easy for use from every body so

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great follow up to The Shining, as always very well written and keeps you turning the pages.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I have a few note book apps on my kindle fire but this by far takes the cake. I love that you can password it, convert your writings into pdf files and have several different books started in the app. I recommend this if you love writing stories and don't like wasting paper to write them.
B003EEMIV8|4.0|I had no idea how large this would be.  My grandson loved it.  Poor instructions but we figured it out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game! It's awesome! I totally recommend. The one downside is that it updates a lot. Other than that it is one of my favorite games.

B002H3F7F6|1.0|I always loved listening to Sting's unique style of singing, which was my reason for buying this CD.  But in order to like this CD you have to hate Christmas!  I have tried to sit down and give this CD another listen, but it is really hard to listen to.  It is that bad!
B000056BOR|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with Cary Grant and Doris Day, I remember when I was a teenager watching this and loving this movie.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|The cable looks sturdy. It works well for USB memory stick, I used it in a VW Tiguan 2011 and Audi S4 2013.<br />Users that were dissatisfied seems to have tried to plug a USB cable for their iPod. It probably did not work because the way Apple works. They probably need the special cable that connects directly the iPod to the car port.
B000Q6ZG6G|3.0|stanley kubric directed movie. another mindbender of a film with contempory style and blockbuster actors that give great performances. Very good,worth a watch
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very detailed weather and time info. Easy to add other cities(tap current city, tap + and type in new city)

B002YK8OKC|5.0|This is my family's favorite Christmas movie of all time. GIVE IT A CHANCE, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. Classic American comedy, Cousin Eddie is my favorite character. Two thumbs up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun better than temple run and subway surf, I love the bad guy battles! The baby minion makes funny noises.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I love flipboard. I use it on my iPhone and naturally I wanted it on my new kindle fire hdx. It works but only in portrait mode. When you switch to landscape which I think would be the best way to use flipboard it has trouble loading articles. When it does finally load it loads 100 blank pages. If this issue is fixed I will update this review.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so very happy that kindle fire got candy crush this is a wonderful game and very addictive.....can't get enough of this game.....fun to play!!!!!
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting weaves a fantastic &#34;story&#34; around the shipbuilding worker of Newcastle. Some brilliant songs and lyrics to die for! Listen!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I came across this book by chance and am glad I did. This book is in the same category as Douglas Adam's HHGTG - and is totally insane at times. Highly recommended!!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Had heard this was tough to watch per the story is difficult to see.  Steven Spielberg does so well building and telling a story.  It is rated  R  for good reason; nudity and the topic is difficult, but really a must see, when you are ready.  Liam Neeson did a very good job as Schindler.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't believe Amazon finally brought this game to KINDLE! Nice job thank you,thank you, thank you.<br />So awesome. So addicting.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think so far this deer hunter is better than the old one, could use more money and coins have to make game better

B00EUEWRUI|5.0|i'm  huge fan of Deep purple<br />and there's been shows pro shot recorded/TV broadcasts of Deep purple LIVE during their 1984-1985 world tour<br />which have been sold as bootleg dvd's over the years<br />the Paris show 1985 was TV broadcast i have seen myself on bootleg DVD aswell as other shows from this tour<br />many Deep purple fans would know that<br />and one of these performances have now been officially released on DVD by Eagle vision<br />it's been a long time coming but finally one of the pro shot concerts have now been officially released<br />and it's the Australian tour concert<br /><br />this DVD perfect strangers LIVE was pro shot recorded during the first leg of the Perfect strangers tour in Australia<br />only few months after the album was released on Vinyl actually.<br />according to the Editorial review on this amazon page this concert was filmed in sydney entertainment center<br />i have watched the whole concert Ian Gillan doesn't mention sydney at all after each song<br />he just says he's happy to be back it's been a long time etc<br />so for all i know this concert could've been filmed in Melbourne or Brisbane.<br />Apart from the location the performance is excellent this is the first leg of the tour so the whole band is playing fresh<br />the band's in Top form in this concert<br />it wasn't until during the end of this tour and the beginning of the The House of blue light writing/recording sessions<br />that Blackmore and Gillan were fighting/Arguing with each other again<br /><br />the Picture and audio quality is excellent in my opinion, the audio has been mixed in 5.1 surround sound ofcourse<br />there is also one special feature/extra which is a Tour Documentary of this tour and goes for 25mins only<br />it should've gone for 1hour at least i think<br />but some of the footage i've already seen on bootleg dvd's<br />Tour Documentary just contains Interviews, Promo interviews with each member (except Blackmore ofcourse)<br />Blackmore isn't interviewed but the rest of the band are<br />there's also behind the scenes footage of the Tour from Australia, Knebworth festival 1985, USA tour footage etc<br />plus Rehearsal footage of the band recording Perfect strangers album all contained in 25mins<br />Documentary could've been longer that's for sure but for some reason Eagle vision only produced 25mins of footage<br /><br />i bought the 3 Disc box set which is packaged in clamshell keepcase with a 2 sided fliptray and the dvd on bottom of case<br />that's how i got it anyway this set might also come in Digipack packaging aswell but not sure<br />amazon don't say what the packaging is on the listing unfortunately<br />so you could get a 3 Disc keepcase or Digipak if you buy it from amazon.com.<br /><br />but anyway the 2 sided fliptray has the 2 Discs Audio recorded LIVE, so it's the soundtrack to the concert<br />and the soundtrack sounds fantastic, 10/10 sound quality it's perfect audio mix<br />there's a booklet included<br />which has interviews with Roger Glover and Ian Gillan about this tour so it's very interesting to read for sure<br /><br />according to amazon the DVD is available to buy on its own without the 2 Disc soundtrack<br />what's the point of buying the concert when you don't have the soundtrack<br />so i definitely think the 3 Disc set is worth buying more than just the Single Disc version.<br />this set has a booklet with interviews, the concert dvd and the 2 Disc soundtrack<br />Definitely worth 5 star rating.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|One of the better 3d movies that I've seen at home.  Don't watch on a cheap 3d tv that has glasses that you don't have to put batteries in. Stay away from LG! Sony, Samsung are good
B006R1T40I|5.0|A long anticipated effort, great music for southern blues, delta style music, a must for Bonnie Raitt fans to add to your collection

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps the brain going! Definitely food for thought! If figuring out puzzles and finding clues is your thing then you'll really enjoy this app. I can't wait for more levels! Love it!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|lots of intrigue and mystery<br />readers will not be disappointed<br />can not wait until the next book is released by this author
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Excellent book to movie realization shot in stunning cinematography! Mister Peter Jackson has embodied the Tolkien masterpiece into a masterpiece of his own making.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. It's family oriented and one of the funniest movies I have every seen. Don't hesitate and buy it now.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a fun game. It's not my favorite game on my Kindle, but it's a good way to pass the time when I get bored. I also don't like how you have to wait for the lives to refill.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|At the end of this book, I was like, whoa! I've seen the show before and watched almost all of the seasons, but that one dude gets it in a totally different way! They basically just summed up the whole season in this one book! Basically, I can't wait to get the next one!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|My fave all times easy to work with ! All stages r so cool lots of interaction simple and so many choices to choose from
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|A great, fun, family movie. The kids lived it as did I. We laughed and even cried a little at the end. I would definitely recommend this movie!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Loved it. Have read a couple in the series, now looking forward to reading the others, all intertwined in some way. Great reading if you like books that connect with each other.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Always loved Star Wars. I love the characters, and hearing the music! I am finding it easier to win in this Angry Birds version.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|i really enjoyed reading this book...it was like i was having a conversation with Pam herself.  i enjoyed her sense of humour and the examples she gave.  i have found the book inspiritational and recommend it to everyone i know to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just as fun on Kindle as on my computer. I am getting higher scores as I started over. Love the challenge of this game.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I enjoy playing this game with my children it's a good way to pass the time and bond with the little ones
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is not one of those easy superficial feel-good books that you race through. You'll probably read a bit, put it done and think about what the author presents.  It's challenging, thought revoking and very insightful of the period.  Especially interesting is how Paul and his version of Christ's teaching emerged as the Christianity we know today.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|I loved the game, lots of varaiation. Play was good. IT CRASHED!!!! I lost everthing I had earned.NOT FUN! !
B000FC130E|5.0|Quite an interesting tour of London's Underground, for those who've visited the City one must never tire from. Rewarding and fascinating.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Its so much FUN!!! and FREE, Finally We both are taking turns at the dark side and the other side
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Starts out good. Begins to fade halfway and has a predictable King ending. I figured out the surprise early on. Meh.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's good but it will not let me use my money I have already throughout Facebook<br />So I guess it will have to work for now
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I have enjoyed both books in the series. I have to keep reminding myself that this is YA and that the characters are only 16 or so and as such make some pretty stupid decisions from time to time. I am interested to find out more about their hidden history and what the rebels are really after.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|Didn't order this it just downloaded to my phone. Don't want it and wish I could figure out how to delete it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Affordable price, easy set up. Great product. We have  one on each tv and use them daily. We love them and highly recommend it.
B00DW1WR14|1.0|Long review short if you like everything Pearl Jam does you'll like this. If you like ten and nothing else you'll hate it.<br /><br />The first 3 albums will always remain classics and my 3 favorite Pearl Jam albums, except for the bad acid trip tracks on Vitology, but the 10 real songs are an awesome album. Whoever thought bugs or that stupid track after Immortality should be recorded should be beaten with sticks.  After that I've been hit and miss with Pearl Jam's releases.  No Code is still my least favorite, but it has a couple good songs on it.  Yield, Binaural, Riot Act and Lost dogs all had their standout tracks and their weaker ones.  My interest was revitalized with the self titled and Backspcacer, which while not on the level of the first 3 were still enjoyable.  My interest was pretty high, as was my excitement for this album.  Afterall Pearl Jam's albums all have something different to offer and this is no exception.<br /><br />I like the first 3 tracks and the last track.  After that I lose interest fairly quickly.  And that's the problem I have with this album.  There's no enjoyability factor.  After track 3 or 4 I couldn't care less about the rest of the album, until Let The Records Play and the last song.  T find most of these songs now bothersome.  I can't stand tracks 5, 6, 7 and 10.  I seriously hate the title track and Sleeping by myself.  Why Eddie's crappy solo song had to end up on here I have no idea, but I REALLY wish they'd left it as a solo song.  Ole would have been a much better choice.  I shouldn't have to dread listening to a signifficant portion of an album and that's what's happened here.<br /><br />The band experiments some and some of it is interesting, and lyrically this album is really strong.  But that doesn't make up for so many songs I don't like.<br /><br />Getaway opens the album with a mid tempo rocker, sort of. This one sounds very Backspacer in its pacing, though maybe a little slower. Still it's one of my favorites on here and has grown a lot on me.  8/10.<br /><br />Mind Your Manners is easily the heaviest song on here, with a very punk style. This one's kind of fun, but we've all heard punk before, so nothing new. It does bring back Vitology memories especially \\"Spin the black circle\\".  This one actually grew more on me and I really enjoy it.  7/10.<br /><br />My Father's Son is a softer but still up tempo song. it sounds very Backspacer.  This one grew on me too and again probably a 7/10.<br /><br />Sirens, the first ballad and it has some good moments, but a killer chorus would have helped bring it all together.  I find myself really wanting to like this song, but it just never takes off for me. 5/10<br /><br />Lightning bolt, sounds like it'll pick up the pace but rarely does. It easily has the worst chorus on here, the first line being ok before Eddie starts repeating Lightning bolt over and over. My least favorite song on here.  And it grew to annoy me more and more.  I don't like it and won't be listening to it again anytime soon 2/10<br /><br />Infallible is a slower paced song, and this is where a little experimentation seems to come in. I can't think of any song they've done that sounds like this.  Well the guitar parts make me think of Vitology's Tremor Christ, but otherwise it sounds interesting.  Something about it has grown to annoy me though.  4/10<br /><br />Pendulum starts off kind of darkly with some piano and other random instruments and a soft bit of drumming, before going very tribal sounding for the end. It's interesting anyways, but kind of forgettable for me.  cool sound but forgettable song 4/10<br /><br />Swallowed Whole has a fast bit of acoustic guitars and sounds like it'll be a single before it's all said and done. Again it's ok but nothing really memorable. Interestingly enough, for me, the song they released Ole sounds really well placed between these 2 songs. 5/10<br /><br />Let The Records Play is kind of bluesy and another different side to PearlJam. I like it, but there's something missing, I can't even remember how it goes right now. I like the guitar solo, but it's WAY too short. They should have let it extend for a minute or minute and a half. But the tempo is kind of fun. 6/10<br /><br />Sleeping By Myself I don't like this one.  I find it irritating.  This song sits right next to songs like Bugs and Bushleaguer amongst the worst songs Pearl Jam ever did and should never have been recorded.  The melody is bad, the music is bad.  I can't stand  ukuleles and to be honest I don't think there's one song i like, and I have over 9000 songs on my ipod, with this crappy instrument in it.  They could have used a mandolin or something better than a freakin' ukulele.  The only worse instrument they could have used is a banjo.  1/10<br /><br />Yellow Moon is another acoustic number and when I listen to the album I enjoy it moreso than most songs, but again I can't remember it. 4/10<br /><br />Future Days is yet another acoustic song, but this one I like a lot.  it took some growing but it may be my favorite song on the album now.  I really like the melodies and the guitar work.  Very beautiful album closer.  I just wish more from tracks 4 until this one had been on this level, or that of the first 3 songs.  This song kicks Sirens's butt all over the place in terms of music, melody songwriting and beauty.  9/10<br /><br />Some have accused this of being a pop album, but it can't be with so many forgettable tracks. It's not bad background music, but there's absolutely nothing making me want to come back to this. But listen for yourself and decide. I personally think they can do much better.  Also this album has the distinction of coming into my life, essentially right as a former close friend decided to become a prick and that friendship ended, so it has that stain of negativity on it for me too.  That can be one of the wonderful things about music, reminding me of certain time periods, which a lot of albums don'tdo for me anymore, but this will certainly be a negative reminder I probably won't revisit much.  I dont blame others for liking it, but I don't.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a greatest 3D movie there is!  Not only are the special effects superior, but the script Is extremely well written and you are really drawn into the film.  Highly recommended!
B004GYY714|5.0|There are LOTS of radio stations and a Television programs!  The selection includes news and other great FM/AM radio programs
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't put this game down. I've been waiting for it to come out for kindle fire and so far it was worth the wait.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are a true King fan this story is for you. Grabbed me from the start and never let me go until the last page!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Painful, especially for someone who grew up during the Korean War... It revived all the fear I felt then.  Well written today the least...
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great mix of stories and data about running and why we were born to run.  Highly recommend it even if you don't like to run.  It might change your mind.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is about my fourth &#34;Angry Birds&#34; app,  I really like this one - but then I like them all - some are just harder than others.  It's an entertaining game to play when you are sitting somewhere killing time!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is truly awesome! You can create your own notebooks and have as many pages in it as you like! Plus, it's free! Flipping awesome!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My two granddaughters fight over this game.  I tried it, and it's great, especially if I'm waiting for an appointment and have time on my hands.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|very fun game. its a good time waster too. I like the aquatic park and prehistoric park too. keep those updates comin
B009WUBERW|4.0|good action.  It was especially great to see Chuck Norris again!  I've missed seeing him as Walker Texas Ranger on TV.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I had heard that the internet would be accessable with the use of this device. That I cannot is my only complaint.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I had heard not so great things about this movie and I usually don't let that stop me from watching or buying a movie. I always figure its worth a watch. My cousin told me to rent it because he thought it was really good, so I went out and bought it. I have to say I was really surprised. It was a really good movie. Good action scenes and I thought the story was pretty good. Definitely worth adding to your blu ray collection.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Cant help but to love Bullock in this movie. Great stuff. Not just a movie for &#34;sports-movie&#34; fans. A great family movie you'll want to watch again and again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and this game.  It has a temple run feel, but it's more enjoyable due to its cuteness and in-game puzzles.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The item didn't work with my TV as I only had one HDMI connection. I have an older TV. So, I gave it to a friend who loved it. CH
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't want to put the game down, it's very addicting! I think I have more fun than the children do! ;)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google. I can always find what I'm looking for and have multiple sites. I don't use Chrome, Bing, or Yahoo search; they just don't impress me as much as good ole Google.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this app! I had to get dumb ways to live. That stunk!  I'm so glad this came out. Best game ever!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its the best. Now that it is a available for fist generation firers. Which is only fare. But if you want more reviews then y'all need to cut down on how many words you have to write.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This is a very nice looking time piece. It really looks nice on my wrist, so my friends tell me. If you have an small wrist it will not look good on you.<br />Thanks
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This is a cute story. Easy read and the characters were cute. Quick read and the storyline wasn't too intense for different age groups
B00ET9T2WK|4.0|I love the game but I keep running into bottlenecks. The worst is iron. Everything needs iron and it costs a lot to get. Other than that I love the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazon made this mandatory and would not allow me to read without completing this review.  When did this start?!? I liked this book, but a mandatory review, really??
B004A2V3K0|5.0|it's Bon Jovi! Of course it's great! Easy download, good sound. Not much else to say. . . . .
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This is a great little puzzle game that is weirdly addictive. My only complaint is that the screen likes to shift around when the ads cycle through and can kind of mess up a move (on Kindle Fire HD). Otherwise it is pretty great!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is great , wish they gave more coins when you get it right but other than that it's a good game
B000LB7G00|4.0|I like using space ball as it is very handy tool for any CAD software.<br /><br />Cons: they don't come with protective case.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game. That is an understatement. This game is freaking great even a little strategic. You should all buy or get this game
1451626096|5.0|I  love this author.  I am pretty sure that I now have all her books, especially those dealing with the Tudors.  This is a great way to find out about Henry VII as so little is known about him.  I will now spoil the various plots.  Suffice it to say, buy and read this one for you will not be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for all ages . This is a must get. It's kinda like temple run but without tilting. All kids ask for it
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I bought the Canon camera and I got this Case for free. It is a nice case for the beginner that fit the camera but not other accessories like the extra cam. But it is easy to carry and light enough to bring with it a long time outside.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I think it's a great app but.  There is one flaw.  It loads really slowly.  I want an app that I can just click then see the weather.  NOT I can click and wait ten minutes.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I got hooked by hearing them on internet radio. They're fun and upbeat with some really unique lyrics and musical sound. They also some some really good &#34;unplugged&#34;/acoustic music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg i love this game Im so glad they finally got it in kindle its so addicting yall should get it like NOW yall wont regret it<br />- jessica lee'Ann church
B005F82X48|5.0|One of my favorite bands, they really rock it out. This is their best album in my opinion, I also have their self titled one that was released 10/15/2013, it's great too but I like the upbeat rock that this album has.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great book!  First one I read in over 40 years that held my interest and look forward to the same
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so fun getting new missions! And I love the vector battle!!! It's  really really super duper fun!!!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Finally a YouTube app that is legit and works I hope they continue to update this app because it is a amazing thing
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked the concept of the story and generally how it was laid out. I thought the book was at least 100 pages too long. I was &#34;done&#34; reading it quite a bit before it actually ended.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game seems fun, however it's slow going. When you tap on the object it doesn't always take the first time. All and all I'm having a good time.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Very engaging game :-) got hooked on it immediately wanting to get 3 stars out of every level (and i'm not that kind of gamer)
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|When you buy the Kindle,it doesn't come with a video camera on it. I saw this problem and immediately went to the app store. Then I saw this app and tried it out. I LOVED IT SO MUCH! YOU SHOULD GET IT!
B004I1WIWU|1.0|Great album by a great artist, but I ended up returning all 4 LP's received because the vinyl was either warped or warped with surface marks that created unacceptable surface noise. The pressing plant responsible for manufacturing this LP and/or the delivery method resulted in an unacceptable product in every case. A big waste of time.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I generally prefer non-fiction books, mostly history and current events.  However, I would recommend this book highly to any reader interested in North Korea.  The writer, who lives in Arizona, traveled extensively in N. Korea but always had a government \\"minder\\" accompanying him so he could not speak directly to the average citizen of this cruelly governed country.  His creative imagination has provided a fascinating novel that speaks for those people.  How do various people adapt and make some sort of a life in a poverty and famine stricken country run by an Orwellian dictatorship?  The answer in this book is they live with fear, pain, initiative and even humor. I look forward to this writer's next book eagerly.
B006RXPY3C|5.0|Excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth and the aftermath of Princess Diana's death.  Came quickly and in good condition. I rated this film 5 stars.  Thank You
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I ended up renting the film because I had to find out what the film was supposed to sound like.<br />• I have a Samsung Blu-ray Disc Player BD-C5500, BD-C5500C so, I should be able to play the Blu-ray Disc from the 2-disc set From up on Poppy Hill.<br />• The Audio Part of the Blu-ray disc has problems, one of the voice-over tracks specifically. It seems to be the major speech track.<br />o Its sound is extremely muffled, almost inaudible, and overwhelmed by the music track.<br />o There seems to be a second voice-over track because once in a while a voice will  pop out loudly.<br />* Any troubleshooting actions completed<br />• I've listened to the Blu-ray and DVD video discs and the problem has been consistent in all three albums. (I returned the album three times.)<br />• All my other Blu-ray DVDs play perfectly<br />• I did a 24 hour purchase of the video through my Time Warner account to compare the sound between the disk I purchased and the one I rented. The Time Warner showing had no audio problems at all.<br /><br />* A detailed description of any missing parts<br />• All parts were included
B005SAV9SO|5.0|Maybe it's because the main star happens to be a woman, who isn't delicate and flowery. Or maybe it's due to  the inclusion of Justin Timberlake. Or perhaps it's because the 'funny' portion of the movie wasn't dedicated to a man  for once... that the movie ended up with such low ratings. If it had been a man, instead of Cameron Diaz? I bet it would have done a lot better - by comedy ape standard anyways (the same ones who gave Nacho Libre 5 stars).    I thought the movie was clever, had a lot of 'lol' moments. I have watched it over and over again.    It's nice to see a movie where the woman isn't some church going piece-of-s***, and who is actually an important part of the movie. The 'bad teacher' in this movie is definitely not disposable nor forgettable. The other cast of characters though, of course, helped make this movie what it is. You could never give one person all the credit.    that being said....liked the x-rated version a little better.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|It's ok - my 18 month old liked watching me, but wasn't so sure what he was supposed to do on his own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My children told me it was addictive.  They were correct.  Keeps mind sharp and helps pass the time of day.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie and thought we should buy it while I was going to be home for several weeks after recovering from surgery.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I just discovered this gem and saddened to find out that it was cancelled and was ended after season 2. I understand that maybe it wasnt as popular as Downton Abbey but I feel they should have let the story continue and see where all the characters would end up. I hope one day they would consider bringing it back and really promote it so that more people could fall in love with the lives of Eaton place
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book is for more than just young adults and I could not put it down. I just wish it was longer! Thanks, Brandon, for yet another great read.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This is a sweet game but lately I am on a hunt or upgrading and my game just closes and energy takes way to long... 10 mins for a 45 second hunt
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved everything about this book very emotion provoking. I couldn't put it down if my life depended on it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The journey continues for Eva and Gideon. Continued healing and a breathtaking romance. The darkness continues to fade, though not entirely.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Beware, once you start playing you cannot stop!  You do need patience because it gets difficult at times but don't give up and you will get through each level.
B003U4UNPK|4.0|Great series, but I liked season 3 less than 2 and 4. It's obvious that they decided to start stretching the series out after season 2. Still a good season, but seems to meander a bit.
B004AUHWLQ|4.0|An interesting aspect of this well written and well acted film is that Jack Lemmon's character's boss, Mr. Sheldrake--played by Fred MacMurray--is a rather less dark archetype on which Don Draper could have been modeled.  Also, compare this movie, released in 1960, with ones from just a few years hence, i.e., The Graduate, Bonnie & Clyde, 2001: A Space Odyssey, to see how incredibly the art changed in just a decade.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|I'm a fan of Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, and anything Judd Apatow writes/produces/directs. So this was a slam-dunk. Very enjoyable movie! Great way to kill a Saturday night if you just want to stay indoors & check out some Video On Demand.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really love this game. Its SOO addictive! I sit in my room all day and play it. Great for little kids too. I wish that you didn't need a facebook for all the levels, but hey! I still got a long ways to go.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Had seen this movie long ago and forgot how funny, and interesting it was. I was particularly interested in the town it was filmed in and watching the movie gave me a nice view of the location. Well worth viewing more than once.<br /><br />As far as streaming on Amazon. I was a bit dissappointed when I could not stream from my Ipad to my TV. So had to watch on my computer.
B000U6BT40|4.0|Is an entertaining set of  science fiction programs mixing the characters (what a set of characters) personal drama with a Julio Verne futuristic vision of the world.
B0000266T2|5.0|Have had this CD for years and absolutely loved it. Somehow I misplaced it so I had to get a new one because I love it so much. Recommend this CD highly.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|of every dystopian sic-fi novel I've every read, crossed with Shirley Jackson's &#34;The Lottery.&#34;.  Lost interest after about 50 pages.
B003EY9UZU|4.0|Very entertaining movie, and a very effective cinematic depiction of what would happen if we were faced with an apocalypse. The special effects still have a ways to go - they're getting close to looking realistic, but they're still not there.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I thought this would be a good movie since Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman were in it but I was wrong.  It was very disappointing.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|This was a great movie. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a cute movie to watch. It's now my new favorite movie!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Fantastic music, every song as great as the one before it!! I will definitely be ordering more of Joe Bonamassa .
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I usually don't read much sci-fi but Outview drew me in until I impatiently toe-tapped to find out what would happen next. Legg kicks his tale off with a cast of teenagers and family members and has a gentle but strategically savvy way of introducing his readers to the supernatural at the same time as his own characters. With well-placed dry humor the supernatural world of sages, seekers, villains and friends suddenly seemed normal as I flipped through these pages. But there were more surprises I didn't expect. Each chapter took me to a different location, where little books within the book delightfully existed. As a human being reading this book, there were even life lessons unlike all the sci-fi books and movies that have come before. This was my kind of science fiction, and although a few tough scenes left me squirming, I knew I would go on to the next book in the series when this one was finished. And that is the toughest test that I present to any series writer. Give me a reason to move on to the next book. I finished the first and there was no doubt what I would be reading next:  Outin. Don't miss out on this series, book-reading friends. You will be delighted!!
0385351399|2.0|I had high hopes for this book but was completely disappointed. The premise was great, but the characters were flat, lifeless creatures.  I could relate to no one, especially not Mae.  The author did not attempt to make the reader understand how such a typical, \\"normal\\" girl could be completely overtaken by the Circle in so brief a time.  How could Mae be so susceptible to this brainwashing?  It is never explained. The Character, Annie, was mysterious and then plainly pathetic.  The men in Mae's life were weird beyond anything I could relate to.  Most of all, none of the characters made me care about what they were doing.  I understand it was a satire, but it missed its mark. Instead of leaving me with an intriguing, thought-provoking story about the slippery slope of Internet privacy issues, it left be thinking that it was just a silly story.  Waste of time and money.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works exceedingly well with Netflix and YouTube videos - in fact I get better quality through the Chromecast dongle than I do through the dedicated apps on my second generation AppleTV. It also allows me to push videos up on the screen through the Chrome browser which is quite nice. I often watch UK television via my browser and can now watch it on my HDTV thanks to Chromecast. For $35 it's probably the cheapest and easiest option for a lot of viewers.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|what is my name my name is eleazaar Pierre because it goofs and my grandma does not flush the toilet because she does not listen for low reason
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a cute game, but it gets annoying when you can't do the quests because the game says can not visit this player cause you have a different version. And you have been able to visit them in the past. Other than that, it's an alright game.
B00A2H9X6I|3.0|For 38 years the original Carrie has remained one of the greatest horror movies ever made, a shining example of not only how to adapt a book into a movie, but also how to make you....Fear, so it was inevitable that a remake would be made.<br /> To not compare this film to the original is impossible. Brian De Palma's version is an immersive experience, a psychological assault on the mind, you feel what Carrie White feels. Chloe Grace Moretz is an incredible actress, but her Carrie doesn't quite project her fears and emotions into us like Sissy Spacek's did.<br />  In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie, the mother(played by Julianne Moore) nearly lacks the controlling dominance the original had over Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz's Carrie right from the start doesn't hardly fear her mother, but instead shes defiant towards her, hates her, and this is what separates this new Carrie from the original. Brian De Palma's Carrie FEARS and Kimberly Peirce's Carrie HATES.<br /> For the most part the majority of the middle of this film plays out almost identically to that of De Palma's, the actors are the only real difference. Some of the new actors are good and some are just terrible, like Judy Greer(Miss Desjardin / the P.E. teacher), she sounds so week and juvenile when shes speaking her lines it's hard to take her seriously as an authority figure.<br /> Lets fast forward to the prom scene. In Brian De Palma's Carrie after winning prom queen and king Carrie and Tommy Ross head up to the stage, this scene is gloriously shot in slow motion, eventually the blood gets poured on her and she goes into a state of absolute shock, the only sound that can be heard is the bucket swaying back and forth, then the bucket falls and hits Tommy in the head knocking him unconscious, in her state She takes no notice of whats happened to Tommy as the overwhelming fear that has enveloped her causes her to lose control unleashing her powers on all her school mates. In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie...well lets faceit, the prom scene lacks the build up of the original, no slow motion, no sounds of a swaying bucket, how this scene was shot by De Palma is what made the original so fantastic. Kimberly Peirce's Carrie somewhat figures out how to control her powers, unlike De Palma's who's powers mainly activated out of fear. This time when the blood is poured on her head she doesn't go into shock, instead she nearly walks off stage before turning around after Tommy is hit by the bucket. This pushes her emotions over the edge and in a fully aware state of mind she unleashes her powers on her class mates.<br /> I personally feel nothing for Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie, it may have followed the plot of the book a little closer in some areas, but it did it with far less sophistication. It has some unique changes that make it worth a watch, but ultimately it doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|I guess I was too busy with babies when this first came out. Missed it entirely! I was surprised to see de Niro in a role like this. Great story, sad history, but naturally, if it involves land, it tends to always be sad. So pleased I found it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Did just what I wanted gave me netflix and youtube on a tv that did not have the ability to use netflix<br />I did have to purchase a range extender to go along with the chromecast device.  My wireless signal was not strong enough for it to work properly but the range extender worked well for the chromecast device and also made connections for my phone and laptop much better throughout the house.<br /><br />I did find that when I installed the range extender I had to be sure it had the same name as the wireless router and not the default name the range extender would have given to the new extended wireless network, the insturctions that came with the range extender did allow me to keep the name the same,  I assume since the content comes from the main wireless router and the chromecast device was working through the extender they needed the same network name to be recognized by the phone which is how you control the netflix movies.  Also the phone must also be using the same extended wifi network as the chromecast device.<br /><br />so it took a little getting use to becaue of the distance of the tv from the primary router and the need for the range extender.
0385351399|2.0|Mae is a recent college graduate who gets hired by the sexy technology company called the Circle that has consolidated most internet activities.  (Think Google crossed with Apple.)  She thinks she may have found the greatest job ever and rises quickly through the ranks.<br /><br />Despite its stellar reputation the Circle’s business practices may not be completely legal or benevolent.  What will Mae’s reactions be when she is confronted by evidence of wrong-doing and by the company’s constant intrusion into people’s private lives and into her personal life?<br /><br />The premise sounds interesting, but the book is not.  Other than Mae, the Circle employees were so bland and so similar to each other that I thought this was going to be a Stepford Wives scenario, but no…they were just lifeless characters.  Mae is so gullible, dimwitted, and self-absorbed that the reader doesn’t necessarily care what happens to her.<br /><br />This book has the feel of a hastily written young adult novel.  The Circle was definitely not worth my time or my money.
0385528752|5.0|This was our book club choice for this past quarter.  Several of my colleagues had already read the book and we practice some of the values taught.  Great examples throughout the book to mirror several industries.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a challenging and entertaining game. My only complaint is the that sometimes the touchscreen doesnt respond when it should so you get stuck on the level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have seen other people playing this game and it looked really fun so when it was available on my kindle I was so excited. It is so fun and you won't regret getting it:)
B008PCVGKI|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year.<br /><br />A lot of sometimes pretty dense information, but to me at least very useful, with a lot of insight and new information.<br /><br />The most I've got out of this book was an insight into the internal workings of medical academia as well as the pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />The fact that it focused on actual systematic problems, and gave reasonable solutions for many of them was highly enjoyable to read, especially in contrast to the usual &#34;oh the big bad wolf...aaa I mean pharmaceutical industry, is bad, because, well it's bad&#34; rhetoric that makes my skin crawl.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Schlosser has done an excellent job of reconstructing the history, the development, and deployment of nuclear weapons in the US.  If what he write is only half true (and I am sure that it considerably better than that), then we are lucky to be here today.  He recounts examples of negligence, arrogance, and stupidity in how the military and other branches of government dealt with the horrible weapons.<br /><br />It is a good read, well researched, and thoughful.  I only wish that he had paid more attention to the human costs in the development of the weapons.  While it is easy to claim ignorance of the longterm consequences of radiation exposure with hindsight, some of the experimental exposure done by the military during the development of the atomic bomb is a blight on the conscience of the US.
1402766785|5.0|George Bridgman will teach any artist everything about drawing the human figure.  Clear and concise.  I highly recommend it for both beginners and professionals.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book without prologue. I liked the story and interesting idea.<br />Expecting not less from the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Me and my mom really like playing this game with all of our friends.<br />I give it a five star.
1419705644|5.0|this book is awesome and a most have for adventure time fans, and it has information on everything in the Land of Ooo. It has many parts to laugh at as well. Though page 9 was hard to read but i figured it out, the trick is a mirror.
B00DJZR4A2|3.0|Let me be upfront. I am a huge Elton fan since the late 1970s. I have most, if not all of his albums. I am more of a fan of the rock/pop Elton. The last album I enjoyed from him was \\"Made In England\\" (probably the only person). But I will buy his albums until he quits/retires like Billy Joel did. Oh, don't get me wrong. His last few albums have a couple songs I like, but definitely not as catchy.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It was an easy read, but I kept putting it down. It's really hard to explain what this novel is about. You really have to read it to understand what I mean. It was probably one of the most interesting concepts I've read in quite some time, so that was refreshing. Definitely give it a read, you'll be as pleasantly perplexed as I am.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|In my opinion this piece was very well done and the acting was quite good.  Thought Gemma  was excellent.  I truly enjoyed this presentation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Bought it as replacement for expansive Cable TV services.<br />Working perfect with YouTube and Netflix. High quality of picture and smooth streaming with WiFi internet connection from smart phones.<br />Did not success to get same quality from all websites.<br /><br />All in all - good quality for fair price. I recommend.
B004G8P2M8|5.0|This black pearl of noir unleashed on the reading public in 1929 is a lethal paper cut of a reminder that Greed exists; the antidote for anyone who thinks Life was easier `back in the day.' The Depression was the car wreck around the corner. The Coen Brothers translated this novel to screen in Miller's Crossing, but what gets me about this novel from Dash is how he peered into darkness of the American psyche before the Depression, before Yuppies showed up. Yes, he will be forever known for The Maltese Falcon, but this is a really dark, violent novel.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Its not as good as JJ Abrams first Star Trek movie but AWSOME none the less.<br /><br />This movie is defiantly a must see for SCI-FI and TREK fans alike.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Thought I would try, and then I couldn't put it down. Very good for your memory too. Game it 4 stars only because everything can try to improve.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|started reading on rainy night, could not put book down until it was done. Crouch is one of my new favorite writers.
0140143505|4.0|Humor. Friendship. The Restoration of the epistolary novel. Platonic love, a ham, and numerous exchanges of books and gifts across the ocean between a hilarious American and one reserved gentleman, with a cast of grateful bookstore clerks. Proof positive that there is no need for a plot. Hemingway and the post-modernists can go to hell. Respectfully.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so happy candy crush is on Kindle. I've been playing in my phone for a long time and waited patiently for it to become available on Kindle. Thank you so very much.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|I'm not going to go into any great detail about this album, but simply it is very easy on the Ears.  I really enjoy listening to Mr. Blackmore play his guitar...in whatever style he chooses.  The songs are all very well put together and Candice Night's voice is just beautiful.  I Xpecially enjoyed the final instrumental that Ritchie did for Jon Lord (Deep Purple Keyboardist)...very well done.  The only thing that could have made it even more memorable would have been Jon actually guest appearance on the song.  Free Hugs!!      & Keep A Rockin' In The Free World!!  Changin' The World One Ear At A Tyme!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very happy Amazon got on board love playing it on my kindle. Now get pet saga and your awesome! Fun game.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|I liked the plot of the movie and the story was Great!!  I enjoyed watching the movie and the graphics were great too.<br /><br />if they would get rid of the inuendo of the father wanting to see the mother in law dead. I would probably give it a 5 star rating because I really liked the movie.<br /><br />Thanks!!!
B00CSYR432|5.0|We lived this movie!<br />It is so refreshing the way in which Miyasaki presents love. Very human, poetic and beautiful without being corny.<br />My children of 8 and 10 absolutely loved it too!
B00F35BV64|5.0|If you enjoyed the last one, you'll love this one. Non stop action, and several twists in the story line that will keep you in suspense.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Because it is better then any book I have ever read and is well written. I LOVE THE FAULT IN OUR STARS !
B001NLKZUA|4.0|The story is exciting and I love the dynamics between all the characters. Just when you think you know what is going to happen the author takes you somewhere totally different. It was hard to put the story down.
B002IEVZFK|5.0|The best All That Remains album no questions asked. This band absolutely rocks.  A must have album for any metal fan.
0451450523|2.0|I've just read this book for the first time.  I never got around to it because I always had other things I preferred to read before this, in part I believe this is because of the title - I have a hard time taking the whole Unicorn thing seriously.<br />I am sorry to say that this is a giant fail for me.  I am having trouble reconciling the adoration for this book with my experience.  I've seen so many reviews that call it one of the greatest fantasy books of all time!  I've seen reviews that claim it is superior to Tolkien!  Yikes, in what universe?<br />The plot is barely coherent.  The characters are hazy.  I needed to force myself to keep reading.  That is not the sign of a good book.  A good book should make you want to keep reading.  There wasn't a single point in this story that I could not just stop reading without any effort.<br />The whole reason I'm writing this review is because of my bafflement about why some people think it is so good.  I think I've come to some possible conclusions:<br /><br />1) Apparently, there is a movie version that is much loved by people who saw it when they were kids.  People who loved the movie seem to be able to project that love onto the book.  I've never seen the movie so I don't know if that love is justified or not.<br />2) Maybe certain kinds of people love this book.  People who believe that a tattoo can have a profound meaning.  People that think animals are more worthy that human beings.  People who call themselves witches or warlocks.  People who take themselves very seriously. People who have a sort of tenuous, dreamy interaction with reality.<br />3) I'm guessing that a good number of people who adore this book are seriously stoned when they read it.  Sort of like how people think Pink Floyd's The Wall is profound because they listen to it stoned.  In other words, it is profound and beautiful if your interaction with reality is off the rails.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because it is decently written.  It has good sentence structure, grammar, etc., and it has some moments that actually made me chuckle.<br />I am truly sorry to write this negative a review.  I'm doing it as a warning to others of like mind, and not as an intentional insult.  More power to you if you disagree (which most of you do).  Maybe someday I'll try watching the movie while I'm in an altered state and see if I 'get it'.s good sentence structure, grammar, etc., and it has some moments that actually made me chuckle.<br />I am truly sorry to write this negative a review.

0385349947|5.0|We ordered this book for a women's leadership network dinner. It was a smashing success. Paired with Sandberg's TEDTalk, this book led to meaningful discussions among participants.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Terrific movie, if you like a movie with drama that deals with characters and personalities as opposed to constant explosions and gunfire. I haven't read the book, so the movie was full of surprises for me. After watching the movie I downloaded it as an ebook. And that's rare that I like a movie so much I take the time to read the book. The CGI is way too over the top and obvious for me, but it didn't spoil the movie. I liked the choices of music. Even though at times there was hip-hop and at other times there was jazz, it never felt disjointed and it all felt true to the story.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great book by James Rollins.  This should be a movie. This was an exciting page turner. I can't wait for the next Sigma adventure!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I see why everyone is playing it.  It's challenging but fun.  I love the graphics.  It's probably good that it times me out, though.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's challenging even my grandson helps me find items. He enjoys it too<br />And it's a different challenge I enjoy it
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|will not down load. I'm pissed. don't waste ur time. it just messed my whole kindle up. horrible. simply horrible.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I have always enjoyed the Pendergast novels, until the plot of this one.  Yes, it's engrossing, and yes, it's all well written.  For those reasons, I gave it a three.  But Nazi eugenics in Brazil?  Killing Helen again over the top to motivate a man with the urge to kill? Please.  Too many characters with guns, too many plots, and too much confusion.  Copenhagen window my eye.  Every writer has trouble with trilogies, please don't do it again.  Loved the first one.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldn't imagine a better way to complete Dan Torrence's life after The Shinning.  Thanks for taking me back to the Overlook and settling the whatever happened to....characters and introducing new family members of Docs.
B000002HMH|5.0|Great songs.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala's story should be required reading for every American. So much of everyday life in the middle east is revealed this book in addition to many facts about our own country's involvement. In the vein of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\", Malala presents an honest account of life besieged by constant terrorism and military force. Here, the fears of everyday people forced to live under Taliban rule are revealed and dealt with. Reading this story enhanced my knowledge of the world in which we live. Malala shows us that the quest for world peace will lead to an enlightened existence for everyone. This young woman is destined for greatness. She deserves every award presented to her. I look forward to watching her progress during her second chance at life.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book after reading a friend's copy of it to my preschool-level class.  While the title suggests technology, the book is a clever and fun experience about following directions with no technology involved.  The humor is subtle and the book was highly entertaining for my little ones.  They absolutely love it,and so do I!  I highly recommend this book.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I have read this novel many times. It is full of life and humanity. Read it. I think you will like it.
1455121924|5.0|I will never eat wheat again!<br />This book was only ten dollars, but it was worth a whole lot more.<br />Just when you think he's given you a plate full of meat and potatoes,<br />wham, he hits you with another fact that blows your hair back.<br />Then you think you've gotten way more than your moneys worth,<br />and wham, he hits you with another fact that blows your mind.<br />He just keeps building more facts and evidence.<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite books.<br />I want all my family and loved ones to read it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Finally Stephen King is back.  This is a great story. It could make a great movie if done right.  I have been reading King since the beginning but he got off track a few years back, not anymore.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Great songs.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|It's easy to say that if you liked any of the Culture books by Banks, you should read this book. It is deftly written, polished and has a sweeping world that takes you away. There are moments of stillness, military action, and mystery. In some ways, it reminds me of China Mountain Zhang.. another story with some memorable characters trying to live and let live.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite app. It is a great time killer. Connect to Facebook and bring you bring you family and friends into the candy kingdom. Only thing that I hate is after reaching the higher levels you can spend days, weeks, or months trying to beat one level unless you break down and buy helps. That being said every level can be best with additional purchase, I am in 345 and have never spent money on the app.
B00005NRN9|5.0|The visual portion pulls you in immediately and the story pulls your inner child out. It makes you want to be that child all over again and it allows you to enjoy it. It will give you the chills and paste a permanent very familiar smile on your face.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love having them with a tap my finger. I use my pictures for display at work, nice to have a no fail way to get them.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This season os Star Trek The Next Generation has some great episodes. The conclusion of the Borg season 3 cliff- hanger is just the beginning of hours of exciting science fiction.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|This was a strange and different movie, however it's about a woman who has a disorder of self distruction and very disturbed.  James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal gave excellent performances in this movie.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. The story  subject matter was different. I loved the characters and how they gradually changed at the end of the story. Once I started reading I could not put the book down. If you are looking for a quick read that is easy to follow and is a different love story you have read this is for you.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Mr. Grisham seemed to have phoned this one in. The book built to a big aha moment which never really came.  It was an ok read but not up to the level he normally produces.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Excellent, easy to get involved with the characters and understand the underlying themes.  Fast paced, but easy to track on the plot twists.
1611761808|1.0|Two of the 11 CDs (#5 and #6) skip terribly.  It is extremely difficult to follow what is being said and to maintain interest in the content.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|I don't get all the bad reviews from people before it was even released. It's a beautiful set. The book with photos from the movie and behind the scenes is gorgeous. On nice high quality glossy paper. The drawing on the cards are amazing i'm getting two framed, The books with blu rays is lovely and well made. and the three toys are mucher nicer than I thought they be.  and all that  And of course the movies look amazing. For the price you get so much stuff. I had the smaller set as well and that one is gorgeous too which i gave to my best friend. I think this new is one of nicer box sets i have and as I said if you are collector. (and its's limited edition which has the sticker on the front telling you the number) it was pre ordered because it came out on birthday and it came right of sept 24 packaged nicely. So again for any collector this set is worth it its really is nicely made and you can't go wrong for the price.
B001DE29SS|5.0|Excellent movie and fabulous portrayal of Charlie Chaplin by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance.  He is a most talented actor especially portraying Chaplin.  It's almost as if you are watching Chaplin himself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it's finally available for kindle fire hd...now waiting for pet rescue to be available. Two of my favorite games.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Well done....Reacher keeps finding trouble and a new girl to go with it....this might actually happen if Obama keeps screwing up the country
B007VUA7VO|5.0|If you find yourself wondering how much battery power is remaining, or whether the charger is actually working, this is the app for you.  It is efficient and easy to use.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A wonderfully new take on magic and fantasy. A trilogy in a world like nothing I've ever read. Perfect magic system, great characters, and perfect story development with a heavy ending that couldn't have ended any other way.
B007NRWLZ0|2.0|This is probably one f the worse comic movies Ive seen. I only got it becaue I collect comic movies even bad one. But it cam quick it was packaged nicely not the sellers fault for a awful movie lol=) so two stars is not about the seller they were great its for the movie being so bad.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|This movie was excellent and exciting to watch.  I loved everything about it and Di Caprio made a wonderful Gatsby.  It's a must see movie.  I loved the first one with Robert Redford, however, this one was more intense.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great family movie. Enjoy this family and servant staff as they grow and change during times of war, love, and scandal.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is easily one of the best game on the kindle. A variety of animals to kill and guns to use.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|My 14 year old and I watched this- he is a big fan of sci-fi and monster movies. We both were disappointed. The whole premise of the mind-meld human operators of the robots is just odd and does not work. The fight scenes were very hard to &#34;read&#34; and therefore kind of boring. Story line is predictable and of a kind with the genre. Nothing new here. Acting is stiff and aside from some comic relief provided by some &#34;researchers&#34; just wooden.<br /><br />Not worth the time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of his best books that I have ever read, and I have read nearly all of his works. Classic good vs. evil with no cliffhangers, and all loose ends taken care of wonderfully. WELL DONE!!!
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Love the stealbox. Movies look great on blu ray. A must for any Mad Max fan. Just wish it came with some extra stuff maye a little booklet with some photos and facts for such a nice package.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I love this game.  I am too o'll d to have discovered a game compulsion, but this game got me.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Mehh...Spiffed up Godzilla movie, no character development, mediocre acting, mediocre plot. Not really worth the time and $$. Would have been upset to pay full price at the theater
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Spent many hours, day and weeks peacefully lulled by it's loveliness...only to loose everything.  It just up and died at level 24.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very much like all the previous match 3 games with minor differences.  Buy, it is enjoyable just like all those previous match 3 games.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Loved this book and the characters in it.  The topic is controversial and set in Europe making it far different than USA.  Seems to be best sellers are coming from the UK and Scandinavia these days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg I love this app it is so much fun,  the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it I love it
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Please do this first.<br /><br />Look at your NorthBridge AMD990FX heat sink.  Does it wiggle.  If it does, then do this.<br /><br />Use a pair of needle nose pliers and care fully push out the 2 white pins. Take off heat sink.<br /><br />Does the Thermal paste look dry and cracked, mine was.  Now clean the paste off, Goo Gone, then Alcohol.<br /><br />Put on new Thermal Paste. Push heatsink back into board.<br /><br />NEXT.  GO INTO BIOS AND ENABLE IOMMU this will allow all your USB to work right.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The Rosie Project was a very engaging read. It is just about the right length to maintain credibility for this sort of love story.<br />The characterisation was well done and rang true. The characters are seen through the eyes of the main character who throughout the book is presented with the challenge of reconciling logic (his key strength+++) with feelings as part of his quest to find a life partner.  Or, maybe it is giving up trying the reconcile the two.  Either way it is amusing, insightful. The weaving of all the characters and their separate relationship journeys into the quest of finding Rosie's father is artful.
B00992CF6W|1.0|CAN NOT GET GAME TO WORK, JUST SPENT $7 on it:/ Is anyone else having issues with the game<br />Y
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|This is a nice movie to watch on a weekend when you just want to chill out. It's more towards the tween ages but not too bad for any ages to watch. Maybe not for kids under the age of 13 though.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy this show.  This past summer, I started watching on the suggestion of a good friend.  This January will be the start of Season 4 and I wanted to be ready for it... I must say in the very beginning of Season 1, I felt it started out slow, but by the 3rd episode I was drawn in and have enjoyed every episode since.  The actors are superb and very entertaining!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This return of the lead character from The Shining brings Stephen King full circle back to his scariest best.<br />I literally could not put this one down until I finished.<br />Nobody tells a tale as well as Stephen King.  Nobody.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is very fun.  Keeps you entertained for hours.  I like the different levels and how you can go different directions for different outcomes.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|I have watched this show from the start and have loved every season.its wity and so well written. I love how stories from the first season are just now being tied back together.
B000FC12SM|5.0|This book has helped me so much to understand the differences between men and women. I learned things about men that made a light bulb go off and could identify with all of it. Things finally made sense! A think it is a great book for any couple in any relationship whether it be dating or marriage.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! I usually purchase movies on the weekend when I just want to chill out. This is definitely one that won't disappoint! I highly recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great read, if a bit crass for my whole family. Glad I finally read the book has been on my list forever. Loved the story and twists.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|A little boring and lacking for some reason.  It just didn't have a magical quality.  I doubt if I will bother reading the next book in the series.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I don't write a lot of reviews but just had to set the record straight. This app is basic-so if you don't want basic fine get something else but don't rate Calc Plus low b/c of that. Secondly, the internet  is NOT necessary to run the app. The internet is only needed for the first time. I opened the app and used it one time with internet. Then turned my connection off and the app still worked just fine. Those who don't bother to truly check out an app shouldn't post a review until they do b/c it's nasty to say false things. Have a happy day!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive. Easy game to learn. Fast action and move up quickly and learn to combine candies to explode and get high scores and then challenge your friends. Can't get better than that!!
B00AG297GK|1.0|There are bad movies that are watchable, this was not one of them. I gave up after 30 minutes. What was Sacha Baron Cohen thinking?
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Okay....so I know this film won a lot of awards but it was to me, just an okay film. Something you may want to watch on a weekend when there isn't much to watch on TV. Don't think the tween ages would enjoy this film so maybe 16 & older for this film.
B003M70O5O|5.0|It is a show you have a love/hate relationship. Love the music. It makes you keep coming back for more!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Very slow start and not the best writing.  Sometimes I doubted it was Grisham 's writing.<br />The story did improve as well as the writing. Also enjoyed learning about this aspect of law.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Great app! I am a &#34;windows&#34; freak, so I gave up on iPad / iPhone with all the limitations using Office products. (Word, Excel, Powerpoint). With my Samsung Galaxy Note and this app I can work on my laptop and phone and synchronize beetween the units. Highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty cool my kids and I enjoy playing it from time to time and we try to beat each others high scores
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Takes a while to wait for crystals but it is still a cool game to play.  Kids like to play.
0470449756|5.0|Plenty of test questions. Great to exercise but you need another book/source to get you refreshed on all the maths concept. I am using Manhattan editions on the side
0525478817|2.0|This book didn't meet my expectations at all. I was hoping it would be a book my older grand daughter might like to read, but I would be very uncomfortable with that considering the language and some of the situations.
B003MAQM6Q|1.0|For me, this was a terrible movie.  If you liked Pulp Fiction, you will probably enjoy this movie.  There was a clever twist involved.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting.  I loved it on Facebook and now am very excited to play it on my kindle fire. Just wish you got more than five lives at a time.
B004IVGBNC|5.0|Surpassed my expectations. You are never too old to discover another great band from your youth. They have immediately become one of my favorites.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|We heard Gawande speak at the New Yorker Magazine Festival recently. He was fantastic so bought two of his books. HIs storytelling is great and his examples make the whole book very interesting. Excellent!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|liked the movie. too many plot holes. more of a retelling of space seed than the wrath of khan, which is open now for a future movie. could have been better
B00785P2QC|3.0|These are great games, but they have a lot of similarities. They tend to all blend together. No real differences in the games.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Still marveling that I'm so intrigued by the everyday happenings of a family and a time that is so far removed from my everyday life.  This series is so interesting I think even my husband would enjoy the program.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The book starts off down a quintessential British lane and ends up somewhere else altogether.  I didn't see it coming and I could not wait to find out what happened next. It's a shame to give away the quirky twist...so don't read too many review and let yourself be surprised.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Originally I thought this was 'just another Zombie Movie&#34; but after watching it...I loved it! As soon as the Blue-Ray came out I bought it! Brad Pitt was great!<br /><br />Let's just say if there was a Zombie Apocalypse...I'm hoping for the &#34;slow and dragging one foot Zombie vs. these fast running, jumping, leaping, ADHD Zombies!!&#34; :)<br /><br />Definitely in A Class of its Own! Buy It!
B000W178XO|5.0|This is a great collection of his classic hits.  I love this album  would recommend to any country fan  Thank you
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I love it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This one is every bit as good as its previous ones. I have read them all in order and wish there were more. Highly recommend.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|As a YouTube player, this program works well. You can easily play clips in either partial or full screen with good audio and video quality. However, ever since the latest upgrade, the interface is very clunky, with way too many features cluttering up the screen. It becomes quite tricky to maneuver around and actually get to the features you're looking for (the icons aren't very intuitive either).<br /><br />Apparently, the company tried to throw in every feature they could think of, and failed to take into account that people had a limited size viewing screen to maneuver around in (cluttered enough on my Kindle, let alone how it would appear on a smart phone).
B001B71NOI|5.0|A dark, slow and intimate album.  Reznor at his best, I strongly recommend this product,  like in fact all NIN music . Another facet of this musician's world to explore headphones on, so as not to miss a single note.  Superb!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is so simple, a cheesy cartoon vehicle with a redneck lookin fellow  with his head flapping all around. The object is simple, use the two pedals to try and to fight against the laws of physics and gravity. However the addiction in the game is that every time you play the same course, the way the car reacts is never the same. Plus you can upgrade the vehicles constantly making it a new game every time you restart. I can't put it down until my battery dies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addicting puzzle game that continuously gets more levels through updates. So glad it's now available for kindle now!
B00CKQ1092|5.0|I LOVE this album!  Best live show ever as well.  I've listened to this for a couple months on repeat.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I attempted to play the game without reading the instructions without success.  I tried to find instructions but could not find them
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I liked this 2nd installment to the newly cast series. Like the first one, this story was very compelling and the action was intense. JJ Abrams does a great job keeping the story moving and Chris Pine plays a great version of a young Capt Kirk (replacement). I did not leave my seat for a restroom break in the theatre. I was not bored and it was definitely not as slow as the old school William Shatner style Star Trek movies of the 80s and early 90s. Then again the technology wasnt cutting edge then either, but I look forward to seeing more of these until the actors get old.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love the interacting puzzles. Graphics are awesome. Not too complicated. Definitely worth the money with the amount of play time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you thought the first book was awesome, you'll be on the edge of your seat the entire book this go around! There's love, betrayal, mystery, murder, so much going on, I couldn't even breathe!<br /><br />L-O-V-E-D it!
B004L86718|4.0|I think the transcript to this movie is actually better than watching it being acted out. But hey, the movie was fun and entertaining so no real complaints.<br /><br />But seriously, google &#34;Jerry Maguire transcript&#34; and see what I mean.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's an awesome game. I never get tired of it and hardly any adds! Despicable me is so cool. It's not like sonic either where you need to be super fast.
B00APACSJG|5.0|big fan of the Vorkosigan saga...this one didn't disappoint.  Had all the trademark humour, great story line and human interaction that a good book should have.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|I have to say I was very disappointed on Iron Man 3. I loved the first 2. This is mainly because, since I am a comic book geek, and viewing how the writers tried to put the Mandarin alongside the Extremis to combine a crazy story that was just all over the place and hard to follow. These are supposed to be two separate stories. Marvel Knights Iron Man was the best in the Extremis story and it was a motion comic.  The Mandarin supposed to journey the globe to collect the 10 rings that made him become the great villain who then takes on Iron Man. Ben Kingsley is a good actor but his character of the Mandarin was weak, and now where near the what the comic depicts of what he supposed to be. I enjoyed all the other Marvel super-hero movies to build up the \\"Avengers\\" climatic mother lode movie, but they should have stopped making them after that.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I would have given this book 2 1/2 stars if that was an option. Certainly different, parts were quite entertaining while other sections dragged. Allan reminded me of a Swedish Forest Gump.
B0027Z5DM6|5.0|Very funny story about how being obsessed with your work can take away from what your actually working for to begin with. Can become obvious,in some cases too late, that 'fixing' the problems isn't always going to work. Waking up and preventing them to begin with may have should have been your first choice.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you like to play bingo it is a fun game. I liked it. The only think I didn't like is the called numbers didn't always let a  person find the numbers called before the next one is called. Kind of fast paced. An easy game to play.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|I consider Mahatma one of the world's greatest peacemakers of all time.  A spiritual man that was willing to do everything and anything for injustice without the use of violence.  Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi is nothing short of remarkable.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Man of Steel is a re-telling of Superman's origins, where Kal-El, or Clark Kent to humanity, must protect the Earth from General Zod, who was banished for war crimes and has come back to save and &#34;advance&#34; their race after their planet is destroyed, wiping out most of the Kryptonians. But as General Zod raises the stakes and begins to cause utter chaos and destruction, Kent learns that he must go beyond what he knows if he is to save us.<br /><br />Man of Steel is, by far, the best Superman film to date. I will admit, I am of a younger generation and was not there to see the first Superman hit screens, but I still liked it when I saw it, and I still do. But this Superman doesn't necessarily stick to the comics more-so (more than the other films, in certain respects) but it captures Superman in a different light. When we see Kent in other films, he's already become part of society and saves the day when need be. Here, Kent is an outsider, and he doesn't know what to do with his life. He's always moving, going state to state and job to job, never settling down. But when he discovers an ancient Kryptonian craft the government is trying to excavate, he finds out the truth of who he is and where he came from. But it's when General Zod comes, when he discovers his true purpose in life; his destiny. Zack's directing is superb, capturing the epic scope of a Christopher Nolan film (who also produced this), all the while showing the scale as well, instead of just a small look at the conflict. The acting is great, especially Michael Shannon as Zod, who is both terrifying and yet, somewhat understandable. Russell Crowe was also incredible, and very deserving of an Oscar nomination along side Shannon. Cavil is damn good as Superman, but it's Crowe and Shannon who stand out the most. The visual effects are top-notch, Hans Zimmer's musical score is haunting and grand, and the script is good. It's not award-winning, but very memorable and worthy of note.<br /><br />Man of Steel is not for everyone, but is a great sci-fi epic. I also wanted to say, not only am I disappointed with the critics (like most), but I don't understand comments on the character development. Superman does develop over the course of the film, greatly. From discovering who he is, &#34;adapting&#34; to disasters that have befallen him over time (shown through flashbacks), and a price he paid dearly at the end of the film, when he's left with no choice. This Superman is a more human Superman, but no less incredible or amazing. I can't wait to see how the sequel turns out.
B00EEXST2K|3.0|The producers of this movie do not approve of pornography. This is unfortunate as the majority of the potential audience for this movie does approve of pornography.<br />  The producers claim that their intention was to present Linda's story from her point of view. But they do not have an insight into her character. Shortly after she died in 2002 an obituary was written by a man who had been assigned to do a profile of Linda a few months before. The occasion was her appearance in the magazine Leg Show. The writer was disappointed when he was introduced to Linda Boreman as she was just a typical fifty year old woman, not especially attractive or interesting. Then he watched as the lights came on the the cameras started snapping for the photo spread. He saw Linda Lovelace emerge from this non-entity. He'd found the key to her character, she was an attention junky. You gave her attention and she would do most anything.<br />  Sharon Stone deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance as Linda's mother. And you can see where her hunger for attention might have come from. But nothing else in the movie is particularly revealing.<br />  In the credits they say the movie was based upon Linda's book, Ordeal. And in the movie they portray some key scenes two ways. First the way most people remember them and secondly the way Linda described them in Ordeal. When it came out and ever since Ordeal has been described as a revelation where Linda detailed how Chuck Traynor forced her to do pornography and that she had never done it willingly. Calling Ordeal a revelation is buying into the Women's Movement storyline.<br />  In 1976 I read two of the three books that Linda Lovelace had supposedly written. One of them opened with her saying that Chuck has an M-16 that no one has taken from him. She goes on to detail his other weapons and how he threatened her with them. This was years before Ordeal. But this book didn't become a best seller, she was still friendly with the world ofpornography at the time it was published.<br />  In the 1970s when ever Burt Reynolds would guest host the Tonight Show he would try to get Linda Lovelace on as a guest but the producers always refused. After Ordeal came out she appeared on the Tonight Show. The movie only hints at this dichotomy but it is essential to understanding her story. The Women's Movement rallied around Linda. They put her on news shows around the country, they got her a spot testifying before congress. And then they dropped her. They did not help her when she needed money. And they were absolutely silent late in her life when she re-approached the fans of her pornographic career.<br />  There is so much more to the story of Linda Lovelace and I am afraid this movie will keep people from looking deeper.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a exciting book with twist and turns. The end of the book was not expected at all. I would recommend this book.
B003K07DUC|1.0|Another propaganda film with Matt Damon.    In this fictionalized account of our war with Iraq, the story line is: the whole WMD thing was made up and the world was lied to in order to justify the invasion of Iraq.    Despite intelligence sources from many countries - not just the U.S. - we are told that \\"Bush lied, people died.\\" That about sums up the film. Nothing new, no new info, just the same old lie made into a story. Just like the claim they make about the war, the film is also based on a phony premise.    Since real investigative journalism is dead in the MSM, we may never get to the truth.    [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I had been playing a smaller version of this; smaller because there were less configurations.<br />It will take me a long time to play every configuration
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|I have never written a book review before despite the fact that I have read and thoroughly enjoyed so many.  I am writing this because for me, this story has so much insight into the human psyche and behaviour: guilts, secrets, desires and insecurities abound. I particularly liked the 'what if' epilogue.  All in all, a thoroughly good read.  I will be looking to read others by her now.

B003G4W49C|4.0|This book was very good! I love how when Ender is being manipulated, he still finds independence and freedom.<br />This definitely gives a good moral to the story.<br /><br />However I do not like how the children who are chosen to fight, are forced to. I do not like how the children forget their memories and and are treated like adults. I mean seriously! They are minors! They are children! I do not understand how the children will benefit from being isolated, from being forced to fight, and potentially getting PTSD!<br />I believe that affection is necessary  for human development. Once that affection leaves you at five years old, you begin to lose affection for others.<br />How can a child feel good about himself/herself when he is the same age as six other children, but in command over them? How can a child develop properly when his family has been taken away from him? How can a child love when he is not loved?  How can a child learn from fighting in an army at age five?<br />Answer these questions for me as you read this.<br /><br />Overall, good moral to the story, but poor plot and  message.

B009LQKHIO|5.0|I would recommend this book if you want an easy read. I read the first in the series and was hooked. They are written in a way that the characters are believable and each book follows in sequence to their lives. The only problem with them is that I read all five in the series in less than a week. Good thing the price is good on them.

0545586178|5.0|The book \\"Catching Fire\\" by Suzanne Collins takes place in the fictional country of Panem. The main character and narrator, Katniss Everdeen, has just previously won the Hunger Games, which is an annual fight to the death with 23 other teenagers, and she now finds out she has to go back.<br /><br />Katniss' second trip into the Hunger Games arena is very different from the first. It has oceans, tropical rain forests, monkeys, and even force fields. Obviously, she is not happy with this outcome but she is forced to go anyways. She goes with Peeta, a boy she is supposedly \\"madly in love with\\". This Hunger Games does not turn out like all of the other ones have in the past. This is Katniss' reaction when she finds out she has to go back into the Hunger Games, \\"My body reacts before my mind does and I'm running out the door, across the lawns of the Victor's Village, into the dark beyond. Moisture from the sodden ground soaks my socks and I'm aware of the sharp bite of the wind, but I don't stop. Where? Where to go? The woods, of course. I'm at the fence before the hum makes me remember how very trapped I am. I back away, panting, turn on my heel, and take off again. (174)\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, Katniss learns about love for her friends and family. Katniss also learns a lot about her self like how she hates power getting in the way of her freedom. She does not like people telling her what she can and cannot do. Although the book is 391 pages, Suzanne Collins does a great job of making the book a relatively easy read. Suzanne Collins wrote a really good book which is part of a really good series.
B0068860WK|1.0|Well, that casting just ruined all the potential this series had.  No way am I going to pay to watch that schmuck play in a WWII military role as a leader. I made it 2 minutes in and had to shut it off.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|Very enjoyable on its own but I bought it for my grandchildren ages 6 and 8 to watch , understand the story and become familiar with the songs before taking them to see it on Broadway. It worked, they loved it, watched it several times and were singing the songs for two weeks before we went. With the cost of Broadway tickets, I wanted them to understand everything!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Absolutely captivating characters and the intensity was overwhelming. Okay, now I am off to book two.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|This is very misleadng due to the fact it says free then you get into the game only to find out you cannot play anymore unless you pay. Well I am not the only person who is smart enough to not credit cards and if I did I would not give you or the game developers my information. Sorry for the bad review but until you are honest and straight with me and all others then you should feel assumed for your lack of creative marketing.
0062086529|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter when she was sixteen months old, not realizing it's meant for older children (I didn't read any reviews; I'd read about it in another book and liked the idea of stimulating the imagination). When I received it and paged through it, I thought it might be a bit advanced for her because it's not rhymy or sing-songy, it's longer than the typical toddler book, and the illustrations are simple. So I shelved it, thinking I'd try it in a few months. Well, I didn't give my daughter enough credit, because about two months later she pulled it off the shelf and started to flip through it, and then she handed it to me to read to her. It's been one of her favorite books ever since. She's entranced the entire time I'm reading it, and it's one of the few books she'll ask me to read over and over again. She also loves paging through it and \\"reading\\" out loud herself. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much she loves this book--and I enjoy it too! We've been reading to our daughter daily since she was about six months old, and we have books all over the house, so I think if your child has been exposed to books from an early age, even the younger ones will enjoy this wonderful story.

B000FC10MU|4.0|My first introduction to Neil Gaiman was a good friend in college shoving a copy of The Sandman into my hands and imploring me to read it. I did, and I've never forgotten it--even if the memories are a bit hazy. Outside of hearing Gaiman's name or seeing his delightful commencement speech, I had never read anything else by him. With The Ocean at the End of the Lane coming out, I decided to read what many seem to acknowledge as Gaiman's classic work: American Gods.<br /><br />American Gods is the story of Shadow, a man who at the beginning of the novel is just being released from prison, serving time for robbery. He's anxious to return home and to his wife. He learns just before his release, his wife was killed in a car accident. As Shadow returns for the funeral, he meets a man named Wednesday, who hires Shadow. And the story unfolds from there, with Shadow driving Wednesday around, keeping a low profile, and so on. Wednesday is, of course, the Norse god Odin (whom the English Wednesday is named after). And, well, Wednesday is a god, though not in the conventional sense, which I won't explain, for the novel does give some suggestions as to what a &#34;god&#34; is, but--and I think wisely so--Gaiman leaves a bit obscure. The gods of the novel are part of the landscape and don't need much explanation. And many gods and goddesses appear, including the new gods of entertainment and other new fangled things. The conflict between the new and the old, the remembered and the forgotten, the found and the lost is a major theme of the novel, which Gaiman explores with a light hand, saving it from being both silly and didactic.<br /><br />Gaiman is a quite a story-teller, and the novel is very well-written, with engaging characters. Shadow and Wednesday are masterfully crafted (as is another character that I won't mention to spoil a mild plot point). Other characters are quickly captured in a few lines and pop distinctively. This novel knows how to build a world and how to use that as backdrop. I recall from an interview with the director of L.A. Confidential, Curtis Hanson, who said that he asked the set designers, costume designers, and so on to spend an extraordinary amount of effort to capture every detail of 1950s Los Angeles--and that he would film it as if it didn't matter.<br /><br />I will admit I found the ending a bit of a let down. Not that it wasn't good, but the build up to it seemed to promise much more, which left me dissatisfied. Perhaps this was intentional on Gaiman's part, though I'm not sure I would find that any more satisfying. Nonetheless, this is a novel well worth one's time.that as backdrop.

B003G4W49C|4.0|This rounds book was an interesting choice my hubby actually picked it out. Well the movie is right around the corner and six months ago I was like I should read that. The story is about Ender who is six when he has his monitor a device attached to his back that watches everything. He's unlike most kids because he's the third child when everyone is permitted to only have two. When his brother was too aggressive for the program they attempted with a girl but she was just too nice so they hoped that by having a third child he would be the perfect one to command the army and defeat the buggers.<br /><br />When six year old Ender is given the choice to stay home or head to space as a officer he reluctantly agrees not wanting to leave his sister or parents. Unlike the other young boys he adapts extremely fast to the flight to training. Quickly rising up the ranks as the youngest commander, being pushed harder to be the commander of the fleet they are expecting.  Adapting and changing his battle strategy with each match. Will he be the commander everyone is waiting for to end the war for good? Or will he ice out?<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect I had an idea from the movie previews and the synopsis so for me the idea was unique and exciting. How many books do you find a child tasked with saving the world? I enjoyed Ender as a character he was easy to connect with I found myself cheering him on through all his challenges. Ender's Game draws you in right from the start with Ender's story when he's having his monitor removed and keeps you with him till the end. I like the alien concept but I'm a fan of fighting alien's because one day I'm sure we will see them. I like that the story has twists and turns some I even found myself shocked. It's one of those stories that you just have to check out. I think it's worth the time. I'm curious to check out the future series.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|Action packed,  and great movie!!!  My son loved the movie,  very entertaining for kids.  Tons of action throughout the movie.
B005T87QCI|1.0|Bought this game when it was first released and loved it. After an older update I noticed a few &quot;full screen take over&quot; ads which a paid app should NOT have. My son had also unlocked all robots. The last update as well as the current seem to have added tons of full screen ads which also have added to massive memory use and ridiculous loading times. Not to mention you now have to pay more for the bots in-game. I might be ok with the new in-game purchases if each bot didn't cost as much as the average AD FREE paid game on Google Play!<br /><br />So basically we now have tons of flurry ads, in-game purchases on items we used to have, and very poor performance and control on a PAID app! From an established developer this is outright greed. I have worked with many open-source and for-proffit devs. I get ads are needed occasionally especially in free apps BUT this was an established app and there is no way Jump Games dev costs to further this game was so expensive it needed overtake ads &amp; in-game purchases on a paid app. If half the money making effort was put to app performance than this would probably be a good rating.

B00C2VIA52|3.0|I'm not complaining that you have to pay money to get some of the best cards, but my gosh, the prices are insanely expensive to even get a few. You know developers have missed the micro-transaction boat when they have a $100 rune package.<br />Same old story of work long and hard, acquire mediocre cards, face opponents with cards that have 2 mana cost and yet deal 10 damage to any minion you control and then pass 15 damage to your hero. I'm exaggerating but you get the point. It's really sad when my bad A undead warrior nearly loses to a boar I stumbled upon in the forest.
B00139W3NE|5.0|This film has had some very bad luck, chief among it the terrible failure of New Line to market it as a classic kids' fantasy movie that deals with very heavy philosophical issues. Those idiots promoted it as a Kidman/Craig vehicle, when in fact it was 95% Lyra's story. So that caused it to tank in the US market, which New Line owned. (Another company got overseas rights and did OK, because they didn't screw up the marketing.) Anyway, I love the film, the performances, the effects. It's a terrible shame that we may never see the two sequels in our lifetime.  I think those who call it a &#34;mess&#34; would feel differently if they saw the fullness of Pullman's magnificent trilogy. This, after all, is just the prelude.

B00DJZR4A2|4.0|Elton still has it what can I say best voice ever.  No one at his age could sing like him go see him in Las Vegas but make sure you get 1st 5 rows ( you'll be joining him on stage. ).
B00F91FRTO|4.0|This is as brilliant an examination of our consumer world as we're likely to see. And of the superficial lessons some parents are passing on to their children. Acquire that which you don't need to create a sense of self. Build your character with sunglasses, shoes, and clothing. And then what?
B0058YPGL6|4.0|I watched this show on MTV.  I enjoyed it because it was a slightly different spin on the werewolf story.  My nephew was turning 15 and had not seen the show because he doesn't have cable, and Amazon had a great price on Season 1.  I got it for his birthday and have not got his review of it yet.  I also found out it was on Netflix which he does have, but it is nice for him to have the DVDs because he watches stuff over & over and it's his to have.  I liked the characters and it had a little bit of a Romeo and Juliet type twist.  The special effects are pretty good for TV.  It was interesting that the sport they are involved in is Lacrosse because it's not typical and works well with the story.  They could have gone the usual type of route and made it football.  I am nearly 50 years old, so no kid here, but I don't like typical old lady type shows.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is an appropriate sequel to Danny's life.  At first I didn't like seeing him how he was all grown up, but then, decided that I loved it and really, how else would he turn out?  The story was just as entertaining as his other books (and more so than a lot of his latest books).<br /><br />I purchased the book and it arrived straight into my Kindle app minutes later. There weren't many problems (if any) with the copy itself.  Everything was spaced correctly and flowed.  A few typos here and there, but those could be in the original hard copy.
B002ZG9800|3.0|I wouldn't have purchased this if I didn't already love it. Cannot stand Jim Carrey but put up with him because the story is so wonderful. I saw it when it came out and first went to DVD. Now that I see it again I see that it is one of those horrible TEAL and ORANGE  movies that they're making now - it's disgusting color manipulation that ruins a good film - and it ruined it for me too. That's why the three stars...other wise it would be five.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is hilarious!!!! What you do is you save people from dying in dumb ways. You can unlock new characters and the original dumb ways to die video. This is both addicting and entertaining. Get it!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a very detailed book that has interesting turns.. A must read! The book is just amazing!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|If you have played this game on FB then you know all you need to about this app.  I have it on my phone but I like the Kindle Fire for games so much better and am very glad it's finally available through Amazon.  It's a maddening game at times but I just play for as long as my lives last and move on.  I didn't associate my FB with the app yet so I am just playing from the beginning again.  I will hook it up with FB so I can play at my current much higher level when I am not at home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME EPIC APP DEFINATLY WORTH THE MEMORY SPACE YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD THIS TOO THIS IS THE BEST APP I'VE EVER PLAYED [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I had read 'Peter: A Darkened Fairytale' by author William O'Brien a few months back and I had loved the poems in the book, so I bought his second book in anticipation of many more fantastic poems, and I'll have to say I found it equally amazing. These poems (can't decide which one is the best) have a unique blend of creativity, fantasy and fun. No doubt I'm going to read all of them again. If you love poetry, this book has a treasure for you.<br />I'm eagerly waiting for many more books from this talented author.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This is hands down, one of my top 3 favorite albums ever. So eclectic and unique, there's not a single song that slows the album's progression. Each song is beautiful apart but even better when listened to as a whole. Gotye makes some incredible music.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Seems to work good easy to use.I have,t had it long enough to really know yet I will know in the months to come.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This movie didn't seem like it would be anything great judging by the commercials but I was surprised to find it was entertaining.  It was kind of like a Glee (a show I don't care for) but only in regards to the singing aspect.  The plot wasn't anything super complicated or original but it went along nicely and at the end you can't help but smile and get into it.  It's a fun, cute movie and evidently a lot of people liked it because I hear they are making a sequel.  My nephew loved it, the DVD was for him--he watched it over & over and was singing along.  There isn't anything super offensive in it so it was fine for the 13 & 15 year olds to watch.  He has a PS3 and an HD TV so he loves getting the Blu-ray included and the price was good enough to get it for him.  I know some kids under 12 that watched it & don't think it's all that appropriate for that age, but that's just my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game with lots of challenges. Although you can pay for some help, it is possible to pass the levels without help. You just need to be patient. Overall great, although it did make me hate chocolate at one point!!!
B007EC27QM|3.0|used it once.  Find it really great at such a reasonable price.  Numbers are large and easy to navigate.  Helping me become more flexible with the kindle.
B00CIOG16I|5.0|One of my favorite albums and one of my favorite album covers! It's different from the first album but not in a bad way, more psychedelic and experimental. A great second album!
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Get ready to have your mind blown in this follow up to shining. It's a stand alone book in itself. Don't take twenty years to do a follow up of these characters.
B00AFEY354|1.0|My nephew had seen this movie with his friends In the theater and raved about it.  It's the Breakfast club for my generation he said.  So I rented it to see what he loved about it and I hate to say it but it was AWFUL.  I mean painful.  The funny thing is around the same Pitch Perfect was in the theaters and he was negative about it, and didn't want to see it.  I rented both movies and would never tell anyone to watch this on purpose!  I thought Pitch Perfect was fun and cute--this is the total and complete opposite.  He now saw Pitch Perfect and loves it but still maintains that he loves this movie.  I thought he was pulling my leg, because sometimes people say a bad movie is good so you'll watch it and be miserable too, but he was sincere.  So why did I buy the DVD?  Because it was a good deal on Amazon, it was his birthday, he was turning 15 and is hard to buy for.  He was happy to get it but I don't know what he sees in it.  It's sad, dark, dreary and the kids talk like something out of a movie, not like real kids would.  If you were thinking of getting this for a dramatic teenager they might like it but as an adult I was so over it.<br /><br />Edit to add:  Not comparing the 2 movies--just that they came out at the same time.  If Pitch Perfect was not in the mix, it doesn't change my review of the movie.  It was slow, dark, overly dramatic and to ME, not entertaining.  But I was 49 when I saw it, the kid was 15.  The purpose of the review was to say what I thought of it and that if you were looking for a cute fun movie this was not it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|playing with different accounts on various devices to maximize enjoyment!  lol!  i know dr oz says u get easily hooked to this than crack, esp stay at home moms

B0010VD7EO|5.0|A wonderful album, full of some of the most memorable songs from the past 10 years. I adore this album.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a must have keyboard to replace the stock potions on my HTC One! The predictive text is awesome and &quot;flow&quot; is smoother than swipe. There is a trial version available so you can get a feel of this great app before you make your final decision. I got lucky and picked this up as Amazon.com 's free app of the day but it is well worth the money
B00064VR0W|5.0|Great production. Great sound. Great performance. He was great when I saw him live at The Finsbury Park Astoria in the 70's. He's still great. Oh, and great mandolin player!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love this game. So glad it is finally available on Kindle Fire. It's highly addictive. Great for the entire family.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|its a good game, i wish a little bit more levels but afterall i like the game. play as a pig is one of the greatest ideas of the game.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|I'm actually in love with this album, it's hands down my favorite of their work. It's good the first time you listen to it, but it gets better every time after that. Mystery Disease and Introspection are my two favorite songs. It's even better with The Optimizer!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My almost 5 year old daughter LOVES this game! It allows you to customize it for their age group, so it works for all ages.
B00092ZL80|4.0|I've liked Chicago ever since CTA. Some of their transformations have been better than others. I think this is one of the better ones.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|waiting for this game on the kindle. now that it is here can not put it down. thank you amazon for releasing it
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|My father and his co-workers all died from radiation poisoning from the mistakes made in the Marshall Islands. He could never talk about it, sworn to secrecy, but I am sure he and the others had no idea of the many mistakes that occurred within the whole program. Now what do we do with all those generations of bombs that sit in storage?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited and waited and waited for this game to be on the kindle fire.I am just so excited for this moment
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The features are much better now that I downloaded the game on my kindle fire HD. Great. You need to get this
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I really liked this dictionary and it was recommended by a friend who know his stuff.  I wanted to review the words I needed to look up and this does it for me.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|It appears to have a connectivity issues keep s as saying movies not compatible then it signs off then movie plays I don't like how I try to pause to do something else movie playing in small box up yop
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|Just upgraded to the cd from the vinyl that I hadn't played in a long stretch of years...I guess I'm in the minority that enjoyed it then and still do.......but now with a distinctively different perspective that the passage of decades affords..... but this quite odd and generally spurned offering by the then reigning lyrical maestro was soon tossed into the bins of techno abandonment and was not upgraded until now...and I've rediscovered Dylan's old breakaway into a new range of creativity with an older ear and new appreciation.  It is a nice win, win and a nod to father time with a sneer and a chuckle.........I realize most wouldn't / didn't rate this album a five, but in my world it is a gentle reminder that the times did change and that some things may have improved without changing a thing but me..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG I'VE BEEN looking for this forever! I'm so glad it's finally on the kindle fire hd works amazing and if you don't get this you hones yt? my don't know what a Good game is
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|You'll find itself not able to quit once u start... Will quickly become one of your favorite games on the kindle
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I absolutely love it. exact distances are very important to me. This is as important to me as any club.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is amazing but I want there FISH in the next update so yeah that's all I have to say except I want there to be FISH.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|I give disc one a generous three stars and disc two almost five stars........and I enjoy the original Self Portrait more....in both a historical context and on its own........so I assume I am probably in the minority opinion on both accounts
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool. You have got to  get it. Ok, sometimes you may have to  update it, other than that it's awesome.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|Loved the writing.  Usually I don't like too much description, but Shelley has a lovely way with words.  My sympathies lay with the daemon in this case.  Frankenstein was weak, foolish, and cruel.  You can't rely on the movie for this story... read this book.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|The start of a franchise.  This is one of the greats  alongside starship troopers,  blade runner.  Glad to see it on prime!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book is an awesome tool to have in your toolbox of personal enhancement, in regards to strengthening your abilities to communicate effectively with everyday people.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Five stars - this book has great characters. Could not put down. Loved the descriptions of fashion. Could feel the emotion!
B005PK56TA|3.0|Starts off really well but tends to jump around at times a bit confusing. Overall keeps you in the movie.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|The book is well written, but the underlying concept doesn't stand up to a novel length telling. Not up to the Standard of his &#34;Old Man's War&#34; series.
B008N1V11U|3.0|Ive finished the story. Does anyone know how to call the vehicle in free roaming? How can i buy the bat caller in the tech shop?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love love love it. It is amazingly fun! I am trying to defeat Meena . It is hard but fun.
B004AP9W46|3.0|This is the 5th book in the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.  While many love this book.  I don't, in fact it was the toughest book of the series for me to read.  Lestat is struggling with Heaven versus Hell.  He is forced by Memnoch to relive religious history.<br /><br />Now that being said you can clearly see Anne Rice struggling with her Catholic upbringing and the Catholic church as a whole and used her story of Lestat to try to figure it out.  I'm not a fan of this at all.  I loved Lestat through the entire series to this point.  I almost stopped reading this book several times but forced myself to continue.  This book almost made me drop the series as a whole but I didn't.<br /><br />Decide for yourself, for me this book was painful!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game for teens and older persons. I love it it kills slot of quality time I'm doing nothing.love it
0142501247|5.0|These books are fun for toddlers. Bright colors, consistent wording, cute flip option.<br />We have them all! Had them for my children, now for the grands!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Man Katniss ticks me off she is s up so wrapped in her self and when she yanks out Peeta' s heart and dances on it she wonders why he is cool to her,<br /><br />She needs to grow up
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy it a lot I love getting free lives from my Facebook friends and exploring different levels  candy crush  rocks!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Incredibly addicting and fun game play, You will have a blast playing it. That being said, Sort of annoying that you either have to grind out in the campaign (beating it on normal/hard) in order to unlock things. I mean I already spent a dollar on it, Shouldn't you give me that in the first place? Also, If you want to skip that and just have all things unlocked then you have to spend 3 more dollars in order to do so. Come on...Is that really needed?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an interesting take on the apocalyptic distopia. Characters were interesting and compelling, and the story just kept me coming back for more. I will definitely be looking into other books Hugh Howey has written about this future world!
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Can't give a review of this dvd as it would not play on my equipment, can't say if I could recommend it or not
B005K17RU0|1.0|Cannot find what I want.  Hard to navigate, and find anything.  A great app was ruined by the update.  Have to find a new weather App. Would not recommend.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works that's just about the only thing I could really say. It does just what it says. I have had<br />No issue with this app.  If you need a good junk removal app. This is' it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love the challenges, the colors, hours of fun. I have completed all the levels and look forward to the next one.
B00F91H666|5.0|Great Zombie flick, but wish there was a little more gore and some slow motion of for action scenes. Sometimes  you could not get a good view of the zombies
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Other than having difficult time get the movie set for English language, this is a quality dvd and a top notch movie.
6305622914|5.0|The Full Monty may be an old movie but it is such a classic has funny moments an human moments. I recommend this movie for the older adults anyone that has ever lost a job or been laid off can relate.
1781162646|4.0|Steven King writes his books mainly very through and wordy this book to on the whole to the point and it keeps your interest without running all over the place.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|This game is fun. The graphics are good.<br />The navigation is simple. Just tap in the direction you want to go.<br />This game is nothing like angry birds. You are a thief, who must<br />find a main item on each level, amongst a few others for bonus points.<br />I like the game because it is a simple concept. I would recommend it.
B00742GBDM|5.0|Wonderful and beautiful. Great Jane Austin story. Beautiful.costumes and sets. Well paced and great dialogue. Must see- feel good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing Candy Crush on my husband's iPad and he can finally have it back lol.  This game is very addicting and there's no way to get bored.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|replaced the battery seems to be working fine and was reasonably priced. a great deal and shipping was fast. The total price of 5 was probably less than I would have paid for one.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Not my fave movie. Very slow. I kind of wish I hadn't watched it. Not Mathew McConaughey's best role pick.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book finally provides closure to The Shining.  Haven't you ever wondered what happened to little Danny Torrance after that nughtmare winter ended?  Great story telling, well developed new characters. Plenty of 'good' people to combat/balance the evil, and as in real life, there's still a little evil inside of all of us.  Didnt want it to end and at the same time, couldnt put it down.  Well done Mr King.  If you have only seen the MOVIE The Shining and havent read the book, i would highly recommend you read it first.  The book captures and explores more deeply the love that Danny has for his alcoholic DAD and the book also ends very differently with Mr Hollaran (Scatman Curuthers) surviving instead of being murdered by MR Torrance.
B001EN71DG|5.0|The original versions are only in the Trilogy DVD set with the blue and black cardboard cover and Luke and Vader at the duel on Cloud City on the front. Each film comes with 2 discs, the first containing the 2004 re-mastered version in 5.1 and the bonus disc contains the original theatrical versions of the films in 2.0 stereo. This is pretty much the only set with the original un-altered versions of the films unless you still have a VHS or Laserdisc copy. Some have complained that the films look terrible on an HDTV but if you have the widescreen version and a newer Blu-ray player to watch them on they look pretty good in my opinion. Plus you cant really complain about the look of the original 1977, 1980, and 1983 versions since you cant find them anywhere else on DVD and Lucas has already stated that he will not release them again. The only thing that bothers me is the 2.0 stereo but I decided to watch the films with a stereo gaming headset instead of my surround and it worked out great. This set is rare and hard to find, ive had mine since it released in 08 and have not seen many others. If you are looking for the original versions of Star Wars then make sure you get the set with the cover I described at the top.
B009DB60W4|5.0|Since putting this CD in the player in my car, I've taken it out for a total of maybe 4 days. I put it in in mid-August, and I listen to my CD player virtually every day.<br /><br />I kept expecting to burn myself out on it, but every time I listen, I hear something new in one of the arrangements that I didn't catch before. The songs start with terrific melodies and beautiful sounding lyrics (not that I have any idea what they mean) and then add so many deep and textured layers that I just don't seem to get tired of any of them. From the concept of the album, I expected it to be an intriguing oddity, most likely a weird blend of styles and a \\"filler\\" album in Therion's discography. Instead, it's just completely mesmerized me. The vocals are stunning, the drums are tight and bursting with great fills, the bass is fantastic and the guitar work is blistering without ever overwhelming the songwriting, which is superb. Finally, the interplay of the symphonic and metal components may be the most seamless on any of the Therion albums I own (7 or 8, I think).<br /><br />Fantastic, and well worth listening to over and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game. Worth a free download but you will be tempted to buy advantages in the app. Try to avoid that urge and just enjoy the unique challenges of this game in moderation.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times already. I have even loaned it out. I usually don't buy movies, but I enjoyed this movie so much I had to.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|simply delicious, creepy, delightful work. never read the shining but enjoyed this nonetheless. the characters are complex and well developed, the story line rocks!
079073639X|4.0|I liked this movie not because it had Dustin Hoffman and Peter Coyote in it; but because it's different. It isn't your usual sci-fi adventure, but it also has suspense; and a tad bit of horror added to it.The only problem I have with this song is it's just a little long, it's over 2 hrs 15 minutes, a little long for a sci-fi thriller. Even if your not a sci-fi freak, you will still like this movie because it does have the suspense and a little bit of comedy added to it. So enjoy :)!<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L CocKayne
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Why, why do we have to purchase our games? Why not just charge once for the app and let us play unlimited.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't see it coming, but then again I did. I usually don't read new author, because I get addicted. This book is GOOD.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I recently installed McAfee on my Kindle Fire because a Tech recommended it. My computer which also has McAfee, was running slow and a tech advised me that if my Kindle and my computer were using the same WiFi connection, it would help the computer's performance by preventing intrusions through the kindle. So far, it is working for me and my computer is back to normal performance.
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|First off, I like much of the music although it is still very \\"fluffy\\". There are a few songs that I really like, but I cringe at some of the lyrics on this. If any other songwriter released some of these lyrics, they would be blasted.. I personally think people around Sir Paul are afraid to say anything to criticize him. Come on, Paul is a master who can take a comment if it will make his songs better! The man can come up with music and melodies all day... the kind that stay with you all day.. the kind you hum to yourself, you go to sleep hearing in your head and wake up to.. My personal choice of poor lyrics is his song about going to work on a bus.. UGH! \\"On My Way To Work\\" -- YIKES!!  But the wonderful thing about this album is that you have a monster song like SAVE US! I'm not saying to avoid this CD, but my honest opinion is that lyrically it is not close to some of the other songs Paul has written. But the music and melodies are top notch.. As my New York friend recently told me, \\"Paul has released so much great music that anything now is just gravy\\"..... Of course, this will sell a gazillion copies because Paul's name is on it, so that is the reality.. Check out the samples... die hard fans will love it, but if you are looking for really mature lyrics, pass on it!
B002IDDRT8|4.0|We come from the land of ice and snow,from the midnight springs where the hot springs flow. Vikings, fiords  and aliens...that's all you need to know
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a book about racing & dogs. I won't give it away, but it is a great read. I really enjoyed how it turned out. If you are a dog lover read this book. You don't have to love racing to enjoy the book.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Wow !  A really awesome show with a spectacular set list.  Watching the DVD is  like unlocking a time capsule from a bygone era.  Fresh back from the Europe in 72 tour the band is in fine form playing in this groovy setting  conjuring up the old hippie vibe of the sixties.
B008469DGY|4.0|Definitely keeps the mind occupied.  Take a while to learn how to control the ball.  Requires a bit of luck too.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|great app very funny, but need more levels, and updates, my kids are very pleased with they, i hope a Tiny Thief II App
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is similar to 50 Shades in many ways. Don't get caught up in the similarities, just read the book & enjoy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Even though we have access to the world, virally, it is  also nice to see what we as humans can share around the world. We can show ideas and share practical solutions that some of us cannot invision. We can reach out and make our own lives and experiences richer and more stress free through ideas and trial and errors and not be alone in our accomplishments,because someone else has already done the same thing. Pintrest allows us to communicate with each other,on a worldwide scale  in non-threating ways.
0741470314|5.0|As I read the book a few month ago, tears ran down my cheeks, because I saw, that the author Karen Moriarty was fighting like a lioness for Michael and his legacy.<br /><br />It is a great book, worth to read not only for Michael Jackson Fans. The reader gets a big picture about Michael Jackson as a human, not only the great Superstar Michael Jackson, but rather a humble and gentle man, who loves his children and adores them much.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all, who are interested in the truth of a man, who was misunderstood and misinterpreted for his whole life  from the tabloids and many others.
6302725534|4.0|For my granddaughter to give as a gift--a little pricey for her budget.  S&H can make buying difficult but she thought it was the perfect gift so decided to pay the price
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I fought the hype for a long time. I am sorry I did. It was a great read. Enjoyable. Kind of scary, too. If you like to read-read these books.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Love this game best game I have ever played even better than<br />Minecraft love the realistic sound hope you make a new version put more updates
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Like all the Bootleg Series it takes you back in time to relive those Years we cannot get back, The quality is superb with the Deluxe Box Set you also get the 'Isle Of White concert' the Audio sound is the best I have heard from this concert. It comes with two Books with pictures we have'nt seen before. One Book is titled 'Time Passes Slowly' Bob sings, 'Time is a jet plane it moves to fast' maybe they should have used that line as the tital. Well worth the money.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I had trouble logging in many times, but I thought it was the site at the time. Now I see it was just this app. The real problem is that I saw tweets purportedly from me pop up before my eyes, with a link to a weight loss product. I read the reviews here, and there is another person who had the same experience. This isn't acceptable to me.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game. its very addictive but I wish it was easier to get acorns. like instead of using real money we could use coins or something. but otherwise its a great game.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|While The Prize is, at times, painfully long and detailed, it is nonetheless an extraordinary read. In terms of understanding the history and importance of oil this book has become the standard.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is a great app, it connected right up to my pc and I can control it from my kindle with no problems and only a few minor limitations like going full screen. A definite 10
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game soooooo much!!!!!!! It is so fun and so well made and just amazing. Please Please PLEASE get it!!!!<br />#awesome #iluvCandyCrush!!!
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This autobiography is also great for looking into the world of the Pashtun. It also brings to show the various obstacles that are in place for non-neo-muslims in Swat and Peshawar.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File is great! It helps keep all my documents organized in My Kindle so that I can easily locate them. I highly recommend this application for document management. Excellent!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I easily learned how to navigate it and post to it. It links to other apps easily as well. I have spent hours on here going from one post to another!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I finished the first book two days ago. It has been ages since a book has captured my attention. I finished this book in less than twenty four hours. It was wonderful. I am looking forward to the next novel.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|We are studying the Book of Matthew in our bible study and are reading Zealot concurrently.  It is truly an amazing  historical perspective of the events taking place in the late BCE and early CE.  We are comparing the two biblical records to strengthen our faith and learn more about the events leading up to the life and times of Jesus.
0880796863|2.0|I was really excited to receive this deck, but as some other reviewers mentioned the colors are not that great. Everything is fairly gold / orange hued and the lines are thick. I felt it was difficult to see the tiny details in the imagery and the colors blended together too much for me. I purchased a guide to help me understand the cards, and it uses the Universal deck as reference. I am loving the imagery in those cards much more. The colors are bright, the lines are cleaner, and i feel like every detail is much easier to read. I will be returning and getting the Universal Waite deck instead.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|This is such a bad remake of a barely watchable original. This was so bad we couldn't even finish watching. I think we lasted about 45 minutes before I just couldn't take it anymore.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|This CD is a bit all over the place. Sweet Nothings is what drew me in but the entire CD is worth a listen.
B008M721MS|3.0|My Kindle Fire HD 8.9 came preloaded with Skype which worked fine. Took awhile to figure it all out, but then it was fine. When I sign in with the Skype ID I use on my PC, and it worked fine. In fact, I really liked the camera function because it was better than the Kindle one.  Both the video &amp; camera had nice zoom and brightness controls. BUT now with the new update, I don't even see the &quot;take a picture&quot; option any more and the video messaging doesn't have all those controls any more.  On the UPSIDE, the video when you are chatting with someone is a lot clearer and sharper.  Hope they add back the camera function.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I can't stop playing it it's so fun. Every single day I play it is so fun you should buy it it's worth $6.99. If you buy it you will love it so buy it. It is the best.
B002O2THRO|2.0|but this movie was so incredibly dull. It was very slow, very overacted and I couldn't wait till it was over. I did stick with it to the end, but it was not easy. The part I liked best was seeing the guy from the Walking Dead.
1476727651|1.0|Over the past ten years, I've become more and more disillusioned with King's output - it seemed like everything good he had, he put into the Dark Tower series. Along comes the belated sequel the The Shining (one of the biggest horror novels of the late 20th century) - but something's missing. Like most of King's books, it's eminently *readable*, but there's just nothing here that's interesting, or involving or moving. King writes what he knows (once again) - what it's like to be an alcoholic/ recovering aloholic writer - but there's nothing new or captivating about the story or the characters (his lead bad guy/girl is particularly bland.) I can remember reading books like Four Past Midnight over the course of one day as a teenager - this much shorter novel took me a week to plow through. Maybe King will return to his former fun if not terribly serious books, but Dr Sleep is just not indicative of what he's capable of when he's at the height of his powers.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is great! gives me everything I need in a very understandable format. a lot of apps are very confusing. but this app is great for the average American.
1250038820|5.0|I am a long time follower, LOVER of Hony and all that Brandon stands for. My book arrived and I immediately leafed through it - I had to stop because I knew that would never do it justice - you need to relax in your comfy chair and read and study each and every thing - the pics, the captions and even the \\"lack\\" of captions as one person commented - study the pics people, that is the real point here! I think this book and it's layout is genius - Brandon started on a journey that seemed to be leading nowhere and in fact as you will find out in this book has lead somewhere inspiring and wonderful. This will be my \\"go to\\" gift book until his next addition is published! Keep it up Brandon...you are a very special man - we are all proud to be a witness to your work!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I just started watching this show using my Amazon Prime benefits. I've never watched it before and I'm really enjoying it. It has some similarities to other legal dramas, but this one has some interesting cases and of course the added drama of her life with her cheat husband. I've started season 2 and I'm still liking it!
B000W1V5VU|5.0|The movie was everything that I expected it to be! Danny Ocean and his crew picked up right where they left off and All Pacino did not disappoint, he just stayed in the tanning bed too long lol
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|It's easy to see why this volume was not immediately translated into English.  The back story about Harry Hole was easily incorporated into subsequent novels without this forgettable story.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This was a wonderful family movie. Not only did my 4 year old enjoy it I enjoyed it as well. This is a perfect family night movie.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Once I saw that the guys neck snaps (with a gross sound effect to go with) when he crashes this app got deleted. Our kids are 4 and 8 this is not the type of game I want them playing.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is an amazing movie !!<br />This is one of those movies you want to watch more than once.<br />Another great movie with Jodie Foster!
B00CL151G4|4.0|love  this show and the actors - their interaction on the show is great.  hope its on for a long time!  when I watch again, I catch a lot of things I missed the first time.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an amazing app i love it it is so much fun everybody should buy it there many kinds of guns and there model is amazing they put a lot of time into this app and it deffinetly paid off
B009P5S11G|5.0|I pre-ordered this cd beause I'm a huge Rihanna fan. The product came on time and is in great condition. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Be prepared to do a lot of skimming, because &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; takes a long time to settle into the story. Much too much background on the three somewhat stereotypical and uninteresting wives who form the focus of the book. And the &#34;secret?&#34; It hit me right between the eyes long before it was revealed. I found myself glancing down at the lower right-hand corner of my Kindle, looking to see how much of the book I had left to plow through. The writing style itself was a bit too chatty and &#34;oh my-ish,&#34; kind of like an Australian imitation of Maeve Binchy, done poorly. After reading this, I have no desire to read any other of Liane Moriarty's books. If you're looking for a beach read that won't take up too much brain energy, try it. This was a book club pick, and when we met, none of us had much to say about it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is like so real and i like how you can customize your own gun and how you can get coins easily its fun
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I wanted to turn it off after first 10 minutes, but, however, decided to see if there was any bigger idea other than grotesque fight between over-inflated dollar-store robot and monster action figures. Unfortunately there was none, so I was left with nothing, but regret, disappointment and the only question in my mind: \\"Why did I watch this someone's dark, violent and stupid nightmare?\\".
B004MPESSY|4.0|If you want to be gross out that you can't even keep lookinf at the screen then this movie is for you. The last time that I close my eye watching a movie was when I saw (Zombie) back in 1990. That is how great this movie is in getting to you that you can't even watch what is happening because is so horrible & gross.
B007EE564U|5.0|A strong storyline that some other writers in the genre should take note. Obviously he knows his subject and procedures.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|I played it on Nintendo and later on the PC.  Eventually I realized that I had an addiction to it (many many  MANY sleepless nights and Zombie workdays later) so I swore off this type of role playing game since then.<br /><br />Unfortunately (for me), now  I've found it in a tablet form.  Good thing for those Zombie workdays that I'm retired from the workforce for now, because the all-nighters are back--I can't seem to get up enough willpower to close my tablet.  I'm obsessed AGAIN, all these years later.<br /><br />Great visual on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  The same music and sound effects that I remember from all those years ago. Handling controls are a little weird, they take some practice.  I wish it showed the enemy status info like the old games did so that you would know how close you are to defeating the foe.  It would make it easier to decide between attacking the foe, running away,  or increasing your life force before you get killed.  I also wish that it had more than three saved game slots.  But overall, I love it.  WAY too much.  PLEASE NOTE that if you've never played any of the FF games before, you'll likely be frustrated for a while until you get the hang of it--as there are no instructions in the beginning.  Stay with it through trial and error and you'll figure things out.<br /><br />It's a lot to pay for an app game, but knowing the hours of enjoyment that I'll get from it, it's more than worth it for me.  I remember dishing out big bucks for the old games.  This is a long playing game, and it will take the same hours and hours to complete--so the higher price is well justified.  This is a game that you will enjoy repeating, as there are so many treasures and side quests that you may have missed when you previously played.  I hope the developer makes more of these FF games available for tablets, just in case I remain retired.....
B0055S348W|5.0|Printer is very Easy to use and so needed for my cell phone and tablet.  Thank you for a great product and for making it happen.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana Del Rey kills it with this album, all if it is very good and tasteful, especially cola. Cola is a very tasteful song, possibly the most tasteful song in the world.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|A historically correct movie about the holocaust in WW II.  It showed the calousness of some members of the Nazi party in Germany, and at the same time showed there were many others who cared about the Jewish community.  It showed the great courage of Schindler to the point of endangering his own life.  It brought out that standing up to tyranny can make a difference.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There weren't enough stars.......love, love, loved Downton Abbey.  I'd give it 10 or 20 stars.  It kept me captivated for hours and hours.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Watch it with my kid. Although I have seen it a couple of times before, I totally liked it and my kid enjoyed it.
B00CS65QGW|4.0|I really liked this song at first, but the second time I heard it I didn't so much care for it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Everything you could want I'm an alarm clock... need I say more? All of the features work brilliantly along with the set up. Some of the additional features force you to artificially rate it but other than that it is great.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|I love this song! It makes u want to get up and dance! I highly recommend this song for purchase.
B002SS8S7E|3.0|Good production but lacks the comic books feeling. Is too serious and complicated. Not to mention the length of it.
B00BATKPBE|5.0|If you're not a Dawkins fan you obviously haven't read The Selfish Gene, the book that let non biologists understand Darwin and his dangerous implications to the world's ignorant. This is a delightful autobiography that takes us to that book's initial publication.  Our breaths are held for #2. Anybody who can invent a word such as &#34;meme&#34;  that goes memetically viral is worthy of a wide audience.
B0058W74UY|1.0|All I really wanted was a flash player and I got a lousy unreadable browser that I didn't need and no tutorial. I still can't open and watch film clips on my Kindle!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|This book was just okay in my opinion. It was little boring, as I kept waiting for something scandalous to happen to her, but it never did.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|It was so different from the original in the beginning that I almost didn't stay with it.  The acting was excellent but there was too much Toby Maguire and not enough Leonardo Dicaprio for me.  The ending was surprising and I hope we are to think that it was actually F. Scott Fitzgerald who was the neighbor and changed his name or used it as his pen name.  Otherwise, why would two people write this story?  Maybe I missed something important so don't go entirely by my take on this one.
0142501123|5.0|This is a wonderful story for Halloween or any time. It teaches about friendship and helping others. It's not too scary for the little ones. Look for the DVD, too. It adds a lot and is beautifully done.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|The battery is slim and holds a great charge. I took it up to the mountain with me and the cold really didn't have any effect on the performance. Its about the same size as my HTC one as well and works charges while on the phone. Its a good buy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a great read.  It makes you think about how things are always how they appear and that you don't always know the whole truth.  It was a very easy read and at sometimes a little predictable, but very enjoyable!
6305428042|5.0|I'm so glad to now own this movie! It's a childhood favorite and I can't wait to introduce it to my own children.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|I wasn't sure about getting this, but we enjoyed it very much. The story was told well and the characters were likable. There may be too much skin for some viewers.
B003JUGQ38|3.0|David Tenant plays an acceptable Doctor, but not the best. His previous companions were much more interesting than the Donna Noble character who I find to be annoying.
B002G917ZK|5.0|Dear Amazon,<br />  KUDO'S IN GIVING US A WONDERFUL AFTERNOON IN OUR COMMUNITY'S CLUBHOUSE BY WATCHING BREAKFAST AT tiffany's IN OUR AUDITORIUM. IT ALLOWED US TO SPEND A VERY RELAXING & PEACEFUL TIME WATCHING THE MOVIE WITH OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS  INSTEAD OF HAVING TO DRIVE TO A MOVIE THEATER OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. THANKS AGAIN AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK<br />RESPECTFULLY,<br />  ANA MARIA 10-17-2013
0525478817|5.0|Though many parts of the book were unrealistic it still was enjoyable. The teens in the book seemed extremely intellectual and spoke like poets. Being a teenager myself I really liked the intellectual words; many of which could cut deep depending on the person reading it. All in all the book is quite good if you are looking for a story about 2 teens which find happiness although they are struggling with physical illnesses.
141694737X|5.0|This little book is very short and simple. There's really not a whole lot of story going on. BUT with just a touch of dramatic reading and motions, it became my granddaughter's favorite for naptime. It has taken on a life of it's own, including a camel song that goes with our search for camels in the animal cracker bag! Get this book and ENJOY it.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I really enjoy this game, most definitely the best game I have played on my kindle. Worth every cent I spent, the gameplay is smooth and the story seems extensive. I have lost so many crew members. I loved them all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm finally able to play now that this game is available on the Kindle......and I can't stop!  I'm truly addicted!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't want the trilogy to end! Can't wait to see what's next!! Make sure you read these prior to seeing the movie when it becomes available.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I can't believe that this book was a number one best seller. I found it to be slow and predictable.
B000QQFKYE|3.0|Sometimes we enjoy David Lynch other times it's a WTF kind of experience.  This was one of those events.  Laura Dern must have been exhausted after filming this montage of images and situations. We sure were exhausted after viewing it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It only has 1 season.. Scumbag Fox..Feels like we get 100 seasons of Hell's Kitchen, but a horribly mismanaged airing schedule for one of the best space dramas ever made. AND ONLY 1 GORRAM SEASON!<br /><br />Luckily the bluray set does what overpaid and obviously incompetent people at fox couldn't do, play the episodes in the proper viewing order. Maybe I'm crazy, but airing a show in order makes sense to me.<br /><br />This show could have been a 10 season 200+ episode giant, if not for Fox.<br /><br />Bring Firefly back! But in the meantime, enjoy this fantastic bit of television.<br /><br />Take my love, take my land, do things that I cannot stand! Burn the man, that did this to me, you can't take the blu ray from me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and I love it.you can sit for literally hours playing it. It is most entertaining to try beating your friends scores on Facebook.
2253150711|4.0|had to buy this book for a college lit course but was surprised to find that it was actually quite entertaining
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Very good movie. If you liked the 1st of the reboot of the series, then I would recommend this for you. Fans of the original may go either way, some make like the references to the original movies, others may hate it. As far as a fun movie to watch, with a good story line and great effects, this is one to own. More fun to watch if you have a home theater set up.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Love this movie. It's a great flick for kids or adults. Though it did make me want to get up off the couch and exercise.
B004G606K8|2.0|This was like Lord of the rings written by a 15 year old. It felt like 600 pages of story were jammed into 450.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|A truly very bad movie as it lacks humor, a plot, acting, or any sort of credibility. To this, if you add the grotesque and the vulgarity associated with it, you end up asking yourself how such a trash was able to be created in the first place.
B00D7OMNXS|3.0|Ironman 3 just isn't Ironmany enough. I understand its suppose to be more about tony stark, but it is called Ironman. For what they were trying to do, its probably about as good as it was going to get with the concept they wanted to do. I know what i was buying from seeing it in theater, just wanted to complete my collection from the others. If you have the other two movies you might as well get it. If not just rent it, its worth seeing for $1.20 or so from Red Box.
B00CE2G3AS|4.0|Good story line.  Good acting.  Great music.  Fun to watch movie.  May not be the best, but it will keep your interest while you tap your toes.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Didn't think I'd ever enjoy such smut. Great fantasy play out. Will definitely continue reading the next 2 books. Story was well written.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooo fun and entertaining. I hope they make another one just like this one. This game is really awesome.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played.  My favourite feature were the new upgrades from bloons td 4. If you r reading this get that game!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It it only chdhcbdddhfvdhd etc eh  end disc sketchbook all afflicted sjfkdjakflssjflajd downloads so speechless it's amazing (: and addicting last last all is
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that you can play with your Facebook friends but I don't like you need lives lol omg fyi bye
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great sequel to a great book. Easily will be seen as one of his best efforts. I re-read The Shining before reading Dr Sleep. I was very glad I did. I would reccomend this if you're not up on your Shining facts. Some things would not have connected for me if I had not. After all- how long ago was that written????
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I received this about 5 days ago and have been using it daily on the PS3. The package was easy to open. Included the controller, a USB RF Transmitter/Receiver with mini-USB 2 Port on the front of it that has a red light on whenever the system is on, mini-USB 2 cable to connect to the controller and dongle for charging and wired game play while charging.<br /> This Controller is slightly more heavy than a standard controller. It has been randomly dropping connection while I play games, which has been very frustrating, and reconnects with a press of the center button. The lights are bright red on the buttons, and they can be turned off. The L and R triggers are very stiff and curved to keep your fingers on them. Where your hands rest there's a kind of rubber texture that feels quite odd to me, I really don't care for it. The sticks and D pad are about the same tension as a Standard PS3 Controller. The select and start buttons are slightly smaller than standard.<br /> I really would not recommend this controller for anyone playing games requiring fast twitch like reflexes. For games like Civilization Revolution though I think it would be fine. The box 360 Stick Layout and Wireless capability are the reason why I bought this, though since it disconnects so often I doubt I will be using it very much which is unfortunate. Good Idea with Flawed Execution on this one.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|What am I saying &#34;classic&#34; its only 2003, Amazing movie I can watch over and over again. Never gets old.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|This app is amazing. I love making my own posters, choosing the backgrounds, changing the colours, and much more. I would totally recommend this app. Two words GET IT!#
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|As shocking and scary as the original. Great casting. The actors don't fade into the scenery and modern special effects.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun keeps you thinking.  hours of fun to play  with your kids<br />Can not wait to play other games
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|I played this app and its sometimes fun but it's kind of boring<br />.like you can't really find people to shoot down.I recommend the game<br />MC4 though.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|This is the one book of fitness I refer to often. I have re-read several chapters over the past months, especially how to exercise with proper form and technique. I don't follow the guidelines of this book to the letter and I don't think it covers 100% of everything you need to know. It does give the right guidance to find an exercise and diet regime that works for you effectively. From the numerous books, websites and blogs I've read in the past 8 years this one stands out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great brain game that requires a mix of seek-and-find and logic puzzles. Challenging and addictive FUN for many ages. GIVE it a try.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this game is amazing it should be worth $10 it is awsone but hurry up with the update so come on and join the pork side
B000PAAH3K|2.0|I'm just not that smart. My brain doesn't analyze things this deeply. I couldn't wrap it around all these concepts
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Typical match 3 game except for the part where you run out of lives and then you're supposed to start nagging your facebook friends for more. I don't DO facebook so I just X out until more lives come my way.<br />It's somewhat challenging once you get to the higher levels but a match 3  none-the-less.....so if you enjoy those, it's a decent game. And it was FREE! (Probably to try to suck you into joining Facebook LOL).<br />Happy Gaming!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Impeccable acting and a very intriguing story makes top notch entertainment. Ian Richardson's performance is sublime. He is a Shakespearean actor in a contemporary role which is interesting in itself. It is a shame that Richardson was never broadly available in quality movies; he was primarily a stage actor. His voice and expressions are so compelling; I would listen to him read the phone book.<br /><br />The episodes are easy to watch back to back as one is hooked into the story and can't wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Ian Richardson is supported by a large, very talented group of actors in conveying this story.I thoroughly enjoyed them all.
B005544V6A|5.0|It is an amazing show and I finished season 2 and loved that as well! Can't wait to start season three.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Well written as usual. I have been reading this author for a long time and he never fails. I also like the issues that he brings to awareness.
B008JFUR10|5.0|What an achievement!!! Pacific Rim is a true work of art. Guillermo del Toro infused this movie with his childhood love of monsters and robots and it is something to behold. Every inch of this film owes its genius to him.  And what a genius he is.  To see it in 3D was a very special treat.  Beautiful and scary and gorgeous and frightening and exquisitely choreographed.  Nothing was left to chance.  Every frame of this movie shows this director at the top of his game. Yes, yes it is safe to say it is not for everyone. I, however,  consider myself fortunate that I decided to buy this movie. It is a unique and one of a  kind blockbuster ...a true original!!! The special features Blu-Ray was also exquisitely rendered.  A must see, actually. I did not get hung up on the plot or the depth of the story. It was perfect for what it was and what he was so eloquently trying to do with this film.  I loved it.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|I love Will Smith, but I found that the strange accent made it difficult to understand the dialogue of father and son.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|In the beginning it was boring and then Was good on the end just needed more action otherwise was a good movie  I enjoyed it
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This game may lack graphics but is light years beyond other ios/droid  games in terms of gameplay and value .<br /><br />Pro's<br />Excellent gameplay<br />Good music but is just as fun without it<br />Being able to manage multiple tasks is fun<br /><br />Con's<br />Everyone is on this retro graphics thing, my only complaint is they could make the graphics worlds better ,though this does not detract from the gameplay or beauty of this game in any way.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Reading this book was a real education for me.  The stories told by Barbara Demick were done in a readable and respectful way, albeit unfathomable. I had no idea how desperate the situation was in North Korea.  What a travesty.<br /><br />A lot has happened since the completion of this book in 2010 and I hope Barbara Demick will continue to report on North Korea under the latest regime, the &#34;cypher&#34; Kim Jong-un.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Oh wow,I didn't predict the ending.  Makes one wonder what would one do under the same circumstances. One to read for sure!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm in love with this game and I'm happy  it was on Amazon yay!!!! It's doesn't freeze or stick its absolutely perfect
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great way to pass the time. highly recommended. if you are looking for games similar. to bejewelled and that type of game but with a twist the is your game.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Don't waste your money, any episode of the walking dead beats the pants off this movie. The movie has no real plot. No character development. Just some ex UN investigator helping solve a zombie crisis, the problem is the zombies are more realistic than Pitt as the crisis solver.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a great way to show how life at that time was not always easy and how family over comes hard times.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I too was very excited to see Amazon now has Candy Crush.  I was unable to purchase boosters with the version I was running - but now that Amazon has included Candy Crush as an app on their site - it's wonderful.  Thanks so much.  Love the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love candy crush and it is a very addictive game. I sit back to relax and play this game for hours.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If your a Stephen King fan, and have read his book The Shining, you will enjoy this read. At the time the book was going to be released, I had no idea it was a sequel, but it is. You find out what happens to Danny (Doc) Torrence after the Overlook Hotel. I think it is up there with some of his best work. I am glad that he (SK) went back to let us know what happened to Danny and his mother. I would highly recommend anyone who like  The Shinning to read this one....it is a &#34;page turner&#34;!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best  game ever it is really amazing and it is really easy to play. You get a life every half hour. The only problem is that when you are at 117 it's not a easy  one to get past.
B00ADMYN9E|4.0|Well written and informative. Gives a clear description of events not only about Roswell but also on how the intelligent networks and governments work. Highly recommended.
B004X75RK4|5.0|If you love a good Romantic Comedy that includes Ryan Reynolds or Sandra Bullock than this movie is for you! It is a little predictable, but the best ones are. It's cute and fun and you'll love the journey that they take together through this movie. It definitely made me laugh for most of the movie. They should make a sequel...
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing book. Read all three. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Learned a lot, enjoyed every page. Could not put it down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this it's fun and it's very addictive one of the best games I have played I keep trying to get my husband to play it as will
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME. JUST WISH IT WOULD GIVE YOU FREE BOMBS AND THINGS IF YOU GET 3 STARS ON A LEVEL.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I choose a lot of my movie choices by the actors that are in it and this was no exception. I have seen at least one great movie with these actors in it, and the premise looked interesting to say the least. I was actually intrigued throughout the whole movie and totally surprised by the ending! I thought about watching this movie again now that I know the ending but I haven't quite got around to it yet. I'm sure I'll watch it again before too long, but it was definitely worth the first watching!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, addictive, fun, and did I mention fun. I can't put this game down. Ive played bejeweled and jewels but they are not even close to the enjoyment you will get from this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much!!!!!!!!<br />I gave catching Fire a five star rating because I liked the action mixed with romance, death, danger, and surprises.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book is very helpful because it always has the words I want to no I love it you should try it
081099741X|5.0|Matt Zoller Seitz is an excellent critic, having established himself over a long career, and etching out a space in the online world of film and TV criticism uniquely his own. An admirer of filmmaking that's unafraid of revelling in the beauty of the craft itself, Seitz champions those films and filmmakers that so many modern critics will readily dismiss for showing hints of \\"artifice.\\"<br /><br />Few modern directors so embody to idea of intentional artifice as Wes Anderson. Opinions about his work are all over the map, but almost always strong. His films inspire scorn as well as reverence. He's an auteur in every sense of the word, and his films, from Bottle Rocket through to Moonrise Kingdom display a remarkable confidence of craft, tone, style and distinct personality. There are no films quite like Wes Anderson's, no matter how many indie filmmakers attempt to emulate him.<br /><br />In this absolutely incredible book, Matt Zoller Seitz sits for a series of interviews with Wes Anderson, discussing each film in his body of work, running through his development as a filmmaker, his influences, his techniques and his general philosophies on film and filmmaking. Comprehensive is perhaps the best word to describe The Wes Anderson Collection, but this book is more than that. Designed with as much thought and care as any of Anderson's own films, Seitz's book features big, beautiful pages chock full of accompanying stills, media and supplemental material about each film and often corresponding to the interview at hand. Reading the book is such a pleasure. It makes you want to revisit each and every Anderson film, but also explore all the other films and influences discussed. It immerses the reader in Anderson's world, and provided that's something the reader would enjoy it's a could not be more engaging.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A exciting and suspencefil novel how two lives can follow so closely to each other. Hope there will be more  like it .
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it, love it, love it! Thank you Amazon! The absolute best match-3 game to date!  Just when you think you have mastered the game, the next level is tougher.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It's a good app for little baby if you want make him/her sleep. White noise is wonderful :) but I love this app also.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Best game for on the road or at home. The game is free and graphics are great so get the game before you have to pay money for it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King brings nice closure to characters introduced to me in his work The Shining. While I enjoyed reading this epilogue, I have to admit I felt like there were a number of extraneous characters that seemed to be importantly introduced and then went nowhere. Much of the suspense created in this story resolved somewhat poorly and, to be honest, without much excitement. The villains seemed to be not quite so evil, rather they felt more deserving of pity than of fear. Perhaps our real-life monsters that daily news uncovers are just more frightening than Stephen King can create these days.<br /><br />Still, I'm all for a happy ending and I'm pleased that little Danny Torrance found the peace he deserves.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve's personality flaws are revealed but so is his genius and perfectionism! Love him or hate him, it cannot be denied that he changed the world!
B003O97W5K|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 12 in the theatre and had trouble sleeping for weeks.  Our 12 year old was getting a little cocky about how movies don't scare her, take me to haunted houses, etc.  Soooo let's just say we did a little test.  We let her watch Poltergeist one morning to see if she could make it through the whole movie. She made it and said it was a little freaky but didn't know what all the fuss was about.  Fast forward to midnight....she wakes us up in tears...screaming she can't fall asleep because she is totally freaked out by the clown.  It's never fun to see your kids in pain but this was one life lesson she will benefit from in the long run.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|A great family movie with a great message.  We watched it with my 11 and 9 year old boys and they loved it.  Highly recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The graphics are wonderful and the game keeps you busy forever. One thing: the music needs some work. It is very crackly and annoying. The computer music is so much better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that Candy crush saga is finally on Kindle fire. I have waited several weeks & now  I can play it on my Kindle fire as well as on my personal computer. This is an awesome game  and I will tell my friends & family about this wonderful game Thank you Amazon.com!
0061992860|5.0|This guide seems to have it all!  Author Wiseman knows what he's talking about, and even though the text is pretty small, it's a great read.  It is full of pictures and illustrations that are easy to follow and understand.  It's put together very well.  I fully recommend it.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|watch this movie if you like power rangers, this movie is really fun and full of action, actors were lame, but action and story make this movie pretty epic, i hope there is a sequel!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is the best game ever if you don't have it you need to get is seriously. it has the best grafics ever
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I loved this game. I was addicted. But after two weeks it got old. But my 5 younger siblings loved it I've had if for a year and they still ask to play it. I'm 12 and I suggest it for people with children under 13. It's realy fun and easy for kids.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book provided a range of emotions.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading, but was immediately drawn in to the story line and could feel the emotions of the characters as well.  From laughs to tears, the story pulls you right in.
B009LREA1S|1.0|FOUR YEARS AND THIS WAS NOLAN'S FINALE?!?!? Tim Burton plus Frank Miller equals epic batman movies.  I feel like Nolan didnt even try to do better than Dark Knight.  The ONLY good scene was the 1st Bane v Batman fight, everything else is was a joke.  Watch the stock exchange hold up, when banes crew enters the stock exchange and shoot their machine guns they are just pointing fake guns and Nolan is setting off firecrackers whereever they point the gunsLOL....  so many plot holes, crappy acting, they made the cops helpless lol, this movie is a huge slap in the face, people who liked this movieblow my mind.... how can anyone like this movie?!?!  cops charging bad guys holding machine guns.... bane sounds like mr freeze!.... batman gets from hole in ground and travels to gotham from across the world in seconds.... i could go on and on.... very disappointed.
0385523912|4.0|Fascinating and astonishing that there are people living under the conditions described, and incredible that they could tolerate or actually support the regime that fails them so thoroughly. It's almost science fiction that humans on the planet right now can be starving and silent, afraid of a misery more profound than starvation if they speak out. What we Americans consider hard times would be a vast improvement for these people, who measure wealth in terms of whether one owns a ball point pen, or whether one's coat has a zipper.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think this game is very very fun because you can breed dragons and you can feed your dragons in to epic form.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I am not certain why people are giving this movie less than stellar reviews. It is a very engaging story and the actors, specifically Jaden did a good job in carrying the movie. There was a scene in the movie where the Mother called her son a \\"feeling\\" boy and it reminded me of the movie Equilibrium. The plot was very unique and original--in the sense that the aliens can neither hear nor see their prey but instead smells the fear from their bodies. I really wish people would give this movie a chance because it is a good solid post-apocalyptic movie. I did not see a lot of asian influences like in other future movies, well except for the chopsticks. Their building structures and ships reminded me more of what we would have evolved to if American Indians' numbers survived and in turn had a strong influence on our future civilization.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app. I just made this review to get more points so. But other than that it fun.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|First, the good side.  HOQ6 presents a LOT of hidden object puzzles, and a LOT of challenges.  The scenes are done extremely well, and are very detailed.  I liked that I could play the game in one of three manners -- with HO clues being given as words, silhouettes, or the actual objects.  I tend NOT to like the silhouettes, so it's nice that I can &#34;exclude&#34; that option.<br /><br />I only give the game 3 stars, however, for several reasons  Mostly, it's because I had a terrible time &#34;tapping&#34; on objects.  There were many, many objects that I tapped on 3, 4, or even 5 times, then gave up and asked for a &#34;Hint&#34; -- only to be told that was the right object, so I tried again until the tap succeeded.  (This is neither a hardware nor a user problem, as I play a lot of other HO games, and haven't had this problem.)<br /><br />Also -- and this is part of the challenge, so I have to say it's a personal preference -- the game only supplies 6 hidden objects at a time.  Even though there are many, many more in the scene, you cannot tap on them -- until they show up in the list.  I felt this to be very restrictive.  I like to be presented with more objects to find.<br /><br />Still, a pretty good game -- and if a player likes the overall format, it should provide lots of enjoyment.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|All your questions about The little boy in the shining are neatly wrapped up in this novel.  I couldn't put it down!  I finished it in a weekend. A truly enjoyable read! WOW
B00FOQRNLE|5.0|It's just not her fascinating journey in time and statistics which lead to great conclusions! Worth reading! Inspiring and Great!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is great....I'm so happy that its on kindle now...i was waiting for this app to be available for my kindle fire
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read this for my book group, would not have read it otherwise. I am glad I read it because I never quite knew how my in-laws felt when their healthy son suddenly got ill and they knew that all of their dreams for his future would not come true. This book has heart and makes you think about it long after you read it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a well paced, well written book that I found hard to put down. I finally gave in and got the audio book so I could continue the story while getting ready, cleaning, driving, etc!  In parts it is pretty graphic in description and language - so if those are upsetting to you, don't pick it up. Sometimes the main characters were hard to like, but you have to remember the tragedy they faced to keep it in perspective. A &#34;girl next door&#34; type would not  have been believable. Many stories, events, and memories intertwine to develop the tragedy of the Day family, and unfold into an unpredictable ending.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The quality of the digital copy  looks bad. I am not sure if i need better internet connection or is just the video. Next time i will buy a cd instead
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|very useful and conveniently available with kindle fire no need to look any further.really like the fact it comes with  larger keys
B007XNAOS0|5.0|The entire album is very good - good musical ideas, some cool guitar harmonies and his voice has grown on me.  Didn't like his voice much at first, but good melodies and I dig it now.  Good to work out to.  Solid album - GOOD GROOVES, GREAT SONGS!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is on of the best game. I am so happy it is on the kindle now. I play it on my computer and my phone.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Action, adventure, intrigue, love. This book has them all. It is a good read easy and light and kept my interest. It is i. My opinion for a younger set of readers but I finished it all the same.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|a hidden object game that you can play for days with several different games. love it way to go g5.
0307476073|5.0|Well written, engaging first-hand snapshot of joy and challenges of extended life on the trail.  Appreciated her honesty in sharing miscalculations and anxieties ... made sharing her celebrations that much richer
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|This is especially enjoyable on Kindle as you can highlight, save, and share key thoughts. This book was both encouraging and instructive and highly recommended for any person who works with people (everybody, in other words) and wants to get a point or lesson or sale or truth across. Communication is so much more than the verbal and non-verbal elements. It also includes the necessity for SUCCESsful stickiness.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a lively account of a little-known episode in recent American history and well-worth exploring via this valuable book.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Excellent read, short, fast paced, intelligent, thought provoking, morally ambivalent characters all in 330 pages. Great read for science fiction fans
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that I can sync with my game in progress through Facebook!<br />Looking forward to playing where ever my kindle goes.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan is a pure academic - there is no bias in this book - just information, and if you challenge it, just have your evidence.  He is a remarkable Professor.  I am reading No God But God - and he makes what could be dense reading enjoyable.  Marvelous author.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I just wish I can download the whole game instead of having to buy the whole game. It would be really great if I could download the whole game not just 2-3mins of game time. That frustrates me because I really enjoy playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|First day I got this game I was amazed at how it looked! It is the best game I have ever played for tablets.<br />I would recommend this game to all people at any age.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Enjoyed the creativity and pace of the story.  Can't wait to dive into the next volume!  Enjoying the series.  Thanks.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|An enjoyable read, kept me interested, this is my first of lee child's, so will be keen to read more!
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|The story is familiar:boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, girl doesn't immediately reciprocate, boy gets upset and cuts her off, girl misses boy, girl woes boy back with fabulous on-stage musical performance. It's not a new story, but the musical numbers are so well done as to make the movie enjoyable to watch. Or you can just fast-forward (scene select) to the musical parts. I do recommend watching all the way through at least once as there are some funny parts.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I don't  know if it is cheating, but I kept a pen and paper handy to write down clues.<br /><br />FUN but short (is free though). Looking forward to more levels.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a beautiful game with great details. Love the fact the game is free.  Keep these great games coming.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|i got this for a friend at work's daughter she loved it child's play fan and quite affordable great for any horror fan thumbs up
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|There are missing pages in the Kindle edition of this book which was quite disappointing.  I am finding that this is not uncommon in Kindle editions of books.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good. I didn't recognize any of the actors, but they all gave a believable performance. The zombies were given a little twist from the standard mindless stumble bums. The movie had its share of gore, but you believed and actually cared about the characters. There was no back story to explain the main character \\"Mister\\". Not sure why, but I wanted to know more about that guy. If you're a zombie fan, do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a really fun and good game.  I would totally recommened it to any one of any age.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I think this is  an very awesome app but it has mostly recent songs the should play the old one more too.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As a technology lover. This is right up my alley! I love the way I can sync all of my info.
B000T02NM4|5.0|This is a classic OMD album. I am so glad Amazon has this in stock. I highly recommend this album for lovers of 80's music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The only hard part is when you loose your hearts, you have to wait for a while unless you have a Facebook account the you can have your friends to send you more hearts.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What a great follow up to The Shining by Stephen King.  It was tough to put down as the story line draws you in toward the end.  Definitely a must read!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is another series and they loved it and they are witting for the forth season to come out then they will have them all till yet another one comes out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the pace and intrigue of this book. The book has complex characters and great tale. I found I couldn't put it down.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Typical Bridgette.  Still a mess and entertaining enough.  I was very heartbroken for her loss, hoping miraculously he would return years later saying it was all a mix up and he couldn't get back to her any sooner, but I was pleased enough at the end realizing she had to heal and move on.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This very addictive. My whole family enjoys playing this. I can tell you my grandson that's only 5 makes it look so easy.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Again got this as a gift for my wife and grandson. They are big fans and would recommend this to everyone.
B005ELZKWS|3.0|Nice cd but not as good as the first one. To me, Chickenfoot is what Van Halen should of become.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is an excellent  read.  A trip to the Middle East without leaving my home.  A moving depiction of life and death, family, and the difference between those that leave and those that stay.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|It was a lazy weekend when we decided to try out this series. What was supposed to be a let's-try-it-out episode turned out to be a marathon of finishing the entire 3 seasons in 2 days. The kids loved it from the very first episode. The script was great and a lot of funny one liners. The only drawback is that because we finished all up to the latest episode we can't wait for the new season...which I know will start in the next couple of days but still...can't wait for the new season!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Got this one for my wife and Grandson as they both really like the series. I know they would recommend this to everyone.
B001641ZFS|1.0|I suppose the shrill, thin sound of the violin I heard on the radio didn't help things out, but the hoe-down coarseness of the first movement sealed my antipathy towards this performance.  There was less poetry in this first movement than in an almost any other Mozart recording I've ever heard.  Things improved a bit in the slow movement, but my reaction was solidified by then.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Excellent app for Kindle. You can update the app from Kindle app store. Search for Facebook and then click on the update button. I have version 3.7 and the annoying update banner on the top of the feed page was removed. I have kindle fire hd.
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter loves this to play with her monster high dolls but i think it could be a little sturdier.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|awesome game fun to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! good game tho awesome. awesome. awesome. awesome. awesome. Kool Kool Kool Kool Kool Kool looking toward to play some more
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ive tried other games that were trying to be like candy crush but they cant compare to this one.  I was a little confused sometimes but I get it now!!!

B0046ECFRM|4.0|It rings true. And it rings in your heart. And you're happy for them. And happy to have found this book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Cute game. Need a way to accumulate acorns faster though. Other than that it's a good way to pass the time.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This is unlike any movie I've seen. I really liked it. It's very clever and I think it is a must watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm just thankful it is not available. Love the game.  I wish Amazon would get more of the most popular apps.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great show.  Didn't think I would like the story line, but boy was I wrong!  Can't wait for seasons 5 & 6 to go to $0.00 per show on Prime!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|After buying the Shredded Chef, I wanted to read more from Mike to increase the efficiencies from my workout and build muscle whilst still trying to lose some more weight.  This book was a great read from start to finish, methodically laid out and clearly articulating the goals, exercises and results you should expect.  As an added benefit it also puts to rest the issues / thoughts I had with relation to supplementation and what was actually real value for money.  And the story not only stops there, Mike also has a fantastic free website, podcast that will continue the journey and expand on your motivation to get the results you deserve.
159514188X|5.0|I could not stop reading this book once I started. It's really life changing and eye opening. Everyone should be required to read this book. You need to read it. trust me.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|...but trust Hosseine.  All the pieces come together in surprising ways.<br />It gave some interesting insights into the lives of Afgani expats.
1451696191|4.0|It was exactly as I hoped it would be.  My sister-in-law just loved the gift, so I'm happy about that.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|I was prepared for something pretty boring, given the reviews, but I really enjoyed this one.  Perhaps not as much as the first one, but still certainly good.
B009G41CG2|1.0|Google ad blocks screen.  Have to keep game to small to see. To enjoy the game one must be able to read the tiles.  Couldnt find a way to stop the ad.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|An amazing glimpse into what would be like to live in a totalitarian state where what the leader says overrides any objective &#34;truth&#34;.  Truly scarey!<br />And yet it reads like a page turner.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I couldn't quit reading until the  very end. I am 70 years old and I recommend this for everyone young and old.
0060555661|5.0|One of the Great investment books of time. A must read for all investors. You will learn how to invest.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Funny, flawed, likeable characters make this book a joy. An unconventional romance, I hurried back to it with anticipation. Highly recommended.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|Great story are the ones based on true stories!<br />I would watch it again. So good we bought the movie.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|No other book has ever made me cry as much as Malalas story has. What an amazing and remarkable young lady. I loved the history in the book of Pakistan. It covered topics dropped by the media and had you glued to the page until the very end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I live with the Crawleys and their staff at Downton in the same way I do the with the characters in a book I don't want to finish. Let Downton Abbey continue for many seasons!  Some thoughts on the characters from the vantage point of the beginning of season 3...I liked Mary and Matthew far more before they got married.  Now they seem shallower--she harder, he less intelligent.  That is disappointing; I hope their characters will become more mature and refined as their story unfolds.  For me now, the central love story belongs to stalwart  Anna and noble John Bates.  But how did such a man ever get entangled with a woman like Vera?! Shirley MacLaine is simply not believable as Cora's mother.  She great fun to watch, though!  Cora doesn't seem to retain a shred of the Jewishness of her mother.  She also does not seem believable as the wife of Lord Robert Grantham.  She seems too smarmy to be loved by him.  He is a solid, good man whose depth and dignity emerges again and again, even when he learns he has lost all Cora's money.
1476727651|4.0|This is a sequel that picks up shortly after The Shining left off, but Doctor Sleep takes a new and entirely different direction. The story follows Dan as he grows up, dealing with his shining, the visiting demons from the Overlook and as grows older, his own personal demons - alcoholism and drug abuse.<br /><br />There is horror, both supernatural and human, but, as with other recent King novels, there is introverted analysis of where our choices in life can and do take us.  Dan's addiction takes him to depths that haunt him throughout his life, even after he cleans up and gets sober, and slowly we see Dan become whole and even venerable, as he uses his shining ability to help ease the pain of those who are dying, hence the name - Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />This makes Dan Torrance a far-from-perfect hero, and through the story, he makes terrible mistakes and regrets them.  He grows and matures and overcomes incredible obstacles to become a character the reader can admire.  This is refined character development, and King doesn't just pitch us a shiny perfect character (like you might see in any Dan Brown novel), but gives us a MC with glaring flaws and then believably builds him into a hero.<br /><br />While I thought Abra - a young girl with strong shining - was fine, it seemed like the author was trying too hard to make the reader like her.  An odd relationship between Dan and Abra forms via shining and Dan realizes she is incredible danger and moves to protect her.<br /><br />The villains in the story - the True Knot, led by the beautiful Rose the Hat - are vampires of a sort, feeding on children who have the shining. By slowly killing the child, they collect steam, which keeps them young.  Most are two-dimensional characters, but they are vile and frightening, and the twist of having old people, roaming the country in RVs, kidnapping and torturing children to death, is absolutely macabre. King handles the gruesome details with class and does not magnify or accentuate the torture scenes, but they are tough to get through, as they should be.  If you read about a child getting tortured and don't wince away - I do not want to know you.  Some people can't face this sort of content at all, so if that is you, please consider yourself warned.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book and think anyone who enjoyed The Shining will like Doctor Sleep, though they are very different stories.  Do not expect this to be The Shining Part 2, but you will enjoy the scenes that draw on the first book, and yes... we do return to the Overlook.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, this is some of SK's finest prose.  He is in his element and keeps things moving at a good cadence.  Rarely did I find myself jarred out of the story to question what was going on.... usually regarding the \\"one big tooth\\" that was apparently not used for anything, yet brought up in the story again and again.<br /><br />Recommended, but those who have some history with child abuse might want to steer clear.  Note that Audible audiobook is narrated by Will Patton, who seems the perfect voice for this story, and delivers a fantastic performance.ate the torture scenes, but they are tough to get through, as they should be.

Note that Audible audiobook is narrated by Will Patton, who seems the perfect voice for this story, and delivers a fantastic performance.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Not the best SK novel.  Certainly does not rank up there with The Shining.  I really wouldn't have minded missing this one.  I miss his older stuff.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie is great fun to watch with the whole family! Action packed from the beginning to the end! Leaves you excited and anxious for the next Avengers movie.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|After discovering that Doctor Sleep was the continuing story of Danny Torrance from I the Shinning, I knew I had to read this book.<br />For me, King as a writer is very hit and miss, I get infurated when he pads out a story with unrelated character events and details or when he uses a lot of American idioms and references without giving any thought to his international readers, thankfully Doctor Sleep does niether.<br />Like other reviewers, I was a little disappointed that scant attention was given to Danny's mother or Dick Halloran, but this is a small gripe, as King packs so much into this story.<br />The villians of this story are truly terrifying, mainly because King underplays the horror of them and what they do.<br />An excellent read and a nice way to revisit  &#34;an old friend&#34;.
B00846REIS|4.0|Maybe I am the only one, but I am not into all the series books.  Let the ending happen within the pages of the book -- not make me read 4 more books.  Had I known that, I would not have started this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging and entertaining. Makes you think ahead, plan your moves and use strategy. Also, a lot of fun getting color bombs and using them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is unbelievable.  I can't stop playing.  I love competing against my friends.  My wife didn't like the idea that I started 25 games behind her and now I'm 90 games ahead...hahaha!!!
630463949X|5.0|Very good concert and with all of the together. Lindsey is a truly gifted guitarist and one of a kind!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great Graphics - easy controls -  lots of different items to purchase - OK mini games but wish there was more even if you had to pay real money, that`s why I give it 4 stars and not 5 stars.  Paying real money only gives you more gems and stops the pop up advertising.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Extraordinary. Liked it very much...can't wait for next season...excellent drama...when is coming the next season.?  I wll recommend it to my friends....excellent .
B009ETEEAU|1.0|baught three for a sunday event on motorcycles. didnt ride 20 minutes and camera battery dies. not hd at all, charge 4 hrs so you can record 20 minutes incredible. dont waste the money buy a gopro even used one at that.
B00ALGW286|5.0|I could simply call this a lovely coming of age story, but that wouldn't nearly express the depth of Julia Gousseva's fine \\"Moscow Dreams\\".  Set in Russia during the early `90s, while the U.S. thrilled to the idea of the Communistic Soviet Union morphing quickly into another fellow capitalistic country, teenagers on both sides of the ocean continued on with their lives--dating, experimenting with makeup, dreaming of good colleges, and giving in to their potent hormones.  But as we witness Marina with her teenage interests and angst, we are also privy to the changes happening in Russia; some good, some not so good.  For instance, after Gorbachev `disappears,' we see Yeltsin urging people not to give up hope--democracy is here forever, but then we learn how now, although there is a far greater variety of food available in the markets, the prices have doubled. Her grandmother, Babushka, talks about the great freedom of religion now; on the other hand, we see, like in the U.S., the lure of being a wealthy businessman far outweighs the former great respect for career scientists and educators. And all through our ride alongside Marina, Gousseva's vivid, beautiful descriptions of Leningrad, the Black Sea and its shoreline, and the older parts of Moscow, bursting with history is wonderful, as we ultimately understand how Marina, as much as she cherishes her new freedoms, recognizes how the old, repressive state at least had some continuity, whereas now, there is none. A highly recommended read, indeed!<br /><br />S. R. Mallery, author
B00A285OOW|5.0|The White Princess was compelling from the first page.  I knew the history and the places where the author had to fill in and she did a great job.  When it ended I could have cried because I wanted it to go on and on.  I've already read all the books surrounding it so I'll have to see what the author comes up with next.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I am a little disappointed that the last movie and this one have changed the Star Trek Universe Timeline, and it is a bit ridiculous how quickly Captain Kirk went from being a cadet in school to commanding a Star Ship.  Real world, that would never have happened.  You have to work your way up the ranks in a military organization to become a Captain, but ignoring that, I love the sci-fi story and the action.  I think casting also did an excellent job finding a young actor for the young spock, Leonard Nimoy I expect is pleased with the performance of Zachary Quinto, I know I am.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm quite happy that this game is now available on Kindle.  It's great to play to take a little break during the day. Unfortunately it's also quite addicting!
B0010T0OCY|4.0|Pretty good movie, great cinematography etc, but I think the plot is a bit of a stretch. They could have just made everybody do different things instead of making them all sleep at midnight.
B009NY43NY|5.0|What a great character she has created in Sookie!!  I am sorry that I have finished the entire series and am waiting for her next book to tell us all about how Sookie and her friends lives go on in Bon Temps.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|City of Bones is the first book that I have read by Cassandra Clare, it is about a teenage girl whose mother is goes missing after being attacked by a demon. She is then exposed to the truth about her family who are actually a type of mix between angels and people, which gets her into a lot of supernatural situations. This book is very difficult to summarize in a few sentences because the book is very complex. If you skipped a page in the middle or beginning of the book there was almost no chance of you understanding the reset of the book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I think that this book wasn't good, its a good read, but I have no interest to continue reading the series. Mortal Instruments is has a good story idea, however, the book displays all of the \\"background information\\" in an uninteresting and repetitive way through dialogue. I loved all of the good descriptions and witty dialogue scattered throughout the book, but it wasn't frequent enough to keep my attention. Also, the middle of the book was very uninteresting and drug on FOREVER. Overall,I really didn't enjoy reading the book due to the lack of consistently interesting dialogue and the extreme complexity
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Brad Pit and stay away from zombie shows and movies. But this had Brad, so it was a no-brainer. I'd watch Brad Pitt reading a phone book. As long as I don't have to watch this movie again, that is.<br />I thought Brad's performance was solid (I don't love all his performances), but it wasn't his best. I don't care the zombies were super fast and strong - they are non existent, so I leave it up to the writers to decide their characteristics. At times, the movie is fast paced, sit on the edge of the seat action.<br />Here's what I DIDN'T like -<br />the story has sooo many holes, the ending bombed<br />no character development<br />still don't know what Brad Pitt did for UN in the past<br />everyone does what Brad says to do, sacrificing their lives, even though he's just some guy from UN<br />UN and WHO are the heroes saving first Brad and his family, then the world - I'm sure Angelina Jolie had something to do with this horrible idea (so unrealistic it's sad)<br />Brad takes his family from Philadelphia and escapes to Newark? - what kind of moron would leave open area and head for the city???<br />the worst scene - him waking up at the WHO center and the following conversation - that is just mind boggling!! The zombies were more realistic than that scene.<br />I'm glad I borrowed this from a friend and didn't waste my money. And I'm sure glad Brad is still hot, so I had some fun watching this disaster.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Very very good movie. Surpassed my expectations as it was recommended to me.. Very sad to see the trials a culture goes through when people choose to make stupid choices. Really shows that being judgmental can cost more than just words. Very good movie!!
B007JWKLP6|4.0|I'm an old Beatles fan and this documentary explained several past actions in the group I did not know.  I never knew about the break-in of his home having such a violent twist.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|great game with a ton of stuff to do but after awhile it becomes very hard to play without spending real money
0316322407|5.0|Story Description:<br /><br />Little, Brown And Company October 8, 2013 Hardcover ISBN: 978-0-316-32240-9<br /><br />When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out.  Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.<br /><br />On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price.  She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school and few expected her to survive.<br /><br />Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York.  At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize.<br /><br />I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.<br /><br />I AM MALALA will make you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />On Tuesday, October 9, 2012 just after midday, fifteen-year-old, Malala was shot in the head at point-blank range.  She was riding the school bus with her friends when the Taliban stopped the bus and a gunman reached in through the back door and shot her where she sat on the back seat.<br /><br />Malala was flown out of Pakistan unconscious while everyone around her said she would never return nor survive, but survive she did.  She is living in Birmingham, England and can't go home to her beautiful Swat Valley for fear she'll be killed by the Taliban.  Malala misses her friends, her room, the snow-capped mountains, the green waving fields, and the fresh blue rivers.  She especially misses her best friend, Moniba who she sometimes Skypes with.<br /><br />Malala loved school and was a good student and referred to herself as a \\"bookish girl.\\"  Since the time of the Taliban her school had no sign and the ornamented brass door in the white wall of the building across from the woodcutter's yard gave no hint of what lay behind that door.  For the girls of the school, it was like a magical entrance to their own special world.  The Taliban didn't believe in education for girls and did whatever they could to uncover any place that was teaching girls.<br /><br />The school Malala attended was founded by her father before she was born.  It was called the \\"Khushal School\\" and was painted in red and white letters inside the school.  The girls attended six mornings a week and Malala was in Grade 9 when she was shot.<br /><br />Malala had been given awards for campaigning for peace in their valley and the right for girls to go to school.  Her bedroom was also full of trophies for coming first in her class and she was proud of her accomplishments, as she should be.  However, the Taliban took a dim view of her campaigning for education.<br /><br />She had begun riding the school bus as her mother was afraid of her walking home alone for fear of the Taliban.  The Taliban had never taken a girl before and Malala thought her own father would be a target for them as they had been receiving threats all year.  Some were in the newspaper, some were notes or messages passed on by people.  Malala's father was always speaking out against the Taliban so it was a surprise when they targeted her.  One of her father's friends had been shot in the face in August on his way to prayers and everyone began telling Malala's father to be careful because he was going to be next.<br /><br />I AM MALALA is rich in history and tells how Pakistan came to be, how the Taliban took over and the story of what happened to Malala after she was shot.  Very well written and kept me glued to my seat.  Malala is one brave and courageous young woman!s young woman!

1594200823|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is an exceptional book and interesting for anyone wondering about the food they consume. The book is very well written and easy to read. It provides a nice history lesson on the background of food supply in America and how corn became king in USA agriculture.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good movie. Creepy and scary... Those crazy Zombie teeth were almost too much!  Unsettling storyline.  Editing could have been better... I little disjointed at times.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I have been reading through the list of &#34;Sci Fi&#34; classic Must Reads (lots of lists out there) and this has shown up in all of them.  Rightfully so........
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|You know how long I been looking for a farm game? Like forever. I love this game and yes I have to agree with most reviewers this game is really addictive. So plz add me . My farm ID:FAQSIAL
B0062NAVXA|3.0|From the previous reviews I was expecting way too  much. Just an average movie, looked low -budget. I bought two other movies along with this, Fireproof and Facing the Giants, haven't watched those yet, hopefully those are better!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Wonderful story with well developed characters. Morton's plots are believable. The characters stay with you long after closing the book.
B001BR90O8|4.0|this very good movie it best Michael j fox the actors the people act in movie.<br />how made top of position that made great movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Easy to make the game fit you. Can play 'as a friend's and still enjoy the game. Slots is fun, too.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I have to say I bought this fro my PC. I wanted one to use to play some PC games. I don't have a PS3 I saw some reviews where people said it worked with their PC. It didn't with mine. The only way it works is if you hack your computer(which I am not skilled enough to do) So yeah if you are buying this for your PC don't. Go for the Microsoft one. AS for the pS3 I have no clue.
B00008G8M3|5.0|This movie has some of my favorite actors and not to mention all the wonderful special effect. The whole family enjoyed watching it together.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What an excellent read. I simply could not put down this book. I already miss my friends, the characters in the story.

B001XUYA0W|5.0|I don't give a crap what people say about Sean Penn, he's a great actor. Good movie, great acting by all (Tim Robins also very good). Well directed by Eastwood. Watch it.
1401324649|5.0|Many times we can't judge the book by its cover as what appears outside might not reflect on what is inside. Nevertheless, I picked the book for the intriguing and attractive title. It might transpire what most of us wonder what kind of life a 100 years old man might lead and what kind of adventure he will encounter; It might be what we ourselves hope for.<br /><br />The 100-year-old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is a very entertaining book to read for a lifetime. It is a book that you want people who you hold dearest to read it too. Aside from being a really good book that can't be put down till it's done, it also makes you laugh and smile, wonder and ponder, about philosophy and life in general. What do we want in our life, how do we get about it?<br /><br />A worthy read for everybody!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game so much I mean you get dragons. what's better.<br />Gems coins dragons so awesome.<br />GET IT!
B00F57VFXO|4.0|This is a fun book, using Ian Fleming and other historic characters as the protaganists in these World War II spy stories.  No wonder we all found James Bond so entertaining!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I don't write many reviews but I felt like I should for this one.  Like the title says, these are great for the price.  I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50 and I think those sound the best for a reasonably priced, $140, set of studio headphones, they're way better than Beats which are over-priced hype.  I also have a ATH-M40fs, a pair of AKG k240 (which are soft on volume when used with a digital source like a computer, best for analog sources)  and now this pair of SONY MDR7506.  For the price these SONY's are far and away the best of the group.  The M50's sound a little better but cost almost twice as much.  If you want a great pair of studio headphones my first choice is the ATH-M50's.  If you want a pretty close second that costs a lot less, get these.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|The book was very poorly written. It was jumbled and kept switching points of view. The plot lacked any substance other than the main conflict surrounding the husband's secret. I skimmed through to find out the husband's secret and that was it. I wouldn't reread this book again ever.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It kept me guessing until the end and then some.  It kept the pages turning well into the night and I will definitely be reading the next in the series.
0062060562|5.0|Superior and subtle mystery. Reveals the uncertainty and loss of stable reference's in one's life as a result of memory loss as well as the thriller plot.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Like book. Share it with a friend. It was great but every sad.  I think the mother  deserves an Sean
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book. I like a really good mystery and this one is. Good characters, convincing plot, and a totally unexpected ending. I did not see it coming!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! I never read the book so I can't compare it but I have to say -- the acting, plot, soundtrack, everything was amazing and so dreamy. I honestly want to watch it again. I enjoyed it so much, I want to jump into the screen and live in that world!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book will keep you up at night thinking what will happen next. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It has delly fun vanes a goober books I love it a lot the games are cool and the are coooooool
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addicting but to get upgrades you need to spend hours collecting coins to get different characters and upgrads. Other than that, its an awesome game!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|FANTASTIC!!! Eddie wrote all lyrics, he is a genius!! This album really shows how versatile they are!! Love...love...love!!! Thank you PJ!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I think it has more appeal than just to a SciFi audience. I recommend for middle school age and above.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game.  There is always something to do or to get to make your world better.  It would be nice to be able to get more acorns other than buying them.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best hunting game I've ever played even on a console  if you like hunting games you'll like this one not another way to say it
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Well, if your looking for another Memory Almost Full or Flaming Pie, it's not quite there. However, it is as solid as Chaos and Creation or Driving Rain--in fact more so. His voice is solid for his age and that's more than other maturing artists can say (but not the Wings Era voice if that is what you want). The songs and music are very good. If your a fan, pick it up and you will indeed enjoy it.
0740748475|5.0|There are some things that are nice to have in print, and this is one of them. It is three nice volumes in a boxed set. The books are printed on nice paper.
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|With this album, I have discovered Brahms.  I had never listened to Brahms before this.  So, I am learning.  Both concertos are excellent.  The inner CD jacket explains Brahms and his compositions well.  I'm now listening to these works at a new level. Also Ms. Helene plays them with honor, respect and love.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone in 5 th grade and up! Alex and Conner's story is sad though. Love this book
B00D6DVSAE|3.0|Wow, I had great rock and roll expectations for this CD and boy was I ever  disappointed. This CD seems like it was written for a musical play rather than--say a rock opera like Tommy or the much less successful Music from the Elder. It would make a fine soundtrack for a musical about the shipyards of England but not a solid CD for someone of Sting's talent. Don't get me wrong the music is solid for a play but it does not work as a stand alone musical piece.<br />I liked his ventures into jazz and  R & B stuff, but I just can't seem to dig my teeth into this. The bonus CD stuff is not up to par with even the rest of the CD. Honestly, if I had heard it first, I would not have bought it and I have all his music with the exception of his Christmas theme CD.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I didn't think the ending was very good.  Left wanting. What can I say.  The story itself was compelling and the science was bleeding edge.
B000RP4LEO|5.0|She brings out Beethoven's heart like none other. I very much like her interpretation of the man, Beethoven, with his struggles and his departure from the normal concertos of his day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is love this game. It's really easy to get energy and the detail is very good  and I recommend this game .
0425263916|4.0|Love the story of Eva and Guideon. I just wish it wasn't five books that we have to read. Looking forward to the ending
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very fast and is very fun to play it also gets updated frequently so if you want this game get it
B004EPZ070|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  It showed a controlling person who was a spoiled brat and couldn't value the happiness of others.  In real life I can't stand these kind of people and didn't enjoy this movie much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game doesn't take a long time to download. It's really cute, totally clean, and kind of addicting. It's a lot like subway surfers (if you know what game that is). It's got cute costumes you can get and all of the missions are so easy you never run out of coins. I highly suggest it!!!!
