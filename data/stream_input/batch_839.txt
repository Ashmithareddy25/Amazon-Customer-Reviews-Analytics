B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood produced and directed Gran Torino. The character he portrays, Walt Kowalski, worked thirty years for Ford and put the steering column into the titular vehicle. Long retired from the assembly line, his age shows and he sometimes coughs up blood, but he's too tough to admit any frailty.     Kowalski is recently widowed and lives alone in a decaying Detroit neighborhood. He's not close to his two sons. They have little patience with the highly-opinionated Kowalski who always bluntly says (growls) exactly what he thinks. It's likely that this abrasiveness alienated his family long ago. His sons seem to dread the prospect of helping their aging father should he become disabled.    It turns out that Kowalski is a \\"lovable racist,\\" an obvious oxymoron which nevertheless portrays his character. He has a fondness for using ethnic slurs in his speech and is not at all shy about using them in front of their targets. He makes his prejudices clear early on and then grinds them into the ground. Enough already. In reality, no one is ever going to shake off the kind of crude remarks Kowalski makes, although in this film people sometimes shrug it all off to the eccentricities of old age.    It also turns out that Kowalski is a decorated Korean War veteran with more than a touch of Dirty Harry left in him. His toughness is tested when he befriends his neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang) and Sue (Ahney Her). These are young second generation Hmong immigrants who become the victims of a street gang. Vang and Her are novice actors who shine in these roles. Likely, Eastwood's magic as a director was crucial here.    The film builds to a powerful climax. The audience was cheering for the iconic Eastwood. There's talk of Eastwood getting an Oscar for his performance, one of those sentimental ones given to a distinguished actor who somehow has never won. Well, Eastwood's acting in this film merits an Oscar.    Kowalski reveals his heart of gold as the film progresses and he grows to appreciate the Hmong culture. This is probably the first time that Hmongs have been featured in a major Hollywood production.    In my opinion, if some of the trash talk had been left out along with the totally unconvincing portrayal of a priest by Christopher Carley this film would be a classic. As it is, it's still very good indeed.

0545128285|1.0|Please, let me say that first and foremost, I adore (nay, worship) the Harry Potter stories.    Secondly, I wish to say that I deeply admire, respect (and am quite envious of) J. K. Rowling's skill, her achievements, and the long and heroic struggle she has triumphed over to get where she is today.    Thirdly, I am so very happy that Ms. Rowling has chosen to put her fame and fortune to work helping children. I have -always- said that children are the -most- vulnerable, as they have little voice, or rights of their own to protect them.    Now, having said this, and with the understanding that the \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" was a plot device used in HP7, And Never Intended To Be A Book In and Of Itself...      This book really stinks.      Flip through the reviews. First eliminate those of the rabid fans who would worship Ms. Rowling's grocery list, if it were made available for purchase. Next, ignore the \\"Was This review helpful\\" rankings, as the first group mentioned probably went though and clicked \\"No\\" on any review less than 4 stars.    O.K., now look at those 3-stars & under reviews. They've said it all:   This thing is -really- short, and the words spread out to try and \\"pad\\" it (I read it in 20 minutes); The stories might be entertaining if read to a pre-schooler, but not to anyone older; and most sadly, the stories AND commentary contain none of Ms. Rowling's great skill, nor do the parts attributed to the character Dumbledore sound even remotely like how I perceive he would have written them (Little humor, no \\"spark\\").    Some negative reviews I chose to discount involve either criticisms of it being \\"Dark\\" or \\"Scary\\", and \\"Inappropriate for young children\\" (reviews written without taking into consideration how dark -most- fairy-tales are, and the fact that kids today are far too wise (on average) to be frightened by this book), or complaints of rushing something out in the name of capitalism.     Point is, the book sales go to a very worthy charity, AND this book was only intended as a \\"cute\\" gift Ms. Rowling made for 6 of her friends, with the 7th being auctioned off for charity.    And on THAT note, I wish to recommend that instead of buying this not-very-good-at-all book, you should look into making a donation directly TO the charity that the \\"Net Proceeds\\" would have gone to, namely: The Children's High Level Group, which you can find using any good internet search engine. This way 100% of the $12.99 goes to a worthy cause.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I got it for Christmas and watched it twice in a row to catch everything I missed the first time!      The only thing I am sorry about it that the version I got is the one disk so I don't get to see the bloopers....really wanted to see those!    As far as the poor reviews of Pierce Brosnan....I have heard MUCH worse!!  I am surprised that no one has mentioned Christine Beranski, she is great as usual!    For parents of young kids....I would watch it first to make sure you want your kids to see the couple of frames that may not be appropriate for them (maybe distract them for those 10 seconds because the rest of the movie is great!).

0446581348|5.0|If you are looking for makeup from waking up to waking up the Boardroom this book is filled with great advice.  Typically, I have found that many women just DON'T want to COMMIT to looking good.  They want great results with no effort.  If you want to get rid of those dark circles, TRUST ME, it really may take 2 or 3 colors, powdered down and maintained during the day.  As to the profession, Bobbi Brown does the best thing by exposing her kit and listing ALL the items that must be carried to every appt.,plus cleaned up and maintained for the next time.  Again the wise message is there are no shortcuts to looking great or being in the beauty business.  But the rewards of fun, meeting interesting people and escaping 9to5 if you wear makeup or use it as a profession are worth it!
0956010903|5.0|All the details of the presentation and packaging of this special edition are superb!      Is this high literature?  No.     Is this an Epic tale?  No.    Is this edition steeped in details and lore to lock it firmly inside the Harry Potter world?  A resounding Yes!    Plus, the proceeds benefit a very worthy cause.    The book, in its grand case, occupy a place of honor in our formal bookshelves.    Highly recommended for fans and charitable souls alike.
B000UUNOQW|4.0|Excellent animated menu, picture quality, and sound. This isn't my favorite movie but it completes my Spider-Man UMD collection and it was well worth the price. This movie is about the continuing love story between Peter and Mary Jane, as well as the continuation of Harry Osbourn's misdirected quest for revenge.      This movie adds a few new enemies that were awesome in the comic book but are pitiful shadows of themselves in this movie. The sandman is a character to be pitied instead of the ruthless character from the comic and who knew that venom could be portrayed as a whining brat instead of the cold alien intellect bent on spidey's destruction. Even with my problem's with this movie if you love Spider-Man and you have a psp this is a must have movie for a person who is on the go.
0316017922|1.0|Your success is not your own, rather its determined by forces outside of your control, like when you were born, your ethnic background, and other factors.  That is the central message of Outliers the third book by Malcolm Gladwell.  While I found Gladwell's book well written and the stories interesting, I found the basic conclusion to be unhelpful and not particularly enlightening.<br /><br />Gladwell's goal is to help us understand success by looking at people who have been very successful.  This personal version of in search of excellence is a laudable goal; but his conclusions are not.  Gladwell starts with the sweeping assumption that people who is good at what they do all have an equal shot at being successful.  But those that are truly successful - the outliers have more to do with who your parents were, the time you were born in and your location than your own hard work or abilities.<br /><br />Using a set of disjointed stories, Gladwell creates causality out of circumstances, for example equating the month you were born in with your ability to be an all star hockey player.  Gladwell applies the same set of rule to explain why Asian's are better at math, Jewish people are better lawyers and southerners are more prone to violence.  Now if you are as offended by these statements as I was, then you get my basic disagreement with this book.  This is not the first time that Gladwell has used race, ethnicity and other factors to stir up controversy to generate attention for his work, it should be the last.<br /><br />The problem with Gladwell's analysis and this book in general is that one can take another set of stories to prove a different set of factors were behind success.  You see every set of data has outliers and I can choose my outliers by choosing my data set.  Gladwell does this throughout the book, and the choices he makes feel more like a set of left over stories than a serious analysis of the factors that drive success.<br /><br />According to Gladwell, you are powerless to overcome your circumstances and if you are luck enough you may become an outlier.  However you are not powerless to choose the books you read and the time you spend reading them.  I do not recommend this book.  Its not about success. Its just about the authors personal hype.rcome your circumstances and if you are luck enough you may become an outlier.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I felt this movie had a lot in common with the pathbreaking graphic novel of twenty years ago by Frank Miller.  Well, it does have the same title, and no doubt it derives its inspiration from that book. (If you know more about this than I do, please feel free to leave me a comment). To recap a bit, Batman, then 50, had come of retirement to try to save Gotham city from powerful criminal masterminds. But we see a darker, more troubled Batman, not so different from the darker, more troubled Gotham City he has come out of retirement to protect. Batman is reviled in the press as a lawless, out-of-control vigilante, the city district attorney is hounding him, and even public opinion is turning against him. Batman seemed to have no allies in his lonely fight against crime but his old friend the Commissioner, who himself is increasingly beleaguered in his attempts to defend and help Batman.<br /><br />In this movie, we see that brilliant vision brought to the silver screen by Christopher Nolan. With an outstanding cast, a hard-hitting script, great performances all around, and spectacular special effects, it's hard to find a serious flaw anywhere in this cinematic recreation of the classic comic-book story. Oldman is outstanding as the Commissioner (interesting to see him playing a good guy for once), Heath Ledger as the Joker is simply over-the-top and brilliant, and Christian Bale, although perhaps not my first choice for this type of role, is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine and also Morgan Freeman have lesser roles but their performances are no less commendable for that. But it's Ledger's role that is clearly the standout. As the wise-cracking, lip-smacking, exasperated, and truly diabolical bad guy, his performance has few equals if any in the entire action genre.<br /><br />And if you like special effects, you won't be disappointed there, either. But for me the movie's fast, intense, non-stop scene-by-scene development was a joy to watch. It takes superb direction, writing, and editing to get this tight a movie, and all too often action thrillers suffer from too many special effects and not enough intelligent direction, script-writing, and editing. But this movie isn't one of that ilk.<br /><br />The Joker's motivation and character is also interesting. At first it seems he's after the big money just like everyone else. But instead he can't, like most criminals, be bought. Instead, he is a force for chaos--both for law and order and the other high profile criminals in the town. He is beyond the law, beyond normal rational behavior, and even beyond any possible monetary reward--a truly different and fascinating criminal mastermind.<br /><br />And if it isn't going too far to generalize from this Frank Miller story about Batman,  another reason I liked this movie is that it shows that in this world, evil usually wins out unless good is very, very careful. Similarly, in this movie, isn't enough to be good. For good to win, a heroic and indefatigable super-hero--Batman--had to fight it out to the very end with the forces of evil.<br /><br />I thought this movie was one of the surprises of the whole year.

B001OFJPIS|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

B001GJOL22|5.0|Okay so here is what you will not get watching from the new Rush \\"Snakes & Arrows Live\\" blu ray:       *You won't see a band dressed up in gaudy costumes and wearing really horrible make- up       *You won't witness singer  Geddy Lee asking the crowd, \\"Is there anyone here who wants to rock tonight?\\" or \\" Left hand side scream as loud as you can.  Okay now right hand side.  You scream louder than that left hand side\\"      *You won't get a power ballad while the camera shows various audience members holding up lighters (Or is it cell phones now?) and getting shots of different women  on the verge of a break down.    *And thankfully, you won't get the show put on hold while a band member who thinks he is a political science major lectures the audience about which candidate they should vote for.    Rush is better than all of that.  This first Rush blu ray (and I hope there are many more to come) is a fine example of what a live DVD should be for many reasons:    I've seen Rush many times in concert over the last quarter century and for the first time in ages the band has really shaking up it's set list.  It's dropped many perennial songs in favor of such rarities such as \\"Digital Man\\", \\"Circumstances\\", \\"A Passage To Bangkok\\", \\"Mission\\", and \\"Entre Nous\\", the last having never been played live.  Like many Rush fans I was not really into a lot of their nineties material (didn't hate it, just didn't find it as good as their earlier catalogue) so all the songs from the era, save \\"Dreamline\\" are gone.   Now the band does something that is almost unheard of for a band as old as Rush and that is play nine songs from it's most recent release, \\"Snakes & Arrows\\".  I seriously doubt the Stones would do such a thing. But the songs from \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" are welcome here as that CD is the best recording they have done in years and the songs sound brilliant live.    The camera work blows away that of the previous two Rush concert films.  I found \\"Rush in Rio\\" a victim of over editing and was annoyed by so many shots of the crowd.  \\"R30\\" was a vast improvement but a third of the show was missing!  Here we get the entire gig, including intro and outro videos.  The main focus this time is the band playing.  The cameras capture almost every angle of the stage including seeing set lists taped up on Geddy Lee's keyboard and Neil Peart's drum.   It also needs to be noted that the high definition quality is outstanding.  After watching this video it's hard to go back and watch the older films. Again, I hope they find their way to blu ray sooner than later.    The extra material is okay.  Fans will get \\"Red Sector A\\" which was omitted from the previously mentioned \\"R30\\" DVD as well as both \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" performances with the camera focused on the rear screened happenings which is a lot of fun.  The outtakes I could take or leave.  I wasn't impressed with \\"What's that Smell\\" video that opened the second half of the 2008  leg of the tour but I am not going to knock the DVD for that.  Overall Rush has provided their fans with a real treat. Peace, and enjoy.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I can't believe the greatest superhero movie ever made only rates four stars as of this review on Amazon. This is primarily because of people who either love the film but dislike the DVD transfer, or find the film \\"overated\\".    Well friends, I'm here to tell you there's nothing overrated about THE DARK KNIGHT. It's not just the best superhero movie I've ever seen, but it's a truly great crime drama featuring gangsters, crooked cops and a murderous madman who calls himself The Joker!    THE DARK KNIGHT picks up where BATMAN BEGINS left off, with Batman and Detective Lt. James Gordon fighting the mob. They are joined by new District Attorney Harvey Dent, who relishes the opportunity to throw Gotham's new crime boss Sal Marone and his pals behind bars. The three are successful for a while. That is, until The Joker takes over.    And boy does he ever take over. He sends Gotham into chaos by challenging it's citizens into making dangerous, life and death decisions. And each major character in THE DARK KNIGHT faces their own difficult choices.     The Joker is an unpredictable sociopath who compares himself at one point to a dog chasing cars...but this dog's bite is even worse than his bark. And the late Heath Ledger truly is a revelation in the role. This isn't some actor merely having fun playing an over-the-top cartoon character. Ledger is unrecognizable in voice and appearance and his performance runs much deeper than your typical screen villain. He reminds me a of the great gangster villains from the past played by the likes of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, but much more twisted. In other words, the Joker I've always wanted to see.     Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the handsome, charming and earnest prosecuter Harvey Dent. His face born for campaign ads and his political future limitless. Yet there's more than one side to Dent, and Eckhart also brings that certain edge to Dent which lends just the right intensity. His may be the underrated performance in the film. His Dent not only has a story arc well known to fans of the comic, but he basically becomes the heart of the film. We find ourselves invested in his character, which makes this movie a tragedy as much as it is a thriller.    The rest of the main cast consists of mostly returning members: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are just as impressive as they were in BATMAN BEGINS. Much has been said of Bale's voice as Batman being too gravelly, but Bale has said he wanted Batman to be animalistic, which is good enough for me and besides, nobody would ever guess Batman is Bruce Wayne from the voice, that's for sure. Maggie Gyllenhaal steps in as Rachel Dawes and she comes across as a more mature version of the character than did Katie Holmes in BEGINS. She does a great job and, in at least one scene, breaks my heart.     THE DARK KNIGHT has plenty of action, with mercifully few CGI effects. And fight scenes you can actually see (especially on my Blu-ray). The music is rousing, tragic and scary...ideal for THIS film! The cinematography is both intense and breathtaking. The screenplay is clever, complex and almost novelistic, with dialogue that doesn't insult your intelligence. Speaking of which, just about every line from The Joker is a masterstroke. It's a multi-layered script with multi-layered characters...even though they originate from the pages of a comic book.     And this is definitely a multi-layered film thanks to Christopher Nolan's bold direction and his insistence on telling a good story. I thought his BATMAN BEGINS was excellent. This is brilliant. He pieced together a superhero story and turned it into a dark, disturbing, tragic, exciting masterpiece. It's one of those great Batman graphic novels come to cinematic life. Gloriously so!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is a movie for the whole family.  You will not want to miss any part of the movie.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Christopher Nolan has done it again, and this time it is with \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  I really thought there was no hope for Batman after the horribly brain-numbing \\"Batman & Robin,\\" but I was happy to see that I was dead wrong when I saw \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Like that film, we are given more dimensions and character complexity to what could have been just a regular superhero movie.<br /><br />It turns out that Batman's new gig doesn't come without its consequences, as he sees copycats trying to take matters into their own hands.  Not only that, but he's struggling with his own inner demons and doubts.  Which makes this the most opportune time for The Joker to take full advantage, and boy does he ever have some big plans in the works.  He may be a dangerous psychopath, but that's not to say that there isn't a reason for his actions.  Chaos is his talent, and with that he will do whatever it takes to corrupt squeaky clean District Attorney, Harvey Dent; and attempt to make Batman break his one and only rule.  And if he can make Gotham City tear itself to shreds, well then that's just fine with him.  All of this leads to an explosive film where answers don't come easily and actions don't come without a price.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" cannot be seen only once.  I know for me I couldn't fully appreciate it the first time because I was so blown away by Heath Ledger's menacing performance as \\"The Joker\\" that I couldn't focus on or appreciate anything else.  The more I watch this movie, the more I fall in love with almost every aspect.  I love how Nolan creates a great balance between action and story.  You come to know and care about the characters as if you were watching a serious drama.<br /><br />While the entire cast does a remarkable job, it cannot be avoided that Heath Ledger simply steals the show.  I was as fascinated by his performance as I was with Anthony Hopkins in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" (and that is not a comparison that can easily be made in most cases).  You want to know everything about him and you cannot wait until you see him on the screen again.  Still, it must be stressed that the entire cast did a great job.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" on Blu-Ray looks FANTASTIC.  I actually tried to watch this on DVD (since I wasn't getting it on Blu-Ray for Christmas), and I had to stop it because I thought it was such a poor transfer, or at least that's how it looked on my TV.  On Blu-Ray, it is crystal clear.  What they've done specifically for the Blu-Ray version is enhance the aspect ratio during the sequences shot in IMAX and then return to it's normal theatrical aspect ratio.  There's a chance that this may put some people off but to the people who have seen it on IMAX, this is the way we saw it and I welcome it with open arms.  There's some nice extra features, although sadly I didn't see any deleted scenes when I was skimming the extras.  I would've loved to see some deleted scenes of Ledger.<br /><br />Maybe it's my imagination or I need a better surround system, but I could swear that they have cleaned up Christian Bale's voice as \\"Batman\\" so it isn't as overpowering as it was when we saw it in the theatres.  He's still raspy, but it seems a lot more tolerable and less distracting.  That was always something that bothered me.  Well, if they cleaned it up for the DVD and Blu-Ray release, then much kudos to them!<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is a dark and complex tale that shows that superhero movies do not have to be without substance.  You do not have to be a fan of Batman to appreciate this movie, and it's even fine to watch this without seeing \\"Batman Begins.\\"  I really enjoyed it and it is something that I love more and more with each viewing.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|I recommend this as the BEST cd I have purchased this year of 2008! I bought this on the premise of loving the most recent of 2 of his 3 cds cds \\"Driving Rain\\", and \\"Memeory Almost Full\\". This is different,of course, but none the less exceptional! Blues, Psychodelia, drony, even a touch of his comrade George H.on track 9,\\"Lifelong Passion\\". But I must say for me, Track 8,\\"Dance 'Til We're High\\" is the EPIDOMY of a Paul track!. Beautiful melody of chord changes, yet still a straight subtle rocker in 4/4 time. At 66, Sir Paul has lost NOTHING musically!!!, and deserves the accolade of: one of, if not 'THE' songwriter in music history! PLEASE!,just >>>Buy it!
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I love ABBA. I love Meryl Streep. I love music. I love my best friend who recommended this movie to me.<br /><br />How will I ever tell my best friend the truth, after having ordered and watched this pitiful production.<br /><br />All the way through,I couldn't wait for it to be over. I have rarely \\"ever\\" felt this way about a film.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. It is a travesty. Nothing redeemable. Beyond stupid and boring. Very sad to say.<br /><br />ZzZzZz
B000NTPDSW|1.0|The movie is 5 star. But I am rating the Blu Ray version, not the movie itself. Unless there is something wrong with my Blu Ray copy, then the God Father Blu Ray is not worth the money. Unlike other Blu Ray movies, where there is a significant noticeable difference in the quality of the Blu Ray version vs. non Blu Ray, I perceived no difference.    I am not saying that if you had both a Blu Ray and non Blu Ray version of the Godfather running side by side, that you would not be able to see a difference. Just that with other Blu Ray movies, the difference to me has always been clear with a Wow factor. No Wow with the Godfather Blu Ray.    I haven't watch Part II of the set, maybe it has improved quality.    Not worth the money for the package. This is the only Blu Ray I have purchased where I have been disappointed.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|Great movie! better than the one they made with eric banna edward nortan carried the movie but the extras could have been better.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is a simple story about a young man following his heart and finding his dreams. Zach (Trevor Wright) is working class, with a crappy job as a short-order cook, an on again/off again relationship with Tori (Katie Walder), a very sick widowed father, and a feckless, self-centred single mother of a sister (Tina Holmes) whose only redeeming feature is her adorable five-year-old Cody (Jackson Wurth). Zach is Cody's only real male role model, and not surprisingly, Cody looks up to him as a father, not an uncle.    Zach has a lot of responsibilities, and since his hope of going to art school died when his mother did, and his sister got pregnant, his only joys in life are his friends and his surfing. He's aware, much more so than his privileged best friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), or his sister Jeanne, how much of life is passing him by, and what he's given up for his family, but there seems no way out. Until Gabe's handsome, gay older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe), returns to Malibu and doors open, along with Zach's heart.    I've seen reviews of this film which call it  mediocre and unambitious. Seems to me that misses the point. It's not a story of high drama. It's about small things - ordinary family dysfunctionality, ordinary dreams, ordinary love. The extraordinariness lies in Zach's selflessness and Shaun's willingness to help him out of the hole in which he's drowning. What makes this film work is the beautiful, affectionate tenderness between the two leads (both straight actors turning in gorgeous and credible performances as young gay men in love), and the strength of the acting on all sides. Every character rang true - and when even the kid didn't strike me as stupidly cute, there has to be something working. I especially loved the character of Tori, who could have come off as a heinous bitch, but was instead a rounded and likable friend to her ex-boyfriend.    Tina Holmes as Jeanne has a thankless task in an unpleasant role, but she is pitch perfect as the emotionally manipulative and immature mother and sister. Her scenes with  Trevor Wright are painfully honest. But then Wright just shines in this. He and Rowe have such chemistry together, such physical easiness - you see them as friends and as lovers, and they felt completely real to me.    It's a short film at an hour and a half, and though it takes a while to get going, it's well worth the wait, and is a positive, happy affirming portrayal of young gay people that allows them a happy ending. That in itself makes it worth the price of admission/purchase.

0307394549|4.0|After about 10 years using Rose Levy Birnbaum's Christmas cookie book, this year I switched  wholesale to my new Martha Stewart's Cookies book.  Birnbaum's book, which I love, has nuts in almost every cookie, and I had several people with nut allergies on my cookie recipients list.  I had some other requirements for cookies, too--ones that didn't require long chilling periods for dough, quick to make, with fairly few ingredients, and with some role for a new baker's helper (2 years old).      I was able to find a good selection of recipes in Martha's book to fit all these criteria, with a few modifications: chocolate crackles, pfeffernusse, lime meltaways, sugar cookies (made small and with Christmas instead of Easter cutters, natch), raspberry and apricot thumbprints adapted from the chocolate thumbprint recipe.      All have been popular and I've spent the week before Christmas defending the tins intended for friends from my immediate family.  However, I must agree with a few of the criticisms of other reviewers.  It would help to have more info on how dough should look/feel, and also how to know when cookies are done.  Some recipes say \\"bake for X minutes or until edges are golden brown,\\" but others just give the time, not useful given the variations in ovens, and also that I like to make my Christmas cookies really small. Also, while I like having the pictures of cookies in the index, I find the classification by texture annoying--I'd much rather have, say, all the chocolate cookies together so I can compare and select recipes without flipping back and forth through the book.      I don't think this is a good book for a beginning baker, but for the experienced who can adjust and fill in the less-complete info, the recipes are well worth it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I looked at OK Computer for quite a long time before I finally bought it.  Thank God that I did.  This album is incredible.  Every song would stand up well by itself and the album flows so well.  When I heard it i was impressed but it didn't blow me away; as I kept listening to it I couldn't stop. Its is just a great group of songs right up there with Abbey Road, Dark Side of the Moon, Zeppelin IV, Moondance, Are You Experienced?, Blow by Blow, and any other \\"classic\\" album you can think of.  Definetly worth any price, a fine piece of music and a must have for anyone who truly loves music.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|As with many Joss Whedon ventures, this is quirky and fun in all the right places. Who would have thought you could turn the bad guy, the erstwhile Dr. Horrible, and make him into the protagonist, while making the traditional good guy, Captain Hammer, into the antagonist. In Dr. Horrible, you find yourself rooting more for Dr. Horrible than you might normally for a villain in anything. Dr. Horrible is very likable, and just wants to join the ELE; the Evil League of Evil, and won't settle for anything less {and certainly not the Henchman's Union that his friend Moist is part of}.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance of 'Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog' is in the casting. Neil Patrick Harris is hilarious and appropriately cynical as Dr. Horrible. He brings a certain something to the character; a kind of jaded determination that lends itself well to the humour in the piece. Nathan Fillion shines as the shallow superhero Captain Hammer, who seems to take a perverse pleasure in bothering Dr. Horrible, finding different ways to make his life miserable. One of the ways he does this is stealing the girl, Penny, who Dr. Horrible has a maybe-not-so-unrequited love for. Penny, played by Felicia Day, is different from the girl you would expect to normally find in this role. She has a girl-next-door quality to her, which allows you to like her and she is a genuinely good person, who wants to help other people, and has no idea, like most women in superhero ventures, that her friend Billy is really Dr. Horrible. We are shown that even though she is dating Captain Hammer, that she may not really like him. And, judging from the way he acts through the piece, we can't blame her.<br /><br />'Dr. Horrible' is broken into three acts, all of which are executed quite well. Whedon brings a sense of reality to his creation; sometimes things don't always go according to plan, sometimes people do die who you don't want to, sometimes the bad guy will win {even if you like the bad guy}. All of these things are part of life. One thing about Whedon, is that he doesn't necessarily let all of his characters have happy endings. And while I'm not a giant fan of that, I have to acknowledge and respect him for drifting from the norm with that concept.<br /><br />The fact that this is a musical brings another element to the mix. Most musicals are flights of fancy, and can have a tendency to go on for too long with the \\"spur of the moment\\" segments of people bursting into songs on their daily routines. There are a few songs that shine out through the soundtrack; 'I Cannot Believe My Eyes', 'Brand New Day', 'So They Say', 'Slipping' and 'Everything You Ever'. These bring a complexity to the story and show different aspects of the characters that we might have otherwise missed.rt of life.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|So it's Friends! thats all you need. There are 6 different covers with each of the character's faces on them. I spent more time watching this then doing my homework. ohh well.

B001CTA1S4|5.0|This is the stuff that great movies are made of: a solid plot with moral tension pulling in more than two directions; great acting across the board, carefully directed: tight, no slack anywhere. Exquisite!<br /><br />This movie is the best I have seen of this year's crop, perhaps the best in years. It can be matched but it is difficult to see how it can be excelled. For now, I put it at the top of the heap for the academy awards: that is, if the academy actually made awards to the best movies of the year, which it does not. Its award usually goes to the \\"American\\" movie that garners the most money no matter how bad it may be, nor how good its competitor are. Therefore we can expect this movie to at most get an \\"honorable mention.\\" But if things were right in the Hollywood firmament, this would be the one to beat.<br /><br />Despite the academy's predilection for picking the \\"money hogs (and dogs)\\" over truly good movies, \\"Doubt\\" will surely make their nasty task of \\"weeding out the best to get to the rest\\" more difficult this year.<br /><br />Streep is back up to her old \\"Sophie's Choice\\" form and takes no prisoners. Hoffman is even better than he was in Charlie Wilson's War, and thats saying something. Streep just makes everybody in this movie better, much better, and they all know it. They know too that they have the winner of the year, so to hell with the academy.<br /><br />The quality of the movie speaks for itself. Its my movie of the year, no matter what the academy says. Amen.<br /><br />Fifty stars
B000QUCNOK|5.0|The first time I watched this movie was when I rented it. I loved it. I think its very artsy, There is little dialogue compared to other movies, but that doesn't make it a bad thing. It is a story about the passion for scent and to capture it forever. I love the acting and just think it is a great movie.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|If you are a history fanatic, like my boyfriend is, you will get crazy about these CD's. Award winning, great series about the pre-war events, and the war seen from different perspectives. A must-have for all history fans.
B001ED7C58|5.0|First and foremost, the Twilight movie OST is filled mostly with songs from the Rock genre of music, particularly some of today's popular bands and musical groups<br />(IE: Paramore)although there are some random but interesting and nonetheless great Indie-genre songs<br />(Flightless Bird, better known as the prom slow-dance song in the movie)  The soundtrack is upbeat and hardly boring, and I use it as my long-distance driving CD.  Overall, its pretty good.<br />The songs tie into the movie well too, so when you listen you might just reminisce & playback scenes from the movie inside your head.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|(It's interesting that other reviewers thought of the novel \\"Rebecca\\" and the movie \\"Titanic\\" because I did too.)    I rarely want to immediately reread a book just after finishing it but I did this one. I did start to read Chapter One again and saw immediately how much richer it was and meaningful as I now can appreciate the subtlties contained therein. But for this kind of reward, you'll need to read the entire book first ~(;->     I don't want to speak more of the plot as there is plenty revealed here already. I will say that the plot is involved, has layers of characters who are pulled forward into the spotlight and then fall into the background, some resurface, some die, some have small bit parts but have big plot impact. The past is always impacting the future which I think is why a reread would be so worth while.    The core characters are tied together on a number of levels - Grace the lady's maid to Hannah the middle child of the family of Riverton House. Together, this is really their story from beginning to end. Grace promises Hannah early on to keep Hannah's secrets which she does.    Grace even gives up her separate personal life journey for Hannah but in the end, Grace does live her full life but you need to read the book to know why....    This is an author I really want more of.

0425200450|4.0|Ms. Christie had a clean, crisp writing style that suits this genre very well. There are no flowery prose to be found in-between the covers of this mystery. It has been over 30 years since I read 'Murder on the Orient Express' while in high school and I still clearly remember the unusual outcome. But despite knowing the surprise ending, revisiting this classic and observing Ms. Christie's remarkable ability to place clues and red-herrings throughout made me appreciate her talents even more. As usual, another great, entertaining read by a master of the whodunit.
1595822003|5.0|I just gave this version as a gift and it is magnificent. Beautiful accents on various pages as well as full page drawings. The story itself is of course a classic in a class of it's own for many, many reasons including, the extraordinary life of the writer, her parents, their friends and Mary's lover and their friends;  having written the book at the age of 19, nearly 200 years ago, and the night that served as a catalyst for the book itself, which is considered the first work of Science Fiction ever. Brilliant, bold, epic, painful and beautiful.
0545128285|1.0|I couldn't stomach this for my kids:  \\"... the warlock drew his wand, unlocked the crystal casket, sliced open his own breast, and replaced the hairy heart in the empty cavity it had once occupied.\\"  ...a maiden is missing.... the people search for her...  \\"They found the dungeon at last, and a most dreadful sight awaited them there.  The maiden lay dead upon the floor, her breast cut open, and beside her crouched the mad warlock, holding in one bloody hand a great, smooth, shining scarlet heart, which he licked and stroked, vowing to exchange it for his own.  \\"In his other hand, he held his wand, trying to coax from his own chest the shriveled, hairy heart...  Before the horror-struck eyes of his guests, the warlock cast aside his wand, and seized a silver dagger.  Vowing never to be mastered by his own heart, he hacked it from his chest.  For one moment, the warlock knelt triumphant, with a heart clutched in each hand; then he fell across the maiden's body, and died.\\"    Below this passage is a sketch of a bloody maiden with blood pouring from her chest, and the warlock, blood pouring from his chest, two hearts in the puddle of blood, one all hairy....    If you feel this is appropriate for your kids, then go for it.  But I'm not quite in the market for that much gore.  It's a bit over the line...  It's not even just gore.  Just gore would be hacking the heart out.  But licking and stroking the fresh heart??  ew.  If this is what my kids read (in elementary school, no less), what will they dream up when they attempt to be creative?
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I generally can get cranky when I consider buying a new video for my granddaughter and yet again realize that the sanitized and perfect little princess/fairy tale type animated films that Disney puts out are nevertheless the best that's out there.    You have to admit that the Disney studio knows how to tell a story, probably better than anyone in this genre, even though not all have been the home run that B&B is.     This is an old, old tale, told in many countries & cultures. I have read most of them, and ironically, all the old tales tend to get wound up in details that tend to distract one from the story line. But Disney knows what can be left out, how to create believable (if stock) characters, develop tension in the story as well as take artistic license where it adds drama and moves the story along.     And of all of Disney animated movies, Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite. Belle seems nearly flesh and blood; smart, curious and headstrong. She knows what she wants and learns to look in the right place. The Beast is wonderful as are the rest.    Oh! And the music is the BEST that Disney has ever offered.     I only have an old VHS tape but need to buy a DVD....!
B001IZZEEI|5.0|Its an awesome box set!  Loved the movie.. and the the box set is beautiful edition and i think worth the extra bucks.

B000PE8DXM|4.0|We bought this Parking Garage for our 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He has really enjoyed playing with it. If you are giving it as a gift I would suggest putting the toy together first. He was wanting to play with it right away and it took awhile to put together. The ramps do come on & off but if you choose a glue gun would work fine to secure them in place. I feel good that I invested in this toy, nice product and I think a very good company made this product too!
0545128285|2.0|Pay attention to all the negative reviews, there's a reason why a lot of people found this book pretty disappointing. Here are my 2 cents.    I AM a Harry Potter fan, and a JK Rowling fan as well. But the target audience for this book is pretty confusing. You have some stories clearly meant for very young kids, and then suddenly there's a tragic, almost morbid, love story in there (don't want to spoil too much by saying more). The stories do have a moral, and they're similar to a lot of 'folk-lore' that I've read as a child. After each story, there's a commentary by Dumbledore. The commentary is informative, but starts to get boring quite fast, and it's almost as long as each story! And each of the 5 stories is pretty short. I'm a slow reader, and I still read the entire book in under an hour.    Overall, there's nothing great about the book. There are a lot of other fables and tales out there that are much better. To me it really felt like they wanted JK Rowling to do another book at any cost, and she put this out in a hurry. That's just what it felt like to me. I'm glad that there's some money going towards the children fund they mention for each sale. But just be prepared for some rather lack-luster reading.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I received this from my wife as a Christmas present yesterday so I cannot vouch for its reliability. I can, however, describe how to get past the sound through the PC problem.    As someone previously described the process I will use their process except change the order because that is important:    Under Control Panel (Windows XP) and Sounds and Audio Device Properties:     Sound Playback: [enter your default sound card as Audio Output] Note that the installation software for Audio Studio LE changed this so that when you plug in the USB cable it will default to USB Audio CODEC. This is WHY your PC sound quits working.      Make sure Sound Recording is set to: USB Audio CODEC     MIDI Music Playback: Miscrosoft GS Wavetable SW Synth [I don't think this one makes any difference but it is where mine is at and it is working]    On Audio Studio LE; Click \\"Tools\\" then \\"vinyl recording and restoration\\" AND be sure \\"monitor recording level\\" is checked.     Make sure that the Sound and Audio Device properties are done BEFORE you call up the Sony software because it seems to NOT recognize changes in Windows once you have activated it.     I only gave this a 3 rating because the instructions are so poorly written. Those of you who have a working turntable and a sound card with a line in input do not need this device. All you need is a set of patch cords that will go to the line in from your stereo. (Note that you can NOT run it directly from the turntable to the line in because you need a higher voltage input (at least a pre-amp level). You also need a program that has \\"line in\\" as an option for recording. Windows Media Player does not have this option.    Update May: On reliability so far not a single problem.    Update October 2010: The auto function on the turntable has broken such that the tone arms will settle on the record and then immediately lift up, return to the holder, and then the unit shuts down. If you have this problem once it does that use the lift button forthe tone arm to lift it. Then move the tone arm to the starting point on the album and gently lower it with the button. As you move the tone arm to the start point the turntable should start rotating via the \\"manual\\" start.    On the software dividing the songs issue I have found that it is better that the software didn't divide the songs automatically. In some cases it divides them incorrectly and you have pieces of songs. It is much easier to divide the songs manually than it is to go in and edit the transcription by cutting and pasting pieces of songs.  This is another major ding against the software.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I'll get right to the point. When the London Philharmonic Orchestra joins forces with Nightwish, you get this masterpiece. \\"Dark Chest Of Wonders\\" opens the album with powerful riffs, which then merges with Tuomas' masterful keyboard playing, creating an incredible out-of-this-world experience. \\"Planet Hell\\". BEST.DRUM.INTRO.EVER! \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is a touching song about the hardships of the Native Americans. I have to keep myself from crying every time I hear it. It's the kind of metal that is beautiful, not just heavy. \\"The Siren\\". Wow. I haven't heard anything this original since \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" by System Of A Down. In my opinion \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is the best song on the whole album. The orchestra is used to full efficiency and Emppu's guitars provide the perfect mix to make it heavy.    In short, 5, 10, or even 100 stars are not enough to do this album justice. It is completely worth every penny!

0316017922|3.0|Actually the reason that students in Asian countries perform better at math is that the curriculum for 4th grade students in these countries include being taught in some fashion the math concept that the Identity Rule is the CORE MATH CONCEPT. This understanding is the only reason why they perform so well as a group in math. The argument that the asian languages create some intellectual advantage does not explain why other non-asian speaking countries also perform at high levels. Those educators that understand the importance of the Identity Rule refer to it as The Golden Rule of Math.    Any person with good math skills knows the Identity Rule. What appears to be less obvious to educators in the U.S. (based on U.S. student math performance) is that the IDENTITY RULE is the CORE MATH CONCEPT, and that it can be easily taught. These concepts can be understood by a student within an hour to an hour and a half, and that once understood (the Gestalt), the student can then easily understand all subsequent math instruction. An understanding of how to use the Identity Rule to manipulate fractions gives the student the ability to perform in math in the 98th percentiles, throughout elementary and high school just like students in asian countries.    Some additional thoughts on the argument that the asian languages create some intellectual advantage to perform better at math. This argument does not explain cause. It is merely an observation after the fact. The same is true about after the fact observations that differences in socio-economics, race, gender, intelligence, environment, single families, nutrition, homogeneous groups, etc., etc., explain why some perform better at math than others. These variables are not causal either. They make for good reading, but do not explain causality.    I argue that the obviously causal variable is BORDERS. Within some borders/(countries) the school systems include in the curriculum, teaching their students in some fashion, the CORE MATHCONCEPT, the Identity Rule, and how to use the Identity Rule to manipulate fractions. After the 4th grade, all math involves manipulating fractions. Students that are taught this CORE MATH CONCEPT easily, (emphasis on EASILY), learn all subsequent math instruction. The result then is that in spite of differences within BORDERS in socio-economics, family structure, gender, etc. their students as a group excel at math.

0525478183|4.0|Being a follower of John Green, from his books Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines to his youtube channel vlogbrothers with his brother Hank, I expect nothing less than another great read from him. Paper Towns did manage to keep my attention with Green's use of Whitman's poem \\"Leaves of Grass\\" and the meaning behind the title Paper Towns. I did connect with the character of Quentin and agreed with his reason for going in search of Margo, however I would have liked to have seen more of a connection between the two. All in all it was a good book and I'm glad I bought it. I liked it well enough to buy it for my friend for Christmas.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|Wow, great movie, with the WORST packaging from Disney I've ever seen... Cardboard slip cases, these are for cheap tv series sets on their last legs of marketability. Whoever thought up this packaging for the three disk special edition should be ashamed.  I fork over good money for an already high priced Disney product and I expect quality, not cheap cardboard.     LOVED the movie... great for the child in all of us.

6305907145|3.0|If you like your Jane to look and sound like Jane, and not like some director's idea of the spirit of Jane, then this film is probably not for you. If, however, you revel in period films done with good production values, intelligent writing and acting, and if you don't mind some nudity and shock value that moves the whole work out of the family-viewing arena, then this film has much to reccomend it.    I mostly appreciated the way that this director/writer effort managed to transport elements of Austen's novel onto the screen, although they often appear tranformed as well as transported. Though this film lacks the polite-society feel of Austen as we have come to expect it from previous film versions of her novels, in purely literary terms it remains true to much of the themes and motives of the original. This version of Mansfield merely expresses them a bit differently.     On the other hand, there are some aspects of this adaptation that stole the enjoyment for me. The infamous slave-drawings scene, for instance, while it helps sympathize Tom's character (you get why he's drowning his pain and moral confusion in alchohol), creates a huge dichotomy in my mind over Fanny's eventual reconciliation and respect for her uncle. How is it possible that such a thoughtful girl as Fanny can learn respect for the monstrous, evil-minded man her uncle is in this adaptation? In addition, that horrifying scene, with Fanny poring over the agonized drawings Tom made of his father engaging in acts of brutality with the family slaves, felt a bit too much like the director was expressing an agenda. I can deal with tough stuff in a movie, if it serves the story well, but this just didn't.     Also, cousin Edmund lacks the motivations that in the novel, render his behavior understandable. Here, he comes off as a wispy stick-figure kind of guy. One has to wonder what her attraction to him could be. Their eventually coming together feels a bit too much like the characters themselves had access to the script and no choice but to follow it.    For me, the main thing this movie lacked was any genuinely likeable characters other than Fanny, and perhaps her sister. That is a wearying thing in a feature-length film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The complete series of Firefly under our X-Mas tree...    I couldn't believe it when my girlfriend, (who btw is not a sci-fi fan) actually got this for me, based on a very casual conversation I had with her a few months back!    Ever since being introduced to Serenity from a very random public library copy a few years back, I fell in love with the whole premise.  I rarely ever buy TV series DVD's but I enjoyed the movie so darn much, I've been debating whether or not to buy it since then, but as time passed by and memories started fading, I kept putting it off.     Well this series rekindled my love for this show, and watching the first episode together with a loved one who good naturedly put up with my inner childish excitement and unasked for explanations was an experience of pure geeky heaven.    Cherish a woman who is willing to spend time with you doing something you love...

B001GQACGO|3.0|Honestly, I was highly anticipating I AM...SASHA FIERCE after hearing singles \\"If I Were A Boy\\" and personal favorite, \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\".  After purchasing, listening, sitting the album aside, and re-listening, it is a bit disappointing. It is by no means horrible and Beyonc&egrave; sounds fine, but the songwriting is not top-notch like it was on DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE or B'DAY. It is a nice departure to hear Beyonc&egrave; singing more pop-oriented songs on the I AM... half of this album, but it drags on, particularly on the Deluxe Edition.  While the SASHA FIERCE side should be better than I AM..., it is pretty consistent because despite the slick production, the tracks do not sit nearly as well as anything from either of Knowles' first two albums (save for \\"Single Ladies...\\", \\"Diva\\", and perhaps \\"Ego\\").  Essentially, this album produces mixed results.  Mixed or not, it is clear this is not Beyonc&egrave;'s best album, though it is not a complete or utter disaster.<br /><br />The album opens strongly with what will probably end up being a timeless adult-contemporary ballad, \\"If I Were A Boy\\".  The track is uncharacteristic of Beyonc&egrave;, but it works exceptionally.  It is certainly I AM...SASHA FIERCE's \\"Irreplaceable\\". The songwriting is taut and impeccable and \\"Mrs. Carter's\\" vocal performance is superb - a five-star performance.  Follow-up track \\"Halo\\" is not quite as strong as \\"If I Were A Boy\\", but it is a solid listen by all means. The lower register of Beyonc&egrave;'s voice is surprising, showing one of the pros of taking risks. It is not valedictory like \\"If I Were A Boy\\" or the phenomenal \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\", but it is strong. \\"Disappear\\" is in a similar category to \\"Halo\\" - it is not breath-taking, but it is solid, perhaps only slightly above average maximally. The vocals, as always still keep \\"Sasha\\" on top.<br /><br />\\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" is OK, but ultimately shows the breaking point of a couple of too many adult-contemporary ballads from a true \\"Diva\\" (no pun intended).  \\"Ave Maria\\" is the ultimate surprise of the I AM... side in which Beyonc&egrave; sounds angelic, particularly in her upper register.  It is a performance such as \\"Ave Maria\\" that makes the riskier moments of I AM... SASHA FIERCE worth the time.<br /><br />\\"Smash Into You\\" is another winner, though not to the extent of the best (\\"If I Were A Boy\\", \\"Halo\\", or \\"Ave Maria\\").  It does work and proves that Beyonc&egrave; can successfully play off the adult-contemporary styled-R&B, if she really wants to. Still, even after a couple of great performances, one still questions why Beyonc&egrave; chose this direction.  \\"Satellites\\" and \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\" close the first disc (in the standard edition I believe \\"Ave Maria\\" is the closer).  Neither of these two performances are truly alluring or memorable and end the first disc with fluff as opposed to substance, \\"If I Were A Boy\\" or \\"Ave Maria\\" caliber tracks.  In this instance, save for the credible \\"Smash Into You\\", the standard edition of I AM... would've sufficed.<br /><br />Beginning with definitive track \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\", the more hip-hop, R&B flavored SASHA FIERCE side begins.  \\"Single Ladies\\" is perhaps Beyonc&egrave;'s best single ever. The Dream (Terius Nash) and Tricky Stewart (Christopher Stewart)have written the perfect pop record with \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\"; it is different from the majority of pop records out now, save for it's repetitive production and catchy hook. It is definitely the high point of SASHA FIERCE and perhaps even I AM...<br /><br />\\"Radio\\" is not bad, but in comparison to previous Beyonc&egrave; dance tracks (\\"Suga Mama\\", \\"Upgrade U\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\"...) it is not nearly as memorable.  \\"Diva\\" picks up the slack and could have fit on either of Beyonce's two previous albums.  The skeletal beat and the hip-hop influenced vocals are perfect making for another hit. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" falls short ofglory, though it is solid.  \\"Videophone\\" is better, though not as great as \\"Single Ladies\\" or \\"Diva\\".  The production as always is top-rate, but production fails to supersede the uninspired tracks of this album.<br /><br />\\"Hello\\" is average, but \\"Ego\\" proves to be worth a couple of spins, something that cannot be necessarily said about some of the tracks on I AM...SASHA FIERCE. \\"Scared of Lonely\\" ends SASHA FIERCE ok, though not stunningly.<br /><br />Essentially, Mrs. Carter has a flawed effort on her hands.  Fans/customers are in a \\"CATCH-22\\" situation with the Standard and Deluxe editions of I AM...SASHA FIERCE. Fans are \\"damned if I do, damned if I don't\\" in the sense that the standard edition is a bit too short while the deluxe edition is a bit too bloated with filler as opposed to genuine solid numbers. B'DAY did a much better, more focused jobs of keeping the album short, but short with above-par material. I AM...SASHA FIERCE, not so much unfortunately. This album is average for the most part, with a few moments feeling slightly below average. 3 stars from my perspective; DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE and B'DAY are stronger efforts.Diva\\".

0375707972|3.0|I will preface this by saying that my parents are both Holocaust survivors, so I was expecting a lot from this little novel which was written in acts as is a play.  The first \\"act\\" described a very intense relationship, obsessive in nature for one and passive for the other party; the time was post World War II and the place was Germany.  An adult man described his youthful experience, but even the man at 15 seemed to be aged.  I had no previous knowledge of either the book or the film, I just saw this at the library and checked it out, knowing that a film was to soon be released.  No character in this book gave me enough to care about them and no event surprised me, rather I felt that my expectations were repeatedly confirmed.  The conflict was not really resolved, things just happened and then the next followed, not really building into a climax.  I wonder if the translation was the weak link.  I also wonder if the book was titled something other than, \\"The Reader,\\" would I then not been able to figure out the bottom line of the story.  Philosophically speaking, I also thought the book was weak and could have been deepened.  Had the first act not been so graphically sexual in nature, this story could be on the high school reading list for Holocaust studies, followed by a discussion of the effects of war, any war, on the common person's struggle for survival in inhumane times.  I will see the film because I am very curious to see if it is shown in three acts in a linear representation and how much time is devoted to Act 1.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I recently purchased this movie for my daughter.  It is one of her favorites.  She has High School Musical One and has seen this one and the third.  All are excellent movies for her age group.  I have bought from Amazon in the past and thus far you have not disappointed me.  This one arrived relatively fast.
B001FEA9QU|4.0|this is a good cd i had lost all hope when the st.anger cd came out, but it seems they are trying to redeem themselves. i really liked it myself it's still different from the old metallica, but still heavy and good you can it's the real metallica when you listen to it. they even had lead guitar solo's again.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|I'm a 40 year old professor and die-hard Star Wars fan.  That said, I think mostly George Lucas shouldn't be allowed to touch his own material, 'cause he can't cast, can't direct, and is a poor writer.  But man what a great conceptualist he is!  Thankfully, on this project, he did just that and let the others do the casting, directing, and writing.  It's great fun.  The animation is beautiful (especially in Blu-Ray hi-def), the voice acting excellent, and the story is fun. I love this era, when Jedi were Jedi and the world wasn't quite so bad, and it's fun to see my favorite characters run around it.  It's a great movie, a lot of fun, and the critical reviews were, for my money, really pretentious claptrap.
B001GQACGO|2.0|A little disappointed.  I have loved Beyonce since she started with Destiny's Child.  She is by far the best female entertainer out right now.  Her concert is amazing!  However, I am disappointed with this effort.  The Sasha Fierce side is really strange to me.  It does not feel like Beyonce.  On some songs she is coming off as a man....with the 'yo shorty's' and that sort of stuff.  I usually can listen to all of Beyonce's album's straight through, but I think I only like 3 songs on the Sasha Fierce side......the other album is better, but I am still confused at why she put out this many garbage songs.  I still love you Beyonce, but the next album shouldn't be you pretending to be a boy or a teenager.  You're 27, married.....not 16 with the yo shorty's, and hustler's.
B001GKJ2FM|2.0|I absolutely adored this movie in theaters and am a big fan.  I was very excited my sister got this for me for Christmas but the transfer to fullscreen is just horrible.  There is so much \\"pan and scan\\" that its distracting and half the time someone will say his or her line and you can even see them say it because they got cut off off-screen.  Even my non-movie-buff friends said it distracted them.  Get the widescreen instead.
B000002LIM|5.0|Danny Elfman gave an award winning composition for this film and rightfully so.  To me the score for the film is as important as the film itself.  I was raised watching the movie and have always loved Batman and the score for the 89 film just brings up feelings of time forgotten.  So if you like the movie or Danny Elfman's style of Composing than is a definite buy, as for others is you enjoy classical music this also a very compelling score, with many highs, lows and the always powerful that Elfman brings.  So dont buy if you didnt like the movie, or dont like Elfman.

B001782N4A|1.0|I have to agree with the other 2 reviewers. Save your money - don't buy this.  This R2D2 USB Hub DOES NOT move its head (as advertised).  In addition, mine has the word DEMO on the front of it.  I bought this from ABC Toys.   I will never buy from them again.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have an SB900 and agree with all the positive comments posted in other reviews, however I want to challenge those who are posting stories about thermal shutdown to supply some additional information about what situations really cause the flash to shutdown.      I've been using my SB900 for several months now, and I've never experienced a problem with the unit shutting down, so I thought I'd try a simple test.     I installed a set of brand new lithium ion batteries in my SB900, set it to full power manual mode, and hit the flash button manually as soon as the ready light lit - that's about one full-power shot every 1 or 2 seconds. I did this until the batteries were drained (that is, until it got to be about 10 seconds between flashes - that's a few hundred full-power flashes in a row).     Never once did the thermal protection circuit kick in...in fact, the temperature display barely moved for the first 50-100 shots, and throughout the test, even when I could feel the batteries getting warm, it never went much above the 50% mark. My test was indoors at an ambient temperature of about 70 degrees.     I tried other settings - repeat flash, flash with my D3 firing at maximum continuous speed, etc. But I could never even come close to driving the flash to shutdown. So perhaps Nikon fixed the issue, I'm just plain lucky - or it has to do with the type of batteries or maybe other accessories used.     With this issue out of the way, I'm able to give the unit an unqualified 5 star rating as it's simply the most capable and easy to use unit I've ever owned.

B001GZ6QBU|1.0|This is easily the most overrated movie of all time. It's full of literally hundreds of lapses in plot, logic, realism, consistency, fidelity to the comics, etc...<br /><br />Christian Bale and not-Katie-Holmes have attended the Matrix School of Non-Acting. Morgan Freeman plays the SAME CHARACTER THAT HE HAS PLAYED IN EVERY MOVIE THAT HE HAS EVER BEEN IN. The plot is simply impossible to follow and has holes ranging from the timing of the bank robbery to the decision to blame Batman for deaths that he could not have possibly caused (like the driver of the car that was transporting Harvey). Batman can fall from literally any height and suffer no injuries whatsoever as long as he lands on a car. The cars in Gotham City are apparently made of pillows. Gun barrels seems to be made of similarly flimsy material. Cutting someone's cheek open kills them instantly. The Joker is the most inconsistent character ever written. He wants to kill Batman, then he doesn't. He has some high-minded ideology about Gotham deserving a \\"better class of criminal\\", then has no ideology except wanting to watch the world burn. He hatches impossibly elaborate plans and plots that would put even the Riddler to shame, then talks about how he has no plans and just likes to annoy people who do have them. WTF. The \\"save Harvey or save not-Katie-Holmes\\" thing was a TOTAL ripoff of the Green Goblin's similar stunt in Spider-Man 1... which was, in turn, a ripoff of a similar scene in Batman Forever. Harvey's conversion to the \\"dark side\\" was even more sudden and unconvincing than Anakin's in Revenge of the Sith (\\"Let's see, do I kill the guy who killed my girlfriend, or kill the guy who tried to save her? Gee, that's a tough one! I think I'll toss a coin to decide\\"). The only believable thing about Two-Face was the makeup/CGI job, which was outstanding and flawless, and is the REAL Oscar material of the movie. The nonsense with the ferry boats was cheap and annoying, and carried no real suspense. And instead of winding up to a climax, the story just dragged on and on and on... and on. And on.<br /><br />The Joker of the comic books had genuinely white skin and green hair as a result of a toxic chemical bath, used lethal pranks like the acid-squirting flower and a joy buzzer that electrocuted people, and liked to use a special gas/venom that caused its victims to laugh themselves to death. The Tim Burton/Jack Nicholson Joker lived up to this. The Chis Nolan/Heath Ledger Joker is just some deranged guy in makeup who has nothing to do with the comic books. Of course, neither of them came close to Mark Hamill in the animated series, but that's a whole different discussion...<br /><br />All of this covers less than ten percent of what is wrong with The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The whole thing is a mess and a disappointment.f winding up to a climax, the story just dragged on and on and on... and on.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|Map of the Problematique was the single that introduced me to Muse last Fall, and from the intensity and brilliance of that one song I wondered if it was the band's only great song.  My fears were groundless.    Black Holes and Revelations is one brilliant album from start to finish. The eccentric Take a Bow kicks off the music and the album finishes with the equally eccentric, epic, and wonderful Knights of Cydonia.    Starlight is the anthem song of the album, and it fights to take first place as the best song on it.    The CD is fantastic through and through.
0890090572|5.0|I've already reviewed all of these wonderful stories in seperate reviews, but I just want to add here what a delight it was to read them in their original form.  These pages are facsimiles of the Strand magazine, where Arthur Conan Doyle published many of his early Sherlock Holmes stories.  The original illustrations by Sidney Paget are reproduced as well.  This volume is a keeper.
0743270754|5.0|This is the best book ever.  I read it before when I got it from the library, and it was one of those books that I just had to own.  It made me fall in love with Lincoln.  Doris Kearns Goodwin's writing is wonderful.  Reading this book allowed me to get to know him, I had a visceral feeling about him.  I highly recommend this book, it has become one of my 5 most loved reads.      ...and it became relevant for me in today's time after it was made known that Obama had read the book, and was picking his cabinet based on some of Abraham Lincoln's values as laid out in this book.  Loving this book as I did, I felt I knew something about Obama, if it moved him to bring something from Abraham Lincoln and his presidency into our time.      Thank you Doris Kearn Goodwin for this most amazing book.  I hope everyone who reads this book loves it as much as I did.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is one of the best family movies I've ever seen that ALSO has a bit of a scary horror vibe.  You know, when aliens supposedly make a crash landing in a farmers barn in the middle of the night, and the farmer hears this and runs outside slowly with a shotgun ready to unload.  That sort of happens here, except, instead of an insane farmer, it's a little boy with an older brother and younger sister.    I liked how the kids kept the alien hidden from their mother.  There were some close calls though, where the mother was only one step away from finding out about the alien, but for most of the movie, E.T. was kept hidden by the kids.    The movie has good acting and really holds up well as far as family storylines go.  Also the film doesn't look old for 1982 either- the picture quality is surprisingly pretty good.      One thing I think people forget to mention about E.T. is how well done the storyline is- it actually involves people feeling emotion towards aliens and open-minded about outerspace, and the alien slowly develops the same kind of feelings for humans.  Very nice touch.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I JUST rented this movie.<br />I was pissed off within the first five minutes of watching it.<br /><br />When a movie is turned into a book you know things will be changed and messed around with, it's expected... However... They did SO much changing with this the only things that resemble the book are the characters names, the places.<br /><br />I seriously didn't make it even thirty minutes into the movie. Everything's changed in it from what I did see. Note: Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />In the book when Roran leaves to go earn money so he can ask Katrina to marry him? (It's been a while since I read the book, I think that was her name x3) Well, this time he leaves just so he won't be recruited into the army, I saw no sign of her whatsoever. The elves? No pointy ears. Saphira's egg? The only resemblance I saw between it and the book was the fact that it was blue. And don't get me started on how all the actors look.. none of them look fit to play their roles.<br /><br />And to top it all off? This movie looks like it was made for FOUR YEAR OLDS. I'm surprised I found it in the family section, and not the kids section.<br /><br />I read reviews that called this movie crappy, trust me, they're way off. It's a LOT worse than that. Don't even bother renting it. If you know someone who has the movie and you're just too curious then borrow it from them. But I SWEAR if you rent or buy this movie you WILL regret it...<br /><br />I want nothing more than to go down to Block Buster and DEMAND my money back, if I even thought there was a chance they would refund my money, I'd do it.<br /><br />Don't rent this movie, it's honestly the most butchered movie I've EVER seen.

B001H5X7I4|4.0|Whenever you sit down to watch a Ben Stiller comedy you have to realize your going to get over the top, politically incorrect, rude comedy.  Tropic Thunder is a great send-up of action films, Vietnam War films, and the actors who appear in them.  Nothing is sacred and that's what makes the film so funny.  Oddly, it's not Ben Stiller who's the funniest character in this film, but that's not unusual for films Stiller both directs and stars in. There were, however, two characters I found laugh out-loud funny. First, Less Grossman (played wonderfully over the top by Tom Cruise) is simply hilarious. Cruise should consider doing more comedy; it might just save his flagging career. Second, Robert Downey, Jr., is great as Kirk Lazarus, an actor who goes through surgery in order to look like the African-American character he's playing. At first, you're thinking this is just a little too much, but he just grows on you as the film continues.      Normally, Stiller's films are not my cup of tea, but I found Tropic Thunder to be hilarious.

I found the commentary by Dumbledore to be funny and informative at the same time the stories are just so rich they pull you in at the first page and you can't wait to get to the ending. i was sad that there were not more stories but i don't think this is the last we have heard from Joe or from our friends in the wizarding world.

Very strong; a male friend of mine asked \\"is that possible?\\" and after reading the book you see why they chose such a strong title. I felt that that the author really thought about the stereotypes that people have against women and he came across was very sensitive.<br />Third, well the book was just well researched and interesting.
0739368044|5.0|I have truly enjoyed watching this series unfold as well as seeing the progression of Christopher Paolini's writing ability. This was the most exciting of the series and I wait with baited breath for the 4th and final book..though I cannot say I want it to be the -final- one.
B000EUDAWG|3.0|I got this as a gift for Christmas, because I love spiders and Halloween.  I had high hopes for this toy.  I am disappointed that it does not work on any carpeted surfaces, and I have found that the spider reaction time is pretty slow.  I find it to be poor engineering that the spider uses one size battery and the remote uses a different size battery.  Still, it will amuse me for a while, and it occupies my cat here and there.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Enya's received quite a bit of criticism from some reviewers for not developing her style into something more fresh with this CD, but from my perspective that wasn't really the purpose of this album. This sounds like Enya- what you loved before is all here.    The nice thing about this CD is that it's a Christmas album, and Enya does a wonderful job of adapting her style to something that is authentically Christmas. That's not the easiest thing to do. How many other artists create corny-sounding, trite, contrived Christmas albums? It's very difficult to create a new sound for Christmas, because Christmas is so deeply nostalgic for the majority of us.     Yet, here, Enya accomplishes music that is wholly Enya and wholly Christmas. This was an absolute joy to hear on Christmas Eve, driving through the snow on the way to Midnight Mass. The entire collection resonates with an ethereal, silvery tone that is perfectly captured in the album artwork. O Come, O Come Emmanuel is breathtaking. I highly recommend this.
B0006213WG|5.0|Okay, anyone who associates Sum 41 with blink-182 is a retard.  Granted, I listen to some blink and like their stuff too, but this band is way different than them, and, despite 'underclass hero' and their earlier stuff, I DO NOT consider Sum 41 a pop-punk band at all.  There is almost nothing pop-punk about this album at all, and this album is amazing.    1. Intro - Pretty cool lead-in for 'No Reason', but not actually a song (7/10).    2. No Reason - Catchy chorus, and a very upbeat, yet still agressive, song.  Good start to the album (7.5/10).    3. We're All to Blame - Such an amazing, yet bipolar song.  I say bipolar because it has numerous shifts between heavy/agressive and soft.  What a shame this song didn't get the airplay it deserved as a single (9/10).    4. Angels With Dirty Faces - I LOVE the beginning to this song - it's just so dark and dismal.  This song is very agressive and metal/punk-ish.  Very underrated song (9/10).    5. Some Say - Very nice song.  The first light one of the album - very well-produced and structured, plus some simple, yet beautiful vocals (8/10).    6. The Bitter End - Such great guitar and drum work on this song.  This track is easily the band's heaviest to date (8.5/10).    7. Open Your Eyes - Best part is the guitar solo, but probably one of the least-memorable tracks on the album (6.5/10).    8. Slipping Away - VERY similar chord progression to 'Somewhere Out There' by Our Lady Peace.  Still, this a very soft, emotional track, and is very well-done.  Nice orchestra bit, too (8.5/10).    9. I'm Not the One - Starts out very Linkin Park-ish, and sounds like a hybrid of that bend as well as themselves throughout.  There's a pretty metal bridge, but this is one of my least favorites on the album (6/10).    10. Welcome to Hell - I love the way this song ends.  Overall, this song is very Offspring-like, but still with a Sum feel.  Very punk, but nothing special (7/10).    11. Pieces - Don't know why the hell they named it 'Pieces'and not 'Perfect', but despite the naming faux-pas, this song is terrific.  Soft but powerful and one of my favorites from this band (9/10).    12. There's No Solution - While 'I'm to the One' was kind of like Linkin Park, this song is a bit too similar for my liking (6/10).    13. 88 - This song is absolutely amazing.  It starts off agressive, then transitions into a nice, softer piano bit, and then into a pop-punkier verse, and, after awhile, turns totally metal.  The drumming in this song, like in the whole album, is fantastic.  The metal part of this song is some of the best work Sum has ever produced.  The last two minutes are all filler, no killer, but the other three minutes of the song make up for it (9.5/10).
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Possibly the greatest album of this millennium. Sigur Ros continues to reinvent themselves and release music so beautiful it is 'ethereal' as they have often been pegged. There is no other band (and will be no other band) like this ever.
B000R7GKQE|1.0|I love this show an decide buy this box on amazon because the boxes in USA are better then the boxes here in Brazil. But I have a surprise when I put the second season in dvd player and discovered that this season don't have subtitles in portuguese.
B000002OX7|5.0|There are few more perfect albums in Rock's history than WHO'S NEXT by the Who.  Oddly enough,  it's basically the result of the band trying to pick up the pieces of a failed project.  Pete Townshend in an effort to top the ever popular Rock Opera TOMMY,  conceived a multi-media blitz called LIFEHOUSE that grew ever more complicated until it finally blew up in his face.<br /><br />Townshend ended up with a collection of perfectly realized songs that summed up the post-Woodstock feel of the youth better than any of his peers.  Flawlessly produced by Glyn Johns, it contains some of the best music that the Who would ever make, and would provide numerous staples for their live show such as BABA O'REILLY, BEHIND BLUE EYES, BARGAIN and THIS SONG IS OVER.  The album, thanks to the use of a repeating synthesizer line (one of the first uses by a rock band), creates almost a suite on  disillusionment of counter-culture youth.  All four members of the band contribute fine performances, from Daltrey's powerful vocals, check out his great scream at the crescendo of WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN, to Keith Moon's powerfully cascading drums.  Entwhistle delivers his usual strong basslines and horn support, as well as his song MY WIFE, which acts as comic relief.  Townshend besides writing the great songs, kicks in with some great vocals and his trademark guitar detonations.<br /><br />One problem I have with the remastered version is that it adds extra songs that take away from the magic of the initial release.  Though these songs in themselves are pretty good, they dilute the impact of the original nine songs.  It's like ordering a pizza at the end of a perfect meal.  It's a minor quibble though, as the beauty of technology is that you can either program the CD to include just the first nine if you desire of you could just shut the thing down after WON'T GET  FOOLED AGAIN echoes into the distance.
0956010903|5.0|My husband gave me this for Christmas to add to my Harry Potter collection.  When I opened this, I was struck by how beautifully done this book and the case were done!  It is really awesome and my husband thought so too.  The detail of the book cover with the gems are perfect and I love the envelope of prints.<br />Don't hesitate, this book is awesome for yourself or anyone who is a Harry Potter lover!
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Any movie with Angelina Jolie I intend to watch. I finally got around to renting the film only to be disappointed by its lack of a plot. Of course, most action films are big on action and small on plot, but this one seriously lacked on plot. I am giving this 3/5 stars because I love the acting by Jolie and Freeman.   The protagonist, while lovable, is a little too unbelievable as a killer assassin and while he learns \\"the twist\\" at the end, its a plot twist that is easily predictable.  In short, watch for the action and forget the mind-numbing plot.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Bash! Boom! Wallop! And really who doesnt love that? Everyone's favorite time traveling, word loving, manic-timelord is back in his fourth series from the BBC. This series hit the ground running whether it was aboard a voyage of the damned. Through the hellish fires of pompeii. Figthing the universe stockily cloned-potato faced soldiers,Saving people from the shadows in a library, to the being overwhelmed by the incomprehensible(sp?) on board a space tour across the diamond planet; Midnight. To finally facing the darkness in that of a foe that he tangled with back in the 70's who was long thought dead. Oh, and if that were not enough...He managed the meet Agatha Christie and in the process solved a murder mystery!     Oh Yes, the Doctor had quite the season. David Tennant fires on all cylinders as always playing with emotion with such liquidiosidity (New word?.. OH Yes!) that he radiates verisimilitude(Sp?). Along with a new companion Donna. Played by the wonderful Catherine Tate who is known mainly for comedy an does some of that this series, plays the drama as naturally. it's not over the top, it's human, heartbreaking and amazing to watch. OH and for good measure...a few former companions show up. A Former Doctor as well. The stakes are raised and theres a consistent question that is raised that had not been raised before. What if the Doctor could choose who lives or dies? What would that make him? Or not make him? The season every episode has that question as that as it's underlying theme. Ultimately, this series was amazing. It starts off in a classic doctor who way, and the series ends in much of the same way. All in all. Bash! Boom! Wallop! indeed.
0316010669|3.0|Ok I read the other book - Tipping Point and said I wasted my time so why did I read this one?  Good question!  In the end I was trying to figure out if my sometime \\"Shoot from the hip\\" method of decision making I use when under pressure is flawed or not.  In the end Malcolm tells us in some situations yes it is perfectly reasonable to make a decision in a \\"blink\\" but in others more than \\"one blink\\" is necessary.  Gee thanks for the insight.      The best thing about the book it gave me renewed confidence in making quick decisive decisions.  That in fact, there are many things that make up our decision making thought process and sometimes it's not possible to explain your answer.  In other cases it would take a team of people weeks to prove your \\"blink\\" decision.
0060763280|2.0|This book has some good concepts to get you thinking however it also contains many negative attributes.  The author goes through lengthy, wordy, and poorly written examples to teach the difference between them [the millionaires] and you.  He makes many statements but cites no references to back them up leaving you feeling as though they're an opinion.  It seems that he starts each new lessen with \\"at the millionaire mind intensive seminar i teach...\\" which gets VERY old.  As the book's end nears he pushes his seminar and book even more.  He encourages you to tell 100 people about the book including friends, family, and acquaintances.  He then tells you that you must sign up for his seminar and any reason you can think not to sign up is only an excuse.  He uses the lessons taught earlier in the book to rationalize why your track to becoming a millionaire is not complete without his seminar.  At this point you feel like the entire book was ramping up just to sell you his seminars.  I would not recommend this book to anyone nor will I let anyone borrow it .  If you want inspiration, Rich dad poor dad was a much, much better book.        My advice is to borrow or check this book out at a library if you are so set on reading it.  Otherwise, you could nearly gleen everything this book has to say by reading some of the top rated reviews.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|this was an excellent purchase for me. it came on time and speedy and was in excellent condition- no damages from shipping and still in the shrink wrap. was not what i had expected but still a great movie - much better then Hulk.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Die hard 1 is a classic. Die hard 2 & 3 just plain sucked! I didn't think old Brucey could pull it off again. Then as the movie progressed I found myself laughing more and rooting for him again as I did in the original. sure I would have changed a couple of unbelievable feats, but isn't that what movies are created for...to escape the real world! I wouldn't say this was better then the original. I would say it was just as entertaining. Im glad I bought it. I wont tell you the price cause I don't want my review to be deleted. But suffice to say I got the 2 disc version really cheap and it was worth every penny!
B000NY12LO|5.0|I am may not have read all the classics but this book has a lot of classic plots. i have read some of the other reviews for this book and some have been not well thought through at all. This book is about a teenage girl named Josie and her &#34;friend&#34; Peter and what you would sacrafice for a friend. This is a classic topic for books as I presume because Ive only read a few. One review I read was very mean to be put simply. I would like you to write a book people who thought this book was bad to write one yourself. Anyhow the reason i liked this book so much was beacause it showed that no matter who you are and what the circumstances that friendship will prevail. Or we like to think.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Every time one of my favorite books is made into a movie I worry they are going to screw it up. Only once in a coon's age do they actually make it better. For me this was one of those times.<br /><br />Others have given plot summaries so I will pass. I do want to say I am really impressed with the casting, especially Robert DeNiro. Watching DeNiro in his role is simply worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />If you have ever enjoyed fantasy at all, buy this movie. You will not be disappointed.
143911000X|5.0|this was an excellent purchase for me. it came on time and speedy and was in excellent condition- no damages from shipping. was very entertaining and for anyone who watches the show they will love it that much more. my boyfriend loved it.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|I'm not going to waste your time telling you about the movie, lots of other reviewers have done that better than I could. I just wanted to be sure it was mentioned that if you buy the 3 disc special edition copy that you know the digital copy requires you to have a dvd drive in your computer. We bought Journey to the Center of the Earth that came with the digital copy. You just put it in the cd drive of the computer and you downloaded the movie from a web page to your computer. Wall-E however, requires you to have a dvd drive. This was not mentioned when I read the description (or maybe I missed it) but now I paid extra money for something I can't use. So, I wanted to spare someone else out there with an old computer that wants to watch this on their system the same experience. Hope it helps someone.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful film, and this edition is no different... providing extras and interesting commentary, new songs as well as singalongs, and more.  Worth noting is that the extras are primarily adult-oriented, other than the singalongs and the Wonderland Party.  The Disc 2 features, like 'An Hour in Wonderland' are more informational and historically based, something that I'm not sure that children would enjoy as much as long-time fans of the film might.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great DVD with interesting features, and of course, a wonderful film.
B000XYNFD2|5.0|I am a novice watch collector, however I have one major rule - the watch must be below $500. This is not only because I am not Mr. Deep Pockets, but also I have issues with spending money. You could say I am a VALUE novice watch collector.<br /><br />I have been wanting a Sub-mariner watch for some time, sure the Rolex is the CROWN (king of the hill) - but to meet my rule ($500) - it would seem that Rolex is not going to make the cut. There are many Sub-mariner look-alikes.<br /><br />Now comes the value - it's not just about looks, it's about substance. Sure - the Invicta 8926 or other similar watches have the looks, but what about the substance.<br /><br />Think about this - Rolex is more than just looks, the name equates to quality and substance. From the movement, crystal, to workmanship.<br />My goal was to find a Sub-mariner - that HAD the Rolex QUALITY! Finding the looks was easy, finding the quality - well that was the hard thing to do.<br /><br />After doing tons of research - Invicta 9937 not only had the looks - but the quality for the price is very surprising.<br /><br />Let's break it down.<br /><br />1. Movement (9937 - Swiss Movement) - many people don't even think about movements, they are just interested in the looks - there is nothing wrong with that, but there is a difference. Many Sub-mariner look-a-likes run on Quartz (battery operated) - there are some excellent quartz movements out there, but this review  is about findings a watch that meets the standards of the Sub-mariner (of which Rolex has set the stage).<br />First, the watch is an automatic (traditionally watches come in 3 varieties - hand wind, automatic, and quartz) - the Sub-mariner is a traditional automatic (or self-winding watch). The movement in the 9937 is a 26 jewel ETA 2824, a popular Swiss movement in many high-end Swiss made watches. For the 9937 to have such a movement at the cost is a darn good deal. The second hand moves in a quick-ticking fashion. If you have ever seen a Japanese automatic movement, while very nice - they seem to make a more jerky beat - this is because they have fewer beats per second, not that it is bad - but it is noticeable. The Invicta 8926 uses the Japanese movement - if you look at them side-by-side you notice the difference, which is seen by the movement of the second hand.<br /><br />2. Crystal - the 9937 uses a Sapphire crystal, rather than hardened mineral crystal. This is another big treat which you would only find on the high-end Sub-mariner watches by Tag, Rolex, or Omega. The use of a sapphire crystal is almost scratch resistance compared to hardened mineral. Additionally the raised Cyclops magnifier is no small affair - it stands prominent at the 3 o'clock marker over the date.<br /><br />3. FACE /BEZEL - if you are looking for the Rolex Sub-mariner - this is as close as it gets. The hour markers are raised has silver surrounds around the luminescent markers - this separates the 9937 from many other imitators that just paint in the luminescent and shows an extra thought in the production. Of course the Invicta wing logo appears and the second hand has the Invicta logo at one end. Invicta - while making their own version of the sub-mariner has no problem showing off their product with pride. So that does reflect a difference - but a positive one in my book. Additionally - Swiss Movement is written along the bottom to indicate that it's ticking with real Swiss precision - not just any movement. The bezel insert only has the minute hash marks for the first 10 minutes - something also more distinctive with the sub-mariner line. The numbers are done in the traditional block fashion. The serrations on the bezel are not as sharp as the Rolex version - but are found in this model.  Note - many imitators use a scalloped edge instead of serration. Again - the 9937 pays homage to the sub-mariner.<br /><br />4. CASE  - the case on this watch is thick and heavy - it's solid, with a combination of brushed and polish. But what really stands out - more so than even the Rolex, is the clear back on the watch - you can see the movement and engraved INVICTA in the weight that moves (to automatically wind the watch). The back is a class act affair. It is stamped &#34;Pro-Diver 200 Meters&#34;, &#34;Sapphire Crystal&#34;, &#34;Stainless Steel 316L&#34;, &#34; Swiss Movement&#34;, &#34;Invicta&#34;, &#34;Model 9937&#34; - inside the clear case it is stamped 26 jewel Swiss made. There is no doubt the pride they took in making a solid watch front to back.<br /><br />5. Bracelet -  Here is where the Invicta actually surpasses the Rolex it pay homage too. The bracelet seems more solid and heavier than the Rolex. Granted I don't own a Rolex, but have tried them on and compared them - so this is just an observation. You FEEL this bracelet and it's solid. The clasp is SOLID stainless steel - not a pressed-stamped out clasp. It's very nice.<br /><br />So what do you get?<br />For just over $300 you get a very solid watch, sapphire crystal, Swiss movement, solid stainless steel construction and bracelet. The Invicta 8926 is nice (for $100) it has the looks - but not the quality. You know you are wearing this watch.<br /><br />Rolex ($5000 plus) - Their own movement, Sapphire Crystal, Stainless Steel.<br /><br />Invicta 9937 ($300) - Swiss ETA movement, Sapphire Crystal, Stainless Steel, Clear Back, Solid Bracelet.<br /><br />Invicta 8926 ($100) - Japanese movement, Mineral Crystal, Stainless - stamped bracelet.<br /><br />I took it to our local jeweler - who caries Tag, Rolex, Omega, etc. for resizing of the bracelet. He gave it back to me and asked what I paid for it. I said it was a gift - but it was a little over $300. He said that it was easily a $1500 watch  and would give his Tag, Rolex, or Omega a solid run for the money. He winked and said - don't tell anyone about it - because it will hurt my business. If that doesn't tell you this is a steal for the price - I don't know what does.<br />______________________________________________<br /><br />UPDATE: SEP 2015<br /><br />It has been almost 7 years since I received this watch as a gift from my wife.<br /><br />The watch is still going with NO problems. I have worn it skiing, diving, sailing, camping, yard work, traveling, and pretty much under every condition you can think of. Frankly - I have beaten the snot out  of this watch with NO PROBLEMS!!!<br /><br />Because it is NOT a $5k Rolex - I don't worry too much about it - I just wear it.  If it was a Rolex I would be babying it and afraid to treat  it as I have treated  this watch. Not that Rolex can't handle it, but it is just a $5 dollar on your wrist.<br /><br />Since this review (almost 7 years ago) I have been fortunate enough to expand my watch collection significantly, which even includes some luxury watches. I do not have a Rolex, but I do own a Blancpain and an Omega.  I have also started collecting the Precista line of watches (which pay homage to older watches for a great price). My three prize watches are the Blancpain fifty fathom, Omega Speedmaster, and my 1968 Seiko 6105 diver - but these watches I am very careful with and only wear them on special occasions.<br /><br />I never bought another Invicta - I also found out that not all Invicta's are the same and made by different manufactures.  I can only speak to this particular watch model.<br /><br />My go to - every day watch - remains this Invicta.<br /><br />I stand by the fact that for $300 dollars you will be hard press to find a submariner that is as solid, well built, and lasting as this watch. Sure you can step up to a mid-luxury brand sub-mariner and you may argue that it is better quality - but buying a $1500 dollar Submariner is still not a Rolex and what are you really getting for $1500 that you can't get for $300.<br /><br />Buy a Omega for a Speedmaster<br />Buy a Tag for a Monaco<br />Buy a Blancpain for a Fifty Fathom<br /><br />But if you want to buy a Submariner- you buy a Rolex or you buy a replica that is built like a tank and the best value for the money for a submariner that is NOT a Rolex is this watch.<br /><br />I certainly appreciate the VALUE of high end brands and that they can HOLD value. That is NOT the point of this watch - this watch is meant to wear without worrying!<br /><br />I expect it to last just as well for the next 7 years as it did that last.going with NO problems.

0316067601|5.0|I bought the book on the recommendation of a friend - and once I began I simply couldn't put it down.  It brought an in depth and complete first hand account of BUD/s training as well as his experiences and thoughts around his experience in the Hindu Kush, as well as life since there.  I've never read such a riveting account of actual special ops action, as well as the tragic fate that some of these men suffered.    Simply a fantastic book.  A must read.
1439102813|4.0|If you were an educated psychology professor of linguistics at Harvard and were diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) and only 50 yrs old? Professor Alice Howland is a physically fit woman, in a routine of running and exercise, so her body is fit and now her mind is going. Absolutely frightening. At first just forgetting little things, but then WORDS of all things, what she is best at, in the middle of a speech, just leave her stalled and frustrated.<br />This is a haunting, disturbing look at how one would feel having to face this and what it does to those who love you.  Even planning ahead for yourself, as Alice does, writing things down, instructions to follow while she is of sound mind, are impossible feats later, when you can't remember why or what you wanted to accomplish. As a reader, you won't forget Alice very easily.  Recommended reading for anyone that can take the frustration and sadness of it all.<br /><br />Another recommendation with a bit more \\"story\\" to it on the same subject is Barbara Delinsky's \\"Shades of Grace.\\"  I read it years ago and still remember it as an eye-opener to EOAD
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Let me start by saying that this review applies only to the single disc edition. It comes without a whole heck of a lot of bells and whistles, but still has just enough to keep you satisfied.    Now for our main feature, the film itself. Before I saw it, I was certain the hype surrounding the film was just attributed to Heath Ledger's untimely demise. Boy, was I wrong. The acting performance turned in by Ledger was quite possibly the best I have ever seen. Christian Bale is also sensational in lead. Mix those two together with the always stellar Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and the result is bound to be smashing.    The sound and special effects were also top notch. The explosions felt fantastic and all the destruction seemed to be in sync. The editing and directing hit me as spot on. The plot mixed in the traditional love triangle/superhero's dilemma very well. My one complaint about the story line is that it didn't pack a lot in the surprise department and perhaps the film ran on a wee bit long. Beyond that, it is one of the very best movies I've ever seen.    While this film certainly packs a punch in the action and suspense department, the undertones of drama and philosophy come on particularly strong towards the end. This isn't just shoot 'em up and it isn't a melancholy love story. It's... something far better.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|Overall, this is quite a nice piece of equipment.  It is better than the SB800 in so many ways.  Controls and adjustments are much easier to use, especially the Master/Remote setup.  I like it and would buy it again.  Only issue I have is that the unit can overheat if you try to click off a lot of pic's in succession - and will not flash.  Seems to heat up faster than the SB800 and it cost me a few shots until I realized I had to pace myself.  The SB800's work well as remotes and with the prices falling on them, it might be a good time to add a few and take full advantage of the Nikon Creative Lighting System.
B00006AW2P|5.0|In the early 60's, Elvis was in a daze after the army, no longer in control of his own music, Buddy Holly dead, Chuck Berry jailed briefly and bounced off the radio,  Jerry Lee Lewis was \\"disgraced\\", his career in limbo, and other roots rock and rollers were suffering under the heavy weight of Lightweights on the radio, Fabian, Steve and Edey, etc. And, then here comes the Rolling Stones, handing us back our own music-Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and the Blues greats that were Never heard on white radio. Their versions of these songs were often superior to the originals, and it's an important milestone in rock and roll that they kept this music alive. Of course, the Beatles tipped their hat to Carl Perkins, but the Stones breathed much needed life into rock and roll, as it was fizzling out in the US. As the saying goes, The Beatles wanted to Hold Your Hand, but the Stones wanted to Burn Your Town! Hats off to the Stones in the Brian Jones era. Great stuff indeed.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|MISS POTTER is a glorious, whimsical family film.  A biography of the life and times of the beloved children's author, Beatrix Potter, this film brings to life her incredible world and vivid imagination.  Sweet, joyful, and touching, MISS POTTER is not to be missed.<br /><br />Beatrix Potter lived a unique and rich life inside her head.  Her friends, Peter Rabbit, Jemimah Puddle-duck, Benjamin Bunny, Tom Kitten, and a host of others, jumped out of her fertile, active mind and on to the water-color pages she so lovingly painted.  A spinster at the turn of the century, Beatrix Potter over came her quirkiness and shyness to become the world's best known children's author.  By a sheer twist of fate, she was thrown together with a publisher who believed in her and her work.  She remained innocent and naive throughout most of her life, unaware of her fame and her fortune, and under the thumb of a mother who did not understand her or believe in her.  Eventually, she finds her own way, and the children everywhere, and the entire world, are much richer for it.<br /><br />MISS POTTER is beautifully acted with stunning locations.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is simply delightful in the title role, and Ewan McGregor is outstanding as the one person who believes in her completely.  They are magical together, making this film a joy to behold.  The lush settings and locations are gorgeous; the colors leap off the screen, enveloping the audience in Beatrix Potter's life.<br /><br />Multiple generations of my family were touched by this this celebration of Beatrix Potter on a quiet Christmas afternoon.  Entertaining and beautiful, MISS POTTER is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  My mother-in-law, Suzanne, would have adored this film.
B00009W0WM|3.0|First, let's go with the performances of some of the leading<br />characters, and let me start by stating that most of the<br />characterizations of the acting abilities of the actors in this film,<br />by critics, are often quite wrongheaded. Let us start with the three<br />top billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, Ingrid<br />Bergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband,<br />the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtually<br />all critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainly<br />because the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But,<br />from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the best<br />acting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because it<br />is the most restrained and understated, however, it usually gets<br />dismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionally<br />stiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in power<br />precisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural for<br />a man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film,<br />and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the political<br />implications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do most<br />blatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrained<br />performance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare that<br />scene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned Paths<br />Of Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front of<br />drunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until she<br />starts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love.<br />The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along with<br />the 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured by<br />carnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure and<br />placement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mere<br />entertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated,<br />without the character (in his physical being and internal composition)<br />of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prose<br />melodrama.<br /><br />Now, contrast Henreid's Victor with Bogart's Rick. Rick is rather one<br />dimensional, despite the film's early evocations of depth. His<br />attraction to Ilsa seems quite superficial; after all, in the flashback<br />scenes in Paris, and even those in Casablanca, does he ever speak of<br />higher purpose? Despite some wittier lines....is Rick Blaine sufficiently different from the Sam Spade Bogart essayed in The Maltese Falcon, or any of the rather stolid thugs he played throughout the 1930s? No.<br /><br />That brings me to the last and least of the trio of star performances:<br />Ingrid Bergman's rather mediocre portrayal of Ilsa Lund. First, it's<br />not a bad performance, but it's nowhere near great. One need only look<br />at contemporaneous performances by a Katherine Hepburn, Joan Crawford,<br />Bette Davis, or even Judy Garland, to see how much Bergman pales in<br />contrast. And, it's rather apparent that Ilsa really loves Victor, not<br />Rick, because anyone who's ever really been in love knows that she<br />would have stayed with Rick, no matter.<br /><br />But the biggest thing that prevents the film from greatness is that it<br />simply plumbs no depths, it simply has no great themes. There is<br />nothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically or<br />performance-wise, that can put it in a class with many of the other<br />highly praised great films of the past. Seen next to Citizen Kane,<br />Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, La Dolce Vita, or 2001: A Space Odyssey,<br />Casablanca comes up short, way short.<br /><br />On the plus side, Casablanca is quite a modern film, in terms of pacing<br />(and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelve<br />minutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for good<br />or ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them under<br />your belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in to<br />its vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if,<br />objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting.<br /><br />Film critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Casablanca was, 'the most<br />decisive exception to the auteur theory,' but he was wrong, and wrong<br />for several reasons. First, auteur theory generally applies toward<br />films or filmmakers that are great, and while Casablanca has been<br />claimed as great, no one has ever made that claim for Curtiz. Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group; thus Sarris's very admission that Casablanca had more than one 'auteur' makes it also outside the scope of auteur theory, by definition, not an exception to the theory....the film lacks vision, and is a stylistic and narrative hodgepodge. Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana. Also, the lower the expectations you have of the film, the more entertaining it seems. Ah, the flicker of illusion!ilm, in terms of pacing  (and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelve  minutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for good  or ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them under  your belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in to  its vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if,  objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This CD was recommended to me (I was also attracted to the cool-looking cover) and I'm glad it was. It totally rocks with catchy, addictive tracks. Actually, it took me awhile to get into it, except the opening number which I loved from the beginning. I thought the songs sounded the same but, upon further listens, I realized how wrong I was. I'm catching things in the tracks that set them apart and am realizing that all 13 songs are, on their own, solid (well, except for \\"Watch Over You,\\" which I don't care much for). Intelligent lyrics, too.  Now, Blackbird is rarely far from my CD player and \\"Before Tomorrow Comes\\" is one of my all-time favorite tracks.    \\"Ties That Bind\\"--Seriously rocks! Loved this track since I listened to the preview on Amazon.  \\"Come To Life\\"--Power verses. I like the verses better than the chorus. The entire song is good, but the chorus just seems a bit ordinary.  \\"Brand New Start\\"--Slower track. Almost a power country feel. Well, if you like Daughtry, you'll like this one--especially when the chorus kicks in.  \\"Buried Alive\\"--Now we're rockin'! The guitar brings some individuality to the track and Myles Kennedy shows off his vocal versatility by displaying some high-pitched vulnerability--\\"I'm cold and I'm so afraid that I'm too weak and I can't change.\\"  \\"Coming Home\\"--I like the timing in the chorus. It sets this track apart.  \\"Before Tomorrow Comes\\"--At first, I wasn't crazy about this song.  I thought it was but a little contrived and more like other songs you hear out there. It made sense to me that this was the album's third single. It is powerful with inspirational lyrics. Well, the more I listen to it, the more I skip to that track over and over.  I has become my favorite track on this CD.  What was I missing before?  \\"Rise Today\\"--Probably the most recognizable song on the CD. It was used as the theme for WWE Unforgiven 2007. It definitely is a motivational number--\\"Won't you rise today and change this world?\\"    \\"The Blackbird\\"--This song must mean a lot to the band. It is not only the name of the album but its lyrics are printed on a separate page. It was written in memory of Mark Morse who owned a guitar shop and sold Myles Kennedy his first guitar. Mighty dirge--Morse was given a powerful send-off.  \\"One By One\\"--Excellent, one of my favorites. Powerful and catchy musically, lyrically it is about those who've given their lives in war \\"for a promised land that may not be won.\\"  \\"Watch Over You\\"--Slow song. This one ended up on pop radio as the album's second single. This track is actually my least favorite. It is just ordinary to me, nothing really stands out about it. I'm glad I didn't judge the album by the singles as I may not have bought it.  \\"Break Me Down\\"--Solid rocker. Excellent from beginning to end.  \\"White Knuckles\\"--Heavy rocker as the title would suggest. Another of my favorites, especially the chorus--\\"The Damned are done believing the cursed can dream no more.\\"  \\"Wayward One\\"--The song reminds me of \\"Bourree\\" which I know from Jethro Tull, but I realize was taken from Bach or some other classical composer. I don't know if that was their intention, but I always think of that song when I hear it.
0060899190|5.0|I love this book and idea. I go to the website occasionally and cry every time with tears of joy, sadness, pride or anger. Reading some entries make me want to open my life to others and show those in my life just how special they are to me. I also like the fact that the postcards have to be original... nothing like creative juices to help with healing.    I still have to send out my own secret.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I've been fortunate enough to see Emmy live a couple of times over the years.  She is simply one of the finest artists around and her work just keeps getting better.  Wonderful support from the McGarrigles and many others but through it all, that voice.  Terrific work.
B000HC2LIK|1.0|Unbelievably terrible movie, and a terrible transfer.  I'd go into more detail, but that would require that i think about the movie again, and i refuse to make myself do that.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Beatiful set; even the menu option is gorgeous.  The new commentary on \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" and the reunion brunch with Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, and Ron Glass should be enough for any Browncoat to make this purchase.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie..Dustin Hoffman is a terrific actor! This movie is probably where the creators of mrs. doubtfire got there inspiration from..and Bill Murray is so hilarious. PERFECT CASTING! SUCH A GREAT STORY! I LOVED DUSTIN HOFFMAN..I LOVED THE MOVIE!!!!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|It must be hell being Paul McCartney when it comes to creating a new album. Alwasys in the shadow of The Beatles, John Lennon and his own prolific body of work. His latest collaboration with Youth The Fireman's \\"Electric Arguments\\" frees McCartney from being McCartney and allows him to create one of his best albums.<br /><br />Mixing elements of ambient, bluesy rock with a tad of influence from Brian Eno, Moby and other artists allows McCartney in collaboration with his Fireman cohort Youth to create one of his most compelling albums. Every song here from \\"Sing the Changes\\" to the blues infused vocal of \\"Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight\\" are a terrific change of pace for McCartney allowing him to create some of his most unique music of his solo career.<br /><br />Take a listen to the samples. I should warn you this sounds very little like Wings, very little like the music that McCartney made in from the 80's through the 90's. That's a good thing. It's McCartney rediscovering his muse and tackling the type of stuff he really hasn't tried since the White Album.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005LELD|4.0|It's a well designed product, very compact, but sturdy. However, be aware that it vignettes very heavily on focal lengths under 24mm.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Just got this for Christmas and quickly added it to my mix for our Christmas party.  Everyone asked what I was playing.  Great for all!  Highly recommend it!
B001FB55Y4|5.0|Guy Richie has turned out the gem of his career with RockNrolla.  Perfect cast (Wilkenson should get an award for this one) incredible sound track, and a wild and wicked plot.  Unlike some of his others, this one makes it a bit easier to understand the dialects. It was the delight of my movie going month in October when it came out here in the U.S.            From reading some of the reviews that pan this movie, it is obvious that they are not familiar with Guy Richie's films, his style and his offbeat humor.  It is sort of like licorice; Some people love it some people hate it.  But for those of us who have the right mindset for Richie's style of film, this it the best one to come along in a long time.          Gerard Butler's turn in this is hysterically funny and is such a great switch from his role in 300.  No type casting trap for Gerry.  This guy can play the heck out of any role imaginable.  But if the Wild Bunch shows up again in the next Richie film, I hope Gerry is included.    DottyinCA  Riverside, CA
B000000P17|2.0|With the exception of a few standout tracks conveniently stored at the beginning, middle, and end of this generic indulgence, the incident reeks of moldy, old school hard rock homage. Fitting in shedding light on their \\"Guns\\" aspect, the \\"Roses\\" side ends up feeling rather cheated.
B00005OCMR|3.0|Let me first say, as a matter of integrity, that I was NOT born when Tron was first made and furthermore that this is a review of the movie itself, and not this particular edition. And while I was (when I was a child), and still continue to be a fan of 80's action movies with a strange depiction of technology, it really is difficult to recommend it to modern viewers.    The truth is, Tron isn't aging that well. On one hand, I feel almost obligated to say that this should be required viewing for the modern moviegoer, if not just to be introduced to the roots of the transition between brick and mortar to digital movie sets. On the other, 30 years have made the visuals almost laughable. This wouldn't be a problem if the plot consisted of more than a \\"outwit some generic baddies and kill the main antagonist\\" plot with some cheap techno-satire thrown in. It consists of little more than this.    For a cyberpunk experience more palatable to today's audience, I would feel more confident in suggesting something along the lines of Bladerunner (a film which has aged VERY well), A Scanner Darkly... even first Matrix really.    Despite my gripes, however, I must admit that this film never fails to achieve a certain degree of charm. I just suggest that maybe you rent before you buy.
B00005QENZ|2.0|2 1/2    What sounded like their most polished and accessible album at the time has not seemed to have aged so well. Asides from the major hits that came from this disc, most of the album sounds like overproduced, underwritten 90's blues-tinged arena rock.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|The reviewers who claim that Wall-e is some malicious form of clandestine liberal wacko propaganda that will warp the minds of impressionable children need to lighten up and smell the paranoia. In their worldview,  \\"Drill, Baby, Drill!\\" would be a much more inspiring premise for this film. Okay then, why not make remake the movie in your own vision, with Wall-e as a robotic uber-hero (like Ayn Rand's Howard Roark), who doesn't need anyone but himself and his intransigent force of will to help re-industrialize an economically depressed planet as he teams up with the Big and Large titans of industry, whose sweat and blood is the embodiment of the virtue of selfish egoism but also trickles down to the benefit all of mankind?    Instead of trash everywhere, oil and gas derricks and nuclear cooling towers and the smokestacks of coal plants swamp the skyline as Wall-e works on the greatest and most objectively rational project of all: the world's largest SUV production plant.    Meanwhile, after being voted off the planet, all the hippie liberals wander through space on the SS Noam Chomsky in a vessel made out of cannabis and piloted by a direct descendant of Keith Olbermann and Katrina vanden Heuvel. Seeking to return to Earth one day to force the enemies of liberalism into Marxist communes and Reeducation Camps, Eve arrives from the Chomsky, only to find instead a thriving industrious society that is so perfectly utopian that taxes and entitlements and homosexuals have all been abolished. In the closing shot, we see Wall-e as he rolls to the top of his nearly completed paragon of neoconservative values (and non-union to boot!) with Eve hovering at his side, in subjugated awe of Wall-e's infallible logic as he expounds in electronic beeps and chirps for 45 minutes, effectively deconstructing and disproving, once and for all, that vast liberal conspiracy known as global warming. And in a brief humorous parting shot of the Chomsky, the ineptitude and touchy-feely emotionalism of the left-wing wackos results in their destruction as the vessel, its inhabitants all out of marijuana and unable to grow anymore due to an ongoing labor strike, goes up in flames as Lieutenant Bill Maher IX attempts to light the ship and smoke it by driving it right into the sun. The End.    On second thought, that's not so inspiring, is it? I'll stick with the version Pixar made -- a visually stunning masterpiece with a great anachronistic soundtrack and a thought-provoking plot for adults and a magical story of friendship that my children thoroughly love and enjoy...
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I have had the turntable for a couple weeks, as of 12/26/08.  It was easy to physically install via the USB cable to my PC.  The software installed easily enough.  I would recommend following the instructions carefully and then do a reboot before attempting to record.  I have recorded about 12 albums so far.  My biggest issue is that the software defaults to saving as a \\"wav\\" file, which is huge.  Every time I use the software I have to remember to change to saving as an \\"mp3\\", which is a pain. You can record the whole side of an album and then the S/W detects the tracks.  This works about 80% of the time.  On live albums there is no quiet period between the tracks so it can't autodetect them, so you get one giant track.  You can then manually cut it into tracks using the S/W, but it is a pain.  I now just save as one track, import into iTunes, and use the Get Info to list the track names in the comments.  Overall I'd give this an A+ for value.
B000002H33|1.0|Why is this album highly praised? Was it becuase the movie OLD SCHOOL had it in the background? maybe so.Metallica sucks. The only decent albums they have are load and reload and their masterpiece ST anger. Their first 5 albums are really bad.
015206396X|5.0|There are many young adult novelists who treat their readers as if they were less than young adults. In fact, I can think of several young adult novels where the novelists skirt practical and everyday adult issues so as to not offend their readers, leaving them in a perpetual state of Alice in Wonderland innocence. Cashore's debut novel, however, is a perfect link between childhood and adult. She has captured the perfect blend of childhood naivete and adult sophistication with her prose, and all is handled with a seemingly graceful understanding of her intended audience.
B0000584V3|1.0|Heh, this Opeth band calls itself Death metal, will you guys don't know what real death metal is.<br /><br />For true death metal from Scandanavia check out: Unearth, Atreyu, Bleeding Through, and Avenged Sevenfold.
B001DHXT20|5.0|This was a Christmas present for one of my younger brothers.  If it has action, explosions, action figures or superheroes, he's GOT to have it, and \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" fits the bill.
B00008PX8P|4.0|from the most incredible version of stairway to heaven ever released to the acoustic going to california, this video rocks the whole led zeppelin world.  the sound is amazing and i found no defect with this product.  jimmy page is just plain incredible on guitar, robert plant rocks his heart out with the vocals, john paul jones backs up with bass and keyboard, and john bonham is just a beast on drums, i think only neil peart is better.  great producing by page, zeppelin will live on for a long time thru all this rap and hip hop.  i just wish they had put the song remains the same on this.    I meant to say 5 stars sorry.

0425218929|1.0|This was such a waste of my precious time. Badly written and boring. It had forensic details that made the book/series unique. I wouldn't ever read her books again.
0783240236|5.0|The DVD provided a good tie-in to my sister-in-law's Bird's Barbie Doll.  It is still one of Hitchcock's best works.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|It's got action, great actor's and a good storyline.  The special effects are good, but could be better.  Sci-Fi fans need a good show to watch, now that other SF Series seem to be dropping of the air.  This could be one for years to come, to watch.  If networks are smart enough to see the SF group that follow these shows.
B001EYGOG0|5.0|Tony Bennett never disappoints.Having the Count Basie Band was an added bonus,those musicians are ageless.  This CD was enjoyed by family & friends of all ages & I gave it for gifts.  I recommend it highly.
B000002UA9|2.0|The Beatles, one heck of a great band, millions of people are fans including me, but I am not such a big fan about this album. The Beatles, \\"Please Please Me\\", realesed in 1963 is a short snippy and poppy rock album all about relationships....YAWN.... Anyways Please Please Me was recorded in about 585 minutes and took only one day to record, it's bassicly just a CD representing the songs they played live and many of the songs on here were played live in the studio. All the songs just sound the same, theres nothing different. Please Please Me is bassicly just your average short 2:45 songs with a little guitar solo, bassicly just a normal pop album for that time. Too some this album is a classic but too me its an album, you can afford not to buy. The two only really good songs on here are, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", and \\"Twist And Shout\\". Please Please Me in my opinion is very overated and on Rolling Stone Magzines list of the 500 greatest albums of all time this album came at 39 before Pink Floyd's masterpiece, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\"? What? All in all this album is for those who like to listen to early Beatles songs or just like all that early 60s late 50s bubblegum pop stuff. If you want to buy some actullay great Beatles albums that are rock classics go for, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, The White Album, and Abbey Road. Buy those albums not this one.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|The dvd was in the wrong case it was sliding around in the case because ther wasn't enought space for it and the bonus dvd .
B000002UAF|5.0|The Beatles by this album were starting to devlop better songs, and were slowly but starting to drift away from the pop music scene. As you A Hard Days Night, is a movie and a good album, and the movie has remained a classic rock movie to this day. Of course the album, A Hard Days Night is really just the soundtrack too the movie but still deserves credit. The title track, \\"A Hard Days Night\\", is the best song on this whole album and has a good riff to it. Other good songs on here are, \\"I Should Of Known Better\\", and \\"Cant Buy Me Love\\". The good songs are enough to raise the low points on this album like, \\"If I Fell\\", and more. But this album is still pretty short, its only 29 minutes long barely even a 30 minutes. Its also still a little too poppy but deserves five stars because it has remained a classic album and movie too this day.
0316067598|5.0|Excellent book about what it takes to become Navy Seal, and a heart-felt 1st-person account of what this 4-man Seal team experienced and sacrificed in their pursuit of a high profile Taliban leader in Afghanistan.  Excellent reading, you will not be disappointed.  AAA+++
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|My 9 year old just received this for Christmas.  I am surprised to see the recommended ages listed as 6-12.  I am a grown woman and I have a hard carrying it and cocking it at the same time.  It has taken my son a lot of practice to finally get it so it does not jam.  Once you get the hang of it, it is easy and a very cool gun.  Dad (being an ex-marine) is having a great time with it as well.  I have to say it is a lot easier to handle than the Vulcan gun and less frustrating.  Overall, I recommend this gun.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|The man is a treasure and here he is, still doing it better then anyone. Backed by a stellar lineup, Jeff rips through some of his best tunes from his huge catalog. With an Australian and Japanese tour planned for 2009, we can only hope we will be hearing more from him in the new year.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Love the movie and something one can watch with kids of all ages. Watched it with my family this Christmass and they loved it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|First of all, I want to be on record as SWEARING that Brad Rowe is actually the love child of Brad Pitt and Rob Lowe... just look at him!!!    This is an easy film to like.  Much of the conflict that drives the story is internal for the characters.  The young lead is quite a good actor, displaying those conflicts with his expressions more than his words - just like most college aged boys would do.  He moves between the freedom and joy of surfing and the challenges of lower socio-economic existance.  He struggles with relationships, challenged by his desire for honesty and his fear of the consequences that truth will bring.  And through it all we see him growing, in realistic ways.    I do think the movie fails in any type of exploration of the meaning of relationships between younger and older men (if early 30's can qualify as older).  I never did quite figure out the time span covered in the film, but decided I'd like the film best if it is months rather than weeks.    The surfing and waves make great symbols of change, control, collapse.  The always sunny Southern California setting adds a quality of its own, whether at the multi-million dollar house or the places next to the refineries.    The most effective mesage taken away from the movie is how true love, if between lovers, friends, family is inclusive.  It is neediness that blocks those not seen as the fount of that satisfaction.    All a little esoteric.  This movie is a pleasure to watch.  The extras, particularly the \\"making of\\", add a lot of value.  Though, I gotta say, I still get bummed out when straight actors, even the gorgeous ones, get to play the solid gay characters.  Yeah, I know.  I want the gay actors to be able to play straight characters, and I should be consistant.  But, I am not.
1933492279|5.0|I am an avid Syd Mead fan and Daniel Simon just about matches him, possibly surpassing Syd in the form of including real, tangible models with his artwork. This helps with better conceptualizing Simon's artwork, something I wish Syd Mead included with his art. For futurists out there, this book is a MUST to have in your library! Believe me, I have spent well over $100 for books that just don't do half of what this book does. Well worth every cent spent!
1577314808|1.0|I heard about this guy several years ago but never took the time to pick up one of his books until this Christmas.  Incredible....I'm certain this man doesn't have a creative bone in his body nor does he have an original idea to discuss.  Everything, and I mean everything, has been stolen from Zen Buddhism at a minimum and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that he lifted ideas from other eastern religions and philosophies as well.  That alone wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that he doesn't appear to give credit where it is due.  A simple blurb in the introduction, or his bio' on the back page, explaining how he was \\"strongly influenced by eastern religion/philosophy\\" would suffice.  The fact that he didn't take the time to do this is disrespectful, deceptive, and plagiarism.      What he's done is comparable to writing a book entitled \\"10 Great Rules to Live By\\" and then going on to explain how one shouldn't kill, steal,  or commit adultery (you get the idea) without once mentioning the bible.  The obvious difference is that most westerners have heard of the 10 commandments but have little knowledge of Zen Buddhism.  Maybe Tolle could use this concept for his next book and peddle it to easterners.       At the end of the day if his regurgitation of Zen Buddhism, dumbed down and then spoon fed into the mouths of spiritually hungry westerners (who are too lazy to connect the dots themselves [which is 50% of the journey]) works, than who am I to bash it?  Bottom line is this guy shouldn't be touting these ideas as his own.  I wonder if he believes in karma?
1596434252|4.0|Very cute book, great conversation piece. The idea of a book as art is very cool. However, other than flipping through it once or twice and showing your friends, which takes all of 5 minutes of your time, you'll never open it again most likely. If that's your expectation, no problem, but if you want something more for your money, you'll want to skip this one.
0307269752|2.0|(Warning-Possible (very small) spoilers)<br /><br />The writing is, overall, quite disjointed.  The first thing that struck me was that I was 85% certain that I knew the identity of the villain as soon as the character was even SPOKEN about, much less introduced.  Needless to say, I was 100% certain when the villain does something dumb that shows him to be the bad guy... and no one catches on.  Not surprisingly, I had also been able to warrant a very good guess as to what happened with Harriet.<br /><br />I found the character of Blomkvist kind of a drag.  It's hard to pull for someone who is so BLAH.  He ruined his marriage by continuing to sleep with Erica, but I'm never sure WHY.  She's married, it is clearly NOT the great love of his life, and they have little to no real chemistry.  The 'relationship' seems forced, and to be honest it skeeved me out that she would tell her husband when she was going to sleep with Blumkvist.  Eww.<br /><br />Blumkvist is totally dense and doesn't pick up HUGE clues about what happened with Harriet, even though it's pretty obvious who the bad guy was, and the answer to what happened to her (without the details of how) is there the entire time.  The answer is so ridiculously in your face, you almost feel let down when it turns out to be what you always knew it was.  I figured with the reviews here, the solving of the crime must pack quite a punch!  I was wrong.<br /><br />  To top it all off, the writer makes sure to let us know that, on top of being a bad husband & an idiot, Blumkvist is also a crap parent. Woo woo, what a hero.  He's an idiot who will (LITERALLY) sleep with anyone and has no emotional depth.  WHY were we supposed to be rooting for him??<br /><br />Salander was (obviously) the more interesting character here.  But I feel like the author took a certain joy in having her treated like terribly. Seriously, what else ABSOLUTELY AWFUL could happen to this poor girl?  The ending angered me to no end.  She finally makes an enormous emotional leap, only to have her hopes smashed by the idiot with NO EMOTIONAL DEPTH!<br />And of course he remains oblivious to the carnage he has wrought with this ridiculous 'relationship' with Erica.<br /><br />Seriously, I hated the character of Blumkvist & really feel he ruined the whole book.  Lisabeth should have been the main character and the entirety of the book should have been told from her perspective.  Of course, had that happened, the book would have been about 200 pages long... because Lisabeth would have figured it out PRONTO.<br /><br />The writer used the dumber character to try and slow down the 'climax' of the (paper thin) story.e her hopes smashed by the idiot with NO EMOTIONAL DEPTH!

B000EXDS5M|4.0|This is a movie that entertains throughout.  It has a bit of history, a lot of legend, and nonstop action.<br /><br />It features Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Butch Cassidy and 'The Sundance Kid' respectively.  These two were part of the notorious 'Wild Bunch' gang that operated in the west during the late 1800s and early years of the 1900s.  They primarily did bank and train robberies.  Their claim to fame was that they did not kill people during their crimes.<br /><br />During the course of the film, Butch and Sundance end up getting separated from the rest of their gang.  They are being hunted relentlessly and finally decide to relocate to South America.  I will limit my comments about the rest of this show to avoid spoiling it.<br /><br />The ending is one that makes a great movie climax, but may not be historically accurate.  There are accounts out there that Sundance died in Casper, Wyoming (under a different name) in 1957 as well as claims that Cassidy died in Washington in the 1930s.  Regardless of the accuracy of any of the accounts of their ultimate demise, this movie is a lot of fun.
0743487583|4.0|Shelley's Frankenstein is a really touching story, well-told.  You must let go of your memories of the movie to appreciate it. It reveals the suffering of an outsider in the 2nd part where the Creature is observing a loving family and longing to be part of some family, contrasting it with being abandoned by his only parent, Dr. Frankenstein.  Also introduces the idea of humans overstepping the lines of nature by creating life and the doubts end guilt associated with genetic engineering.<br />This paperback, is difficult to read because of the closeness of the margins and the binding.  But then, it is cheap, and not a collector's item.
B001C08RHA|5.0|If you liked Robocop, you definitely love IRONMAN.      But at the same time, this movie tells the story of a few things that are true and going as we breathe.    One thing that p***** me off is that we have terrorists in our own country under our noses and they are being covered up.  They are probably committing illegal acts right now.....Just think about how Jeff Bridges betrayed Morton Junior.      Also, this movie proves to me that the government(certain politicians and leaders) is good at only one thing.....covering up lies, cheating, killing, stealing, and manipulating.    But if you have a closed mind and is naive, you will only see and hear what you want.

0802798225|4.0|Alex Fuentes is gang member from the south side of Fairfield, and Brittany Ellis is a privileged girl from the north. Each have a status and a reputation to uphold at Fairfield High, but they also have secrets--for Alex, it's the desire to break free from the Latino Blood gang and his tough image and succeed in life. Brittany's life may look perfect from the outside, but at home, her parents are struggling to deal with Brittany's handicapped sister.      Brittany and Alex are on the opposite ends of the social scene spectrum, but that doesn't stop their chemistry teacher from making them lab partners. It's hate at first sight for both, but as they learn more about each other and slowly move beyond the stereotypes, they'll discover completely new people.     Perfect Chemistry is the classic love story of two utterly different people falling for each other, despite their initial loathing. Elkeles breathes new life into the old tale, giving it a fresh teenage perspective by interchangeably writing in both Alex and Brittany's point of view, keeping Perfect Chemistry fresh and evenly paced. The plot is realistic and sweet without being cliché, and the dialogue is perfect; gritty, and genuine. Each side is portrayed objectively, and though Alex and Brittany's relationship does move at a fast pace, their thoughts, insecurities, hang-ups, and urges all ring true and are easy for nearly any teen to identify with.      Though it is an important part of the book, the romance doesn't dominate it: strong themes of acceptance, diversity, courage, and independence are also present, making for a powerful read that boldly faces the consequences of gang life, and offers an unflinching look at how difficult it is to extricate oneself from it. Elkeles has created a riveting and strong novel with an important and relevant message and a romance hotter than any exothermic reaction.

B0010ZR160|5.0|Gone Baby Gone is an outstanding movie with great actors and a plot that moves along so well and so fast that you are riveted to the edge of your seat the entire length of the film. The actors do a great job with the script and this is a strong showing for director Ben Affleck as his first film that made it to the big screen. The cinematography and the special effects enhance this movie all the more.<br /><br />When the action starts, we are in Dorchester, Massachusetts outside Boston. Dorchester is a tough neighborhood filled with drug problems and other types of dangerous crime; nevertheless people live there all their lives and develop relationships that truly matter. When four year old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) goes missing, the police come in fast but they don't have strong leads. The girl's Aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel McCready (Titus Welliver) enlist the help of two private detectives, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to help solve the case. Bea and Lionel believe that Amanda's mother Helene (Amy Ryan) is not able to do enough to help find her daughter because of her emotional problems, not the least of which is that Helene scarcely cares what happens to her daughter. Patrick and Angie get some information from people in the neighborhood although even knowing these people for decades still makes getting any information difficult. Patrick and Angie also come up against Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) from the police squad who is not exactly happy to have them around because they're not experienced cops.<br /><br />The story takes many twists and turns which adds to the suspense; and the ending isn't necessarily clear until we see it in the very final moments of this picture. Along the way you can expect a strong performance from Morgan Freeman; and Amy Ryan steals the show as Amanda's mother Helene McCready, an almost hopeless drug addict who also gets involved in dealing drugs herself. Helene has even taken her child Amanda to a drug deal or two because, as she claims, she just doesn't \\"have daycare.\\"<br /><br />I must agree with the reviewers who note that this movie is very much for adults and mature audiences. There is a good deal of profanity and violence. Moreover, guns are whipped around faster than the bullets speeding out of them. Other issues raised include police corruption, child molestation and murder. It's not a Disney movie! However, don't be fooled--this is one strong movie worth owning in your collection.<br /><br />The DVD comes with extras; the deleted scenes are really the best of them.<br /><br />Overall, Gone Baby Gone presents us with a complicated thriller type of mystery that highlights the tragedy of child abduction and how it can affect so many people. The ending is good subject matter for debate; therefore for at least this one reason alone you won't forget this movie anytime soon.her child Amanda to a drug deal or two because, as she claims, she just doesn't \\"have daycare.\\"     I must agree with the reviewers who note that this movie is very much for adults and mature audiences.

1596912863|3.0|This book started out terribly; I exclaimed several times \\"this is horrible!\\"  In the end, however, it did redeem itself somewhat, though it is still just an ok book.  Much of the plot has to do with Jane vacillating back and forth between being able to fully participate in Austenland, and feeling stupid and NOT being able to do it. You think I'm kidding?  A sampling:<br />page 31: \\"She was ready to plunge.\\"<br />page 33: \\"Now that it came to it, she didn't know if she could role play with a straight face.\\"<br />page 38: \\"You can do it, you can do it, she chanted silently\\" [to herself]<br />page 43: \\"She was completely ridiculous.\\"<br />page 48: \\"She still felt dried up and brittle in this new pretend skin, and she really didn't think she could stomach false declarations...\\"<br />page 51: \\"I don't think I can do this.\\"<br />page 53: \\"I can do this; I want to do this.\\"<br /><br />You get this idea; that's 20 pages with several swings, and I skipped some.  There is a similar back and forth over whether or not she needs men in her life.  So there's very little Austen wit here (though it is better than some of the other Austen-related attempts), mostly you're just thinking \\"this is bizarre\\" and \\"this is inane\\".  Don't try applying logic to the premise, it will start to fall apart.  There's not much chemistry between the characters and not much immersion in the time period (other than costumes).  Jane doesn't really even feel very likable, she is so unsure of who she is and what she wants, too focused on someone else making her happy.<br /><br />All of that being said, I did rather enjoy the ending, and was pleasantly surprised by how it wrapped up.  It is a very quick read, so if you are looking for some light fluff that has bits of P&P association, give it a whirl.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|This movie is not as good as the first installment of this series.  My first problem is the length of this thing- it seems to just go on and on.  The second is that there really isn't any suspense, and you actually just don't care about how things come out.  Most of the plot twists may be seen about an hour before they occur- they've been done so much better in other movies.  And, you tire of watching what seems to be an endless series of psuedo intellectual dialoge punctuated by scenes of predictable and overdone violence.  The special effects are good, but the action scenes eventually get to be ludicrous and even silly.    I have to agree that Heath Ledger did an excellent job- much more than I expected, but the rest of the cast lets him down.

B000YABYLA|2.0|Have you ever known someone who put a tremendous amount of effort into being cool?  They played guitar 'cause it was cool, were obsessed with classic rock even though they were born after Boy George was popular 'cause that's cool, say quippy little remarks and not care about anything because they are so cool, can rattle off obscure horror film directors, hang in living room furniture on the front lawn, have wacky bedroom decor and accessories like a food-shaped utilities cause they are so cool? If those people bug you, then like me, you will not enjoy this film. I get that sixteen-year-olds thought this film was really awesome. I think it is kind of pathetic that people who have gone to their ten-year high school reunions thought this was a really good film. It tried so hard to be cool it actually hurt to watch. This movie simply will not stand the test of time.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This is certainly better than the latest Hulk movie, but for me it never quite reached the heights that I had hoped. The opening part of the movie is well done and the scenes when Stark is devloping the final version of the 'Iron' suit are some of the finest use of CGI I've seen. In particular where he was initially testing out its flying ability adjacent to his collection of classic cars. Great scene...<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the leading role (reminded me of Al Pacino in fact) and it was great to see Jeff Bridges again. Gywneth Paltrow also gave a good performance.<br /><br />Where the film went downhill was the final 1/4. Much like the ending of the latest Hulk film the final battle was entirely predictable. Once again though there is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee and the final few moments give us hope that Marvel may be preparing a film based on The Avengers.<br /><br />My review is perhaps a reflection of my age. If this film had been produced when I first read the comics (the 1970's) I would have been blown away by it. Sadly age and a somewhat more cynical view of life means that superheroes are never quite what they were. I still love the comics though!
0307383415|5.0|President-Elect Obama's memoir about his childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood is a fascinating page turner.  The subtitle could be \\"Beneath the veneers of color, religion, and education, we are all the same.\\"      Readers who followed the presidential campaign and noticed its fortunate relative absence of race as a campaign theme will be surprised to find the depth of the author's struggle with his own racial identity in his younger years.  As a white male naturalized American I had certainly heard of the difficulty of growing up black in America but found the account in this book particularly gripping, coming from a man who constantly strives to avoid the easy stereotype or scapegoating and instead chisels away with admirable earnestness at finding the original essence of our racial and multicultural issues.    After reading this book I come away calm and reassured that no actions by the new administration will be biased by some unresolved youthful conflict by the commander in chief.

B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a very interesting portrayal of some aspects of the D/s BDSM lifestyle. Although in fact that almost appears to be on the periphery of the story. The reality is more about these two conflicted characters neither of whom fit well into the real world.  I did not find this to be a comedy even though it has some good comic elements.  Also I suspect many people who have reveiwed this here did not understand some parts of it.  Lee, the main character does cut herself, but it seems to be the way she has learned to escape the pain of her life. The release of endorphans from the cutting pain, helps her feel better.  Mr. Grey, the lawyer is truly a lost soul. I would have to even conclude that he suffers from Aspergers syndrome based on his behavior: He is bright, shy and has a difficult time relating to other people in a normal way. He is really a gentle person, even releasing mice caught in his office back outside. Growing orchids. He has trouble reconciling his quiet nature with his need for dominance in his relationships.   Therein lies the crux of the story.   Well done, sensual and fun. However without being familiar with or having read up on the BDSM lifestyle mny viewers may not really understand the story. There are many books on this on Amazon, including Consensual Spanking and others.   Many folks may find this film disturbing however, so choose carefully who you show it to.

With Schindler's List this is Steven Speilberg's finest hour and it follows the true heroes of Easy Company. The end of episode 8 is probably the most difficult to endure as the narrator reminds us that while the war was being fought and while these men lost their lives in France and Germany all of us in the US had already forgotten what they were doing. \\"How will they know\\" the narrator asks. This blu-ray set is one way how we will know, and reminds us to honor our veterans and those who still fight for us.

630215829X|5.0|I'm not sure about this EXACT VHS tape on here, but I watched the original Fantasia growing up (I'm 21 now) and I turned into a music prodigy.  I watched it every day, sometimes twice, from age 2 until I was about 11 or so. I was obsessed with the music, I loved it, and now that I look back, I have a theory that when you see rhythm paired with colors like this, it naturally teaches you rhythm.    Compare this to the Baby Einstein bull..really compare them (it's not hard)    Baby Einstein music is dumbed down...beautiful masterpieces changed completely!! I DON'T GET IT.  Fantasia incorporates completely original beautiful classical masterpieces from the world's best composers.and pairs it with exactly matched cartoon rhythms...    Growing up, I naturally started playing piano well, it just \\"made sense.\\" I was able to play commercial tunes on the piano without even thinking. I then started drums, violin and guitar. No problem.  I was always #1, always first chair, always understood, complex rhythms, etc etc.    I made an all-city high school band when I was in middle school..and also gave lessons to other students in the high school band.    I could keep going but it's too much to read.  Fantasia is an amazing amazing amazing movie and concept.  Please show this movie to your kids every day!!  If your kid can hum tunes to Bach, Mozart, etc...he or she will be smart.  It just works that way.    Trust me.

B00007FOMP|3.0|I have a funny relationship with What's Going On; listening to it, I can totally understand the rave reviews, the adoring fans, the consistently high rankings in \\"best albums of all time\\" type surveys. I totally dig that this album  kinda sorta revolutionized soul music, established Marvin Gaye as a \\"serious\\" artist (although it is criminally wrong to imply that \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" isn't high art), and set the tone for a more hard-edged breed of socially minded pop. I even recognize the music as being genuinely gorgeous, and I understand the phenomenal emotional impact that these songs must have on people.     The thing is, I really don't care if I ever hear this record again.     I really can't understand why. Sure, What's Going On has its faults - the lyrics can be a bit too obvious and melodramatic at times, and some of the themes seem somewhat dated- but none of them seem like a compelling reason to give the overall work less than five stars. Criticizing the album for any of its obvious faults would feel like I was just looking for a reason to explain why I gave it a less-than-perfect score.    Maybe it has something to do with the fact that What's Going On is a bit too perfect. It seems glossy at times, glossy and calculated and hermetically sealed. Listening to it, I feel like I'm watching a stage play that would be performed in the exact same manner no matter who the audience consists of. It's a one-trick album that happens to be very good at its trick, a well-preserved piece of art that's been encased in wax and left to hang silently in a museum, a cold monument to the ideal of emotional expression held by its creator.    Or something like that.

This is thier best, most accessible release yet and look forward to more.

B000007VCM|5.0|This album is a true underground classic and is certainly one of the best albums of the 80s.   One of those magical combinations of artists that comes around from time to time, with Steve Brown's amazing production and the incredible drumming of Mark from Big Country - it's a work of art in every way, from the unique cover art to the gorgeous sound quality - especially the recording of the drums and guitars.  The Cult were really at their best on this album - and Love deserves to be way more famous than it is.  One thing to pay attention to - the multi layered, often understated guitar patterns laid down by Billy Duffy.   He creates some remarkable, unique tones and textures.  I remember when this album came out, my friends and I just about flipped.  I'm still all over it... over 20 years later.
B001L4NJIO|3.0|So, I saw these folks touring in Europe a year ago and simply got amazed of how fantastic they performed and how good both the set and the sound of their reunition tour were; it was simply worth every penny having to drive for more than 6 hours the 600 km. sepparating my home from Lisbon. Perhaps one of my greatest 'live show' experiences in quite a long time...<br /><br />Unfortunately things are not the same when it comes to the concert you purchase in DVD / Blu Ray... image quality and resolution on Blu Ray raises up closely to perfection but, for some reason, it simply doesn't looks as amazing as how it was watching them live. Sometimes it even looks like a grammy or an MTV show rather than a two-decade-awaited reunition show. It's just a subjective matter of feeling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 2-channel stereo sound is simply awful. It got distorted several times on every single song... even the 2CD set included on the Blu Ray edition does it much better than the Blu Ray (!!!).<br /><br />Documentary and photo galleries are quite good, but you know I'm not buying the whole set for just watching at the pics =)<br /><br />So, basically, that's why I rated it with only three stars: because of post-production and packaging, which also doesn't meet my expectations.<br /><br />If I should be rating the show itself as I've seen it in Lisbon, Portugal, I would rather be giving five stars, but it is the whole post production which pulls down the whole item to a 'just approved'.<br /><br />Could have been quite much better... and it looks like there's not going to be a 'next time' to solve it.<br /><br />Now: it's still very good as a historic music legacy worth having, but wait till it gets cheaper.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|Popular music thrives on melodrama, especially when it's expressed by a vocalist like Beth Gibbons. The stylized, hyper-magnified fragility of her performances is the biggest strength of Portishead's Third. In \\"Nylon Smile,\\" she pleads, \\"I don't know what I've done to deserve you, and I don't know what I'll do without you,\\" and her voice veritably quivers with hurt, you can easily imagine her as a poor wounded bird, plaintively lamenting her cruel fate. In many songs, she dwells with similar helplessness and sensitivity on feelings like, \\"hoping I might change a little, hoping that I might be someone I want to be,\\" \\"tormented inside life, wounded and afraid,\\" and \\"I'm just emotionally undone, I can't deny I can't be someone else.\\"    That's the predominant tone of Third, but Gibbons also does a magnificently calm, distanced tone in \\"Machine Gun,\\" and becomes a bit warmer in \\"Deep Water\\" and \\"The Rip.\\" Eventually, the melodrama feels more like the style of an old silent film, or a story by Stefan Zweig, than like typical nineties-style angst. Gibbons' vocal style has [[ASIN:B000001FI7 always]] recalled old torch songs, and she has lost none of her touch in the eleven years that passed since the [[ASIN:B000003TSP last]] Portishead album. If anything, she's spookier, more mysterious now.    However, the music on Third is obsessively, insistently rudimentary, even for a minimalist decade like the 2000s. It's not \\"repetitive\\" in the sense that, say, [[ASIN:B000AY9ON0 Ladytron]] are repetitive. Third is full of surprises and changes: the abrupt ending of \\"Silence,\\" a fast keyboard line suddenly interrupting the slow pace of \\"Hunter,\\" a loud crescendo in \\"Small,\\" glitchy effects in \\"Plastic.\\" But these surprises have no musical content whatsoever. The keyboard line in \\"Hunter\\" plays a very simple scale, up and down; the crescendo in \\"Small\\" is a one-note keyboard line. Many songs prominently feature a shrill drone -- not a \\"droning keyboard line,\\" as one might write abouta post-punk album, but a plain, unadorned beeping sound, either continuous or repeated. \\"Silence\\" begins with one (around 0:30). So does \\"Magic Doors.\\" So does \\"We Carry On.\\" These are not small, insignificant details; they actually form the musical core of the album. Things get a little more exciting with the rare appearance of a distorted electric guitar, at the end of \\"Silence\\" and \\"Small,\\" but there, too, it plays basic chords, covered in reverb.    The issue is laid out starkly in \\"Machine Gun.\\" The drum track is lifted from New Order's \\"[[ASIN:B000002LCK Blue Monday]].\\" Okay, fine: steal from the best, everything old is new again, and so on. But New Order's song had about a dozen different unforgettable hooks apart from the drum track. \\"Machine Gun\\" not only has no other hooks, it has no other music, except for a short keyboard line (heavily reminiscent of nineties [[ASIN:B0001M1KM4 MOD music]]) in the end. But for most of its duration, Gibbons sings over just this drum track. To add variation, they produce the drum track in two ways -- a cold \\"industrial\\" sound and a louder, clanging pot-beating sound. They alternate. The end. If not for the striking, cold clarity of Gibbons' voice, there would be nothing to discuss.    Not that it's all bad, but the good parts generally occur when the music doesn't try to call attention to itself, and retreats into the background (\\"Hunter,\\" \\"Threads,\\" \\"Deep Water\\"). Occasionally it is used to sort of gently guide the tone of Gibbons' vocal performance. The best such moment is on \\"The Rip,\\" perhaps the best song on the album, where a slight increase in tempo leads to a warm, dreamy climax. When the music is at the forefront, however, it can be quite frustrating to listen to.    This style can be traced back to Radiohead's [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]], particularly \\"The National Anthem,\\" which also simulated musical techniques using essentially non-musical stand-in sounds. Occasionally there are hints of Bjork's [[ASIN:B000002HPVHomogenic]] (the drum track in \\"Plastic\\" would have felt at home there), except without the pop moments. Overall, though, the sound of Third is closer to [[ASIN:B000NVIXFA Volta]], another musical simulacrum, featuring a wide array of instruments (diligently noted by reviewers) that failed to play anything of any interest at all.    The minimalism of Third is anticlimactic. Exactly like Kid A, the careful pace and the jarring sound suggest an album that requires careful attention and repeated listening, but in the end, the music reveals much less than it promises. It remains to listen to Third for Gibbons' often-amazing vocals, and treat the music as an occasionally pleasant backdrop.
1400079276|1.0|I'm surprised to see this book get high scores here, it's quite bad even by Murakami Haruki's relatively low standards (\\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"A Wild Sheep's Chase\\" and \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\\" are good, the rest are enjoyable as contentless vehicles of style only).  Everyone I know who's read \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" thought it was pointless rubbish.<br /><br />Murakami Haruki seems to be very famous in the US, and he publishes rubbish short stories like \\"A Shinagawa Monkey\\" in the New Yorker as a result, but when he puts out books like \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" I get a bit frustrated. He has great books, but this one just takes his more experimental pieces like \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" and goes through the motions for a couple hundred pages. Very silly, irrelevant stuff. A truck driver in the movie picks up a hitchhiker and drives him to Shikoku where things seem to be happening. He gains an appreciation of classical music, he picks up a heavy rock, he has fantastic sex with a callgirl (who happens to be a philosophy major in college by day!) pimped to him by Colonel Sanders (yes, that's right - the guy in the white suit). He's a minor character in the story, but it doesn't matter - the tale says nothing about nothing. At least it's technically well written, and I've been able to remember this much about its annoying details several months after finishing the book, but that's probably no big compliment...
B000W1V5VU|2.0|Having seen the first one (Ocean 11) and found it bearable lighthearted entertainment I came across Ocean 13 on cable and gave it a chance. Of all the low ratings most seem to be unhappy with the DVD quality but finding the movie ok....<br /><br />As I saw it on cable I cannot comment on the DVD format but can safely say I found the movie boring, the acting uninspired and the plot far fetched and overly technical. You dont need to be 88 years old to be unable to relate to the way in which the plot is to be carried out... the main actors repeatedly admit they dont even themselves when presented to them.<br /><br />The movie is very slow paced and often outright boring and there is very few witty lines to cheer up us viewers. Clearly this movie was made, as most sequels are, to make 'an easy buck' which I am sure they did on our expense.
B00000583F|5.0|If you ever wished that Black Sabbath had released more albums, you need to hear Sleep, which comes pretty close to replicating the sound of Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward as you can imagine, only without the distinctive wail of Ozzy Osbourne. Also comes complete with corny doom-laden lyrics, although without the occult imagery. Great grungy heavy slow plodding stuff.<br /><br />Starts off well, but whacked out songs like \\"Inside the Sun\\" are a bit corny. \\"Dragonaut\\" (Supernaut?) is bluesy and reminds of Clutch. \\"The Druid\\" is bluesy and also reminds of Clutch. \\"Evil Gypsy/Solomon's Theme\\" is kind of like Sabbath meets Metallica. Breathless and hoarse yelling over primitive heavy riffs. \\"Some Grass\\" is a 48-second interlude that sounds like those pretty little medieval things that Tony Iommi put on some albums, although maybe it's more like Zeppelin than Sabbath. \\"Holy Mountain\\" is the real thing - plodding, bottom-heavy, droning, grooving, fun!<br /><br />Lyrically, the band likes to use the word \\"stoned\\" a lot. \\"Look onto the rays of the new stoner sun rising\\" and \\"Stoner caravan from deep space arrives.\\" The band gets pretty wild, saying stuff like \\"Within the center of the Galaxy, Awway from Earth and all its misery/ Pressing on into the burning sky/ Burning spaceship its time to die,\\" predicting the whole Heaven's Gate cult thing somehow... Unfortunately the song itself, \\"Inside the Sun,\\" is really irritating with its sound tunnel voice effects...
B000007XUQ|5.0|We were delighted to enjoy the beautiful voice of Karen Carpenter this Christmas. They are a timeless duo.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|I lost track of Iron Maiden some time in the late '90s with the \\"Somewhere In Time Album,\\" but when I read the reviews that the recent album is a return to the classic sound of the \\"Piece of Mind\\" album I was intrigued, not to mention the fact that this release comes with a bonus DVD (I'm a sucker for bonus video).<br /><br />Listening to the heavy riffs, the melodic acoustic riffs, the weird squeaky effects of two guitars playing simultaneously but one a half note off from the other (I think this is what they do) is comfortable and familiar and good fun in fact. Not that this album has a song as good as \\"Flight of Icarus,\\" nor any cool literary tracks that crack the world of Frank Herbert, Alan Silitoe, or even H.P. Lovecraft, no songs about the Prisoner, no continuation of the Charlotte the Harlot saga, but lots of good clean riffs that remind us that in some worlds it's still 1984.<br /><br />After this, I got checking out some old Iron Maiden stuff, and found out about a female cover band The Iron Maidens, that would be interesting to see/hear. Seems like more good, goofy fun. I've also been looking into the legend of Eddie the Head stuff through the Wikipedia, as well as the website of Derek Riggs, the guy who created the character and did a bunch of album art for the band. I haven't checked out the DVD much yet, although the accompanying video for the Reioncarnation of Benjamin Bregg is uninspiring, as is the accompanying photo gallery.
B000P12LWY|4.0|I love all things Tudor. This is an excellent series. Lushly produced, fabulously designed costumes. Quite possible that some inaccuracies exist -f rom other historical books i have read, but this quite well done. Thoroughly enjoyable. I can;t wait for the next season! Highly recommended !
B000NA77YO|4.0|After buying the stunning 8-CD, 1-DVD Black Sabbath \\"Black Box\\" set, the followup edition for the Ronnie James Dio era of Black Sabbath, with a single CD, may seem a bit uninspiring (although they've now got a Black Box - the Dio Version).  But it does have some of the best nuggets of the first two Black Sabbath albums with Dio, such as \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" \\"Neon Knights,\\" \\"Turn Up The Night,\\" and of course the ultra-heavy \\"Mob Rules\\" that I'm still a bit weary of from overplay in my teen years.  But the album also has a few nuggest from Dehumanizer, a mid-era Black Sabbath album that had Ronnie James Dio singing on it, a reunion album of sorts that I was only aware of recently (I'd seen the cheezy album cover in the stores, but didn't know that Dio was back singing with the band for just that one release).  Two of the songs from Dehumanizer that make it to this album, \\"After All (the Dead)\\" and \\"I\\" are actually quite good. At least they're better than any of the new songs that Black Sabbath has recorded with Dio for this release, \\"The Devil Cried,\\" \\"Shadow Of The Wind\\", and \\"Ear In The Wall,\\" which are only just decent. But I suppose that Tony Iommi's battered fingers are getting a bit weary after all these years, and \\"slow and plodding\\" seems to be the theme for new output.  At least for now.
4789009637|4.0|My college teacher uses this book and she is one who expects you to do alot on your own, that being said this isn't the book for self teaching. Its great for classroom instruction with the aid of the workbook, as long as lectures are provided to help put in the missing pieces of japanese grammar that genki misses. Overall, its a good book but only recommended for those in college or high school.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|Clever tale of libertarianism from Peter Thiel, the PayPal guy.  In the story, our hero Aaron Eckhart lives a lie so that he can pay his mortgage, he goes through a series of challenges, and comes out on top the way you'd see in any Tom Cruise movie, the main difference is that this one happens to be starring Aaron Eckhart instead of Mr Couch Jumper.<br /><br />Sure, it seems to be a thinking man's movie, but why would a movie about smoking not show anybody smoking?  Why would a movie about the right of the tabacco industry to exist suppress smoking in it?  Why would a movie that shows the main character going to Hollywood to convince studio executives to feature its stars lighting up, but then not have its star light up?  Somehow the film, while enjoyable, is not clever enough to answer any of these questions. Rob Lowe is good as a serene Hollywood guru-type, but William H. Macy horribly typecast as a snivelling senator who is exposed with ridiculous ease as a hypocrite.
0439882826|5.0|Everytime my son and I would go to a store he would look for this book.  It was a wonderful Christmas present for him.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I'm so glad that I got to attend a couple of the shows from this tour, and this DVD is a gorgeous reminder of how good the shows were and how fantastic this band STILL is.<br /><br />I was very pleased with how well it is filmed, it looks stunning. And the 5.1 audio is spectacular! The guys are having a great time, you can see the joy. I couldn't help but smile. The set list is phenomenal, the musicianship, stellar. I cannot recommend this more highly.<br /><br />A SOLID FIVE STARS! What a great keepsake of a brilliant tour.<br /><br />I do have a couple of things that I need to mention. As well as this show was filmed, it almost suffers from today's INSATIABLE desire to shoot and edit in the \\"no attention span\\" mode. This show is nowhere edited as bad as Rush In Rio, but it still does not focus on the group or individual as long as it should, sustaining shots on solos, singing and such. You know what I mean. It's better than most, but could be better, still. Take a look at Neil Young's, Heart Of Gold. It is amazing.<br /><br />Second issue is the pathetic piece of paper packaging. I totally understand going \\"green\\", but I got this DVD for Xmas and the inside is torn up and folded. Plus the DVD's must be slid in and out, hence scratching the DVD surfaces. This is an issue that they need to improve on. I am considering contacting Amazon to see if I can get a replacement because of the torn, junk packaging. NO STARS for the packaging.

0316017922|2.0|Obviously this book is lightweight, but there is a discomfort and tight-lipped quality to the negative reviews that seem to me to be expressions more of the discomfort of engaging with the political nature of this book. Read Kakutani in the nytimes: \\"...Mr. Gladwell's emphasis on class and accidents of historical timing plays down the role of individual grit and talent to the point where he seems to be sketching a kind of theory of social predestination, determining who gets ahead and who does not...\\" This book (what Kautani rightly calls a \\"flimsy selection of colorful anecdotes and stories\\") should be read, I believe, not as a quality work of non-fiction, but as a document of the political shift in the USA away from the \\"conservative\\" reverence of individualism, \\"grit and talent\\" of the Regan/Bush years towards the Obama era in which global capitalism is self-destructing and the federal government and our democratic institutions (society) are called on to solve the crisis.     It's interesting that Gladwell who is a \\"Science\\" writer here mostly avoids the literature on genes and DNA that was the rage in the 1990s when there were several advances in genetics----instead he walks out into the dangerous waters of \\"nurture\\" (not \\"nature\\") and attempts to make his case that the structures of society, our positionality and class have huge consequences. But contra Kakutani, he does not discount \\"grit\\", as one of his theses is that there is a 10,000 hour rule: Practice something for 10,000 hours (20 hours a week for 10 years) and you will be an expert. Gladwell's point is *not* that hardwork, grit and determination are unimportant: it's that only *some* people have the access to the tools, resources, time and money to log those 10,000 hours.      Of course this will be controversial; it sounds \\"un-American\\" (Gladwell is Canadian, oui?) and to what extent our societies should create level playing fields essentially divides the left from the right. It doesn't help, though, that his argument for equality is sketched out so flippantly in this book. That's too bad; I thought this book was going to remind me of the awkward racial insensitivity of \\"Freakonomics\\" in which the authors \\"prove\\" that inner-city drug dealers in the end don't make that much money at all and are better off taking a minimum-wage job. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gladwell is an author who is deeply disturbed by the structures in place that prevent advancement and reinforce inequality.    Gladwell even deconstructs his own \\"bi-racial\\" antecedents and how their light skin and choice of light-skinned mates may have had something to do with the relative ease in which he grew up. This is quite timely during the age of Obama, where there many conversations over whether the future president is \\"black\\" or \\"African-American\\" or multi-racial or something new. The election of Obama is obviously an historic event that crystalizes and raises consciousness about the contradictions and struggles of race and class that have been raging in the USA for hundreds of years. This book fits into that context nicely.    It's also a sign of the times that this author who sells millions of copies of books decided to engage with these knotty issues and in the end side with those who want to ameliorate society. It's unfortunate, though, that because these issues are so complex the magazine style of writing and fluffy researching can't do the subject justice and the result is some embarrassing passages. Social inequality is the subject that some of the greatest thinkers such as Rousseau and Marx spent their careers on. If you are interested in this type of philosophy, the philosophy of actually changing the world, then this book is worth a skim to see how the zeitgeist is slowly shifting.
B001KVZ6FC|3.0|I saw this movie not knowing what it was about. I saw it because I was out with a friend, and they picked this film.    After watching, my first feeling was emptiness. I just sat an 1 /12 through a film that mixed comedy with drama. It felt anti-climatic in a sense.    My second thought was the unrealism of it. I don't really care if a movie's unrealistic, but I felt this film was trying to be realistic in certain ways.    Another thing was that I couldn't tell throughout the film whether it was trying to be a comedy or drama. It was both, and I don't think it really succeded.    Overall the film was decent, not great. 3/5 stars.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|Good :  In sequential order, each and every episode, fabulous looking set.  Beautiful pictures of the four girls, and great descriptions of each episode!    Bad : Cheap binder and paper, cheap fake velour cover, and cheap disc sleeves.  Binder-type style that doesn't fit with other dvd's in your collection.  No play all option that I can see, so if you're planning on watching a \\"marathon\\" be prepared with the remote (cause that 30 minutes goes quick :)    It's definitely a great collection.  However, I likely wouldn't have bought it for myself because of the cheaply made binder and the ridiculous retail price.  But because it was a gift, I'm enjoying every fabulous moment :)
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I love this album. There are songs for every mood, and it's especially perfect to drive to. I cannot recommend this album enough, I really enjoy every song, though for me, \\"Electric Feel\\" has become one of my all-time favorites. Listen and enjoy.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|\\"Hellboy: The Golden Army\\" is just amazing! Shoot! Hellboy himself is amazing, especially considering his DNA. The early scene in which his Earth father reads a bedtime story about the Golden Army: How it came to be and how it was put to \\"sleep\\" --is also amazing and sets up the premise for the story at Hand (er, no offense, Hellboy). Young Hellboy is so endearing with his broken horn--you know, boys have mishaps--so believing in all his father says, so, well, downright sweet (considering his DNA).<br /><br />However, Hellboy grew up. His adult demeanor is cynical, macho. He works for a very secret branch of the FBI that houses--literally--\\"odd\\" creatures from the supernatural world. We get a glimpse of a few when the film turns to the time sequence for this story. We also learn that Liz (the fiery woman who can ignite at will) lives with her man, Red--Hellboy--and is miffed at his behavior as a domesticated male. Yet, remember that sweet side? Hellboy is totally in love with Liz.<br /><br />The most delightful scene occurs when Red takes a six-pack to Abe Sapien's room (he's the Fish Man) who has also fallen in love. After Red convinces Abe to imbibe, they start singing with Barry Manilow (of all singers!) his saccharine song \\"I Can't Smile Without You.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lord Elfin wants to awaken the Golden Army and put them at his command. His goal is to declare war against humans because of the awful things they have done to the planet. Elves respect nature (remember Lord of the Ring?).<br /><br />Of course, Lord Elf gets the third piece of the crown (or we wouldn't have a battle) and finally gets his army--the indestructible golden ones. Only the progeny of royalty can challenge the royal holder of this special crown. That's where Hellboy's DNA comes in. But I'll say no more.<br /><br />Here are a few things so mysterious, so dazzling about this film:<br />1. Reminding the viewer of Hellboy's dual fathers<br />2. Setting up the current circumstances of Hellboy's life<br />3. Reminding the viewer of Hellboy's love story<br />4. Setting up the premise for the Golden Army<br />5. Dazzling special effects, both simple and boldly imaginative<br />6. The reminder of the beautiful and destructive sides of nature<br />7. The universal qualities of love<br />8.

0385732554|4.0|We think we may want Utopia. No crime, no anger, no great divide. The laws of Sameness makes sure of it. Utopia, at what cost? Along with this very Creepy Utopia comes the forgotten memories of what it is to be different. Forgotten memories of war and hate, of hunger and sickness. But also forgotten memories of rain and snow. Of falling in love and having a child. Of make choices. Remember what it was like when you first starting having feeling for someone, that little funny feeling in your tummy. Feeling of love stirring deep inside. Well they have a pill for that, and everyone must take it. The joy's of being with child--Gone. They have birthing women for that. What about sharring loving memories with the grandparents sitting around the dinner table or a warm fire on a cold night--Gone. Sickness, death, not anymore. They just release you. There is only one who holds all these memories both good and bad. Now it is his time to be the Giver and pass on the memories to the one who will take his place. What is Utopia anyway, and what are you willing to give up to obtain it? Great book. But more for a young adult reader. Still very enjoyable. Well worth the read.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|How clever to use \\"The Women\\" as a title for a film dealing exclusively with women! I say that both facetiously and seriously. The name \\"Stephen Hanes\\" is most often used in \\"The Women,\\" but he never appears. So, what is the message? Is there an easy answer to the problems between men and women? Not since Adam and Eve and that was a long long time ago.<br /><br />\\"The Women\\" makes the statement that forgiveness is a dish best served with a back-up plan. Meg Ryan, in a more mature role than she normally plays, is the one married to Stephen Hanes, who, everyone discovers, is having an affair. Why, for crying out loud? Meg's character is pretty, can do anything around the house, is involved in charity events, and claims to be great in bed. (For one thing that puffed up, kinky hair annoyed the heck out of me. And what's up with her lips, or out, I should say--Meg has the new, yucky, puffy lip style now.) As her mother (Candice Bergen) tells her, men admire women who achieve on their own.<br /><br />So who's the man stealer? Eva Mendes in a hot, frankly--slutty role. She looks great! Does Meg keep a stiff upper lip (no pun intended) as her mother advises, or does she leave the scoundrel. Leave him she does and throws lives in chaos, particularly her daughter's, a tween.<br /><br />Three generations, three reactions to a marital break-up. At a weekend retreat Meg learns from an edgy Bette Midler to live selfishly. Ask: What do I want? That begins Meg's regeneration as an independent person, particularly as a fashion designer, her life's goal until she married.<br /><br />Other issues concerning women spring up in this mult-layered story:<br />1. Annette Benning (looking worse than I've ever seen her--what's up with that flat head?) is Meg's best friend. Their friendship is ruptured as a result of the separation and must be mended. She plays the successful single friend whose career has hit its peak. This is another issue.<br />2. Jada Pinkett Smith--in my honest opinion--plays the \\"gay black\\" friend. Her role in the movie did not feel authentic to me.<br />3. Why in the world would the gorgeous Debra Messing play that last scene? It was so grotesque and utterly unnecessary!<br />4. However, Candice Bergen's role as a matronly mother feels so right.<br />4. And why would a director keep Cloris Leachman so tightly zipped? Wasted talent there.<br /><br />But the message is clear. Men are nice (sometimes), but they're really not to be trusted. (That statement also applies to hussies who leech married men of their time and money.) Most of all, forgiveness works out if it can be freely given, if there is a grounded person giving it.in the movie did not feel authentic to me.  3.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|I really felt like I'd gotten out of something earlier this year when my husband offered to take kids to see this movie in the theater. Even after they said it was good, I still didn't quite believe them. (I've sat through enough cyncial/crummy Dreamworks movies--for example, Over the Hedge, Bee Movie, Magadascar, Shark Tales, and Shrek 3--to cause me to lose faith in the brand.) But Santa brought Kung Fu Panda on DVD and we watched it together yesterday. It was actually quite good--stunning animation, and a good story with a valuable message. In fact, one of the main themes of the film echoed something Nancy Pelsoi said in her recent book about women's leadership, \\"Know Your Power: A Message to America's Daughters.\\" How's that for an unexpected connection?    I spend lots of time with nine- and ten-year-olds, and I really appreciate things that are truly aimed at them. Not too babyish, but not just wholesale appropriation of teen culture, either (as in, \\"Mom, when can I have a cell phone?\\"). Kung Fu Panda hit that sweet spot for me. It is too intense for little ones but I thought it was great for older elementary on up.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I supported David all through the time he was on American Idol.  Every time he walked out on that stage, i knew he was going to do something incredible.  he never let me down and he still hasn't.  This album is absolutely phenomenal!!!!  Every song is unique and original in it's own way.  The lyrics are astounding, they take my breath away!!  His voice is the most amazing, gorgeous, wonderful, incredible voice i have ever heard!!  He doesn't go halfway with anything.  He puts so much passion and feeling into every song, especially \\"Permanent\\".  I can't listen to that song without crying.  Not only is the subject matter sad, but David's pain on that song is almost tangible.  He has proved with this album that he more than deserved to be the American Idol.  I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next!!!!!
0439023483|5.0|Have you ever read a book that wiped out all your favorite books? That changed your life, your perception of the world? That you couldn't believe you hadn't read, even if it came out only four months ago? The Hunger Games is one of them (I have only had two, sorry The Book Thief, you've been demoted). Even though some readers of this wonderful book might of read it only because Stephenie Meyer put a little blurb about it on her website, I read it for a different reason. I got the idea from Ms. Meyer but didn't read it because she said it was good. I read it because it looked so unique, so interesting, too good to pass up. Oh boy I was right. I breezed through it in a day, four hours I believe, and now I am starting to regret it, mostly because there is no sequel yet, and truly I cannot bear to wait for it.    The book follows a girl named Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future. Katniss lives in the country of Panem, the ruins of North America. In Panem there are 12 \\"Districts\\", each of which have a specialty. Katniss, along with her mother and sister Prim, live in District 12, the coal-mining district, where they struggle to survive. Every year the Capitol (the ruling seat of Panem) holds a competition called The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are Panem's punishment for a previous rebellion against the country that lead to the obliteration of District 13. Each district, on reaping day, sends a boy and a girl to the Games. There are therefore 24 12-to-18 year olds in all.    Anyhow, on reaping day, Katniss's sister Prim's name is called. Without hesitation, Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place. Katniss and the other District 12 representative, Peeta, are sent to the Capitol. Peeta and Katniss have a past, a past they cannot erase...   In the Capitol they are fed rich food, taken to interviews, and pushed around the arena in gorgeous outfits. Peeta and Katniss, supposedly under direction of their always-drunk mentor, have to pretend they are in love to win the crowd's support. There hasn't been a winner in 30 years from District 12, so one of them needs to win. When the games begin though there won't be all this luxury though. There can be only one winner of The Hunger Games, and Katniss is determined to win. But alliances must be made, foes must be fought, and loves need to be protected.   I couldn't put this book down. From the first page I was drawn in and stayed there. This book wasn't as gory as I thought it would be, although the savagery is enough to make your bones chill. The characters, every last one of them, was interesting and well-thought out. I cared for them all, even Katniss in her oblivious moments. There was humor too.    It is hard to explain, the feeling I got when I read this. I loved how they had to survive, how they had to stay themselves in this harsh new world. It really got me thinking, this book, about the future. It wasn't sci-fi or anything. It actually showed what our world could look like if some bad people and things came along.   The Hunger Games was such an original idea. The things Suzanne Collins did to her characters were stuff they would actually do. For the first time in a long while, I actually felt as though the characters were teenagers, not adults in a teenager's body. They may seem grown-up and mean and savage, but these characters had to survive. Some of them did a great job at it, others not.   And of course the romance. A love triangle, between Gale (Katniss's best friend from home), Peeta, and Katniss. I must say I like Peeta better. The Games can never be taken out of them both. It bound them together. I loved the things Peeta said. You could tell he really meant them. They made me all tingly, how much he loved her and Katniss was being an idiot and it nearly killed me. I liked Katniss, but sometimes I wanted to knock her on the head for being so stupid. She should pick Peeta.   I cannot WAIT for the sequel. I need it to come out soon. Very soon. When a book like this comesaround, don't pass it up. It might change you.  P.S  As I have read more into the Battle Royale resemblance I have discovered something. Sure, the plot sounds the same but I highly, highly doubt that Suzanne Collins saw either the movie or the book and went \\"Wow. Why don't I Americanize that?\\" Look at her videos people. It is all around us, the violence and obsession with TV and reality contests that inspired her. After I read THG, I went \\"Wow. This is like our society, only worse, but it in maybe 150 if something goes wrong.\\" And anyhow, it was said that Battle Royale was like Lord of the Flies, which goes to prove that there are only a few plots. I defend Suzanne Collins in this, and I am a teenager myself. You guys shouldn't go and try to ruin it because it sounds similar. Just read it, savor it, and reflect on it. I've got to admire Ms. Collins for writing such a novel, even if she later found out it would get such non-praise. Because guess what? It is a wonderful novel in its own right, and I am proud to call it my FAVORITE book of ALL time.

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|This musical was taken to the wide screen, mainly with actors, rather than singers. Meryl Streep might not be the best singer in the world, but wow! She gives all her soul, and the most powerful interpretation of \\"Winner Takes it All\\" It is great to see middle aged women having so much fun, and handsome actors in glittery suits, dancing and singing, very funny!!!
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|The movie was definitely over the top where the acting and plot were concerned, but what I think a lot of people forget is that this musical was designed for the stage, so in order to capture people's attention for a stage production, it has to be over the top.    The only thing that really had me wincing was Pierce Brosnan's singing, however, I don't think he has ever claimed to be a singer.  My thought is that they could probably have cast someone who could sing into that role, but aside from that, he acted in his part well.    Overall the movie is very entertaining and worth seeing at least once.  Just take it for what it is and don't expect to be blown away by great vocal performances, great acting or even a good plot.  No one ever said a movie had to be believable to be entertaining, right?
1594201927|5.0|This is a wonderful gripping tale of history.  Instead of focusing on wars, this book, as the title states, shows how our concept of money evolved.  Ferguson shows how our civilization developed as our idea of money developed.  This is a \\"fun\\" read.
B001GMH8RO|5.0|The movie itself is a favorite so I was looking forward to getting it in blu-ray. The video is a step up from the sd dvd but definitely not one of the better blu-ray transfers for a catalog title. There is some grain in the picture and at times the picture is a little soft but overall better than the sd. The CGI effects however are hurt by HD and don't look as seamless as in the sd dvd. The audio is TrueHD. It is clear and crisp but since this movie is mostly about dialogue the lossless codec doesn't add a lot. Surrounds are easily heard during the action sequences. Overall if you don't have this in sd in your collection I would get it over the sd. If you have it in sd you might want to rent it in blu-ray before deciding to purchase it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Dexter is a highly addictive show.  It's well-written, imaginative, thrilling and funny.  Michael C. Hall is so brilliant in his portrayal of a \\"good\\" serial killer, I feel like I could be friends with his character in real life.  In spite of his feelings of emptiness that stem from his traumatic childhood, he is evolving as a person and understanding the human condition more and more as the show progresses.  Dexter's dark side is as delicious to delve into as his kind side, and the show is one of the best on television.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is absolutely perfect for me. I've watched it close to a dozen times and it never gets old. I'd like to believe that I can be very passionate about a lot of things and this movie nails almost all of them and leaves me with the feeling that I need to go make this world a bit better and maybe even a little magical.
B00007AJF8|5.0|This is one of the coolest, most bizarrely funny movies I have ever seen. It stayed with me long after I left the movie theater, and I just wanted to view it again and again.  Charlie Kaufman wrote a brilliant screenplay and all the actors do a wonderful job as characters who develop such an anguish over their own existence.  I love that it is a totally original tale.  I recently added this DVD to my collection because it is one of my favorite movies of all time!
0385340990|5.0|I couldn't put this period piece down. I loved the epistolary style. Each letter was like a mini-cliffhanger, making it hard to stop reading. It was also interesting to consider the way the lives of the people on Guernsey had been affected during the German occupation. This is a work of fiction but a lot of excellent research went into its creation. The romance was a little predictable, but satisfying, and the ghostly \\"main\\" character was just the right combination of female qualities. I loved her spunk and daring and what she stood up for. I gave this book to all my dear friends for Christmas.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Dire Straits' self titled debut album was released in July, 1978 on Vertigo/Phonogram in most of the world and October, 1978 here in the United States on Warner Bros.<br />Dire Straits formed in England in 1977 at a time when Punk was big in the UK and disco and soundtracks were the rage here in the US. Then came along a different English rock band named Dire Straits (named after the financial situation the members were in) who did things the old-fashioned way as they combined rock, blues, folk, jazz and even some Country to great effect as witnessed on its debut album.<br />In the beginning, Dire Straits consisted of singer/guitarist/songwriter Mark Knopfler, his rhythm guitarist younger brother David (who would leave in 1980), bass player John Illsley (the only other original member who stayed throughout the band's career aside Mark Knopfler) and drummer Pick Withers. Those who put this debut on were in for a treat (as I found out one day when my local classic rock station played this album start to finish in the fall of 1986).<br />We begin the album with the rock radio classic \\"Down to the Waterline\\" which starts with a drone effect before giving way into some of Mark's stellar guitar work into a great rocker. \\"Water of Love\\" is next and a great country sounding track with some tasty dobro and acoustic guitar work. Next is the rocker \\"Setting Me Up\\" which is a great number with great country type of guitar playing from Mark. Next is \\"Six Blade Knife\\" which is another great piece. The first side ended with \\"Southbound Again\\" which was another excellent country sounding rocker with stellar guitar work from Mark.<br />The album's second side started with \\"Sultans of Swing\\" which put Dire Straits on the map and made the band huge here in the US. It's one of the band's signature songs. It's the story of working class guys who want to play their own type of music in a London club. The guitar solo from Mark Knopfler is one of the best ever recorded. Next is the epic \\"In the Gallery\\" which was a great song about a painter and artist who don't get credit for their works when alive but get recognition when they have been long gone. We slow down with the ballad \\"Wild West End\\" which is a great song showing the band were not afraid to try a ballad. We end the album with \\"Lions\\" which is a phenomenal track and great mid-tempo rocker.<br />Dire Straits' debut peaked at #2 on the Billboard chart and sold two million copies Stateside upon its release (9 million worldwide to date). Sales aside, Dire Straits were a band were to be a force to be reckoned with as time went on.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\\" which was a great song about a painter and artist who don't get credit for their works when alive but get recognition when they have been long gone.

B00005CDNJ|4.0|\\"Super Trouper\\" is an album where all the previous experience and successes of ABBA show, making it the most accomplished release the group has ever put out. It does not mean, however, that it's the group's best offering by far. This honor would go rather to \\"Arrival\\", which contains crisper, stronger songs and also more immediate and catchy hits. Moreover, ABBA albums rarely (if ever) worked as one cohesive piece (to this they came close on \\"The Album\\").  That said, the penultimate studio album is still as close to perfection as ABBA could get. Arrangements are maybe the best Benny and Bjorn ever wrote and they work especially well on songs that as such were not among the album's cream (\\"On and On and On\\" or Me and I\\"). The super hits of this record are the worldwide smash, a quintessential breakup tune \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", the title track with wonderful backup vocals and flawless melody and the majestically synth-ed \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\". Within this track, as well as in \\"The Piper\\" and \\"Happy New Year\\", ABBA unconventionally used simple structure of three verses and choruses instead of inserted bridges. Although the record is rather dancey, there are great ballads thrown in (\\"Andante Andante\\"), as well as the nostalgic \\"Our Last Summer\\", reflecting on a happy youthful times back in the late 1960's (?) in Paris.  \\"Super Trouper\\" is ABBA still at the top of their game, even though the future of the group at the times of its release started to be uncertain. It's a solid, smooth and catchy effort that you won't regret buying.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Genesis' new 13-disc (7-CD/6-DVD) box set entitled Genesis 1970-1975 is a MUST for all Genesis and Peter Gabriel fans.<br />This 7-CD/6-DVD box set were the last five studio titles to be re-released in an exhausting and long Genesis remaster campaign which began in 2007 with the 1976-1982 and 1983-1998 box sets.<br />The first inklings that a Genesis catalog overhaul was in the making was the release of the 3-CD Platinum Collection box set in 2005.<br />The albums in this box set are from the days when Genesis were the most adventrous progressive rock band and when Peter Gabriel was lead singer. The albums in this box set are 1970's finale with original guitarist Anthony Phillips called Trespass (see my review of the album), 1971's Nursery Cryme (which was the debut of drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett (see my review of the album)), 1972's classic Foxtrot (see my review of the album), 1973's Selling England By the Pound (see my review of the album) and 1974's swan song with Peter Gabriel called The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (see my review of the album). Plus a bonus CD/DVD set called Bonus Tracks 1970-1975 which is only available in this box set.<br />Each album was painstakingly digitally remastered and remixed by longtime Genesis producer Nick Davis. Plus the albums in the set are double disc sets (except The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is a three disc set) that features a CD (whereas in territories outside the US and Canada have Hybrid SACDs as Warner Music do not support Hybrid SACDs) and a DVD (which has each album in 5.1 plus interviews with Tony Banks, Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford, Anthony Phillips (on Trespass) plus Steve Hackett and Phil Collins (both appear on rest of the DVDs) videos and concert footage/TV appearances). The discs themselves all look like their original UK vinyl album counterparts with the labels (the pink Famous Charisma Label on Trespass and Nursery Cryme whilst Foxtrot, Selling England and The Lamb has the \\"Mad Hatter\\" label).<br />The bonus CD and DVD on this set is called Bonus Tracks 1970-1975. \\"Happy The Man\\" was recorded during the Nursery Cryme sessions and a great piece. Next is \\"Twilight Alehouse\\" which was written during the Trespass era but recorded in the Foxtrot period. The next three tracks were first recorded in 1970 for the BBC program Nightride which are the following tracks \\"Sheperd\\", \\"Pacidy\\" and \\"Let Us Now Make Love\\". We follow with a demo from 1969 which is \\"Going Out To Get You\\". The last four tracks are from an unreleased soundtrack entitled Genesis Plays Jackson. Michael Jackson (not the one everyone knows) was a painter who put music to a silent film of \\"Metropolis\\" and invited Genesis in to add music to it. Some tracks were recorded but the project was abandoned. These tapes have only recently come to light. On this box you get four tracks which are \\"Provocation\\", \\"Frustration\\", \\"Manipulation\\" and Resignation\\". \\"Frustration\\" would turn into \\"Anyway\\" on The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. \\"Provocation\\" would morph into \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" on Nursery Cryme. \\"Manipulation\\" would transform into \\"The Musical Box\\" on Nursery Cryme. Plus its offshoot DVD includes interviews, more concert footage and a documentary aired on VH1 in the UK.<br />All of the tracks on this box set sound SUPERB in their remixed state though many are long for the original mixes (those who want the original mixes go and find used copies of the albums). These mixes are reminiscent to what The Who did to their back catalog in the 1990s though less fans complained than the Genesis fans did here!<br />Plus, the box contains a 42 page case-bound book with essays about each album and rare photos.<br />RECOMMENDED IMMENSELY!e bonus CD and DVD on this set is called Bonus Tracks 1970-1975. \\"Happy The Man\\" was recorded during the Nursery Cryme sessions and a great piece.

B00005JLFC|4.0|\\"Yentl\\" is one of those movies that contain too much of Barbra Streisand. For her fans it's OK to bear, other may get fed up. For example, the overwrought soundtrack which does not even fit the movie very well, makes it overlong. On the plus side, the songs quite pointedly describe feelings Yentl has at a given moment of the movie. And when we pass over the fact that hiding of a girl in man's clothes counts on total naiveté of other characters, the movie is well worth your time. The story and especially the love triangle among Yentl, Avigdor (curiously dashing Mandy Patinkin) and Hadass (beautiful and delicate Amy Irving) is unique and does great promotion to I.B. Singer's short story. Most food for thought comes from variations and discussions on Jewish religious writings, mostly when concerning intimate lives of people. These moments make the film - among the great many of those with treat trans-gender disguises - unique and hard to forget. The 1983 flick's country looks resemble \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" quite much - this is understandable, since the settings are similar. For me the movie has a special magic as much of it was shot in the former Czechoslovakia, which used to be my homeland before Slovakia got independent in 1993.
B000002H2H|5.0|This time around, Metallica seem like they have a purpose with their music. Not only does Metallica surpass Kill em all, But Metallica creates an essential document in the history of all Metal music. The guitar playing is outstanding all throughout and the solos are all extremely impressive no matter how many times this album has been heard. There is not a bad song in sight on this album. And plus, you know you've caught onto something real good when you can play an entire album and never once hit the skip button! Every song is a classic in their own right. The dark, haunting ''Fade to black'' captures the band in one of its darkest moments as Hetfield laments about committing suicide. ''The call of ktulu'' is an outstanding 9-minute instrumental which should really be listened to in its entirety in order to get the most out of it. This is what 80's Metal SHOULD be remembered for instead of latter-day Motley Crue, Poison, and all that other crap. If you don't own this album, Buy this now!!!!!!!!

0321543726|5.0|For some reasons, I had expected a book on reflections on Stroustrup's philosophy of C++ programming aimed at experienced practitioners. I was quite surprised by the heft of the book, but much more so by the content. It's a book for non-programmers or beginners to teach them how to program with C++ as the vehicle and it's structured for use as a textbook for a first year college course.<br /><br />Physically, the book is massive, weighing in at over 1200 pages. It is printed on good quality semi-glossy paper and the extensive use of color will remind some of the Deitel & Deitel series, at least superficially.<br /><br />The prospective student will probably benefit from a comparison of this book to the existing leading tutorial books. The leaders, by popularity or quality, are (in no specific order): Lippman, Lajoie, & Moo's [[ASIN:0201721481 C++ Primer (4th Edition)]], Eckel's [[ASIN:0139798099 Thinking in C++: Introduction to Standard C++, Volume One (2nd Edition) (Vol 1)]] and [[ASIN:0130353132 Thinking in C++, Volume 2: Practical Programming]], Dietel & Deitel's [[ASIN:0136152503 C++ How to Program (6th Edition)]], Koenig & Moo's [[ASIN:020170353X Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example (C++ In-Depth Series)]], Lippman's [[ASIN:0201485184 Essential C++ (C++ In-Depth Series)]], and Prata's [[ASIN:0672326973 C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)]]. These all share the common purpose of teaching the C++ language, so an effort is made to cover the features and concepts, with examples that were constructed to illustrate them. This is NOT Stroustrup's approach.<br /><br />Stroustrup isn't trying to teach the C++ language. He's teaching how to program. C++ is the tool he uses to do so. This isn't a subtle difference. It's the difference between teaching you about a wrench and making up fake  car parts to fix with the wrench and teaching you auto repair and giving you a wrench to do so. You still learn the tool as you go along, but it's a side effect.<br /><br />The overall direction of the book is to teach students how to program solutions to real problems in a way that one would in the real world. Things that other books consider \\"extraneous to illustrating the principle\\" aren't swept under the carpet. Inputs are validated. Code is tested. Errors are detected. Exceptions are thrown and caught. They're not incidental details, they're part of the solution, and that's how Stroustrup presents them. Yet, these \\"details\\" don't detract from the readability or understandability of the code. In fact, they preempt the stream of \\"but what about...\\" questions that students will inevitable have when presented incomplete toy code.<br /><br />Chapters 6 and 7 are gems. They develop an expression evaluator, walking the student through a tokenizer, parser, and interpreter without bogging the student down with deep theory that will be learned in later courses and is unnecessary to get started (though many will be inspired to go read up on it). Besides showing some interesting and useful techniques, understanding an expression evaluator goes a long way toward understanding programming languages in general.<br /><br />The discussion on containers and iterators explains how one would go about designing them, not just using them. Once the development of a vector-like container is described, the other standard containers are presented for the student to use. No time is wasted trying to teach data structures, for which other classes and books already exist. The same applies to sorts and other basic algorithms. The standard ones are presented for immediate use by the student.<br /><br />There are chapters on basic I/O, GUI and graphics (using FLTK), data formatting, and numerical programming (this is my least favorite). There is also some cursory coverage of upcoming C++ features as they are found in boost, such as regular expressions. Because this book deliberately targets beginners, you won't find advanced topics like template metaprogramming. Thereare entire books (three of them!) dedicated to that.<br /><br />Finally, there is some brief discussion of the history of C++, on its own and in the context of the evolution of programming languages in general. I would have enjoyed more of this.<br /><br />If I were to teach a course, this book would be my first choice. A disciplined self-learner would also be well served by this book.<br /><br />However, it does not try to target those who already know how to program and wish to migrate to C++, though they would doubtless find this book interesting and well written. For them, I would recommend \\"Accelerated C++\\" or \\"Essential C++\\" to bring them up to speed quickly or \\"\\"C++ Primer\\" to study the language more in depth. For those coming from a language that is conceptually different from C++, the two \\"Thinking in C++\\" volumes do a good job of aiding in the paradigm shift. I am deliberately omitting non-tutorial books like the \\"Effective C++\\" and \\"Exceptional C++\\" series, though they are certainly essential.<br /><br />Everyone -- beginner and migrating expert -- should avoid C++ How to Program (6th Edition). Notwithstanding the pretty presentation, this book teaches abysmal programming practices, such as blatant and amateurish violations of the Liskov Substitutability Principle.<br /><br />Naturally, every C++ programmer should own [[ASIN:0201700735 The C++ Programming Language: Special Edition (3rd Edition)]] and [[ASIN:059600298X C++ in a Nutshell]] is a marvelous one-stop reference.<br /><br />As a side note, there is a long running debate over which language is most suitable for teaching an introduction to programming.

B000HEWEJO|1.0|I am a big fan of Frank Capra movies. But for some reason I waited 20 years since it's video release to watch this movie. Back in the 1980's and 1990's it flooded the tv channels at Christmas time. All my friends watched it and said it was great. As a Christmas treat I decided this was the year to see it. What a let down. First of all it was about a half hour too long. Jimmy Stewart's character was a born loser. Everything bad happened to him from the beginning. He also passed up opportunities to better himself. He ignored the prettiest gal in the movie (Gloria Graham) for a plain Jane (Donna Reed). To me, Lionel Barrymore's was the best character in the movie and he certainly gave the best acting performance. This was a big Frank Capra disappointment. With the length of the movie and the failings of the George Bailey character, when he was on the bridge near the end I was yellinh \\"JUMP JUMP JUMP\\".
1878424505|4.0|It's simplicity is deceptive:  The Four Agreements provides essential guidance in a challenging world.  So obvious, so essential, I wondered why I did not think of them myself.  Having said that , Ruiz is not a particularly engaging writer, and at times he is redundant, over-simplified, and even a bit patronizing.  He could have said more with less, and the beauty of the agreements is sometimes lost in his verbosity.  Even so, I keep a copy in my desk at work for those moments when I am distracted by the extraneous and need a road map to spiritual integrity.

B001ILHY1I|4.0|This movie didn't shoot for an oscar nod, it's just a straight up action movie. Jason Statham is doing his usual hard faced, kick butt role, which is what he does best. The race/fight scenes are excellent and I really enjoyed them.     The only thing that was kind of off note is the female co-pilots. The explanation for them seemed forced and just didn't jive, but that's the only weak point.    So if you want some hardcore action, and a Mad Max style movie this is it!
0761145613|5.0|Perfect for the busy mom- lets you keep track of everyone's activities- lots of fun stickers for the kids (or you)
0747541604|5.0|\\"The Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" details the gruesome/improbable fates of Amy to Zillah in the style of a childrens' alphabet book. However, it's definitely not for children young enough to be learning the alphabet, unless you want them to have nightmares or to turn out really creepy. That being said, if you have an irreverent and quirky sense of humor, you'll find it hilarious. And, you'll learn to be careful not to be done in by a thug or die of ennui. Really.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|Fresh and new with an old world feel.  One of the best fairly new bands in years.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|Yes, this movie is humorous and entertaining, but towards the end I stopped laughing because I was so annoyed and bothered by basically everything, especially the fact that the brothers never acknowledge their white privilege. These are some of the main points that bothered me in the movie:<br />1. The trivialized portrayal of poverty in India. It is shown in a way that makes white people feel comfortable--by not portraying it at all.<br />2. White people acting as saviors to brown people<br />  a. When the brothers save the kids<br />  b. When the mother says \\"They need me\\" when the brothers try to get her to leave<br />3. Exotification of India--yes India exists for white people to take spiritual journeys, buy lots of cool exotic goods, and have sexual encounters with their women.<br />4. how white privilege allows them to step in and out of a third world country and only take and see what is useful to them<br />5. how rich white people can afford to take vacations for months at a time and throw away all their luggage because they can buy everything again. Yes, I understand Anderson's cliche baggage ending but you get the point.
0061537934|5.0|When I picked this up I had never heard of the author or book but it seemed like an intriguing book. This book gave me every type of emotion possible. The story was great and unique with its different perspective. I would recommend this book to anyone and hope to find more books that are like this.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This was the first Blu-Ray disc I purchased, and it set a high bar for others to follow. The image quality is phenomenal, and it absolutely pays off in letting you notice the incredible details that Pixar put into this film. The additional content is also terrific. The Director's commentary includes thumbnails of the early artwork in the film's development. While the Director's commentary gives you the broad backstory and ideas behind the film, there's also a second commentary track, done Mystery Theater 3000 style, that points out all sorts of details and easter eggs in the movie that I'd missed. Wall-E is a fantastic film, and this Blu Ray edition helped me appreciate the movie even more.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this for an extra controller. These things have a lot of features. The motion sensor aspect will take some getting used to by this gamer. I was unaware of this feature when I bought my PS3, and it certainly adds a new element to gaming. It was on sale for a very good price and worth it.
0316017922|2.0|Thought this book could have been a magazine article in Psychology Today. Couple of interesting points that didn't require a $20.00 book to explain.  I bought 3 books as gifts on recommendation of other readers.  Unless you are interested in reading how Korean Air turned itself around, don't bother.
0316035904|4.0|I'll do a breakdown on what I thought about each of the stories.<br /><br />SantaLand Diaries - This one I would have to say is my fave out of all the stories. This one hooked me right from the first page. I just couldn't stop laughing. My other half was looking at me like I was nuts! LOL<br /><br />I'll give you an example, 'I often see people on the streets dressed as objects and handing out leaflets. I tend to avoid leaflets but it breaks my heart to see a grown man dressed as a taco. So if there is a costume involved, I tend to not only, accept the leaflet, but to accept it graciously, saying, \\"Thank you very much,\\" and thinking, You poor, pathetic son of a bitch. I don't know what you have but I hope never catch it.'<br /><br />Just too funny!<br /><br />Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family! - This story was funny to with a very odd ending. It's about the Dunbar family, with whom the husband at one point in time went to war, had sex with a Viatmenese woman and had a child who showed up their doorstep one day. Well, let's just say that this one was pretty darn funny!<br /><br />Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol - This one was short and sweet and pretty much to the point with talk about television and plays. It has a lot of talk about the shows that the schools put on for the holiday season.<br /><br />Based Upon a True Story - This story is told by a gentleman who is taking the place of a minister. So he is practically preaching to the people in the crowd. He wants the help of this poor congregation so that he can get his 'story' to be 'based upon a true story'. This one was pretty funny.<br /><br />Christmas Means Giving - Two families who take Christmas way beyond the 'means giving' part to out-do each other every single year. This one I found to be pretty hilarious.<br /><br />Dinah, The Christmas Whore - Who takes a whore home? Well, in this story, this family takes her in like she's a celebrity!<br /><br />Jesus Shaves - Talks about religion in a French class full of adults who are trying to do an exercise where they are going to be using the word 'one' as a pronoun. A lot of referring to the different holidays. Funny.<br /><br />Us and Them - A young boy is recounting his life with his mother when they moved to North Carolina. He found it interesting to spy on the neighbors to see what they did in their time off. Lots of talk about TV and why some people watched it continously and others didn't 'believe' in it.<br /><br />Let It Snow - It snowed and snowed and lucky them got snow days. Their mother had a nervous breakdown and then someone lost their shoe!<br /><br />Six to Eight Black Men - A story about the local gun laws that interests him and makes him a proud American. This one was pretty good.<br /><br />The Monster Mash - Dead bodies, anyone? Let me give you an example of this story, 'By this point in my stay, my list of don'ts covered three pages and included such reminders as: never fall asleep in a dumpster, never underestimate a bee, never drive a convertible behind a flatbed truck, never get old, never get drunk near a train, and never, under any circumstances, cut off your air supply while masterbating.' Okay, I think you get the point! LOL<br /><br />The Cow and the Turkey - A Christmas story with animals who are playing Secret Santa with each other. There is a lesson to be learned at the end of this one.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the entire book! I laughed out loud, oh, I don't know how many times. But it really was good to read something that put a hilarious spin on the holiday season!hey are going to be using the word 'one' as a pronoun. A lot of referring to the different holidays. Funny.

B000MQ54OO|5.0|I'm a enviromental lobbyist for ALL the nay sayer adults, Prior to this film, Few were even concern about the enviroment and most still aren't. There are films out there to enrich & educate our youth, we don't rent or purchase them. We vacation in other countries commenting on their beauty then come home &  we throw food, cigarettes, dirty diapers,soda can's, bottes, paper everything out car door windows, to lazy to walk store carts back to the stores or to a cart storage area but we can say this is to adult, not this or that. Children learn by adult examples, and the examples we adults are seting are poor! Look @ us we are picking our nose driving, texting driving, drinking & driving, ladies with shorts with the butts hanging out & we want to belittle a film that's for entertainment. People exercise some of this energy in your enviroment to preserve the planet for the young people. People, put the trash in the trash can, bend over and pick up something & throw it away. Stop  talking & texting while driving not paying attention wile driving, serving whole dinners while driving and then throwing them out the window or leaving the garbage them in parking lots. Have you looked around a movie theater when the movie has ended and see all types of garbage left in the theater? Think about it! Ferngully is a nice film for young people to see it's enviromental movie....Purchase or rent it, let children see how to make a better enviroment & be far better examples then we are showing them. I have a grandson who was 9 months when he first saw this film and was captivated by the colors & music most of all the tapping, he's 13 months walking now & still captivated & tapping with one foot. It's entertainment!I've seen far worse and we display far worse in our everyday lives. Children didn't know about the enviromental aspect before this film, many adults either. This is broadening many young people's thoughts.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I have every Rush item I can get my hands on and this is the prize possession! I cannot believe the Blue Ray difference. It really shows the greatest musicians in the world in their ultimate form. If you want the best of Rush .....this is it. A good mix of old and new tunes showing the boys in their best form. Hopefully they will tour again so I can see them the 15th time. Buy This DVD!!!
B000FVQLRA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, and would recommend it. also watch the review and the director done a good job directing  the movie the way it was. I would order from the same co. again.
B000YAA68W|5.0|I had long intended both to read the graphic novel upon which this film is based and to see the film itself.  As it turned out, I encountered the film before the book.  I had long wanted to see it after noticing the stellar reviews it received upon its release and because of the extreme outrage the film created in the Iranian government, which repeatedly requested that various countries not allow it to be shown.  I can understand why.  It is an unfiltered and uncensored insider's perspective on what life inside post-revolution Iran is like.  There is absolutely no question that life under the Shah was horrific.  It is also absolutely certain that life after the Shah has been just as bad or worse.<br /><br />I am a religious person and I certainly have no problem with anyone worrying about what God wants them to do.  I have a great deal of difficulty with people who think they know what God wants other people to do.  This film should not lead Americans into complacency.  There are millions of fundamentalist Americans who are just as certain that they know what you or I need to do to fulfill God's will as the religious zealots in Iran.  So this film should stand as a warning to us reaffirm diligently the separation between church and state.  We really, really don't want religion shaping our government.<br /><br />If PERSEPOLIS were merely about the dangers of religious fundamentalism taking over civil society this film might have pedagogical value but no more.  Luckily, it is a witty, charming, and deeply moving account of one person's life.  As Marjane Satrapi's real life story unfolds in animated form we come to feel deep compassion for the tragedy that has surrounded her childhood and youth.  We are also moved by the delight and joy she finds in life despite the religious zealots who want to micro manage and tightly control her thoughts and habits.  We also come to understand the impossibility of anything approaching a normal life in a society where self-appointed policemen (and the occasional policewomen) for God dominate everything.  The film is filled with dozens of amazing moments illustrating the absurdities that enforced religiosity creates.  My favorite may have been when Marjane goes to the black market where shifty looking men quietly hawk their wares, looking for all the world like drug dealers.  But instead of heroin or pot they are selling the Bee Gees and Julio Iglesias.  And you have to love it when Marjane refuses to succumb to religious pontification but instead goes back to her apartment to listen defiantly to Iron Maiden.<br /><br />This is a delightfully unique film.  We are used to non-animated films dealing with serious topics and as a result are somewhat steeled against them.  They are simply all too familiar.  But we aren't used to animation delving so deeply into such serious and profound matters, and as a result the film surprises us.  The film provides us with a grim and illuminating portrait of life in Iran since the late seventies, but it does something else besides:  it delights and entertains.the occasional policewomen) for God dominate everything.

1416562591|5.0|Adiga's chillingly suspenseful tale is Hitchcockian in its portrayal of a murder.  It is a tome of social conflict but it is much more than this, an insightful psychological study of greed, jealousy and the motivation of a murderer.  It can be read on many different levels.  But the point is this: it is an excellent read.  Enjoy!
B001ILHY2C|3.0|In the end Death Race is a goofy little movie. If I were thirteen years old with the attention span of a tick, this would probably be my idea of a cool exploitation flick...<br /><br />Read the whole review on DreadCentral.com!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001ILHY2C Death Race [Blu-ray]]]
B00011F5DK|5.0|I ordered this game after reading all of awards that it had won. I thought we'd give it a try. I recommend this for ages 8 and up. My 6 year old plays but you have to think ahead a little. We love this game! It's a quick game to play and there are very few rules! Highly recommend!!
0452289963|5.0|I'm going to start out with what I feel are the cons about this book and then elaborate the pros (which FAR outway the cons!!!)I agree with some who say Tolle's writing is redundamt, wordy at times, and often a tad confusing.  Not confusing as in the concepts explained, but confusing as in his specific wording.  Some passages took me 4 or 5 times to re-read to figure out what he was talking about..  Even then, there were moments where I just simply had to move on, not quite 100% sure I understood what he was saying.    Additionnaly, there is a passage about eating disorders which, in my opinion, is too simplistic:     \\"If the sufferer could look at her body without the interfering judgments of her mind or even recognize those judgments for what they are instead of believing them - or better still, if she could feel her body from within - this would initiate her healing.\\"    Have gone through (and conquering!!!) an eating disorder myself, I know from experience that there is much more to healing than simply feeling the \\"body from within\\".  I was disappointed that he offered such a pat solution to a very complex issue.    Aside from these few cons, the rest of the book is aboslutely amazing and eye-opening!  I can say it truly has changed my outlok on life this past year.  Period. Yes, it does take some time to catch on to what he is saying, but once the light bulb goes off, the effects are startling!    My eye-opening moment came when he explained that \\"thinking\\" is just a process of the body like any other that's running in the background:  breathing, digesting, sleeping, etc...  I finally was able to \\"GET\\" how to observe thoughts.. in much the same way one would observe that they are indeed breathing, it is the same with thoughts.    That one particular passage nailed it for me.  It toally sealed my understanding of everything else he says in the book!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Not only is this completely awesome in a way that will define awesomeness for generations to come (only a small exaggeration) but it is a huge step in finding a way to circumvent the studios. That's why it's so important that Dr. Horrible makes money, enough money to make people pay attention. Because this will prove what Joss Whedon and other writers have been saying all along: We don't need the studios. All they do is interfere with creativity, take money from the real creative minds of the writers, and try futilely to stop pirates. Joss is (hopefully) about to prove that he can make a simi-high-budget film, put it up on the internet free for a week, and STILL make money.  I am an amateur filmmaker. I hope one day to be able to make a high-budget film, put it on the internet, and make enough money to keep making them till I'm old, tired, and fat. But amateur filmmakers like me can't do that if the studios control everything, if independent films keep getting swept under the metaphorical carpet as they are now. The studios have all the control right now, which is why there is such a lack of creativity in American movies today, half of which are just sequels or remakes. I say they had their chance, and now it's time to move on.  Getting a copy of the DVD isn't just about supporting everyone who worked on this project, it's about proving something. Proving that we don't need greedy middle-men who interfere with creativity. Proving that we won't wait for the next writers strike before we see the need for change. Because that's what this is really about; it's about change, and our ability to change the industry for the better. It's time the writers got back control of what they've written. Just imagine, if Dr. Horrible succeeds, and is followed by other successful independent films, there won't be a need for a writers strike ever again.
0061120073|5.0|I am seventy three. I remember reading this book in my early teens. I gave a copy to my daughter, then to my granddaughters, who enjoyed it as much as I did. Fashions and lifestyles may change, but the human condition does not. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn'is a perennial delight and as fresh as the day it was written. The bitter-sweet tale of Francie, a  young girl of Irish immigrant stock, approaching womanhood in downtown Brooklyn, speaks to the heart. On the face of it, this is a somewhat bleak tale of poverty, disappointment and sorrow, but above all, it tells of great love and youthful hope springing up among the weeds. My only fear is that in today's society, where instant satisfaction has become the norm, this book, with its' 500 pages, might seem too long - I hope not, for it is one of literature's truly great stories and a very good read!

015206396X|5.0|At first I had doubts about this book. Didn't know if it was worth the effort reading it but I bought it anyways and I don't regret it.    Kristin Cashore first book takes us to a time and place where kingdoms rule. All over the seven kingdoms there are people with gifts, or grace, some extraordinary, some not to much. But the ones who are, are taken to the king to serve them. They'll know if they have a grace just by looking in their eyes, if they are different colors then they're graced.     Katsa, the main character, found out by the age of eight her grace was killing. She was the king's niece and was trained to use her grace rightfully and serve the king. However, she did not like doing was she was told to do: killing and hurting. And that's how she and others close to her decided to do things on their own behind the king's back, and save people and do well. It was in one of those missions when she met Po, a graced young prince who was in the middle of the same mission as her, with fighting skills it's hard for her to bring him down, something that usually takes her a second to do with other people. She did not judges him at first, but as time passes, she learns they have more in common than she thought, but finds a truth that makes her sad, angry and dissapointed. As their friendship grows they discover together there's more to her grace than just killing, and can't help falling in love, and fighting for their lives and other people.   I won't give out much. But I recomend it.  This is a book I would gladly read more than once!
1595141979|5.0|Shadow Kiss is another great read in the Vampire Academy series. Once you begin the book, I promise it will be hard to stop. I disliked the ending, but if you like bittersweet conclusions, you will definitely enjoy this one. Even if you hate sad endings, this book is too engrossing to skip!
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Like all the other Dido fans, I waited over five years for another album from my favorite musician. I totally agree with one of the reviewers here who said that on first listen the songs are not that impressive. By the second or third listen, however, something magical happens. Every single song is a masterpiece in itself but the album as a whole seems organic. The only thing missing is the song *For One Day* which is on the deluxe edition.<br /><br />One wonderful addition to the instrumentation is the recorder. Dido has been playing the recorder since she was four years old. Her playing is magical and haunting. In addition to writing the music and lyrics, she plays the recorder, guitar, keyboards, drums and beats.<br /><br />Outstanding!
B0017MO10U|5.0|I have been a longtime Stargate fan, and this movie is no disappointment. It is a fun movie and typical of the Stargate series, lots of funny lines mixed into the dialog. Also typical of Stargate, lots of action. I really enjoyed the movie! I am glad I added it to my Stargate collection!
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|I tried soooo hard to like this new effort because of my love for Donna Summer. I played this over and over, not consistantly, but at different times to see if I would feel differently about it. Unfortunately, I could not.     Crayons, the title track, is the best song off of the cd, in my opinion. I got a reminiscent glimpse of the old/new Donna on the verge of emerging. You know the one...? Solidifying her own style of music, phrasing and likability. Different, fun...you remember?.     Driving down Brazil gave me the same feeling the first two times I heard it but on the third listen I began to be disappointed and annoyed. The something old mixed with the something new began to remind me of an old diva wanting desperately to be remembered by the old and respected by the new. Forgetting she became who she is by calling her own creative shots and not by following others, begging to be accepted into the musically inclined fold. Especially with styles that aren't so great out there to begin with.     Example; Sand on my feet has an overly used recipe of cutesy down to earth, folksy, everybody like it, sing along song style. It became annoying pretty quickly as well.    I won't go thru every song, I am not a licensed critic. Although, some who are shouldn't be. I can say, I know what I like and I have an opinion.   Although, I may like an artist I won't look over the things I don't like about a project just because I like the artist. I think these songs suck and are beneath Donnas talent. Yeah, I said it!     Donna Summer, like many seasoned artists who have not lost their voice or flavor, lose their nerve when it comes to creativity or remembering how they got to where they are; Taking chances and not following the status quo was key to becoming what many other artist could not. Not exactly becoming greater than others but becoming their own different light on the music industry. Not afraid of setting their own standards and not what radio stations or execs say will work which most times does not.     I really, really wanted to like this because Donnas vocals are still powerful, distinctive and with plenty skills but in good conscience I could not. As a TRUE fan I could not forgive myself, if I had. She took her song slide over backward literally by taking backward steps that were all too unnecessary for a still skillful lady.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Love the movie...great for kids and parents. Also enjoy the bonus features -- Pixar should continue to make the short films, as they are very entertaining.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This is absolutely the best metal album of 2008.  I also loved Metallica's Death Magnetic, but this album is just more brutal and is in my opinion Trivium's best.  And saying this is Trivium's best is a huge compliment because Ascendancy, Ember to Inferno, and The Crusade were all incredible metal albums in their own rights.  This album is simply Trivium at the top of their game.  Lyrics are some of the best I have heard in a long time, they are very dark and poetic, and many tell stories effortlessly!  Musically, all members are almost flawless, bass is great(for this genre anyway), drums are insane, and the guitar work is incredible with monster riffing, dual solo's, and very inventive solos throughout by both guitarists (Heafy and Beaulieu (however you spell it)!  The solos are all perfectly executed at breakneck speed.  This album combines the more melodic of Trivium's work perfectly with the most brutal of Trivium's work.  The album is basically half screaming and half singing, which like many made me happy that Matt was screaming again, and screaming like a maniac from an insane asylum.  All the songs are long, epic, and exciting, never dull or boring!      The highlights of the album are:  Kirisute Gomen, Torn Between Scylla and Cherybdis, Down From the Sky, Into the Mouth of Hell, Of Prometheus and the Crucifix, and Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven.  He Who Spawned the Fury is basically a death metal song with almost exclusively growled vocals, and is one of the darkest and heaviest songs Trivium have ever done!  Down From the Sky might be the best Trivium song yet, the music and tempo changes throughout the song are breathtaking, it goes from melodic to insanely heavy to fast to just about everything, it's just incredible!  Like Callisto is a thrash masterpeice, that's all there is to say, it's one of my favorite Trivium songs ever, if you love thrash you will love this song!  Of Prometheus... has the best chorus that Trivium have ever done, incredible melody!  Into the Mouth... tells the story of a shipwreck, it's another great highlight!  But all the songs are very good, the weakest would have to be the title track, which drags a bit at parts (It's 12 damn minutes long)!  Truly the best metal album of 2008 and may go down as one of the best of the last many years!  If you love metal do yourself a huge favor and pick this up!
B000RZGIQ8|1.0|This might seem obvious to people who are tech saavy, but you can't play Blu-ray on a regular DVD player.  We were very disappointed to find out as we were so excited about watching the movie!  Now I guess I have to sell the Blu-ray disc and get a regular one.  Bummer.
0316017922|5.0|This book does an excellent job at breaking down how and why people have been able to become as enormously successful as they have. Gladwell explains the history in a very easy to read way that gets a very powerful point across,; to be really really successful it takes about 10 years or 10,000 hours first.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|I don't understand those who slam this movie (or the prequels!). I have watched it with my kids countless times now and it is very well done and a lot of fun (which is what Star Wars movies are meant to be, entertaining fun).  It's a great addition to the Star Wars universe along with the movies and several novels.    A must have for any Star Wars fan THAT GETS IT! (and isn't some nostalgic trip expecting to see a movies tailored just for them).

In the back section of the book, you will also find examples of some of the author's photographs, and a detailed description of how the shot was achieved.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|All-star cast has no story.  Movie praises high-end shopping and looks while just giving lip service to friendships.  Notable for having no men in leading roles (or with any dialogue to mention).  Moderately engaging.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Verve Forecast re-released Melody Gardot's \\"Worrisome Heart.\\"  Its slow jazz arrangements and her lovely voice give the album coherence like the first Norah Jones CD [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]].  The title track smokes with a late night, last call feel with Dave Posmontier's lovely piano and Ron Kerber's silky sax, \\"I would be lucky to find me a man who could love me the way I am with this here worrisome heart.\\"  \\"Some Lessons\\" seems like a simple track, but oozes with the bittersweet mixture of joy & pain, \\"Some lessons we learn the hard way; Some lessons don't come easily & that's the price we have to pay.\\"  \\"One Day\\" with Gardot's guitar and Stan Slotter's trumpet sounds like a renegade Edith Piaf track, beautiful for its austere arrangement, \\"One day you will arise to see the stars within my eyes; One day you will be mine.\\"  Comparisons to Laura Nyro come from the stark and searing vocals on \\"Love Me Like a River Does\\" that make it a classic track, beautiful and smoky. \\"Goodnite\\" has a trill in the melody that helps the set conclude with a sense of melancholy lightheartedness.  Gardot's \\"Worrisome Heart\\" CD is a delightful treasure.  Enjoy!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing! I am surprised that I have not worn it out yet. I listen to it all the time now on my way to work, instead of the radio.  Loved the books, the movie, and now the soundtrack!
0618154043|5.0|For fans of Tolkien and his mythology, this is an indispensable work. Unfinished Tales provides incredible details about many aspects of The Lord of the Rings, such as the hunt for the One Ring and how the Ringwraiths got to the Shire. There is also a history of Galadriel and Celeborn, a full account of Tuor's journey to Gondolin, the history of the Wizards, and the history of the long friendship between Gondor and Rohan, as told in \\"Cirion and Eorl\\". All readers of Tolkien must read this collection if they are going to understand Middle-earth and its history and people.<br /><br />One can read this book as a companion to The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, or The Hobbit, but it can also be read on its own. There are notes from Christopher Tolkien which explain the progress of each story, and the different versions of them. The only complaint I have is that my edition only provides a general map of Middle-earth, after the breaking of the West. There is no map of Beleriand. But there is a map of N&uacute;menor, and it's a great help as a reference when reading \\"A Description of the Island of N&uacute;menor\\". I had a lot of fun reading this again, and I found the stories, which are found almost nowhere else (with the exception of the \\"Narn I Hîn H&uacute;rin\\", the history of Turin Turumbar). I would recommend this not only to hard-core readers of Tolkien, but also those who are simply curious about the history of Middle-earth.
0316017922|5.0|I find that Mr. Gladwell writes another enticing book. I actually spent an entire day reading all the way through his third book, and to no surprise, it was one of the best reads of 2008. I actually suggested the book to one of my teachers, and she now plans to a project with next year's students in conjunction with the book. She even went about purchasing all three of Mr. Gladwell's books. It is easy to say that Mr. Gladwell will be, if he is not already, one of the best writers of our generation.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Just finished watching the movie and also some of the DVD extras. The main purpose of the film, which is showing how the US health system is unfair and deceptive, is well achieved. We recognize ourselves or someone we know in the situation of having treatment denied due to limitations over finance resources or a pre-existing health condition. Well, living is a pre-existing condition to be sick and die, and the movie managed to show how the government, the drug and the health insurance industry could not care less about people when money is all that matters.<br /><br />However, I thought the attempt to show how public and free health care systems work so fine in the UK, France and Cuba was a mistake. While I agree that just the fact of having free access to medicine and assistance in those countries is just good enough, that does not mean it is effective. Let's not forget that this is just a movie and things and people tend to behave differently when the camera and the lights are on. I don't mean to be pessimistic and/or skeptical, but that's just what happens in reality. So the apparent \\"red carpet\\" treatment patients in the movie get might not have been that genuine. Comparing different systems is valid for the point Michael tried - and managed - to make, but if he had chosen to focus only on the US problem, it would have produced better results.<br /><br />Good movie, despite its apparent flaws.
B000000OF6|5.0|The only drawback would be to say I cannot hear my copy which I take in the car.  I have made a copy so that I don't lose my original.  Don't know why.....and love listening to all the songs.
0765317389|5.0|I'm 46 years old and the last sci-fi book that I read was in high school until I picked this book up on a whim to venture outside of my normal book reading realm. Simply said, this book is so well written in regards to the character development, the concept of the story and the manner in which it played out to my surprise in the end. There are so many books that I've read and so many more that I want to read yet I must find time to read this book a second time and I already look forward to it.  Be prepared for a thought provoking story that is truly a pleasure to envision time and time again.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Let me say unequivocally, if you're thinking about adding \\"Metropolis\\" to your DVD library, Kino's [[ASIN:B00007L4MJ Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)]] is the one you want.  Hands down.  This restoration rendered the print so clean, and the movement so smooth, it looked almost as good as if it had been made yesterday.  It's as restored to its original construction as well as it can be accomplished at this time, with intertitles to explain the missing elements that have so far remained lost.  This is a finely produced disc, rewarding on a couple of levels.  For one, it satisfies the wish to see the film in as close to its pristine condition as possible.  I wasn't there for the premiere, of course, so I can't say how exact it is, but it seems remarkable to me, as I imagine it might have appeared when it was new.<br /><br />For another, the extra features provide quite an education on the film itself.  The first is a documentary titled \\"The Metropolis Case.\\"  Running just under 44 minutes, it traces the cultural and historical influences explicit in the film, the people involved and their relationships, the set design, the cost, and so on, and how it fell into the edited mess it eventually became.  A second much shorter documentary (about nine minutes) details the restoration process.  It's interesting and very informative, instilling an appreciation for people who dedicate themselves to such tasks.  To demonstrate the result, several scenes from the film are divided down the middle, for a left-right, before-and-after comparison, where the improvement is striking.  In an exemplary case of the dedication to the project, when a scene involving a special effect was irrecoverably ruined, the archivists located the preserved original elements of the effect, then further restored and reassembled them.  Jumps from splicing, caused from slipping in the copying machine, were corrected, so in at least that regard, it's improved over how it would have looked at the initial screening.  The end result of the restoration was so successful, it was admitted by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) into the Memory of the World Register.<br /><br />This edition includes an audio commentary by film historian Enno Patalas.  Patalas approached the task like a film scholar, and therefore omits the casual tone present in most commentary tracks.  He draws attention to the themes, how Lang and his crew provided this or that to hit the mark.  For what you get out of this disc, it's worth every last penny, and then some.<br />__________________________________________________l screening.

B001HC7XCS|1.0|My Grandaughter received The Lady and the Tramp on Dec. 20th. 08. So far so good. Problem, the DVD is in Korean.
0143034901|5.0|This is a truly magnificent novel, especially for those who have or will visit Barcelona. There are many locations visitors can identify. It lead me on a trek up Mount Tibidabo where I witnessed one of the most breathtaking sunrises of my life. It is masterfully written/translated, and is a pleasure to read. I personally cannot wait for more of Zafon's stories to be translated and published. It is highly recommended for anyone, but a must-read for travellers to the area.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|After being convinced by a friend that this game wasn't for the über-nerd I bought it for my roommate and I. I am totally sold on it now and is one of my favorite games of all time now. The game board can be randomized each time you play introducing new strategies and obstacles keeping it fresh. I liked it so much I bought the game again to give to my little brother (11 years old) and he love it too demanding to play it constantly. Learning the game can seem daunting at first, but in actuality it's very simple (I taught it to my little brother in a few minutes). Now I'm looking to get the expansion sets for their added elements.    The instructions that come with the game are in color and very good including a setup for a starter game. It also comes with little plastic re-sealable bags for the numerous small pieces making storing the game easy. The game says its for 3-4 players which is definitely more fun (expandable up to 6 with an expansion set), but it's definitely worth playing if you've only got two players.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I bought this because I love the show.  I was hoping to watch the episodes on my laptop, but note that these DVDs do NOT work on laptops (or at least not mine).  I can only view the discs on my regular DVD player.    I've never had a problem like this before, so I don't think it is an issue with my computer.  I assume this limitation is deliberate and has something to do with the producers making sure the discs can't be copied, but I have found it to be inconvenient.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas.  It is a great movie and he enjoys watching it.
B00000DHR0|5.0|The CD was just as the seller said it was, received the CD very fast. excellent service by seller. Thank You
B001DHXT20|5.0|The Incredible Hulk is another take on one of Marvel Comics' favorite hero.  Having been a big fan of the 70's TV series, I find this film much better than the 2003 Ang Lee version which was seriously flawed and almost put me off from seeing this version lest there be further disappointment.  Edward Norton and Liv Tyler have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  They give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! The rest of the cast carry out their performances well though nothing extraordinary.   The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects (!!!) and the music are all wonderful!  In short, The Incredible Hulk is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the 70's Incredible Hulk TV series. 4.5 Stars
B0002B15XI|5.0|Unbelievable, but true my husband had never seen the original movie M*A*S*H. It was great to see it again - the quality and wit still there.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Everything has already been said about this movie. I just seen it Christmas Eve night and it floored me. What a great movie. I definately recommend it to anyone.
193413712X|5.0|I loved this book.  Yes, as the reviews state, the writing is excellent, but more than that, the story and characters are amazing.  It has the unique gift of being incredibly moving without being maudlin.  You feel like you know the characters and they are part of your family.  I am traditionally a mystery/suspense buff so I actually wasn't sure I would like this, but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  It was one of those books you become jealous of the people who have not read it yet because you want to experience that feeling again. Don't miss this reading experience.
0783225857|4.0|This review is for the \\"Collector's Edition\\" of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The movie easily gets five stars, and the transfer on this disc is well done, but nowhere in the product description does it say \\"letterboxed\\" as it should. If you have an older 4x3 TV this edition is OK. If you have a newer widescreen 16x9 TV then you need [[ASIN:B0009X7664 To Kill a Mockingbird (Universal Legacy Series)]], called \\"Special Edition\\" on the Universal website, for an anamorphic widescreen version. Amazon lists both as merely \\"Widescreen\\". Universal lists this collectors edition as widescreen, but does specify Anamorphic for the Special Edition. I usually do a bit of research before purchasing DVDs, but in this case I jumped the gun, and now I will have to pay another $20 to get the correct release for my needs. Usually these discrepancies are addressed in product reviews, but I didn't see any addressing this particular issue. IMDB.com does however correctly list this edition as letterboxed.
0765342294|5.0|Have you ever wondered what it is like to have an army or have to freeze your own legs to pass a school test?  In Ender's Game, Ender does that and much much more, all before he's 13!  At age 6 Ender left his family to go to the Battle School.  From the very start older kids hated him because he could beat them at all the games in the game room.  After only a couple of months, he was put in an army, but could not participate in training, and during battles he was not to enter the fighting.  Not long after, he was transferred to a Rat Army where they used his ideas to win lots of battles.  After a lot of moving around, he found himself the leader of the Dragon Army, where again he put his abilities to use to win battle after battle.    Do not get this book if you hate action, battle, science fiction, and excitement; otherwise, you must read it.
1400063515|1.0|This is one of the most annoying books I have ever tried to read.  Perhaps this is because I have a Ph.D. in economics and know something about the topics covered, but could also be because Taleb has a self-indulgent, self-referential, inchoate writing style that would drive any discerning reader crazy.  His arguments are almost always tendentious, his expositions seriously flawed, his conclusions spurious.  You will learn little or nothing from this book, and may find the experience of reading it highly annoying.    Let me add that I am sympathetic with the conclusions, I just find the writing poor and the exposition tendentious and tedious in a way that I call \\"bogus mystification,\\" which involves frequent sloppy self-contradiction with the intention of sparking an interruption from the interlocutor which can then be interrupted by the speaker, a middle-Eastern conversational style that fares poorly on paper.  Nowhere in this book are the principles explained clearly.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the blu-ray version of \\"Incredible Hulk\\".  The colors were outstanding, great audio, and very good CGI.  Edward Norton played the part well, but I feel the Hulk should have looked more like him.  The blu-ray colors were so vivid, I needed to lower the color saturation on my TV.  Good, entertaining movie.  Highly recommended.
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is a book you can get lost in. Much of the horror that the nation experienced after the Columbine shootings has dissipated with time, and Picoult's plot, with its many similarities, can bring that horror rushing back to mind. This is a multidimensional story with vivid characters, a story that propels the reader into the pain and sensibilities of everyone involved.  and stimulates the consideration of important questions. Does American culture foster violence? Is violence ever justified? When victims retaliate, who is to blame? What is, or isn't, happening within our families? What is the nature of friendship?<br />Those who view Picoult's depictions of high school life as stereotypic are sadly mistaken. The subculture is cruel, affecting all students, and this is nothing new. Reading Nineteen Minutes is not a comfortable experience, but it is a memorable one.
B000RZGIOA|4.0|The acting by Nicholas Cage and John Travolta is fantastic in this movie, but there is too much vulgar language for my taste.  The blu-ray quality is top-notch.  There are a lot of special features included, and I especially enjoyed watching \\"making of Face/Off\\".  The story seems like science fiction, however, I understand that face replacement now has been done and is actually a reality.  Other than the bad language, the movie is well-presented and worth watching.
B001FB55MG|3.0|Skeeter (Adam Sandler) grew up in the hotel business with his father Marty (Jonathan Pryce) and sister Wendy  (Courteney Cox). Despite Marty's love for the business, he never quite succeeded and ended up having to sell his beloved hotel to a large chain.  The chain's owner, Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) promised at some point if Marty sold, Skeeter would run the hotel.    It's twenty plus years later, and Skeeter does run the hotel all right.  He's the maintenance man.  His sister Wendy contacts him for the first time in four years and asks him to babysit her two kids for the week while she looks for employment in Arizona.  Though Skeeter doesn't know it yet, the school Wendy is principal of is going to be torn down to build another Nottingham hotel.    Desperate for some way to entertain two kids he hardly knows, Skeeter lights on the idea of telling them bedtime stories.  To his surprise, the stories (to some extent) come true the next day--some to his delight and some to his woe.      \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is a good natured funny story that kids of all ages can enjoy.  It's not the best kiddie entertainment but you can take even the youngest to this film without having any content that is really worrisome.  And in these days, a good clean laugh is very hard to find--quite unexpected it came from Adam Sandler.    Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
B00197POXG|1.0|I just received this for Christmas and was so excited to reconnect with Dr. Quinn. I loved this show when it was on and I started watching right away.  Unfortunately the sound was completely out of sync. I jumped around to many episodes and they were all out of sync.  I will be sending this back and hope that the new set doesn't have these problems so I can enjoy the show!!!!    Anyone else had these problems?
015206396X|5.0|Fast paced, engrossing, refreshing, unique.  The concept of magic as a Grace is unusual, and creates a \\"thinker\\" of an action novel.  Along the lines of Tamora Pierce or Mercedes Lackey in the scope of the action, with a Turtledove-like or Stirling-like ability to make you think of the consequences of the characters' talents long after you're done reading.  Fantastic, I can't recommend it highly enough.  YA fantasy at its best.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|We had rented this because it looked interesting and fell in love with it!  Had to buy it!
0439023483|5.0|I devoured this book in a matter of hours and its characters remained with me even in my dreams. The next day, I reread it, unable to find significant faults.<br />Collins has established a powerful balance of romance, suspense, and morality. Katniss, the heroine I've come to love so much, knows what it takes to survive. The reader feels her pain from cover to cover as she makes choices between lies and survival, rebellion and submission, humanity and love.<br />The Hunger Games is an incredibly engaging read- and one that has left an impression in my mind greater than that of any book I've read in far too long a time.<br />My initial reaction upon finding that this book was the first of a series was fear. However, I am confident that Collins will provide us with more amazing content- and that Katniss's rebellion against the Capitol (the group forcibly in power) is just beginning.<br />I greatly look forward to the sequel.<br />This book may be the best I've read this year.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This little sweeper does exactly as advertised!  It's not a major cleaning device - and wasn't intended to be one.  It's a quick and easy picker-upper and it works just great for that.  We have hardwood flooring and a few low mat carpets in the living and dinning rooms - and we use this little baby daily for the simple and quick clean-ups - it's so light and easy to retrieve that it's a pleasure to use.  In a couple minutes, all of the daily crumbs and debris are gone.  For heavy cleaning we bring out the Hoover.  Battery live is actually very impressive compared to other battery cleaning devices (my Dustbuster gives out after about 45 secs - this device has not petered out on me yet even after 15 minutes straight use).  Note: I bought this in 2007, so maybe they fixed the battery problem.    Drawbacks - it gets hung-up on higher pile carpet and will lock-up.  It needs to be emptied frequently.  And, hair and fabrics get tangled in the rotor brushes and need to be cleaned often.    Hint - buy a new one on Ebay for under $20.00 and avoid the infomercial shipping/handling/ and BS that goes along with it.  I got mine new for $18 and a reasonable shipping charge.
B00005JPKE|3.0|The flip side of \\"Flag of Our Fathers,\\" this Japanese language film is a little too long for its own good. The tale told from Japan's perspective grows a little tedious, but you do see things from an alternate point of view. The praise is somewhat unwarranted, because, ultimately, there is nothing especially revealing or surprising here, just an expected take on what it must have been like to be a Japanese soldier on Iwo Jima. Worth watching in tandem with the other film, at your leisure.
B001GZ6QBU|2.0|To begin with, I loved the Dark Knight. I think it was one of the best movies to come out in 2008. But I'm reviewing the product here, not the movie.    I got the single disc full-screen DVD for Christmas, and was initially excited. But when I popped it in, I realized that it had NO extra features except subtitles. I mean none. This product is just the movie, so if that's all you want, go for it. But personally, I feel like the Dark Knight is well worth springing a little extra cash on to get some extras.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 11 year old daughter loves this game, and she has gotten so good she can beat me most of the time--it's amazing how this game improves kids' spatial relations, and yet they have a BLAST playing it!  Great also for adults to play with each other--very fun and yet challenging!
1401902197|5.0|I came to this book already a fan of Louise Hay after reading You Can Heal Your Life. I have since purchased audio affirmations and I find Ms. Hay's voice calm and relaxing. She's like a gentle grandmother talking kindly in your ear!<br /><br />I Can Do It covers different aspects of life and well-being and Louise Hay discusses with the reader why our thoughts block and ruin good that comes into our lives. The book and CD are the same reading (this can be confusing because Louise Hay sells subliminal mastery cd's that include affirmations and actual subliminal messages). This CD is for using in your car or during your daily chores, to help remind you to stay on track with what you have learned in the book.<br /><br />I love the inspiration it brings as Ms. Hay reminds you of all the different ways you can reinvent your life, at any given moment. She mentions a new infancy at 49, for the later stages in life. That particular focus makes this book all the more special for someone who thinks their life is stuck because they are older, but the lesson is a wonderful influence for any age.<br /><br />I keep the book at hand for flipping through, I keep the cd on a playlist in my iPod for listening to, and I keep gifting this book out to friends and family for the promises of a new life it affirms. All the best.

B000F8O35U|5.0|The little mermaid was one of my favorite movies to watch as a kid. As and adult I still find it to be a fun movie to watch. Twenty years may have passed since its release but it has'nt lost any of its charm.

B0017ANAZO|3.0|The original 1939 film [[ASIN:B0008ENICU The Women (Keepcase)]] is a laugh-out-loud experience with fast-talking, catty women characters saying and doing outrageous things. I think it is safe to say that if you are a big fan of the original film, then this 2008 remake will be a huge letdown. Women have come a long way since 1939 and despite the hilarity of the the original film, the characters (desperate acting women who will stop at nothing at keeping their man, even if he is a no-good cheater) seem cartoonish today. Of course a literal re-do would be ludicrous today. However, even with modern female sensibilities thrown into the script for the remake, a talented ensemble of actresses fail to ignite a stale script. Annette Bening is fun to watch and manages to trigger a few laughs but Meg Ryan is colorless in the lead role and Debra Messing is just irritating (and I usually like her!). Eva Mendes is gorgeous in the role initially done by Joan Crawford, but she isn't given much to do. Jada Pinkett Smith seems to have been thrown in as an afterthough and wonderful actresses like Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergman bring little to the table.<br /><br />On a positive note, this was my first blue-ray dvd experience, and I thought the sets, photography and art direction was first-rate. Simply stunning, the film is beautiful to look at.
B000PY30JE|5.0|Chet Baker has become one of my favorite trumpeters. His trumpet playing is lyrical, but on many other albums he has proven himself a quite capable technician on his instrument. Anyone who doubts his technical ability should check out his quartets with saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Russ Freeman. He was a master of playing playing, which is what this 1959 recording consists of. Every single track is rendered beautifully by the space given in Chet's lines. Chet is joined by some of the best jazz musicians at that time: Bill Evans, Pepper Adams, Kenny Burrell, Herbie Mann, Paul Chambers, Connie Kay, and Philly Joe Jones. Anyone looking for some swing will have to look elsewhere. This album is nothing but ballads. I highly recommend this recording to anyone who is a potential fan of Chet's and for anyone interested in collecting Bill Evans session work, which he didn't do much of at all during his career.
B001KZVQJI|4.0|This review addresses the question: Will the January 2009 Blu-ray release be the standard or the extended edition?    According to Amazon's current product details, the Blu-ray run time will be 187 minutes, 14 minutes shorter than the run time of the [[ASIN:B000H30B2C Deluxe Extended Edition DVD]] with \\"more than 13 minutes of never-before-seen footage\\" [from the DVD liner notes].    However, that appears to be incomplete. At the NBC Universal Store web site, both the Original Theatrical Version and the Extended Version are listed for the pending Blu-ray release.    Based on this information, I have pre-ordered this item.
B0012Q732O|1.0|This movie was terrible im so glad I did not buy it but rather watched it through someone else. It didnt do much with the special effects.. I almost fell asleep. It could have been so much better with a better producer. It almost looks like a low budget film. And whats with the cast having their eyebrows \\"done\\"??? Whats up with that? I thought it was called 10,000 BC?
0446607274|4.0|I've enjoyed all the Connelly books I've read, no exception here.  I would like to see the characters more fleshed out, the dialogue better, the telling less, the book longer, but these are just small criticisms.<br /><br />The subject matter of this book is interesting, dealing with civil unrest and the multitude of problems that the LAPD has dealt with and sometimes causes for itself.<br /><br />In any case, the book reads quickly and is written fairly straight forward and tightly.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.
0143113100|3.0|\\"The brain that changes itself\\" demonstrates the various ways the theoretical plasticity of the brain can produce significant recovery of patients suffering from the most debilitating ailments, including paralysis from stroke, and autism.  Prior to the acceptance of the idea that the human brain is surprisingly flexible and adaptable (plastic), most neuroscientists were of the belief that different sections of the brain specialized in specific tasks (localization), and these specialized areas became rigid and solidified early on in life in such a way that sufficient damage to each section would forever deprive the victim of its functionality.    While Mr. Doidge presents numerous case studies detailing the astonishing and successful impact of plasticity based therapies, there is a peculiar absence of failed outcomes using these methods.  As a result, just how far can plasticity take us is difficult to ascertain.    Unfortunately, Mr. Doidge's presentation portrays him as more a cheerleader than an objective source of information on neuroplasticity, and his excitement comes through as glaringly obvious.  Consequently, his ideas have a deterministic flavor to them.  Plasticity, as he implies, is the end all, be all remedy for a host of maladies, and then some.    Mr. Doidge is also unclear what the future applications of this relatively new field of brain study are.  Seemingly, he believes plasticity of the brain can reverse or cure maladies in every walk of life, including but not limited to alzheimers, dementia, age related memory loss, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, learning disabilities, worries, obsessions, compulsions, bad habits, stroke, and problems with sexual attraction and love.  Clearly, some patients have benefited greatly from plasticity based therapies, but none of these aforementioned conditions have been close to being eradicated, which begs the question, just what is the potential of neuroplasticity?  Can it benefit the plethora of conditions as described b y Mr. Doidge or is he grasping at straws in some cases?    Mr. Doidge's effort in writing this book is to be commended, as it simplifies the field of neuroplasticity and introduces its ground breaking ideas in a coherent and understandable manner to the masses with many interesting case studies.  Beyond that, a more focused and less deterministic approach would have made this an outstanding piece of work worthy of five stars.
B001GQSY5K|3.0|And yet, we get a mediocre story with okay voice acting and pretty gorgeous computer animation.  The whole thing is just one big piece of eye candy.  The square-faced look takes some getting used to, but it is rather nice in an artistic kind of way.<br /><br />The script's terrible.  The only good lines were given to the battle droids.  \\"Why?!!!!!!!!!\\" (as it is getting chucked off the platform)<br /><br />The changed opening was just tacky.<br /><br />The battle scenes were decent, but not amazing, hence 3 stars and not 1 or 5.

B001L4NJIO|3.0|I bought tickets for this tour (LA) and gave them to my son and his roommate who went and said it was mostly drunken teens there at Dodger Stadium, so as a 50+ yr old rocker I am glad I didn't go.  [Later that summer I did go to the RUSH Snakes and Arrows show at the Hollywood Bowl and that was SUPERB.]  This Police DVD is well produced and shot but STING IS AN OCTAVE BELOW what he normally sings - sad really.  For a 3 piece naked rock bad it is good, but Sting, take some hormones.  The Synchronicity DVD is better IMHO.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This is a great CD with super pickin' and singing on all tracks. Alison Krause has the most beautiful, clear voice in the business. I can't believe that a year ago I never heard of her! Saw her on a tribute to James Taylor where she was singing \\"Carolina on my Mind.\\" I was mesmerized by her singing and her beauty. She is a great artist. Too bad this genre of bluegrass isn't more popular right now, or she would be winning many more grammies.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|Mama mia what have I done to deserve this? Well, at least I can return it.   I had high hopes and was excited to watch this film and felt like I just wasted my life.   Dont get me wrong, I love showtunes but this one was a HUGE let down.   I like only the very few ABBA songs used, and the others to me werent my favorite.  The singing was not the greatest either. I wont pick the cons out b/c most negative reviews explain everything that I didnt like about this film.   Plus its total chickflicks, I dont like chickflicks and Im a chick. I'll stick with ALW, Moulin rouge, the marraige of figaro, sweeney todd and repo, thankyou. At least with the few crappy songs in those shows, I leave happy. ^_^  Also it beats me buying overpriced tickets to the actual show and be disappointed. ^_^
0156030306|5.0|Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes was published/written as both a short story and a novel. Some of the themes covered include the treatment of the mentally disabled for the sake of scientific experimentation,the conflict between intellect and emotion or happiness,and how events in the past can influence a person later in life. This book is truly a classic.

0743424425|5.0|Without a doubt, The Shining is Stephen King's best novel (okay, maybe it's in a dead heat with [[ASIN:0451169514 It]]), though it isn't my personal favorite. The themes and characterizations are all expertly handled and mesh well together with one of the best hooks any horror novel has ever had.<br /><br />The elegant Overlook hotel closes down every winter due to the extremely harsh weather. For six months out of the year it is cut off from the outside world, usually occupied by a single caretaker. Of course, every hotel has its share of ghosts...<br /><br />This year the caretaker has a family with him. Jack Torrence, a troubled alcoholic with a sometimes violent temper; his wife Wendy and their son Danny, who is gifted with a sixth sense, or a `shine'.<br /><br />Since his cast is so small (especially compared to the whole town portrayed in his previous novel: [[ASIN:0671039741 'Salem's Lot]]), King is able to spend ample amounts of time building his characters into fully realized and `real' people. You empathize with Jack. He is a deeply troubled guy, with a dark background trying to do his best while under attack from an outside malevolent force.<br /><br />Stephen King proves he's more than a hack thriller writer with Danny, a believable (to me) five year old character. The sections written from Danny's point of view were never saccharine or cloying. Danny has trouble with concepts that we as the reader understand and that was handled very well.<br /><br />All this talk of quality characterization shouldn't lead you to think that The Shining isn't scary. The Overlook is a masterpiece of a haunted house. Complete with a suitably nasty back-story and tons of atmosphere once the final (living) guests have checked out and Danny's `shine' was a brilliant mechanic to make the sometimes... dry... scares of normal haunted house stories much more visceral.<br /><br />One flaw I had with the novel was that the ending felt a bit rushed. Still, it's a pretty minor criticism. It may just come down to personal preference. Overall, The Shining is a modern day masterpiece of a horror novel.e.

031606792X|4.0|to tell you the truth, the only problem to this book is the part from Jacob's point of view. I liked the writing but I'm not that interested in his point of view, i don't like him very much with Bella. Plus his part seemed to drag on to find out what was happening to Bella! And i really don't like that there is not going to be another book ):
B000P7V45S|5.0|1975 was a very busy year for Genesis. Obviously Peter Gabriel left the band but at the same time,in the transition they didn't release an album that year,opting to spend a long time recording this-with their new lead singer Phil Collins. Well obviously this is hardly [[ASIN:B000WTZ78O Invisible Touch]] from a decade later;pretty much all the technology used to make that one didn't even exist when this was made. That doesn't make a whole lot of difference because along with Peter Gabriel's departure came,of course a musical transition. \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" is a great way to begin the album mainly because it is one of a few songs here that fans of the earlier Genesis era will feel right at home with;that same acoustic feel in with the prog rock. Even if you could say the same of the \\"Entangled\\",yet another of those early Genesis acoustic pieces it sure is a pretty tune,even if the abtract and mournful lyrics work somewhat against it. After these songs THAT is when things get interesting.\\"Squonk\\",a very forboding song with the heavy drumming of the kind that would typify the kind of music Genesis would pursue in the coming years but it does start here. As illustrated in the liner notes to the [[ASIN:B000P46P82 Genesis 1976-1982]] boxed set Phil Collins was more interested in fusion jazz,R&B and Motown then progressive art rock and on even the Gabriel styled songs \\"Mad Mad Moon\\" and \\"Ripples\\" that begins to show a bit more. On \\"Robbery,Assault And Battery\\" there is an even more pronounced jazz-funk sound;the jazz-fusion style concludes the album with the instrumental \\"Los Endos\\" (which means The End I think) which actually has some unusual musical moments,including segments that sound as if they just recorded the random static of a bunch of unplugged studio equiptment mixed with the synthesizers.Whatever they did I like the effect. The title track is,up until this time is one of the poppiest numbers Genesis had done to this point. It has an almost Beatle kind of feel. Not out of the woods for a lead singer who had appeared in the first Beatles movie [[ASIN:B0000542D2 A Hard Day's Night]]. This album probably has the most variety of all of the early Genesis albums. The question I continue to ask myself is that is this more electric and mildly jazzy style of production was one Gabriel would've pursued if he'd remained in the band. It probably doesn't matter because no band can stay the same forever and considering how close the style of instrumentation and style of prog rock and fusion can be it was enevitable that one day Genesis would begin to mix the two,especially with Phil Collins's involvment with the fusion group Brand X. Either way you get around it this recording sure sets the stage for what was to come.kind of feel.

B000VBJEEG|4.0|I loved the movie only because I love critters. My daughter loved the movie because a rat can cook and talk. The move is cute and fine detailed. Although warning after watching it ten times can make you sick of it. So watch it here and there. BUY this movie for any one that loves critters and kids that love to watch animals cook. Do not buy for someone that easily gets grossed out or is majorly afraid of germs and critters.
B00004VVN9|4.0|This was a very interesting movie, both when I was a kid and even now 30 yrs. later. I watched this movie every time it was on as a child on HBO. It is a good choice to buy, it never gets boring.
B001IZFXMQ|5.0|I've read the book and it was great. The audio version was almost just as good. The positves were that there were many famous actors that participated and that performances were great. The story had a great flow and I was thoroughly entertained, nothing beats listening to this from the comfort and safety of your bed on a late, dark and/or stormy night.    The only drawback is that it is an abridged version and in particular one character's story is missing. Other than that, I was really happy with this purchase!
B001D52XO2|4.0|This is a wonderful collection for Nina Simone to gain more fans. The choices of the versions of songs for this collection, are the smooth more soothing ones. Each song easily fits together on the same album with any of the other songs. The DVD is really just for already fans. (I guess if your buying a box, you must already be a major fan)The mix of the clips of her performances and the interview disturbs the full experience. They should have had the performance then the interview.  Do not get me wrong. I highly recommend this box set to anyone. I am personally a fan of the coarser versions of some songs. One thing I really like about Nina Simone, is that no two performance of her are the same.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i love the world stephenie meyer has created in twilight and new moon and eclipse. breaking dawns events and conclusion not only thrilled me but also inspired me. to know that love is worth anything and the obstacles, even if they seem impossible, can be overcome. the love edward fells for bella can not be summed up in words . it is the same for bella. and when bella and edward are together its like theres nothing else in the world. so this book has nothing to do with vapires and their indestructibility or their beauty but bella and edwards will to overcome the obstacles that lead to eternal love whether that means dieing or simply being together. so anyone who thinks this book is pointless oris stupid obviously has never been in love and doesnt believe its worth it tofight for it either. so get over the fact that edward will never be in love with you. but for those who believe in true love as stephenie meyer does i hope u find ur edward or bella
B0018CWEYY|4.0|Have not watched it yet. But, if you are into Lost it's a must have. Loads of extras. We have the first three seasons. Very nice so far. If you are curious about Lost get season one or rent it. The story is far to complex for just a passing glance. Enjoy.
0786838655|5.0|Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson (p 38) \\"A dyslexic, hyperactive boy with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years,\\" has been being shipped off to boarding school for years. Seems like he is always getting into trouble for something. And he has oddly awful experiences every time he goes on a class field trip. His stepfather is a smelly, obnoxious man who doesn't seem like a good fit for his sweet mother. In spite of which, he wishes he could just stay home. Finally, he ends up at a camp for half-blood kids like himself, learns about his paternal pedigree, and sets off on a quest to retrieve a stolen artifact. To say much more might spoil the story. The Lightning Thief is  phenomenally filled with facts about Greek gods and containing: appropriate humor, wonderful writing, a fabulous plot, and uniquely funny chapter titles. Those who like this series may also enjoy: A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket; Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins; and, of course, Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling.

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|I had heard that the video quality on the special edition version was better than the original DVD release.  On my plasma screen, the original appeared washed out in many scenes, as if the video was too compressed to handle the source material.  In fact, the original is one of the worst DVD's I own in terms of video quality.  Fortunately, the special edition version exhibits none of those issues, at least not nearly to the same degree.  This fabulous movie seems to have finally gotten the DVD treatment it deserves.

B0007Q6PBK|5.0|I found every detail of this production to be unimprovable.  True, the film is old and grainy and sometimes slightly blurry.  But it doesn't matter.  The casting and vocals are unbeatable.  I'm so glad to have seen Pavarotti in this role and in his prime, when he fully committed to everything with his whole being rather than just vocally doing so.  He is superb (though he wobbles on the High C in \\"che gelida manina\\"), as is the rest of the cast.  But the biggest revelation for me was Scotto.  I grew up seeing her as Musetta on the other Met Boheme, and never really understood her following.  Thank goodness I saw this.  Her performance is something I cannot shake.  It has an emotional depth to it that fits perfectly with her vocal choices - she crushed me.  \\"Senza rancor\\" is the highlight of the night - I had to rewind it a few times.  This is an ideal DVD to show non-opera people.  I can't imagine not being swept into its magic!

B001ILHY1I|3.0|This movie is definitely more entertaining than most professional reviews gave credit, but maybe not quite as good as over enthusiastic reviewers might give. I was prepared for the worst going in. I am a fan of the lead actor but saw first hand with \\"In the Name of the King\\" just how bad a movie he could get himself envolved in. I read the reviews and removed this item from my preorder list, especially with a price from $26 -$29 on Amazon at that time. I was surprized on the upside once I rented the movie that most of what I feared was unfounded. The action is terrific, the acting is good and not distracting at any point that I noticed. The characters are compelling but, true to one allegation against the movie, not fleshed out much in any way. You literally get just an introduction to many and then the plot moves on to another race. This is a good movie that really could have been even better. On the other hand, for everyone of me, there are two others out there who just want to sit in the easy chair with a beer and watch fantastic car races... with gunfire of course! I will admit, coming from a military background, specifically combat arms, I really like a movie with the heavy base of gunfire and the clink of endless rounds of spent casings falling on the ground. This movie doesn't dissapoint in that area. I still consider this a purchase when the price goes below $15 or $20. I noticed Amazon stopped discounting movies much from the original intro prices you always see on Blu ray of about $26.99-$29.99 once they say their holiday sales were better than most. Time to give Amazon a lesson. In any case, I am also a huge Joan Allen fan and at over 50 she is still one of the most stunning women you will see on screen. My only beef with this movie at all is that the relationships are so underdeveloped it is hard for the viewer to become envolved or invested in what happens to them. Even the revenge plot around Jason's (the lead) family is so thin that you are not sure you care even though you know just enough to understand why. Seriously, 5-10 minutes of character developement really would'nt make this movie drag and you would be more on the edge of your seat caring about what happens.

0316017922|5.0|Gladwell is a refreshing writer who in not too many words   is able to communicate ideas of great importance.  I read   \\"Blink\\" and \\"The Tipping Point,\\" and this book is every  bit as impressive.  \\"Outliers\\" is a fresh perspective and more   realistic appraisal of what goes into the making of a successful person.  As usual, the answer is multi-factorial. It suggests that if you want to be successful, you need to maintain a broad focus.
0452289963|5.0|I realize now that although this book has hit the ball out of the park for so many readers (including myself), there are many people who have great objections to the concepts within this book as well as the general teachings that Eckhart Tolle presents to those who choose to listen. It seems that the bulk of the negative reviews and comments are coming from the perspective of the Christian type. Perhaps it was the fact that Mr. Tolle describes these concepts as being close to some of the teachings of Christ. In my personal opinion, I can see the connection between the two. Those that find this to be false are merely basing that assumption on your own opinions and likely the opinions of those you surround yourself with.        Eckhart Tolle's description of the ego and the power it has can be seen in its practical form right here on all of these reviews and especially the comments. This review is essentially no different. Those of you who attempt to debunk and destroy Mr. Tolle's message are only showing everyone that his observations are in fact valid. He is presenting new forms of age old traditions and concepts that have withstood the test of time. Eckhart Tolle's observations are profound, and I have no doubt that he exists in this venue because we need him. Not as a messiah of any sorts. Not as God. Just a messenger. He is able to do what most other scholars, intellectuals, and spiritual mentors have been unable to do for some time: present these always already existing concepts to people in a universal context that can be understood easily by those who are truly willing.        I understand that many Christians will be offended by the message in this book. Eckhart Tolle walked out onto a very shaky branch when he shared his interpretations of Christ and other central religious figures. I only hope that Christians can still find a way to get through this book, it will surely give you a great deal of inspiration. The ego is something we all need to be aware of.
0345495004|5.0|I love the escape of historical fiction.  Reading this book was like living another life (or at least seven years) with these characters.  They are not always loveable, but they seemed very authentic to me.  If you are very judgemental about extra-marital affairs, it may be hard to even like these characters.  But if you allow yourself to fall into step through the mundane and tragic, you will never forget this one!    Personally, I fell in love with Mamah.  Some reviewers despised her because she seemed to leave her husband without justification.  To me, that is the one of the most intriguing actions of a woman in her time.  She might have had more cause for desertion in real life, but I chose to see her as someone who couldn't pretend to love her husband as much as she loved Frank.  I wish that the author would have given us more insight into their private love affair, but considering all that Mamah gave up and endured, it must have been a powerful connection.    Highly recommended for those who love a good cry!
0316035904|3.0|OK, I love David Sedaris on This American Life and loved his previous books about his family. This little book was more bitter and violent than I expected. \\"Santaland Diaries\\" is a classic and a great read, but after that there are stories of people dismembering themselves, family members treating each other cruelly, and a barnyard animal being led to slaughter. Not denying Sedaris' talents but I enjoy it more when he is turning is razor wit and observations to his hilarious, off-kilter, endearing family and less when he is creating stories that seem designed to shock us out of whatever little holiday cheer we have. Sorry David!
B001CTA1S4|5.0|I saw a touring company of \\"[[ASIN:0822222191 Doubt: A Parable]]\\" starring Cherry Jones in the role that won her a Tony Award for Best Actress, and when I came out of the show what impressed me even more than her mesmerizing performance was the way John Patrick Shanley's play achieved such a delicately balanced sense of ambiguity on the issue of guilt and innocence.  Consequently, I was worried that even though Shanley would be both adapting his play to the screen and directing this film version, the careful calculus of the drama would be ruined.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is concerned about young Donald Miller (nee Muller), a 12-year-old student at the St. Nicholas school in New York City, is having an improper relationship with Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  She warns Sister James (Amy Adams) to keep an eye out for anything strange concerning the boy, and sure enough the young nun sees something that could be interpreted as being exactly what Sister Aloysius fears.  Armed with a certainty that is the antithesis of the work's title, Sister Aloysius works diligently, if not pathologically, to confirm her suspicions and to rid her school of the popular priest.<br /><br />There is an inherent impulse when a play is transformed to the screen to add characters and locations.  You might recall how \\"[[ASIN:B00004TJKK Steel Magnolias]]\\" added an entire new gender to the movie version with success.  But then there is the example of how the sense of claustrophobia so central to \\"[[ASIN:B000I2JDEY Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]\\" was jettisoned by a car trip to a road house.  Such pitfalls may well explain why Shanley decided to adapt and direct this movie.  The play consists largely of scenes of Father Flynn talking to his congregation or the school's male students, with those in which Sister Aloysius confronts each character in turn in her office.  Shanley has significantly reworked the former while keeping the latter scenes essentially the same, a precarious proposition because whereas the play tells us about Flynn's interaction with young Donald and the other students, the movie takes pains to show us several (but not all) key encounters.  Usually the dictate is for films to engage in showing rather than telling, but that is problematic here the audience should be in the position of Sister Aloysius, trying to render a judgment on the basis of hearsay evidence.  In reworking so many key elements of one half of the equation, Shanley does a masterful job of recalibrating his play for the screen.  Despite the performances in this film, once again it is the playwright's craft that most impresses me because if \\"Doubt\\" does not walk that fine line, so that each side can look at the evidence contained within and justify their respective rushes to judgment, the play collapses.<br /><br />The final hurdle is that audiences watch \\"Doubt\\" from a contemporary perspective in which the assumption, at least by late night comedians, is that every priest in the country has predilections to pedophilia.  But that is why it is so important that Shanley's story is set in 1964, and not just because it makes pedophilia less of an obvious concern.  It is because a key part of the dynamic here is that Sister Aloysius is old school while Father Flynn represents the tide of reformation in the Catholic Church mandated by Vatican II.  I have little doubt that when Sister Aloysius watches \\"[[ASIN:B000KJTGHO Going My Way]]\\" she sees Bing Crosby's Father O'Malley as the most troublesome priest this side of Thomas a Beckett.  The fact that Sister Aloysius may be seen as having ulterior motives is another compelling complexity of the play, as is Father Flynn's attempt to demand blind obedience from someone who is only a nun in an organization that is the paradigmatic model of patriarchical order.<br /><br />I was concerned when I saw the trailer for \\"Doubt\\" that Streep's approach was wrong for the character, but was relieved to see that within the context of her performance those lines that struck me as being odd all work.  This is a performance when Streep's character is confined by the severe bonnet of her holy order, and the actress focuses her performance on her mouth, going through an impressive display of tight lips, puckers, and twitches to flesh out her characterization.  The standout scene in this film comes between Sister Aloysius and Donald's mother (Viola Davis).  The scene is critical because it is the first (but not the last) time that Sister Aloysius has to deal with somebody as a human being and not as a superior or subordinate within the strictures of the Catholic church.  The scene is also a textbook example of how an actress can earn at least an Academy Award nomination, if not the Oscar itself, on the basis of single solitary scene.  Davis is clearly the one to beat for Best Supporting Actress in 2009.  Of course, you can anticipate Streep being nominated for the umpteenth time as well (Tell the truth: when she won for \\"[[ASIN:0784011710 Sophie's Choice]]\\" way back in 1982, did you not think Streep would have a couple of more Oscars by now?), and could hardly be surprised if Hoffman and Adams received nods as well, although such a clean sweep might be too much to ask for.<br /><br />In the final analysis I tend to think the film did not work as well as the play, but that could because this was the second telling of the tale for me.  I still favor Jones' performance over that of Streep, but one of the attractions of this play is that each actress who assays the role has an opportunity to make it their own.  Every actress within spitting distance of 50 is going to what to play Sister Aloysius at some point, and the four person cast should make this Pulitzer Prize winning play a staple of local theater for decades to come.  The key is to judge Streep on her entire performance, because in her final lines there is a definite payoff to the way she has wound her character so tight.  I really did have some serious doubts about how well this film version would play.  Suffice it to say I have them no longer.ance those lines that struck me as being odd all work.

Every actress within spitting distance of 50 is going to what to play Sister Aloysius at some point, and the four person cast should make this Pulitzer Prize winning play a staple of local theater for decades to come.  The key is to judge Streep on her entire performance, because in her final lines there is a definite payoff to the way she has wound her character so tight.   I really did have some serious doubts about how well this film version would play.  Suffice it to say I have them no longer.

B0017ANAZO|1.0|Superficial. Having not seen the original movie and not knowing that this was a remake, makes me now want to see the original.  Why does Hollywood keep remaking movies? I can say that in watching this, I was reminded of another movie made in the 40's?? It was about a woman - a socialite, and her husband left her and she was out of home and staying with friends, and still trying to exist on the far fringes of the society she came from. Everyone knew, some took sides, some acknowledged her, some didnt, and in the end, he called and told her to come home and she was ecstatic. I felt that movie said more about that time period than anything.    I felt the actresses in this movie, \\"The Women\\", were playing themselves. The only person that was funny and you felt for was Ms. Leachman. I couldn't feel for any of these people. And personally knowing many divorced women that dont shop at Saks, that aren't in high-power positions, I feel this movie was for a different demographic...I dont know which one.     In researching through Amazon today, I came across a book titled \\"Factory Girls\\" where the author describes chinese female factory workers who aren't \\"passive victims\\", and that instead the author found them to be \\"resourceful and ambitious, full of plans to improve their lot and change their fates, willing to challenge their bosses and quit their jobs for better ones, and willing to take night classes to improve themselves\\" and most importantly, they're not victims of circumstance. Maybe this would make a more compelling movie.

B000TEPKS4|5.0|A friend of mine bought this album when it was a brand new release for no other reason than these guys had backed up Bob Dylan. It was fall of 1968. He played it for us and I went straight out and got my own copy. Over the years I've had three vinyl copies (still have the last one), a CD copy that ended up wrecked from so much handling, and now the mp3 album with the out takes.  I have a particular affinity for first albums and live albums. Rock music isn't just about a tight band. Full Tilt Boogie was a GREAT band, but Janis Joplin lost some edge with them going for \\"tight.\\" This album has music that no band, including The Band, had done before or since. My only other Band album is Last Waltz.  One reviewer called this a \\"singles album,\\" with weak songs. This album got rave reviews from other musicians and caused several to make music they wouldn't have thought of without it. The Weight got a little radio play, but The Band songs that you heard or will hear on the radio are from The Band, and Stage Fright. Honestly, Cripple Creek and The Night They..., are not weak but they are commercial. This album, this music, is classic and timeless.

B000002G87|5.0|In 1970, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs was released, featuring two of the most outstanding guitarists ever, namely Eric Clapton and Duane Allman. A landmark album in its own right, Layla is perhaps one of the most widely disputed LPs in terms of how proper mastering was and is to be done on CD.     The first known CD release was in the early 1980's in a two-disc format; production capabilities of this then-new format could only allow a maximum play time less than 75 minutes, roughly two-and-a-half minutes short of the entirety of this masterpiece. This issuing was, by and large, not well-received by fans and audiophiles, because there was too much noise and tape hiss, signaling that duplication and reproduction had been done from a source quite removed from the original masters.    Since then, serious attempts have been made to issue CD's properly remastered from the original source recordings. Thankfully, Polydor has followed through with the \\"Clapton Remasters\\" series, which includes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. In this version, the 1996, 20-bit production has a rich sound far better than the first generation of CD's to ever come forth.    Contained are the introductory \\"I Looked Away\\" and the album rock staple, \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\". Quite noteworthy is the band's version of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\". The album was released only three months after Hendrix's death, so many thought that this cover was an immediate tribute to the guitar icon. In fact, the track was recorded about one week before his passing. Near the end is the immortal \\"Layla\\", arguably one of the greatest rock songs, if not the greatest rock song, ever recorded.    Collectively, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs is a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, listen. On a parallel with the sorrow that would emanate from witnessing the passing of young, promising stars, including Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and the aforementioned Hendrix, one cannot help but feel the great loss the music world would suffer less than one year after the completion of Layla when, on October 29, 1971, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident.     All in all, the album has, again, the finely tuned, top-notch guitar work of the great Clapton/Allman combination. Perhaps most importantly, it has inaugurated and, due to the popularity that remains over a generation later, has preserved the legacy of not only Eric Clapton and blues artists but also that of the Allman Brothers and the Southern rock genre.
B001GQACGE|2.0|I have always been a fan of Beyonc&eacute; and her \\"girl power\\" anthems.  I Am... Sasha Fierce, her new album, opens with \\"If I Were a Boy,\\" a song with very strong lyrics.  Some would call it a feminist's song, but the lyrics resonate with most women who have suffered from a broken heart and put up with unfair double standards.  And so, I downloaded this album as soon as it was available on iTunes.  I Am... Sasha Fierce includes feminist anthems and party-girl songs not unlike the previous stuff Beyonc&eacute; has released.  The problem is that this album, unlike B-Day and the others before that, is boring.  In the first half, only \\"If I Were a Boy\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" are enjoyable.  The others are nothing more than fillers.  The second half -- which includes dance music -- is much more enjoyable.  I especially like \\"Diva,\\" \\"Single Ladies,\\" and \\"Video Phone.\\"  There was a time when I used to love all of Beyonc&eacute;'s songs, but this album just doesn't cut it.  It reminds me of Mariah Carey's snoozer E=MC2: just as pointless and uninspired.  If you want danceable music to get your heart pumping at the gym, go for Britney Spears's Circus.  If you want smooth R&B/Pop, go for Alicia Keys, Jennifer Hudson or Leona Lewis.  If you want to listen to an artist with a similar feminist approach, try Christina Aguilerra's single called \\"Keeps Getting Better.\\"  Trust me, you'll be better off.

B00000JR29|5.0|I first got into Tears for Fears through their #1 singles, \\"Shout\\" and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\"; both, coincidentally, came from the same album - \\"Songs from the Big Chair.\\"  Over three years later, I finally got around to buying the multi-platinum album that everybody gives 5 stars.  And it's hard to disagree with what they say.    The main reason why the album was (er, is) so popular is because every song evokes emotions.  Instead of singing just the lyrics, Tears for Fears created each song with a unique approach that made it possible for the listener to remember it by.  \\"Shout\\" has an angry tone and \\"Broken\\" conveys a pessimistic tone, for example.  Some songs, like \\"Head over Heels\\", \\"I Believe\\", \\"Listen\\" and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" tugs at the heart because of the masterful combination of guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, drums, sound effects, etc. that Tears for Fears compiled (not to mention the accompanying lyrics).  The rest - \\"The Working Hour\\" and \\"Mother's Talk - offer an upbeat tempo to keep the album from slipping into a predominantly dark and moody album (though the cover says otherwise).  This combination turns the album into a medley of hits, waiting to be discovered for those curious to find out what the fuss is about.  Trust me, and the rest of the public opinions, this album is not only worth every penny, but also every ounce of praise that it has carried for the past 20+ years.  Bravo Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.  Y'all have created a masterpiece that will forever remain a classic in the music industry.    -RoMo37  --December 26, 2008

0316017922|3.0|This book points out some great examples of how arbitrary cut of dates for various activities in sports and school skew normal distributions.  Also, that in addition to hard work and brainpower that luck and happenstance have a lot to do with success.  But, the author after giving such great examples then fails to pull it all together with a summary chapter.    It is well written and absorbing, in fact it is hard to put down. But then he lets you down at the end, by instead of a summary or conclusion, with a story about his family, which while showing another example, is just another example and not really a good way to end the book.    Up to the end of the book, I would have given it four stars, the ending was at best a two star effort - so, overall I gave it three.
0452286751|3.0|Ayn Rand's talent as a writer is manifest primarily in her characterizations, and her ability to write dialogue.  She is also a master of analogy, though it is an over employed technique.      Although my familiarity   with her philosophy is limited to The Fountainhead, it certainly is capsulized in Howard Roark's summation to the jury at the close of the book.  Rand's celebration of the self (egotism in her words) at the expense of the collective (second-handers in her terminology) seems shallow and unworkable.  She idealizes the creator of the wheel, because such advances to civilization  exemplify the results of an individual working for his own self interest, whereas the user of a cart is merely a member of the collective second-handers following the resultant availability of carts (essentially).  Man's self interest is the highest good to Ms. Rand; higher than spirituality, higher than love (witness the 'heroic' surrender of Roark's love, Dominique, to two other marital partners apparently because neither could submit to the discounting of creative genius by the collective); higher than altruism (the ultimate underminer of Randian self-interest); and certainly higher than government regulation (as manifested in the current financial crisis led by such Randians as Alan Greenspan and Phil Graham).      The ultimate moral collapse of Gail Wynand makes no sense because he had no need to submit to the collective will- eventually acquiring full ownership of the Banner newspaper and closing it (those who have not yet read the book will forgive me this paragraph).  The acquittal of Howard Roark makes no sense; predicated on the basis of a contract giving him full creative powers.  In short the tenuousness of self directed behavior strains the narrative, itself, because of the faulted philosophical underpinnings.     Ayn Rand is the antithesis of Vedic thought from the Upanishads to the Buddhist sutras.  One must feed the motives of the self.  We are independent entities beyond the necessities of others.  The highest self is that which knows no compromise.  The transcendence of the ego leads to no discovery because there is no higher Self, no Atman, no Holy Ghost, no God, and no higher consciousness.      In short The Fountainhead is an engaging read.  Within its narrative style lies a self-refutation of selfish behavior, a dramatization of the suffering caused by egotism, and blindness to the commonality and interdependence of mankind.    As a counterpoint to utilitarianism and the philosophies of the East stands Randian libertarianism ; a polarity  to contentment, and in its contrast allowing one to understand the higher Self more deeply.  If we all were capable of inventing wheels, and the servicers of our biological needs were insentient   automatons perhaps the empty bauble of Howard Roark's existence would make sense, though it would remain empty; as untenable as Ayn Rand's philosophy.

031606792X|1.0|Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse have all shared one overall theme.  Sure the situations might have been different, but in the end, the books were always about the love between Bella and Edward, the struggles and dangers they faced, and Bella's struggle to choose what life she wanted.  Breaking Dawn, however, was about a completely different matter!    The conflict that the last three books have been about was resolved by the 3rd chapter.  Bella and Edward get married, and thats that.  All those struggles they faced, all the danger they went through, Bella's struggles to choose...all of that was wrapped up by the THIRD chapter.  So now what?  The author introduces a completely new conflict and theme: a baby!  What the heck?!  The books are no longer about the story I loved: Bella and Edward and their forbidden love.  It's now about a....vampire-human baby?  All the attention shifts from Bella and Edward to the demon baby.  If you liked this concept, good for you, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  Reading about a baby and motherhood was not the reason I read these books.  I gave New Moon and Eclipse pretty harsh reviews, but overall I still liked them because I liked what the overall story was about.  The baby however, was not what I was expecting or wanted to hear about.  I wanted more conflict.  One more final struggle before Bella and Edward could live happily ever after.  We did get that, but it wasn't about a conflict between Bella and Edward being together, it was about keeping the demon baby alive.  Blah!    Aside from the fact that book completely changed it's theme and overall conflict, there were other problems.  It was dull.  The author builds up two fights that never even happen.  In the previous books, the author builds up the volturi and makes it seem like they are going to do something huge at some point...but nope.  This was pathetic.  Where was the action?  It was all just talking and debating and cooing over Nessie.  Even Bella becoming a vampire was lame. Meyer talks about how difficult it is to be a newborn vampire for two books, but we never get to see any of those struggles.  Bella is perfectly fine.  BORING!  Not only was the book boring, but some parts were just disturbing. Jacob imprinting on Nessie...I really don't even have words for this.  If you can't understand why this is wrong and disturbing, then I'm not going to bother trying to explain it. And what happened to Bella's sacrifices?  The other books were about the sacrifices and choices, and then she gets everything?!  Jacob and Charlie will still be in her life!  And Meyer also tried throughout the other books to give Bella other friends that she would have to give up (Angela, Mike, Jessica) but I never believed for one second that Bella actually cared about any of them.  All she ever cared about was Edward.  Yes, Bella will never see those friends again, but she never cared for them in the first place, so there is no loss there.    Another problem was that everyone was out of character.  After Jacob imprints on Nessie, his character is gone.  It was like all the life got drained from him.  Bella was unusually cocky, psycho, rude, and irritating.  I wasn't aware that becoming a vampire also completely changed your personality.  Edward was still Edward...just duller than usual.  Was he even there during the last part of the book?  Rosalie was also weird...Alice was weird...it was all just weird.  Everyone was different.    My opinion is that the series should have ended at Eclipse.  The last chapter should have been the wedding, and then the epilogue could have talked about Bella as a vampire and Nessie.  We didn't need a whole book on it because it didn't follow the overall theme of the story and it just didn't really belong in this series.  The magic of these stories was about Bella and Edward.  The magic of their relationship is just completely gone.

1439102813|4.0|, but it starts slowly.     As I began this book, I found it not much better to read than \\"Another Mother's Life\\", which has recently become the book that I compare other bad books to. As soon as something else comes along and replaces it, I would conceivably have compared this to that book instead.     Nevertheless, Lisa Genova has a point at the beginning of the book: Without knowing what Alice's life is like BEFORE she gets diagnosed with Alzheimers, and BEFORE she is so symptomatic, it is hard to really compare what she has lost. And that is truly what this book is: A before and after image of what one woman's life is when she has early onzet Alzheimer's disease.     The book is horrifying for anyone who considers the possibility that this could happen to them. By the end, Alice has lost virtually everything. Her language skills, her job, her passion for reading, etc. The author would have us believe that she is, essentially, still the same person. I would tend to disagree, however. We are the sum of all the things that make us who we are. Yes, Alice still has her family, some of whom may or may not get early-onset Alzheimer's as well. Yes, Alice's family still loves her. No, she has no idea who they are. Without all of ourselves that we wish to have, we are not ourselves anymore. A person is who they CHOOSE to be, not who they are left being when things are taken from them.    Truly a despairing read, its still nice in the occasional moment when Alice manages to accomplish difficult tasks and retain some independence. These brief moments keep the novel from surpassing despairing and becoming monotonously soul-damning. And, they have the beneficial side effect of bringing the characters to life and making you feel Alice's plight.    It goes from a bad, dull book, to a wonderful, but sad, journey, with a woman it is impossible not to like, despite her foibles. I had my issues with the book (the pretentiousness of setting the main characters as professors at Harvard, as if losing a career in research and teaching at the University of Florida would somehow be less poignant, the husband's behavior to his wife, and hers to him), but nothing truly significant enough to disrupt my enjoyment of what, ultimately, became a heart warming and sorrowful story of a woman whose life is taken too early.    If you have a family member with Alzheimer's disease, this may help you cope, because the presentation of Alice's frustrations and depression are dead on. If you simply want to expand your horizons, pick up this life-reaffirming book. If you want a good read, grab this and don't let go. If you want something happy, well, you may not have found what you are looking for. Then again, you may have. Try it out.    A-     Harkius

B001N26GFC|5.0|Mike Leigh is known for darker works - Grown-Ups, Vera Drake, Naked... I always thought part of his \\"trick\\" was using deeper, dark subjects in his films.

As a friend of mine said, \\"I've never seen somebody so happy in a film that somehow wasn't annoying\\".  Just like Leigh's other films, this one will stay with you forever.

Most camera manuals and instruction books tend to be dry, over-technical and crammed with complex theory and explanations.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|If you told me beforehand, \\"I want to show you an animated film with almost no dialogue about a trash compacting robot,\\" I would probably laugh in your face. Dialogue is such an important element to any movie that I might have easily assumed it would be awful; something concocted by adult science fiction fans intent on pushing their interests unto the younger generation. However I don't mind admitting when I am wrong, and never have I been so wrong than when I told those who invited me to watch WALL-E with them that it would not be a good movie. It is not just good, it is amazingly good, and easily the best animated film I've ever seen.<br /><br />I know there will be movie buffs and purists who will extol the virtues of SNOW WHITE, or FANTASIA, or even TOY STORY, but to me, this movie exceeds those older Classics. As part of a younger generation accustomed to computer animation and with no particular love for hand-drawn cartoons (although I do love SPIRITED AWAY), I find the polished, digital animation in WALL-E to be visually unparalleled in quality.<br /><br />However, this isn't a digital wonder with no heart. The story is touching, heartfelt, witty, romantic, frightening in its portrayal of un-curbed consumerism, and altogether delightful. With elements of classic science fiction (the oh so HAL 9000 like shipboard super computer) juxtaposed with a modern, polished take on robotics (like the white i-pod exterior of EVE), the movie delivers for the true science fiction fan and child alike.<br /><br />Even if you have little or no interest in science fiction as a genre, this is still a beautifully told story that is not dependent on the science fiction elements to be enjoyable. WALL-E is a great character, filled with hope and imagination and an insatiable curiosity that any child will relate to. Eve, his 'female' counterpart is dramatically powerful, cautious, and ultimately as 'human' as WALL-E is.<br /><br />A film that I will watch again and again, and one which I am completely sold on, is perfect for children and adults alike, and one of those rare films which can be watched together with neither party feeling put upon. 5/5 stars and a must buy for anyone with children, or who is a child at heart.is perfect for children and adults alike, and one of those rare films which can be watched together with neither party feeling put upon. 5/5 stars and a must buy for anyone with children, or who is a child at heart.
0312330537|5.0|The best book I've read in my life.  So many books I read and get disinterested, every time the book slowed down a bit it instantly turned a new corner and peaked curiosity into another unexpected situation.  The way it was written is magnificent.  Very descriptive of all the characters and emotions at any given second.  This is how raw human emotion can translate into a book by captivating the reader, making them laugh and make the reader shed tears.  The most revealing aspect for me was how quickly I managed to go through 930+ pages.  Get the hardcover and throw away the paper flap, it looks classier that way. :)    I can't wait for the film.. I actually think Johnny Depp and Amitah Buchin (sp?) will be fantastic.

I think it might have enjoyed this 'queasy cam' flick more than I might of, because I kept busting out laughing at the most inappropriate moments (whenever another of the hapless party goers bit it) thinking of Stan's dad repeatedly saying \\"I'm so startled!\\" while shooting film of the 'monsters' destroying South Park.<br /><br />Cloverfield has an interesting premise, and provides a unique take on the 'Godzilla' variant of monster movies. Many singing its praises reference its uniqueness as if unique things are inherently good because they are uncommon. I disagree completely. For a 'unique' film to also be a quality film, it needs to provide something VALUABLE that is lacking from more traditional presentations. While home video style hand cam footage does put the viewer right in the thick of things, I don't believe it actually does much to help tell the story more convincingly. A film (or any story for that matter) will always succeed or fail because of its characters, plot, and dialogue. A gimmicky shooting style may create a new \\"look\\" but it will not make a bad film into a good one.<br /><br />Cloverfield suffers more from story telling problems than anything else. It is hard to really engage with the characters, even though the first third of the film is devoted to sorting out their love lives. In my opinion, it would have been much better to simply start the movie at the point where the monster begins to attack the city and leave the audience to feel the panic of the faceless masses, and then introduce the characters as the story develops.<br /><br />Novelty can only take a film so far. To really be successful, it must do more than just provide an interesting gimmick. Cloverfield is just another hum-drum monster movie, shot with an admittedly unique(if sickening) shooting technique. 2.5/5 stars.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|This LIVE DVD/CD is the best live set I have ever heard from any band EVER! I thought the show I attended in Orlando could not be beat, but Paramore really outdid themselves.  Hayley's vocals on \\"We Are Broken\\" are simply AMAZING and it was the best rendition she has done.  This band is spunky, fresh, and very talented.  I hope they continue rocking and I am undoubtedly a fan for life.    Best tracks: Let The Flames Begin, CrushCrushCrush, When It Rains, My Heart, We Are Broken, Hallelujah, and Emergency!!!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I use it on my D300 with 18-200 lens to photograph my 1-yr old son. I need a flash since I usually take pictures in the evenings. (Winter days in Portland also do not offer much light indoors, so I use during day as well.) Small size and bounce function make it perfect for me - both attributes are critical for me. Stays on my camera 100% of the time, both turned on (camera and flash go into sleep mode) and ready for action. I get masterpiece shots of my son every day. Having camera ready to use in an instant makes the special shots possible. I always use it in the bounce mode with just a slight tilt down to add some light on the face and to put some sparkle in the eyes. I use ISO 400 to get some ambient light. Everything works perfectly all the time - exposure and colors. The only improvement I can think of would be adding head rotation to allow vertical composition with bounce off the ceiling; not a big deal though. Low cost is a bonus, but not a major factor for me. (BTW, I also have Canon 40D with 580EX and I practically don't use it anymore - it is just too cumbersome due to 580EX size. I also get better results with D300.) If my SB400 broke for any reason, I would instantly buy another one.
B001KMB6VE|1.0|When the director of a film bashes his own creation before its released to the public, you know it's likely terrible. That is exactly the case with BABYLON A.D. whose director Mathieu Kassovitz brutally made fun of the film several times before it hit the big screen. Sadly, I didn't know that when I paid for my ticket. Halfway through I was wishing I was watching reruns of Babylon 5 whose average episode is superior to this movie by a long shot. By the end I was wishing that I could have my money and two hours of my life back.<br /><br />I've you've seen [[ASIN:B0014Z4P6U Children of Men]] you will immediately be appalled at how much of that much superior film has been 'borrowed,' for this one. In fact, if you want to understand this movie, think of CHILDREN OF MEN. Got it? Now replace the intelligent and believable Clive Owen with Vin Diesel, replace a careful plot and character development with a long series of violent confrontations, and lastly replace an impending sense of doom undercut by the promise of hope with an impending sense of doom undercut by sheer frustration that the movie has not ended yet. That about sums it up.<br /><br />Distopian science fiction is one of my favorite genres, with films like BLADERUNNER on my all-time greatest list. If there is anything at all to give this film credit for, it is that some of the sets and art direction do capture the 'feel' of a world in duress. Sadly, most of them are also stolen; there is very little that is original, and the scraps that are are unsatisfying.<br /><br />If this were a book, I would say it isn't worth the paper it's printed on. It's that bad. 0/5 stars.
0316236535|5.0|This is a great book for a child under about 7 years.  In a sense, it's a flat pop up book.  The monster changes with every page turned, which makes a kid's smile get bigger and bigger until the finale.  Not a long book.  My 5 year old loves it.

0060899220|3.0|When I started culinary school, I was told that this book was a \\"must read\\" for anyone who wanted to be a chef. I bought it, but never read it. Finally, this year, I decided to bust through it. While it is fairly enjoyable, I hardly think it is a \\"must read\\" for any aspiring chef.   Maybe I got lucky, but my experience working in restaurants is nothing like what Bourdain described. Maybe it's because I'm not in New York City, and maybe it's because it's no longer the 1980s, but the freakish work environment he described is pretty out of date. Besides, let's keep in mind that Bourdain never worked in the finest kitchens in NYC: he's a bistro cook. Sure, restaurant kitchens may still be a bit more \\"crude\\" than the professional offices of their patrons, but they're not the oozing dens of sin that Bourdain tries to describe. Read the book for the entertainment value, but remember that this is really just him reminiscing a bygone era.
B001J6NZGU|2.0|This film fails on several levels. First off, the characters are unbelievable concocted affairs that attempt to be funny by speaking very quickly when delivering their largely boring dialogue. Overacted jib-and-jab banter is the norm here. Unfunny at best and un-watchable at worst, THE WOMEN is a slow, ponderous train wreck from start to finish. Some of the scenes are so poorly constructed that not even the frenetic back-and-forth dialogue that saturates the movie can bring any life to them.<br /><br />Another problem is the gimmicky nature of the movie: there are no male actors in it at all. Not even extras. Gimmicks have and always will be about drawing attention to something that doesn't really deserve it. In this case, doubly so. Strewn with stereotypes, pithy anecdotes, and shabbily developed characters, it left this reviewer wondering what, if anything, the movie was supposed to be saying about the fairer sex. Certainly very little positive; even the daughter of one of them tries to burn her own tampons, desperate not to grow up to be one of the shallow, empty souls this movie presents as 'women.'<br /><br />Believe the many negative reviews of this movie. It really is that bad.
B001KQEA5E|5.0|This is a classic rap album from the early 90's.  If you grew up in the early 90's this is a must have.  It has some timeless classics that can be thrown into a party mix to change things up a little.  It's pretty heavy on cursing also, so this is the album that Tipper Gore and crew warned you about, haha  Enjoy!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney took this story and made a great film with it. I can watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. Great music in it also.
B0015DROBO|5.0|One of the best mysteries I have ever read. How tragic that the author is no longer with us.  Henning Mankell take note!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I must say the soundtrack contains an interesting mix of music. From the alternative sounds of Paramore to the blues-like acoustic songs of Rob Pattinson. I really enjoy listening to this CD.
B000KEG94C|2.0|Good and interesting story with absolutely top-notch actors, continually interrupted by obnoxious Broadway-ish musical numbers. Many of the performances were good, but many more were the type of stereotypical NY elitist silliness that I feared when I put this disc into the PS3. This movie has nothing on Dreamgirls, 1776, Hairspray or The Music Man. Heck, I'd force myself to watch High School Musical before watching this thing again. I like musicals. I didn't like Chicago.
B001GAOY5U|1.0|I saw this film in 3D in San Francisco.  It was outstanding.  There was excellent technical direction, as well as an interesting story.  The film has the usual stereoscopic gags with things popping into your eyes which I object to.  With 3D coming into increased use, perhaps Directors will get a clue it plays to the VFX, not the story.  As a slight digression, the best stereoscopic movie out there is \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" - this is a conversion of a formerly 2D movie; the 3D conversion enhanced the film.    Anaglyph video, as well as anaglyph comics, have been around at least since the 1950's.  Whoever did this conversion to a nonstandard choice of green/magenta versus the usual red/cyan does not make sense to me, considering the body of technical knowledge, skill available for such a conversion using red/cyan.  Perhaps it is an attempt to deploy rights management, but the glasses are available separately.  I observed many alignment problems with JTTCOTE.  Some shots with vertical misalignment in the original were not fixed in post.  There is a particular scene in the guide's house sitting around a coffee table: it was as if the two cameras had slightly different magnification.    The 2D conversion of the movie was well done, but not excellent.  I have viewed several BD videos by now, and I expect a certain amount of care in the conversion.      It is my opinion that the technical deployment of the stereoscopic portion of this BLU-RAY release of JTTCOTE was a hack job, poorly thought out, poorly done.  Considering how well the stereoscopic version in the theatrical release was so well done (albeit some minor alignment problems), that it should be so poorly deployed on the DVD release.  I saw the discussion of this film at NAB in Las Vegas 2008.  The Director and his colleagues put such effort and care in the technical deployment of this film, only to have it so poorly rendered in this DVD release has done the work a considerable disservice.  If you are purchasing this release with the goal of viewing this in stereoscopic 3D in your home, it is my strong opinion that you will be very disappointed.
0316010669|5.0|i almost did not read this book because of its title.. \\"the power of thinking without thinking\\" implied that its a sappy self help book that tells you how to think .. i don't like books telling me how to think..only my wife gets to do that...  but i thought i'd give it a shot seeying as i really liked his other book \\"the tipping point\\" .. it might have not been as good as the tipping point but it is very stimulating.. i don wanna give away the idea .. i'm sure the book jacket does that perfectly .. its about rapid cognition and the power of te subconsious .. i think the book's point was self contradicting at time and i completely did not like the last couple of chapters.. i would definately recommend it to anyone .. i give it 4.5/5
B0002DKCMG|4.0|I am over 30, but I've always liked to watch teen movies, mainly John Hughes' funny stories. This Eurotrip is somewhat over the top, but the characters are caught so naturally in the continuous weird situations that you are obliged to laugh! Four friends go to Europe during summer. Scott's girlfriend abruptly ends their relationship and in his sadness he discovers the internet friend he has in in truth a beautiful German girl. Then, he flies to Europe with his best friend Cooper in search of his true love. There, the twins Jenny and Jamie complete the group! There are countless scenes stereotyping both Americans and Europeans, sexually and culturally speaking. It is not for all audiences as some jokes really go deep and beyond... but if you just want to have something to laugh and not ponder about it, this is the movie for you!
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|When I first went to see this flick with my better half, I really didn't care for it. I'm an avid music lover of all genres other than heavy metal and improvisational jazz (I know I'm not alone in that) and was fairly critical of the amateur-grade singing by decidedly professional-grade actors. Hairspray nailed this approach. Mamma Mia! doesn't. However, having purchased the soundtrack shortly after seeing the film in theaters, I've found myself listening to the album from time to time over the past few months, and you know what? I'm now starting to like it precisely FOR its fresh amateur qualities. Couple the now familiar versions of the songs with this startlingly gorgeous and colorful Blu-ray release, and suddenly I find myself punching up 8/10 and 4/5's for this thing. It's just good fun, and that's not bad.
1582701709|1.0|There are SEVERE logical flaws found within the doctrine of the \\"law of attraction.\\"  I recently wrote a rebuttal piece on it you can find here:    [...]    Basically, this book is written by the affluent for the affluent.  If you are SERIOUSLY envisioning yourself in that new car you want, you are shallow.  If you absolutely MUST have more money, then you need to rethink your value system.  Poverty is not an ignorance to The Secret: it is a plight.  It is created by genetics, mainly geographic location (whether literal location, or your displacement from the rich white male standing).  After reading this book, I could do nothing but weep for the complete lack of compassion these people had and demonstrated in it's writing.      Assuming this information is all true, why waste it on a new car?  Completely absurd.  People are dying senselessly all over the place, and this big secret is only used for the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor.  It's as if to say the slave owners of the south during the 17th-18th century knew The Secret meanwhile their field hands didn't, which was why they were rich.    No, it's because they were white, and had the money to pony up for a fresh-off-the-boat slave.      The rhetoric was fluffy, the content was questionable, and it addressed nothing relevant.  It always talked about the Universe (capitalized, as if there was a proper noun, Mr./Mrs. Universe) but never established what that was except for some servant beckoning to our every whim.  This is a selfish idea of spirituality, and is only an egocentric testament of our generation.    And yes, I read the whole thing.    Ben  [...]  [[ASIN:1598588427 Green Bean Spirituality]]
031606792X|2.0|I enjoyed Twilight and made it through New Moon and Eclipse but was very disappointed by Breaking Dawn.  The characters that I had grown fond of in the first three books were not the same and the ending of the book was beyond terrible.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Today I saw this movie and didn't know anything about it. I really didn't want to go to a \\"chick flick\\" especially one about \\"who wants to be a millionaire\\". Who gives a rats butt? Boy was I wrong. This is not a kid's movie. I would say teenage and up. I love action flicks with a great story. Slumdog delivers the goods! This movie was fantastic! The way they went back to explain how he knew what he knew. The love story, true love even though she was \\"damaged goods\\". The story of a mixed up brother. Greed & corruption. I really enjoyed the music choices and the music during the credits was even enjoyable, typically I get up and walk out. I found myself planted on the seat until it was all over. I cant wait to get this on DVD. I will be buying some as presents. Hollywood could learn from the producers of a terrific movie!
B001G9LVGG|4.0|What a joy to find an original new holiday CD. Loreena McKennitt's voice is unparalled and is in top form on this CD. The song selections are eclectic and the orchestrations interesting. The only minor complaint is that the overall mood of the CD is \\"slow\\" rather than \\"joyous\\". For anyone who has enjoyed other McKennitt CD's however, this CD will be pleasing and a keeper for many holiday's to come.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Like our hero, in White Heat, for those two<br />hours, it is Jamal's tragic journey through the slums of India to the top of the pyramid that held me transfixed.<br />While the horror of the slums of India is soundtracked with an amazing score Jamal survives through hope that by going on he will find Latika his lost love. Truly love is the fabric that keeps Jamal hoping and surviving.<br />Many like Jamal's brother Salim choose another path and if there is a weakness in the film it's Salim's undeveloped transformation.<br />All said and done Slumdog Millionaire is a great film. The ingenious plot<br />reminds me that every moment holds meaning. For me it is a blind mans journey into our own future; Jamal's like all heroes has his heroic<br />journey to accomplish. These days the path is our modern world. Slumdog<br />Millionaire opens our eyes to the poverty of India that Jamal,<br />Salim, and Latika are thrown into. Slumdog Millionaire will not disappoint no matter many accolades it will receive.<br />For Jamal, unlike Cody, in White heat the top of the world doesn't blow up. Leaving the theater<br />I found new meaning in the hidden moments of my life and I had a new<br />soundtrack to buy.

My daughters knew it was under the tree and unwrapped it for me.  From the time the menu starts to the end credits, it's on.  We watched it as if it were the first time we had seen it.   The color, the images, the sound, all truly amazing.  To see the two bands together as I said in an earlier review of this project is a music lesson no classroom could touch.  I'm not sure it was the 7.1 surround system or my excitment to watch this, but I was hearing sounds that I had not noticed before.   There are a lot more reviews to go, so I will simply end with, if you are looking for a Blu-Ray that will test your system and keep you moving all at the same time, this is the disc you want in your player.  If you think you are a fan of either of these bands, then this disc will erase all doubts.  Enjoy, stop reviewing and just buy it.   You will not be disappointed.  Bobby D Elkton MD

Not just for the acting, not just for the directing, but for the storytelling, and the emotional journey on which it takes you, the laughter, the feeling of being gripped, and its more surprising moments.<br /><br />In the opening scenes, we have the exposition of the character.  We get to know Walt Kowalski, by how people act around him, and his seemingly hateful attitude towards people.  More is conveyed through a scowl, and a snarl than with words.  When the mischievous grandchildren go through his stuff in the basement, we see the Silver Star he won in Korea.  There are three other important symbols in the movie, the lighter, the gun, and the car.<br /><br />We see a hero with a warrior past, a patriot who  fought for a cause greater than himself.  Clearly, his bigotry stems from those experiences.<br /><br />He's not just mean, he's 'get of my lawn' mean. He's Dirty Harry 'Go ahead punk, make my day!,' mean.<br /><br />His dead wife's priest bugs him to hear his confession, at her request. The priest in a way is his wife's conscience.<br /><br />When he snarls down the barrel of his rifle, at the neighborhood punk: 'I could blow your head off, and sleep like a baby,' you get the sense that he means it.<br /><br />So, with all that happens, we see the change in his decision making, from someone reluctant to be involved in his neighbor's affairs, and a story can turn on something as random as looking at an empty beer cooler.<br /><br />For all his faults, Walt has mature masculine character.  Even though he is a difficult father, he has taught his children character.  So, when he sees the boy next door lacks character, and a strong male role model, he takes him under his wing, and teaches him how to be a man.<br /><br />The scenes where the boy practises Walt's high octane ball busting banter, are the funniest in the movie.  Through knowing Walt, he makes decisions he never would have made by himself.  In so doing, Walt finds meaning and purpose, and a chance for redemption, and the  boy becomes a man.<br /><br />The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:<br /><br />1.Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />2.Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.<br /><br />Every rule has an exception.

031606792X|4.0|I want to preface this by noting that I'm 44 so I'm not part of the main target audience for this series.  Also, my comments below include some major spoilers so don't read if you want to be surprised.  My first introduction to the TWILIGHT series was the movie which I saw  last week. I enjoyed the movie so much I picked up the first novel, bought the rest of the  series the next day and didn't do much for the next few days I until I finished the whole  thing.  This is one of the most entertaining stories I've read in ages - and that's despite the fact that throughout my life I've usually avoided stories written in the first person  point of view.  For the TWILIGHT series, first person works well.  The first three books get 5 stars from me - pretty much flawless. With regards to BREAKING DAWN, Book One could  not have been more perfect as far as I'm concerned - culminating in what had to be one of  the funniest moments I've ever read when Edward realizes just what is making Bella sick.   The fade-to-black scenes didn't frustrate me though I did find it amusing that the novel  followed the same pattern we see in a lot of things in our society - the sex can't be  presented too clearly but it's fine to go into detail when it comes to blood and gore  and violence.  Now, Book Two is the reason I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5.  This  whole series is the story of Bella and Edward - most specifically, Bella.  Throughout  books  1-3 we're seeing things through her eyes.  Now in the 4th entry in the series,  when we get to THE most crucial moment in Bella's life - the moment when not only does  she become a vampire but also gives birth to her and Edward's baby, all of a sudden Stephanie starts to write from Jacob's point of view.  For me it was just wrong. I like Jacob.  He's  a great character - but this has always been Bella's story.  I wanted to see what her thoughts  were on the way back from the honeymoon.  I wanted to see the reunion with the Cullens.  I wanted to see what those days were like for her before Jacob entered the picture.  I  wanted to see Bella forming her alliance with Rosalie - talking with Esme - seeing Alice  again.  Instead, the second part starts of being all about the wolves and even later  when Jacob finally goes to the Cullen's house, it's his point of view we're reading.  For the first time in the series I found myself skimming quickly, skipping whole sections  because it was Bella I wanted to read about, not Jacob and his pack friends.  I understand that once the birth begin, it would have been impossible to continue in detail using  Bella's point of view because she was in and out of consciousness.  I think perhaps a chapter  from Jacob's point of view would have ok but an entire part in such a crucial moment in  the series was extremely disconcerting.  Once we got back to Bella, I pretty much loved the book again.  I think Stephanie does an awesome job describing those first few moments for Bella and the days after.  It's great to see her become a vampire while essentially remaining the Bella we and Edward love.  The baby story I thought was a good one.  HORRIBLE name,  Rennesme.  It's a good thing Stephanie decided on a nice nickname.  One thing I did not like about this series and which I agree with others on is the whole imprinting thing for the  wolves.  A clever idea but I think it would have worked just as well if not better if  the imprinting didn't happen at LEAST until the object of the wolf's affection reached  puberty.  It's disconcerting and a bit...troubling...to think of these teenage boys  obsessed with babies.  Stephanie only goes into detail regarding the imprinting from the  wolves' point of view but not from the human side.  These babies are going to be growing  up seeing these boys as big brothers or even father figures and then all of a sudden at some point they're going to want to mate with them???  This could have been done better.  In fact,  it probably would have been more significant and moving if Jacob hadn't immediately imprinted  on Nessie but rather decided he would protect her above all else because she was Bella's  daughter and she was an innocent.  We could then have had a novel where he's been away for  some years - comes back and THEN imprints when he sees Nessie.  With regards to the rest of the story - I absolutely ADORE Alice.  I would have liked to have seen more of her in  this story but using her to set up the \\"save\\" at the end was an understandable choice.  My  favorite part - next to Edward realized he was going to a dad - had to be Bella using her shield to protect her friends and family.  It was so great to see this once clumsy, somewhat insecure human girl come into her own in her new life.  It was the BEST payoff and I so  hope we get to see this on film.  Overall, the book had some flaws but it's a must read for any fan of the series.  Stephanie Meyers is very generous with her fans in allowing and  welcoming fan fiction so different versions of the story in BREAKING DAWN will no doubt  show up on the Internet to please those who had problems with parts of the story.  I for one  HIGHLY RECOMMEND it and look forward to seeing this entire series in the theatres.  I also  hope Stephanie comes back to the story of Bella and Edward and the Cullens someday.  I  think there's a lot of story to tell there yet.  I would love to see future confrontations  with the Volturi.  Would love to see Bella discover more about her abilities.  Would love to see the Romanians again - absolutely hysterical - these two HAVE to be in the movies, hopefully looking all \\"Bela Lugosi\\"!  My thanks to Stephanie for sharing these incredible characters with us.  Unforgettable.
B001CTA1S4|5.0|If you are starting to have doubts about your doubts, does that mean you are becoming more certain?<br /><br />Doubt is without doubt, a surefire frontrunner for Movie of the year.<br /><br />It's rare to have such a great ensemble cast in a single movie.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays Father Flynn, and Meryl Streep, the highly repressed although previously married Sister Aloysius, whose suspicions provide the fuel for this narrative.  You can only only wonder where such a suspicious nature came from.<br /><br />Carl Jung famously said: \\"Perception is projection.\\" So it proves in this movie.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is certain about her opinions, and you know she will pursue this matter like the holier than thou pitbull she is to the bitter end.  As she says: 'I have my certainty.' And there's enough did he or didn't he to keep us guessing throughout.<br /><br />She hones in on this priest after he gives a sermon about doubt. She starts to have doubts about this doubtful character.  She enlists novice nun Sister James played excellently by Amy Adams to keep an eye on him.<br /><br />Sister James is caught in the midldle, veering between doubt and certainty.  Amy Adams is brilliant, as is the mother of the boy played by Viola Davis.  Her brief performance may win her a nomination, but may be too short to win an Oscar.<br /><br />Meryl Streep's performance makes this movie. It's one of her best. It may surprise you to know that she has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress 11 times in a Leading role, and two times in a Supporting role.  She has won only two awards.<br /><br />Can a person be certain that she will win, even if they have not seen every other best actress performance? In the absence of better evidence to the contrary, yes. Although, I do have some doubts.  Hope this was helpful.
031606792X|1.0|I absolutley loved the first three books and this one totally ruined the series.    a. Bella and Edward's relationship turns into sex   b.Bella is obsessed with this flat baby  c.Renesmee...dumb name, it should be Elizabeth after edward's human mother  d. Charlie knows about vampires ect.   e.fairy tale ending much? Twilight is a realistic series emotionaly, but i think at least one small thing shouldn't be perfect?  f. werewolves imprint on those who can best carry on the line, not their enemy's baby  g.the only characters who stay true to themselves are Emmet and Rosalie  I really wish i hadn't read this book. I loved the other three and i guessed that Bella would get all prego, but it sucked, at points in the book i just had to stop and laugh my head off for a few minutes.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|WARNING: No glowing review here-If you don't want to read a review that isn't just gushing over The Dark Knight, then you had better skip this one!    What's my problem you wonder? Here's a brief list for you:  1. Overkill! Hype!  2. Too long! What? Did someone forget to edit this thing?  3. Dark-yeah, it's supposed to be, BUT.. Totally humorless equals \\"Good grief-whens this thing gonna be over?\\"  4. Somethings wrong! The charecters are not engaging! The story is weak, I didn't care about the fate of Harvy Dent or Rachel Dawes-or even that Batman was about to cross 'the line\\" and become-well a bad guy. Sigh...  5. Christain Bales groaning Batman! Hahaha! Someone give the guy a cough drop!    Now my griping is finished! I bet you are happy if you're still reading this thing! I did give it 3 stars-that means I will watch it again. To be fair, here's a brief list of the stuff I liked:  1. Heath Ledger played a nasty more twisted Joker! A far cry from Mr. Nichlosons Joker(not knocks intended!) A new and creepy interpretation of the Joker! One of the few really interesting charecters in the mediocer Dark Knight.  2. Gary Oldman was great as Commisioner Gordon. One of my favorite charecters.  3. Michael Caine!? He played Alfred? Dumb me-yeah!   4. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox!   5. Oh yeah, I forgot. The special effects. No skimping here!    In closing, I was quite dissapointed in The Dark Knight-(duh.)     More fun:   Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  Hellboy II and the Golden Army  Iron Man  The Incredible Hulk  The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emporer  The Journey to the Center of the Earth  Star Wars Episode 1-6!   yeah- I said Ep1! long live Jar Jar Binks-heheehe
B001M5UDGS|1.0|I haven't been able to watch the movie yet. It arrived, surprisingly as a \\"home-burned\\" (purple read surface) DVD disc. The disc also had a scratch on it out of the box, but I don't know if it won't load or play because of the scratch, or the \\"burned\\" nature of the disc. The \\"home-made\\" burned style disc is disappointing. There are places that REPLICATE DVDs in the same method as movies at the store. I have used these services and they cost about $1-2 a disc in quantities over 1000. Replicated (silver, \\"store-type\\") DVDs have the highest compatibility.     Amazon does have the DVD-R note at the bottom of the product description. I received it as a gift, and am requesting a replacement through Amazon. Amazon made it easy to print a return mailing label.    I look forward to seeing the movie.

031606792X|5.0|I LOVED all of the books about the Cullen clan but this one was my favorite.  I LOVE the way the writer takes you on a journey in the lives of humans, vampires and werewolves.  Her descriptive writing is the best I have ever read.  I started this book on Christmas eve and finished it this morning; I couldn't put it down.  ALL the books in the  series are AWESOME!  I just wish I had the imagination to write something like this!  I have my son and daughter-in-law reading the series now.  I don't understand how anyone could rate any of these books badly.  GREAT books!
0307454894|4.0|I picked up this book from the buzz I had been hearing in regards to the film adaptation.  The book follows the story of Michael Berg's life at the start of a summer affair with a woman, Hanna, who helped Berg when he fell ill one day.  One day Hanna disappears and Michael is left dumbfounded until, years later, as a law student, he sees that she is on trial, accused of Nazi war crimes.  While trying to wrap his fingers around his conflicted emotions and memories of Hanna, a secret regarding Hanna is revealed which may have served behind Hanna's actions and behavior.  The book also ties in the generation of Germans, post WW2, and the idea of guilt being transferred down from a generation that was taught to look the other way to another that didn't really know how to feel in regards to it all.  Does one constantly acknowledge the atrocities and atone for them, or does one try to move on relying on the mantra that the dead are dead?<br />I found the writing to be sparse and cold, but it only added into the characterization and I found it was easier to get wrapped up in the story that way. I felt that Schlink's writing is good in that he wants one to not feel sympathy for Hanna, but I felt that as Hanna's secret was being pulled apart, layer by layer, one can't help but wonder if Hanna did what she did because she truly felt she never had a better choice.  (This also ties into the idea of ordinary Germans who were willing to participate in Nazi atrocities under the excuse of creating a better nation/providing for a family/etc. etc.)<br />The book was an easy and quick read, and while I a bit put off by the fact that Hanna technically committed statutory rape with Michael, it was compelling enough for me to brush it aside.  In conclusion, I do recommend The Reader for anyone looking for a good read that deals with the nature of guilt, love, and the debate over whether what's in the past truly does remain there.

B000E1155E|4.0|A few months ago saw the Artcic Monkeys performing in and old Jools Holland show and thought: hey, this is an interesting band! Then I learned they have been around for a couple of years and about all the hype around them. I am not sorry to have missed that because I am aware of the overestimation the English media do on new bands just for the sake of bussiness. But when managed to listen the whole album, what a pleasant surprise! This is not like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Kaiser Chiefs and similar, which are good bands, but not like the AM. If I have to define this cd in one word that would be: FUN. What I liked most is that there is not the pretentiousness that you easily find in bands like Oasis. Artic music is raw, fresh and very rhythmic, makes me to stomp the feet and banging my head when listening every song of this cd, hardly any new band or cd makes me this happy. It is like I have been waiting for this basic, yet smart music for a long time. It is no surprise the monkeys were 20 when they recorded this, you can notice they are unbiased and innocent on the music industry. They are just having fun and at the same time trying to be different, not trying hard to be original. They are not geniuses or virtuosos, but they are a real rock and roll band! The last time I was this enthusiastic with a band was for the White Stripes and just for the innovative \\"Seven nation army\\", the song alone was worth buying the whole album. Well \\"Whatever people say...\\" has twelve \\"seven nation army\\" on it. Fully enjoyable from A to Z.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Like I imagine many others, it's holiday season and we decided to take in a few movies.  I'd give this movie a five if...  I thought the action scenes were better than Dare Devil but they weren't.  In parts they seemed to be honest, extremely slow, but perhaps that is because Batman himself doesn't really have any true super hero powers, just a desire to confront evil head on.    The story line was good, but what made this movie great or parts of it great was Heath Ledger.  Prior to seeing this movie I was thinking that maybe they were considering him for a Academy Award/Oscar because of his unfortunate death.  Having now seen the movie, he certainly deserves it!    He was not only convincing, but stole the show!  Much in the same manner that in Tombstone Val Kilmer who got robbed did as well!  This is definitely a movie that is worth seeing and a fitting movie to be in the Batman legacy and made even more so by the performace Heath Ledger delivered.    Why Dare Devil wasn't considered by many a great movie I think has more to do with the STAR of it and his relations at the time with another Star... And not his performance which I found outstanding and true to any one that actually reads these things called comics.    All the actors in this did a wonderful job and Heath if someone had to go on, left a performance I am sure seals his standing as an incredible actor.    I again, wasn't impressed with the fight scenes.  But over all a great movie!    [[ASIN:0976678705 Your Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak]]

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|*The Other Boleyn Girl* is a beautiful Hollywood production which has nothing to do with true history.   Many important facts are incorrect and in addition to this some of them have never happend in history.     If Justion Chadwick would have stuck to true history this movie could have been terrific.     Contrary to the interessting Tudor-history this movie is a lukewarm experiment.     In my opinion this movie comes in the same league as *Elisabeth* and *Elisabeth: The Golden Age*. The director Shekhar Kapur presents history after his own fashion as well as Justin Chadwick in *The Other Boleyn Girl*.     Because of the mutilated history I cannot recommend this film.     The only things worth seeing are the costumes and the acting ability of the actors.

0316017922|4.0|There are flaws in this book, to be sure.  Still, there's so much good stuff in it that I've found myself recommending it to friends a half-dozen times in the short time since reading it.<br /><br />To those who criticize on grounds of lack of originality, I would say, remember that Gladwell is a journalist, not a researcher.  As a journalist, he tackles the task of reporting and popularizing the original research of others, and he's brilliant at it.  He also makes connections between and among different ideas in a truly thought-provoking way.<br /><br />A lot of recent pop-psychology and pop-economics books seem to draw on the same handful of studies to justify their arguments.  One thing that I found fascinating about Outliers was that all the research he mentioned was stuff I hadn't personally come across before.  If you keep up with these fields more than I do, then fewer of the ideas will be new to you, but I'm guessing 'most anyone will find something they never knew.<br /><br />The central argument is actually a bit subtle and easily misunderstood.  Gladwell observes that very successful individuals had much more opportunity than the population at large, and also worked harder.  The easy mis-characterization is to say that he's taking the top folks down a peg, saying they're not really as talented as everyone believes.  That's not his point at all; what he is saying is, there are other people out there who are also talented, and if they had greater access to opportunity then we'd have that many more great success stories in the world.<br /><br />One difficulty with the argument, pointed out by others, is that it doesn't acknowledge its own limitations.  Gladwell finds that the top software tycoons, corporate lawyers, and concert soloists all got more opportunity for practice than anyone else in their generation, which is in itself a really interesting observation.  Where he overstretches is in saying that the same is true in every field.  I don't know whether it is or not; but I suspect neither Gladwell nor anyone else does either, because the form of the proposition makes it impossible to answer definitively.  No matter.  Knowing that this pattern exists in many diverse fields, we can say it's at least common (if not universal), and that already is a great addition to the public discourse.<br /><br />Two things I wonder about, after reading Outliers.  First, what do we make of the polymaths and \\"Renaissance men\\" of history - da Vinci, Franklin, Newton, Diderot?  There are only so many hours in the day; how could they have gotten more practice than their peers in so many different fields of endeavor?  Second: this book tells us that in order to achieve greatness you have to have opportunity and you have to start young.  As a matter of social policy, and even life advice, that's good.  But for those who don't have ideal opportunity, or who are too old now to start young, it's telling us that we'll never do certain things.  Even if that's true, I'm not sure I want to know.  An awful lot has been accomplished through history by people who didn't know something couldn't be done; they'll now have one more reason to believe what they're trying is impossible, and a few of them may give up.  I hope not.ither Gladwell nor anyone else does either, because the form of the proposition makes it impossible to answer definitively.  No matter.

0375826726|3.0|The third installment of Christopher Paolini's Inheritance series is titled, Brisingr, which means \\"fire.\\" The hero Eragon begins to deepen his understanding of the leadership that is expected of him, and throughout this novel there are leaders who are elected, or ones who prove their worthiness to lead by succeeding in passing tests to that leadership. Paolini continues to do a fine job at creating a fantasy world that capitalizes on prior heroic tales and legends. One would think that he could have wrapped up the series in these new 763 pages, but this remains a transition book, leaving fans with time to kill until the next installment. Despite new revelations and maturation, Eragon, Sephira and the Inheritance series still have a ways to go before they face Galbatorix. Given the pleasure it is to read a fresh heroic novel in a classical style, I'm willing to wait and read on until Paolini has gotten out all that he wants to write.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B000BB1MI2|4.0|Having seen both versions several times I have to say I like both. Yes there are stark differences in the main character Willy Wonka and there were some other minor differences in the characters of the children and their parents. Actually, there are a great many differences between Tim Burton's version and the original Mel Stuart version. Mel Stuart's version was more like a musical, highlighted with several musical interludes presented by Gene Wilder and his portrayal of Willie Wonka and one other musical interlude given by the character Varuca Salt - the \\"I want it now\\" song. Both versions had Oompah-Loompah songs - after all, it wouldn't be the same without the Oompah Loompah's musical mantras touting the social problems of misbehaved, spoiled children.  I did, however, prefer the original Oompah-Loompah performances. The lead up story, basically Charlie's story, for the most part is unaltered with Burton's version deviating slightly to include Charlie's father, a man who works at a toothpaste factory, and his mother is non-working to stay at home and take care of the ramshackle hut of a house and Charlie's grandparents. In the original, we do not know of Charlie's father and his mother works at a laundry, washing clothes. Tim Burton's remake also does not include \\"The Candy Man\\" song or Charlie's theme \\"Cheer up Charlie\\". There is one other song when Charlie's grandfather get's out of bed for the first time in twenty years. It's not in Burton's version either. In contrast, the only \\"musical\\" interlude in Burton's version aside from the Oompah-Loompah songs was a cheesy \\"Willie Wonka\\" mechanical doll performance at the entry to the Wonka Factory.  This performance while starting out innocently enough soon transcends in to a scene more apropos for a \\"Chucky\\" film - hideous and revolting!  Over all I give both versions equal ratings. In the following I discuss in general the differences I noticed and meant the most to me. If you for some odd reason have not seen either movie and wish not to know the details then please read no further. They have certainly been on TV several times.     The parallels:   Augustus Gloop, the gluttonous brat: No differences between the two versions.      Violet Bueregard, the gum chewing brat: In both versions she takes the gum from Wonka and, at the behest of Wonka not to, begins to chew the gum. The 2 movies do deviate at the point only slightly where as Wilder's Wonka does, in a more nonchalant manner, say \\"stop, don't\\",  Depp's Wonka simply bemoans where the process goes wrong. In both versions, Voilet turns violet and becomes very,  very round and plump, like a blueberry, only in Burton's version, more so. The end is the same- to be rushed off to the blueberry squeezing room!    Varuca Salt, the spoiled rotten brat who gets anything she wants:  All through the movie (both versions) she demands her father to buy her this or get her that. The difference here is that in the original she sees giant geese that lay giant golden eggs - for Easter, of course. In Burton's version, and as I understand from the original book, there are squirrels - who test and shell walnuts. Of course, Varuca demands her father to buy her a squirrel, or in the case of the original, a goose.  In either version she attempts to steal her prize and ends up going down the garbage chute to the \\"incinerator\\". Which we find out isn't working that day - whew, thank goodness for that ;).    Mike Teevee, the brat with a television addiction:  The same annoying \\"know it all\\" brat. The difference being that in the original he was addicted to westerns and in Burton's version he is a video-game addict. I liked the way in which both Wonka characters dealt with Mike through the course of the movie. The end for Mike was the same in both versions.     The major differences (aside from the musical score and the characterization of the Oompa- Loompas);    Willy Wonka: The eccentric chocolate mogul. There are stark differences between Mel Stuart's version and Tim Burton's version.    Mel Stuart's Version of Wonka portrayed by Gene Wilder is a light hearted, whimsical and somewhat eccentric man where as Tim Burton's version portrayed by Johnnie Depp is a considerably darker character who has deep emotional evulsions toward parents - linked to an apparently overbearing father who was a dentist, as we are repeatedly shown in no less than 3 \\"flashback\\" scenes.  Depp's Wonka was definitely eccentric. His portrayal, however,  stopped well short of whimsical and was in no way light hearted, but rather more stogy with a slight after taste of stale comedy.     Then finally to Charlie Bucket: The poor and destitute \\"good\\" child. Here, the story isn't quite the same, either.  The differences are many; I'll touch on the most notable.   In the original, there is no father figure. Charlie is closest to his grandfather, who hadn't stepped foot out of bed in 20 years. In Burton's version, Charlie has a father figure who had just been laid-off at the \\"toothpaste\\" factory, his job being replaced by a robot.  In both versions, however, Charlie does go to the chocolate factory with his grandfather.   In the original, Charlie and his grandfather DO get in to mischief by taking a sip of some \\"Fizzy Lifting Soda\\" and end up floating up in to a, for lack of better description, smokestack. They do return to ground unharmed and continue on with their adventure - after all, the story is about Charlie. In the remake, no such detours. Charlie was a perfect child all the way through. In the original, Charlie did not initially win. He had to prove his \\"goodness\\" by returning the \\"Everlasting Gobstopper\\" at the end of the adventure. At which point Wilder's Wonka awarded Charlie the factory; End of movie. In Burton's version, Depp's Wonka, since Charlie is the last remaining child, the factory is awarded to him, BUT, unlike the original, Wonka tells Charlie his family can't come with him. The movie languishes on with Charlie actuallyshowing Depp's Wonka that having a family is a good thing and eventually Charlie wins out, reuniting Depp's Wonka with his father and then obtaining the factory and moving his family in as well.  There is hardly a mention of the \\"Everlasting Gobstopper\\" in Burton's version.  There was a \\"sub plot\\" in the original version that centered around honesty. Wonka's chief competitor was Slugworth Candies. A man posing as Slugworth approaches each child offering him/her cash fortune to get an \\"Everlasting Gobstopper\\". A tempting trial for each child, no doubt. While this sub-plot does make an appearance in the Burton version, it ends up fading away never to be seen again. In Stuart's version, this sub plot would be the deciding point for Charlie, had he not returned the Gobstopper to Wonka, he would not have won the \\"prize\\". This sub plot proves honesty above all else.    Let's not forget the flyover in the glass elevator.  While minor to the movie, it should be noted that in the original we never see the end result of the children who lose out. This would be the end of Stuart's version as Charlie, grandpa, and Wonka fly onward and the credits roll.   In Burton's remake, we get to see each of children as they exit the factory in a cartoonish portrayal of what each child went through.     Augustus covered in dried chocolate - attempting to eat the chocolate from his fingers    Violet, still violet in color is now more flexible, but otherwise unharmed and apparently enjoying her new found flexibility.     Varuca and her father exit covered in trash. Varuca spots the flying glass elevator and quips, obviously not learning her lesson, \\"Daddy, I must have a glass elevator!\\" This time, however, Mr. Salt retorts quite shortly \\"the only thing you're getting is a bath!\\"    Mike Teevee, having been shrunk in the Wonka-vision is now considerably taller and very, very thin; having been stretched in the taffy pulling machine.    Then we see the glass elevator crash through the roof of Charlie's house where Depp's Wonka delivers the prize to Charlie. Telling him he has won the factory, but then dashing his hopes by telling him his family can't come along. No, sadly, this is not the end of the movie as it languishes on. We see later Charlie working a shoe-shine stand and Wonka sitting, pretending to read a news paper, taunting Charlie about his decision and wondering why such a smart child would want his parents around. This continues with Charlie convincing Wonka to find his father, Wilber Wonka DDS. They do, they meet, the Wonka's engage in a rather reserved father/son embrace. We then see Charlie and Willie returning to Charlie's house for dinner - but this time, the house is actually IN the factory. Wonka did give the factory to Charlie AND allowed Charlies entire family move in.     I did prefer Stuart's version of the Oompah-Loompahs. Burton's version seemed like a cloning production in overdrive. All looking exactly the same. Which, in reality it was. In Burton's version, Gordeep (Deep) Roy played ALL of the Oompah Loompahs - with a little help from technology, of course.     All that said, I have not read Dahls original novel. I have read the introduction for the screenplay, however. The Intro scenes of Burton's version do, for the most part, follow the Dahl intro. From the point of the children gathering at the gates of the Wonka Factory and forward, I can't say. Perhaps I will have to obtain a copy of the novel and find out.

0956010903|1.0|I ordered this product on December 8th, as a present for Christmas, and it supposedly shipped on December 9th, with a delivery estimate of Dec. 13th.  the status of the package was \\"in transit\\" until Dec. 23rd, when I finally contacted customer service and told them my problem.  they emailed me back saying that their site doesn't always have up to date availability information.  Even with that, if it wasn't in stock, how would it be \\"in transit,\\" having left PA and on its way to my home?  shouldn't have said that it wasn't available?  And shouldn't I have gotten an email saying that it wasn't going to ship after all?  The worst part; if I hadn't contacted them, it's very possible that I would have never received information on it at all, or the refund that they gave me.  I'm glad to get my money back at least, but I have to say that I was horribly disappointed with my first time dealing with Amazon.  I still have faith though, and hopefully the next order I make actually comes.

B000001OAA|5.0|I lovelovelove this album.  I only recently got into Garbage, but I'm a hardcore fan now.  I bought this album because the song \\"Stroke of Luck\\" caught my attention on a tv show, and I fell in love with all the songs.  Every song on this album is raw, melodic, and intense.  The opener, \\"Supervixen\\" is a tease to the rest of the album.  This song is my absolute favorite, with Shirley telling the world that she will be their religion.  Next up is \\"Queer,\\" which has a video that is to die for.  Coming in third, still sure to please, is \\"Only Happy When It Rains,\\" which I'm sure every person who was at least 10 years old in 1995 has heard.  The rest of the album has standouts like \\"My Lover's Box,\\" \\"Not My Idea,\\" \\"Dog New Tricks,\\" \\"Vow,\\" and \\"Stroke of Luck.\\"  Seriously, pick this up.  You WON'T be disappointed.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell synthesizes a wide variety of information and finds critical connections that challenge tons of everyday assumptions.  It's the best kind of smart writing--simple and clear, so you almost don't notice how clever his observations are.  It's a fun read that will change the way you think about life--can't get better than that!
B001F12J48|1.0|The 3D Polar Express is not 3D at all. My grandkids love the movie and when I saw it was out in 3D I thought awesome and ordered it.  We were all disappointed and when we checked, the reviews all agree with us.  I only wish I had read them first.  I will NOT order again without reading what others think first.  I wasted money for the 3D and we can only watch the regular version.

B001EP8EL2|5.0|If you are a fan of The Criterion Collection movies, you will love their first wave of Blu-Ray titles. Once again, the quality is top notch. I have been purchasing Criterion Collection movies since laserdisk started. They are known for their \\" classic \\" titles, super clean transfers and in depth extras.     This great 70's movie directed by Nicolas Roeg is a cult classic. Filled with surreal images, this title stands the test of time in the Sci-Fi genre. If you like straight forward Sci-Fi movies like Star Wars, this may not be for you. This movie is more along the lines of 2001 A Space Odyssey.     First off, the picture quality is awesome. Super clean transfer with no artifacts or blemishes to speak of. This title has been taken well care of. It is very sharp and clean. The colors are super vivid with great landscape shots. The skintones are spot on without that waxey look. The blacks are nice and deep, the whites are super clean without blooming. Alway's in focus, with nice sharp backgrounds to give great depth. The closeups have very nice detail also. Though this film has that classic 70's look and feel, it looks very fresh. I would give this film a 4 1/2 stars out of 5 for picture quality. You simply cant ask for anything more from Criterion on this title which is over 30 years old. Although the special effects are dated, you will enjoy this movie which is not dominated by CGI.     Next...the audio is presented in 2.0 uncompressed stereo. Though the rear speakers do not get a ton of use. The sound is great. The voices are crisp and clean without any distractions of any kind. The subwoofer does not get much action either. But....this film is not Star Wars. Overall this title does the best it can with the source. Once again, awesome effort. A solid 4 to 4 1/2 stars on audio overall.     This title is presented in the 139 minute version. As it was intended.     Lots of extras on this disk: Audio commentary by Roeg, Bowie and Buck Henry. Interview with screenwriterPaul Mayersberg, video interviews with Rip Torn and Candy Clark, audio interviews, multiple galleries, costume sketches, behind the scenes photos, publicity stills, galleries of posters and lots of movie trailers. Plus a booklet with facts and photos.     Great movie...looking even better on Blu-Ray. This is a must have for the classic Sci-Fi lover. Great screenplay, great actors with very cool music to boot. Enjoy!

B000W91RUG|5.0|Growing up in the 60s I watched nearly every 60s TV show. I pretty much stopped watching sitcoms since All in the Family and Mash ended. Reality TV? Ughh. But early this season I accidentally surfed this show, laughed until my sides hurt, and have been addicted ever since. What a funny, cleverly written, and well acted show. Finally something worth watching on network TV. Please don't phone me on Monday nights at 8:00.     My daughter gave me the first season DVD for Christmas and we have been enjoying it non-stop. It probably helps being a lifelong engineer with a keen appreciation of fine nerd humor. Big Bang Theory raises nerd humor to an art form that can be appreciated by the nerd in all of us.

B0016OMFPW|4.0|I broke up with Roy Hargove. After the first RH Factor cd I left him. I started cheating on him with another funky bunch called Soulive then left altogether for artists unknown. Didn't leave him because of  RH Factor in fact I dug those projects.  I'm not a \\"they should stick to straightahead jazz\\" type, let's just say I got distracted.  To make a long story short, I found my way back home and looked him up and was pleased to get a plate of Ear Food.  Let me tell you, I didn't know what I was missing. Mr. Hargrove and his working band are tight, tight, tight.  If you're a longtime fan/lover or brand new to Roy Hargrove, cop Ear Food.<br /><br />Below is the track listing and my two cents.<br /><br />1. I'm Not So Sure - Swinging, a good leadoff cut, songs that sound/feel like this always remind me of NOLA<br />2. Brown - Smooth a great ensemble cut.<br />3. Strasbourg/St Denis - There's something hopeful sounding about this. The energy is positive. Definitely feeling the bass work on this.<br />4. Starmaker - Nice. In my mind I was coupling this with Maiden Voyage.<br />5. Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked - ballad<br />6. The Stinger<br />7. Rouge - something satisfying about the pauses in this one<br />8. Mr. Clean - sucker for anything with a heavy bass, however Mr Hargrove lets everyone know he Is running this show.  I know this one ILL in a live show.<br />9.  Style - aptly named<br />10. Divine - yes it is<br />11. To Wisdom The Prize - beginning, middle, end, all tight<br />12. Speak Low - this is a whisper in someone's ear<br />13. Bring It On Home To Me - bring it home baby!

0316017922|3.0|As with his previous books, Malcolm Gladwell brings together seemingly disparate issues and ideas to illuminate one undergirding notion. His argument this time out: that wild success has more to do with a person's surroundings growing up -- and the opportunities of time and place -- than any innate differences that may set that person apart from the rest of us.    At times, the points Gladwell makes are obvious. Too often all he's really doing is putting an intellectual spin on common sense. But then he makes bold leaps of logic that have absolutely no grounding. For example, he recounts the early days of the Beatles and how they performed together some 1200 times before ever arriving in the U.S. to launch the British invasion. This comes in a chapter about the \\"10,000 Hour Rule\\" and how practice of that magnitude translates into real \\"oulier\\" mastery of something like playing the violin or piano. He recounts a study showing that those who go on to be elite musicians begin practicing more and more compared to those who become, say, music teachers (10,000 hours vs. 4,000 hours). But then he begins conflating the terms, talking about amateurs and professionals ... and he seems not to realize one can go to any club in any city on any Friday night and see \\"professional\\" musicians you wouldn't label \\"outliers.\\" The term certainly applies to the Beatles, and Gladwell asserts that much of their success is simply that they played a lot. Baloney. How many obscure professional musicians making $100 a night could he have found that have practiced and played for 10,000 hours or even double or triple that number ... and yet aren't anywhere near good enough to get a recording contract, much less record a masterpiece like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? Too many to count. And so his explanation of the Beatles as \\"outliers\\" is laughable. He doesn't begin to understand what made them great. And, for that matter, he doesn't entertain the idea that those musicians willing to put in 10,000 hours of practice may be different from the outset, that they begin to see and understand their own gift and self-select themselves into the group willing to work harder and longer because they know it will pay off (as opposed to those who stop practicing so much because they can see their talents really lie elsewhere).    The problem of self-selection bias, in fact, is something Gladwell never addresses. It undermines the book's thesis at several junctures, as when he describes at length the success of the KIPP Academy. He never puts up alternative explanations and argues why his thesis should carry the day. But as with Gladwell's other books, I found the reading mostly entertaining (even if I argued with him from time to time). You do learn some interesting things. But you also encounter some kneeslappers. (Single dumbest sentence in the book: \\"If Canada had a second hockey league for those children born in the last half of the year, it would today have twice as many adult hockey stars.\\" No, Malcolm, it would simply mean that the makeup of professional rosters would be more varied and better representative of the entire calendar ... and the overall talent level might be marginally higher. It's not as if the number of sports franchises and the size of rosters are determined by the pool of available athletes.)

B000Q6GUW0|2.0|Say what you like about the show, this is a mention of the bad technical quality of the discs.<br /><br />I just finished watching Season 1, Disc 1. I won't be watching the rest. While the \\"English 5.1 Surround\\" soundtrack seems fine, here are some critiques of the rest:<br /><br />* The \\"English Stereo\\" soundtrack is reversed. Everything that should come from the left comes from the right, and vice-versa. So, in episode 4, where his girlfriend comes to visit dressed as Lara Croft, she knocks on the door on the right, and the sound comes from the left. Only on this track, that is. Spanish \\"mono\\" and English 5.1 have the sounds in the correct places. I found that out after swapping cables, thinking that my system was hooked up incorrectly.<br /><br />* The \\"Spanish Mono\\" soundtrack is actually stereo. That's a good thing, - the bad thing is that they didn't have the technical proficiency to identify it correctly as such. I used the Lara Croft example above to verify that.<br /><br />* The disc claims to be an NTSC region 1 disc, but it actually has no region coding, which means it works just fine on my Region 2 Pioneer combi-player.<br /><br />* The 3D graphics in the menu are awful.
0956010903|5.0|It's true. If you are a die-hard fan of the Potter series and had the means to purchase this collector's edition you won't be disappointed in knowing that your 'investment' went to a worthy charitable organization.  You 'do' get some quaint stories and lavish looking packaging (which has been finely detailed by other reviewers). I particularly appreciate the outer box for storing on the library shelf.<br /><br />While you can envision yourself transported back in time by holding the book, the print on the inside will serve as a reminder that it is... while prelimenarily impressive looking, still... a mass-produced (though limited) print copy.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I love it when people review movies like this and complain about them being unrealistic or having plot holes. Movies like this are about suspension of disbelief. They're meant to be fun and over-the-top; they're not supposed to be Citizen Kane. If you're looking for a fun action movie that will wow you with visual effects and stunt-work, and also make you laugh a couple times, this is the movie for you. It's also a great Blu-ray disc for showing off your home theater system.

B0001KZM4I|4.0|I bought This is the Sea many years ago, after I saw the Waterboys open up for U2 at a concert in the DC metro area. At first, I did not care much for the album, but it really grew on me over time. I recently bought the re-issue and glad that I did. This is the Sea is an excellent album which demonstrates the wide music array of talent of the Waterboys. The original album includes great songs such as Bang the Drum, Whole of the Moon (best song on the album), Pan Within, and the classic title song. The bonus CD includes more great songs, and some strong live versions as well.    The re-issue includes detailed notes from Mike Scott in which he describes how the album was recorded (to include the bonus CD material), and the many influences of his music. You can definitely hear the influence of Van Morrison, and celtic music mixed with U2. They almost sound like a much more positive version of Echo and the Bunnymen. If you like Van Morrison, U2, the Alarm, Simple Minds, Big Country, and other UK bands like these from the 80s, then I would try this album. You may find a hidden jewel.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|My only hesitation in ordering this CD set was questioning the quality of the sound.  I have numerus other recordings on CD of Oistrakh and most sound like bad vinyl records.

B000IOM0WY|4.0|The Blu-Ray version of this movie is disappointing, while the movie itself is incredible. The story, acting, etc. are all very good, and keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. However, having just recently picked up the Blu-Ray release, I would advise to stay clear until it is re-released.    At many points in the movie, there is a lot of visible grain, a result of over-sharpening of the picture in the transfer. Furthermore, the audio quality is only lossy Dolby Digital, instead of the DTS promised on the exterior of the box. If you aren't a videophile or audiophile this disk may prove just fine, and an enjoyable Blu-Ray experience. However, if picture and audio quality are extremely important to you, I'd advise you to wait until a re-release.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|this album is a good album but isn't close to their last album for all the right reasons. that album will probably end up being their best ever. every song could/should have been a single except for like maybe one. dark horse has good songs (something in your mouth, never gonna be alone, shakin hands , gotta be somebody , just to get high) but no song is gonna be a mega hit like the last album . good songs yes, great no. actually i think never gonna be alone will be a huge pop hit . dark horse is right on par with all their other albums that aren't named for all the right reasons

B001FB55LM|4.0|Jim Carrey has had his good and bad moments; this is one of his good ones. In \\"Yes Man,\\" Carrey's trademark rubber-faced goofiness matures into humor that is still a bit zany, but in a more developed way than some of his previous comic performances.<br /><br />Carrey plays Carl Allen, a divorced couch potato who prefers to mope around his apartment rather than go out and enjoy life. All this changes when an old friend drags him to a meeting hosted by motivational speaker Terrence Bundley, where Carl makes a fateful pledge to say \\"yes\\" to everything. That's right: EVERYTHING. Wacky adventures and awkward moments ensue, turning Carl's life upside down and leading him into a romance with a spontaneous, free-spirited indie musician named Allison.<br /><br />This isn't a movie with a great deal of substance or intricate plot twists. Carl finds himself in one crazy situation after another, only discovering toward the end that his pledge has a downside greater than having to respond to an ad for a Persian mail order bride or spend a steamy morning with an elderly neighbor. As pure silly entertainment, \\"Yes Man\\" succeeds, with numerous laugh-at-loud moments and a lot of good chuckles in between.

0812548094|5.0|I though Stone of Tears was an amazing sequel to Wizard's First Rule and was more interesting. The plot line and new characters kept me guessing with the interesting background stories and revealed identities or connections.  I also enjoyed how background information not revealed in Wizard's First Rule was brought to light in Stone of Tears for an added punch.  Overall the plot moved quickly with never a dull moment.  The issue I had with the first book, where the content (torture) didn't match the writing style (shallow/not complex), was mostly eliminated in Stone of Tears.  The content was still very adult, with the addition of rape.  However, the writing level upped to be less childish and was more on par with the content than in Wizard's First Rule.
B000001GX8|5.0|Mozart's opera \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" has its basis in the old comedia d'arte and in opera buffa. In Figaro, Mozart combined these comic, playful elements with themes of seriousness, as his music explored human frailty, character, love, and forgiveness.<br /><br />The \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" was Mozart's first operatic collaboration with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte, and it was followed by \\"Don Giovanni\\" and \\"Cosi Fan Tutte\\".  Mozart himself asked Da Ponte to write the libretto for the famous play by Beaumarchais. The play itself had just barely passed the censors, and Da Ponte's libretto softened slightly the attack on aristocratic privilege in the play. The opera was first performed in May, 1784 in Vienna where Mozart conducted it with modest success. Soon therafter, it achieved much greater success in Prague.In his introductory remarks to the libretto, Da Ponte spoke of his and Mozart's efforts to \\"paint faithfully and in full color the divers passions that are aroused\\" by the story.<br /><br />The opera is in four act and set at a castle in Seville, Spain. The action of the work all occurs within \\"one mad day\\" As befitting a comedy, there are many madcap moments, and somewhat stereotypical moments in the opera (people jumping out of windows to avoid a suspicious husband) and the goings-on are difficult to follow at times. But the thrust of the story is clear. The story involves the love and impending marriage of Figaro, a servant of Count Almaviva, to Susanna, a servant of his wife, the Countess. Although the Count has forsworn the medieval droit de seigneur, he still has designs on Susanna. The Countess, meanwhile, has long been dispirited that her husband's ardour and love for her has cooled. Figaro's marriage is threatened by an older woman named Marcellina who has lent him money and who wants herself to marry him. The Count offers Susanna money for her dowry in exchange for the favors he gave up in abolishing the droit de seigneur. Eventually, it develops that Marcellina is Figaro's mother.  Over a long and convoluted plot, the Countess, Figaro, and Susanna find a way to foil the Count's plans. As the opera comes to its close, the Count, seeking to have his way with Susanna, thinks he has found the Countess compromising herself with Figaro and threatens to act without mercy.  When he learns differently, he abrubtly changes course and begs the Countess's forgiveness, which she freely grants.  The opera concludes with a triumphal march and chorus.<br /><br />In a series of solo arias, duets, trios, sextets, and large ensemble numbers, Mozart's music explores love in all its forms. An important character not mentioned above is the adolescent boy Cherubino, who is attracted to every pretty woman he sees and who sings two arias full of  youthful passion early in the opera.  Mozart explores the yearning of the Countess and her determination to win back her straying husband. Susanna's heart and desire for physical intimacy with Figaro are on display from the outset of the work.  The Count is a snarling, arrogant aristocrat, but he comes to beg forgiveness and, perhaps, to mend his ways at the end.  Figaro is hot-headed, and scheming and not a little jealous of Susanna.  The other minor characters, including Marcellina and her husband to be Bartolo, (the father of Figaro in a long ago affair) and the young girl Barbarina, in love with Cherubino and another victim of the Count's advances, also have important moments in the opera. Although it is difficult to point to a few aspects of Mozart's music, the large ensembles at the end of Acts II and IV, the sextet in Act III and the choral ensembles are frequently viewed as the highpoints of Figaro.  Many CDs featuring \\"highlights\\" of the opera focus on the solo arias.<br /><br />This classic recording of \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" dates from 1968 with Karl Bohm conducting the Chorus and Orchestra of the Deutschen Oper Berlin. The cast includes Fischer-Dieskau as the Count, Herman Prey as Figaro, Edith Mathis as Sussana, Gundula Janowitz as the Countess, and Tatiana Troyanos as Cherubino. Bohm conducts in a carefully crafted performance, somewhat more deliberate than other recordings, which emphasizes the serious part of the story. The women in this recording are uniformly excellent. There are listeners who are less than enamored with Fischer-Dieskau's acting as the Count, but I found his performance suited to the role. As is apparent from the many thoughtful reviews of this recording, \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" is difficult to capture in its entirety in a single performance.  But this remains an outstanding performance.  Listeners coming to \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" for the first or the tenth time will not go wrong with it.<br /><br />As happens so often in life, this recording came to me more than I came to it. I have heard Figaro live several times and I own a selection of highlights.  But for years, I did not have a complete version of the opera. Recently, our local public library had somewhow received several copies of this CD from the manufacturer and was selling the surplus copies at a ridiculously low price.($4.00)  I couldn't  pass it up. Thus, it is more or less due to happenstance that I have this version of Figaro.<br /><br />It is unlikely that anyone considering buying this opera will have my stroke of good luck. On the other hand, there is no need for anyone to wait as long as I did in getting to know and love this music in a classic recording. Although it is not the only choice, this CD is a wonderful way to explore Mozart's playful, humanly wise, and transcendent music to \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\".<br /><br />Robin Friedmanssana, Gundula Janowitz as the Countess, and Tatiana Troyanos as Cherubino.

As happens so often in life, this recording came to me more than I came to it. I have heard Figaro live several times and I own a selection of highlights.  But for years, I did not have a complete version of the opera. Recently, our local public library had somewhow received several copies of this CD from the manufacturer and was selling the surplus copies at a ridiculously low price.($4.00)  I couldn't  pass it up. Thus, it is more or less due to happenstance that I have this version of Figaro.    It is unlikely that anyone considering buying this opera will have my stroke of good luck. On the other hand, there is no need for anyone to wait as long as I did in getting to know and love this music in a classic recording. Although it is not the only choice, this CD is a wonderful way to explore Mozart's playful, humanly wise, and transcendent music to \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\".    Robin Friedman
1401307450|3.0|I wasn't a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan in their day - for one thing, I always thought of them as more a tribe of half-naked Hollywood junkies than a viable musical act, and this book seems to back up my opinion.  However, this book isn't really about the RHCP but more about the life and times of recovering addict Anthony Kiedis.  It was recommended to me by several people, one of whom was involved in the LA music scene around the same time and praised the book for its honesty.      On the one hand, I applaud Mr. Kiedis's skills as a writer, as well as his ability to craft a reasonably decent adult life following a pretty dysfunctional childhood with seemingly no animosity towards either of his parents.  And the book is clearly honest about the realities of junkie-dom in a way that \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" was not.  You never get the feeling the author is gilding the lily or exaggerating; he doesn't have to.  As the son of a Hollywood drug dealer turned actor, who had his first sexual experience with his father's teenage girlfriend (with father's own blessing, no less) at age 11, and who went on to have sex with multiple girls, act in films, hang out with Sonny Bono and share a bed (platonically, but erotically) with Cher all before his midteens, and wind up fronting one of the world's biggest rock bands...nobody writing fiction could possibly top that.  Juxtaposed with exciting world tours and girlfriends and groupies galore are the more sordid tales of ripoffs, dope sickness, failed withdrawal attempts and the like, that have peppered every true-life junkie tale since \\"Confessions of an Opium Eater\\".  Somehow, Anthony manages to stay positive through all of his ups and downs, including the death of his friend/ bandmate, rehab, a relapse back into addiction supposedly caused by a dentist's malpractice, and rehab again.  He generally comes off as a good-hearted likeable guy who doesn't seem to have let fame go to his head and realizes that addiction is a spiritualdisease as well as physical.    On the other hand, unless this fellow's emotions are completely dead, I would have expected some recognition that his upbringing wasn't the greatest.  It's awesome that he has a good relationship with his family, and I'm not looking for \\"Mommie Dearest\\" confrontation levels here, but Kiedis seems to completely gloss over the point that a father providing his preteen son with ready access to drugs (and sex) and involving the kid in his own drug trafficking activities is, to put it mildly, NOT a good idea.  Instead, Kiedis just seems bemused by the whole thing, even admiring of Dear Old Dad.  A number of other books in the true-life addicts genre, including Danny Sugerman's \\"Wonderland Avenue\\" and Papa John Phillips' autobiography, are much more direct about coming out and saying that young teens running loose on the Sunset Strip popping pills was a lot of fun, but in the end, bad with a capital B.  Kiedis can't seem to get himself to admit that.      A goodly part of the book also details Kiedis's relationships with a long series of women and his erotic encounters with many more in a curiously detached manner.  It's understandable that he'd have lots of women given that he's a handsome rock star living in Hollywood, and some of his detachment can probably be written off to the toll that addiction and recovery takes on one's emotions.  But reading about a grown man seeing a woman for two minutes at an elevator, deciding on the spot that she could be his future wife (until she gets on the elevator and disappears forever), and then breaking up with his long-suffering committed girlfriend who has, by his own admission, done nothing wrong - he's just not in love with her any more for no good reason - sounds like Anthony's maturity meter got stuck at about age 14 rather than him being \\"honest\\". He seems more drawn to women who fight with him rather than women who are nice to him, yet we never get any real insight into why. By the end of thebook, our hero is middle-aged and still doesn't appear even close to settling down with anyone (plus, since writing the book, he has reportedly fathered a child by another girlfriend and then split from her).  Perhaps the kind of self-realization needed to explain this pattern is still down the road in Anthony's recovery journey, or perhaps it was just too intimate for the book, but it's hard to see Anthony as a fully evolved recovering adult when his closest and healthiest relationship appears to be with his dog.    Overall, this is a reasonably interesting tell-all in the \\"junkie survivor\\" genre and makes Anthony Kiedis seem like the slightly sad sweetie he looked like in the \\"Under the Bridge\\" video.  I wouldn't call it super honest though - go read \\"Wonderland Avenue\\" if you're looking for that.  And if you're looking for a book about the band, that's yet to be written.  I don't think the story of the Chili Peppers could be adequately told by one person given the number of musicians with strong personalities (Flea, John Frusciante, etc.) involved over the years.  It would be great if the band decided to do something along the lines of Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt\\" with each band member chiming in.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The best adaptation of an Austen movie so far. I just read the book (and bought the movie on iTunes and watched it right after I finished it). After seeing the movie I have to say it's been the best adaptation so far in that it stays VERY close to the book and deviates rarely, and even these \\"deviations\\" are barely noticeable. I was really surprised by it and I enjoyed the movie very much. I don't think there's a better Austen-based movie comparison.
B001ESYAJY|1.0|David Arnold has never disappointed in his Bond scores - except that we never quite get the full score on CD, especially the gun barrel and opening music from World Is Not Enough.  This score may not quite compare to Arnold's best, but it IS the best part of Quantum of Solace, a film with no plot, no characters, and none of the cleverness and freshness of Casino Royale. Thank God it was the shortest Bond film for decades. It took Sean Connery four films to look bored playing James Bond - the terrific Daniel Craig seems to have gotten there after just one. Not to be outdone by the movie itself, we have a really wretched Bond tune from Jack White and Alicia Keys. I didn't think I'd live to see anyone out-perform Madonna for worst Bond tune, but this blend of idiotic lyrics and amateur-grade music is right up there - or down there - with the movie itself.  It's ironic that the great Bond tune from Casino Royale, You Know My Name, was left off the CD while this turkey makes it onto the Quantum of Solace CD, though thankfully at the end so it's easy to skip.  All is definitely not right in the creative world of Bond, but lets hope David Arnold sticks around.

R. Martin book (although you probably have a 50% of finding a similar sentence in most any other contemporary fantasy novel). That's because Martin is a genuine writer, a true storyteller who just so happens to love fantasy. If he were to change genres, I have no doubt that he could be heralded as the next John Irving.<br /><br />Now, if you're reading this review, chances are you're a fan of the genre. If you're like me, though, you've had your fill of dime store heroes and villains, quasi-desperate quests to regain a lost sword/ring/crystal/deep fryer, etc, and you want something more--like, say, an author who actually operates under the assumption that his readers are reasonably smart! Well, at long last, an author with imagination AND the ability to craft a coherent sentence has arrived to revitalize this ailing genre.<br /><br />I am heartened by the number of sterling reviews written for THIS book--a true book, in every sense. You've probably read at least a few of these reviews before coming to mine, so I won't waste your time with an additional rehash of plot points (such as Martin's great use of POV). Suffice to say, Martin has a poet's ear for alliteration and rhythm, which gives his prose a smooth, vibrant feel. He also steadfastly avoids the usual deux ex machina tactics so often employed by today's hackneyed fantasy writers, in which a cackling wizard SUDDENLY descends from the clouds on his carpet/chariot/flying frog and SUDDENLY blast the heroes with lightning/fire/tapioca pudding then, while cackling maniacally, SUDDENLY steals the princess and soars off to await the sequel. Nope, none of that.<br /><br />Instead, Martin gives you complex characters riddled with hopes and insecurities, pride and shame, grief and exaltation. This comes at aprice, though. As other reviewers have stated, this is NOT \\"beach reading\\", nor is it for the faint of heart. The villains here actually ACT like villains, meaning they do more than just cackle as they stroke their dark crystal balls (no, don't reread that). If you want a quick read in which you can pretend to be the lone, flawless hero fighting an inexplicably evil force, you best look elsewhere. This is a brutal book, the kind of book that--if you let it--will coax you into investing more than just your time, then shake you to the core.<br /><br />These books are written with what could be called a \\"tender mercilessness\\", a kind of raw wisdom that is both entertaining and enlightening. Take, for example, this quote from the character, Tyrion Lannister, who is a dwarf (no, not the subterranean kind) and often the object of ridicule: \\"Never forget who you are, for surely the world won't. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.\\"<br /><br />Not saying George R. R. Martin is the first author to have one of his characters speak such a sentiment, but you'd be VERY hard-pressed to find a character in any other novel--fantasy or otherwise--who says it more eloquently than that. Eloquence aside, though, we also see a lot of wisdom in Martin's writing. There's wry wit here, too, like this statement from Varys, another complex character: \\"There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.\\"<br /><br />There are many more grand quotes in this book (and the others) but I don't want to spoil anything. I'll wrap this up by adding that, honestly, I'm a very tough audience. I read a lot of contemporary fantasy and poetry and I probably toss aside or loathe 75% of what I read because it's riddled with cliches and/or just plain badly written. Martin's books, on the other hand, kept me reading until dawn more than once.<br /><br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" is also, in my opinion, one of the most emotionally draining (in a good way) and satisfying novels of the series thus far. Again, I won't spoil anything for you; let's just say that the last few chapters of this book contain some of the most jaw-dropping moments yet in the series.<br /><br />Sidenote: I've also listened to some of these books on tape during car rides/business trips. Makes the time fly!
B0012GN260|4.0|This is a great debut solo CD from Bruce.  Alot of Maiden fans were turned off by this CD because it didn't sound like Maiden.  Being that Dickinson was still a member of Maiden at the time and released this in 1990 between Maiden's \\"Seventh Son...\\" and \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" I'm confused why fans thought it was going to sound like Maiden.  What would be the point of recording a solo record if that was the case.  Instead we get a bit of pure hard rock that at times sounds more like AC/DC than Maiden and even Bruce's \\"air raid\\" vocals are toned down to more straight out hard rock than metal.  First five tracks are fantastic most specifically the title track, \\"Born in 58\\" and \\"Gypsy Road\\".  The second half of the CD and bonus tracks aren't quite as good but still better than most of the similar types of hard rock/pop metal coming out in 1990. The cover of \\"All the Young Dudes\\" is also great.  Bottom line, this is a solid CD and allowed Bruce to do some songs that he couldn't do with Maiden.

B001IA46D8|5.0|The term \\"boy band\\" has unfortunately gotten a bad rap in today's fast changing world.  It's an abusive label that has been placed on music groups who all sing but typically don't play instruments.  Because the most popular outfits were young male teens or twentyish guys singing popish, bubblegum, R&B tracks then that's the image people forced on these groups.  Sadly, these groups are often criticized for being flavor of the month acts who just crank out these syrupy songs aimed at teenage girls and are not serious musicians with longevity in the industry.  That may be true for some groups but there are some artists who do take their music seriously and are each talented in their own right and also have the ability to stay on top.      Take That are one those rare bands that started out as a 90's pop sensation in the UK and then disbanded in 1996 only to make a successful comeback 10 years later.  With their new album going #1 in the UK, it's almost like they never left except their music has evolved to a more Beatle-esque meets Coldplay sound.  I guess if you had to put a label on them, it would be \\"Man Band.\\"  The lads from Manchester have found a winning formula that keeps all members involved in the singing and songwriting process.  The downside is that it has divided some loyal fans into 2 camps.  One camp wants the band to keep their old pop formula and have Gary Barlow sing all the songs.  The other camp are the ones embracing the new direction and were probably fans who favored more songs with Mark Owen and Robbie Williams back in the day.  Fans of the former camp will likely be disappointed in how little Barlow is on this album and how many songs Owen gets this time round.  Thus the problem with bands like this.  Everyone has their favorite band member and everyone on in the band is capable of taking the lead.  In my opinion, for the most part TT pulls off the balancing act quite well for the most part.  I personally wouldn't given Mark the amount of songsthey did but the ones he does are memorable and catchy.  What makes this situation more interesting is the giant elephant in the room/studio for Take That.  What happens to them if Robbie Williams decides to rejoin the band?  That's something that might never happen but for now the band is enjoying their success with a solid follow up album.
0553582038|3.0|If you're reading this, you're probably already a huge George R. R. Martin fan (if not, start with \\"A Game of Thrones\\", which is absolutely excellent) and you've heard some of the controversy surrounding this book's release, you're wondering whether to keep going with the series or hold off, etc.<br /><br />First, I give credit where credit is due.  Martin is still a Class-A writer; that hasn't changed.  This is a riveting, emotionally taut book that, although quite a bit different in style from the previous books, still holds the reader's attention.  (Like how I presume to talk for all readers everywhere?)  Further, I think Martin's plan to cut what would have been an uber-huge Book 4 into Book 4 and Book 5 was a gutsy move--guts being something contemporary writers rarely display, especially when dollars and publishing houses get involved.<br /><br />Still, I have to admit that I wasn't completely blown away by this most recent edition to \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".  That's by no means an overall negative review, though.  As I said, the writing here is still very good; I think the story lines and plot actually progress quite well, despite what some critics have said.  I was particularly impressed with how Jaime and Brienne's respective characters developed.  And I suspect that once Book 5 comes out, Martin's logic behind dividing the story will be more clear.<br /><br />In the end, I really only have a couple complaints to this book, one of them being the very un-Martin-like ending.  Don't worry; I won't spoil it if you haven't read the book yet.  I'll just say that it's a towering cliffhanger that might have been forgivable if Martin weren't so patently slow in releasing these books.  To make his EXTREMELY loyal, generally very intelligent and very grateful fans wait years in the real world just to find out what happens a couple seconds later in Westeros strikes me as a dirty trick.  I was also alarmed to hear that Martin was working on other projects, rather thanconcentrating on getting Book 5 out there.<br /><br />Granted, these are REAL books, not slush.  As a writer myself (not that I'm comparing myself to Martin, of course), I understand that writing a good book takes time.  Fans of the fantasy genre in general, though, are probably the most long-suffering readers out there.  We have to contend with hackneyed writers by the dozen, so when a true writer like Martin comes along and hooks us with a series like \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" which requires a true investment on the part of its readers (read my review of \\"A Game of Thrones\\", if you like), we're naturally pretty impatient.  I'm not sure Martin quite appreciates that.<br /><br />All that rambling aside, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" IS a good book, perhaps not as emotionally taut as \\"A Storm of Swords\\", but still well worth buying.
031606792X|1.0|I have to admit that I was disappointed to some degree with the plot line of the first book and then reading that the rest of the books seem to follow the same line and pattern.  I had just finished reading \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and asked for \\"Twighlight\\" for Christmas.  Maybe I shouldn't have read a hardcore vampire book before it, because I became disillusioned that it seems to be a more romantic story than a good old fashioned fang fest.  The story is good, if that is what you are into, but for my taste I think I am going to skip the rest of the series.
0553288105|4.0|Since he was a polymath who could never stop writing in massive quantities, Asimov was surely entitled to some clunkers now and then. This book surely isn't one of his worst, but it's not one of his best either. First of all, it's not a novel and should never have been presented that way, by either Asimov or the publisher. It's actually three interconnected novellas with common motifs and subplots, so anyone who approaches the book as a novel, especially if they've been mislead into doing so, is likely to find faults with the reading experience (see several of the negative reviews here for proof). Also, especially in the second and third novellas, Asimov attempted character-driven and dialogue-intensive drama at a level that was usually beyond his reach. A related problem is that the three novellas are based on fairly strong ideas that could have each been expanded into novel-length form, but in short form here they appear incomplete and undeveloped.<br /><br />But despite these structural weaknesses, what we have here is still classic Asimov, with curveball placement of subplots and fanciful yet believable science. The recurring motif of the three stories, in which an easy energy source mollifies politicians and consumers who then ignore the very real warnings from Cassandra figures, also illustrates Asimov's always uncanny ability to look into the near future. His scientific thought experiments herein are also fascinating and quite thought-provoking in a cosmological sort of way. So this book is a bit below Asimov's average and may not be for everyone, but his fans will still appreciate it. [~doomsdayer520~]
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I liked Batman begins much better then this movie. I thought Dark Night  was way too dark of a movie. I wasn't expecting that from what we have seen with the past Batman movie and comic books. Also all the hype on this movie was way over done. I think Heath Ledger was a great actor but this wasn't his best by far.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|This is a delightful film. The book was written in the 1930's, but its expression of young girls' hopes and dreams is timeless.  The film is true to the book, with a few bizarre exceptions--what on earth was going on with Nana's hair, and where did the romance and all that smoking come from, and why? However, these anomalies are easily overlooked because the rest of the film really captures the look and feel of the book--the way I always pictured it in my mind. I only wish it could have been longer, so that we could have seen more of the story. Much of the casting is perfect--particularly Pauline, Gum, and Winifred. Emma Watson is the perfect Pauline!  I highly recommend this movie for anyone over age 8 or 9, and hope that it sparks a resurgence of interest in all of Noel Streatfeild's \\"Shoes\\" books.  Her stories embodied the concept of \\"girl power\\" long before the phrase was coined.  Another \\"Shoes\\" film would be nice too--maybe someone will make Movie Shoes into a film.  It would appeal to both boys and girls.  One can only hope!
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|But I think comic-book movies should be fun and exciting.  I don't enjoy these action movies lately like the Batman series and Bourne Identity that are completely lacking in humour or whimsy.  Give me the Spiderman and X-Men type stuff any day.    During the second half (of what seemed like a 5 hour movie), I was dozing off...and I don't feel any need to go back and see what I missed.    I didn't like Batman Begins and I don't like this either.  Actually now that I check director Christopher Nolan's resume, I didn't like \\"The Prestige\\" either.  So that makes his last 3 movies I could have walked out of.  \\"Memento\\" was incredibly fantastic though.  I guess that was a one-off.

Also the \\"villain\\" was...nobody.    Good news is Robert Downey Jr. was FANTASTIC as a playboy, pompous businessman, monkeying around with the suit, sitting eating a burger during the \\"change of heart\\" press conference etc.  The tension between him as Bond and Paltrow's MoneyPenny (or whatever the hell her name is) was believable too.    But once it gets building up to the climax...I really stopped caring.  Particularly when the final battle ends of being a blatant, BLATANT rip-off of the final battle in RoboCop 2.  If you didn't see that one, what happens is little RoboCop ends up fighting a much larger Robot with a gatling gun on his right arm...and later ends up on his back, piggy-back style, destroying it.    Sound familiar?    Christ people...would it kill you to write something original?    So I recommend RoboCop 2 (and the orignal of course).  That one's not afraid to splatter blood all over too, instead of G-rating the action for the kiddies.
1416595546|5.0|This novel has everything - story, history (true), plot (several), suspense, love, hate, violence and so many unforgettable characters that only the greatest director could use it to make either a memorable miniseries or the splendid movie it richly deserves (think of David Lean's Doctor Zhivago.) It is a first novel by an eminent historian whose specialty has been Josef Vissarionovich Stalin and his times; and it is a superb first novel.       Written in three sections or parts  - St. Petersburg 1916, Moscow 1939 and then the Caucasus, London and Moscow in 1994 - it covers The Revolution of 1916-17, the Stalin Era and, finally, in that third section it looks back over the shoulder to contrast the taken-for-granted world of Communism of 1939 with that of the world in1994. It is a superb story superimposed on what is at bottom an historical indictment of the absolute but well meaning evil which the Bolsheviks imposed on the Russian people in the name of The Communist Party and everything it represented. Death and dishonor were always present. Nothing was what it seemed.       As Montefiore has one of his characters put it \\"One shouldn't think of those Bolsheviks as modern politicians. They were religious fanatics. Their Marxism was fanatical; their fervor was semi-Islamic; and they saw themselves as members of a secret military-religious order like the medieval Crusaders or the Knights Templar. They were ruthless, amoral and paranoid. They believed that millions would have to die to create their perfect world. Family, love and friendship were nothing compared to the holy grail, People died of gossip in Stalin's court...Secrecy was everything\\" (Page 399 And so it was. Millions did die; and some of them were the people of this book.     Now to the book:     Were I going to put this sweeping book to the screen I would open with a scene in 1994 in which a most attractive young women in a small village in the North Caucasus opens a letter to find that she has been selected from among many other young historians by Academician Boris Beliakov, Director of the Department of Modern Studies at the School of /Humanities in Moscow University to fill a six month job - all expenses paid - researching family history (lost persons) in London and Moscow. She is Katinka (Ekaterina Valentinovna) Kinsky, the lovely daughter of Valentin Kinsky the respected town doctor.     Then I would show her meeting in an exclusive hotel in London with Pasha Getman, a Russian oligarch, from Odessa, and his mother Roza Getman, an attractive widow from Odessa in her late fifties, and where Roza tells Katinka that she was adopted child of the Revolution and wants to find her true family. Pasha says expense is no object; and Katinka goes back to Moscow to see what she can find in the old files     Next scene: Katinka is in Moscow in the stacks of the old records of the Stalin era and she is reading a report of an Okrana Captain of Gendarmes named Peter de Sagan, dated November 1916, and having to do with his meeting with a beautiful young revolutionary in St. Petersburg carrying the name of Comrade Snowfox.  And now the camera does a \\"resolve\\" and it is.....       St Petersburg. Deep winter. 1916. The Neva is frozen. There are breadlines. People are hungry. The war is going badly. The Tsar is at the front, but the Empress in Pitir is engrossed by Rasputin the mad monk and living as she always has, surrounded by dissolute, craven courtiers, one of whom is Baroness Ariadna (Finkel Abramovna) Zeitlin, wife of Baron Samuil Moiseivich Zeitlin, a wealthy banker and industrialist, and mother of school girl Sashenka (Alexandra Sanuilovna) Zeitlin a lovely teenager who is by day a student at the exclusive Smolny Institute but who by night is a loyal revolutionary known to her fellows (including Stalin, Vinoviev and Molotov - Comrade Lenin not yet having arrived at the Finland Station) as Comrade Snowflake.     On the surface St. Petersburg society is as luxurious as always.There are balls, bright lights, great restaurants; but Sashenka and her loyal friends are doing their work. Soon there are shots at night and then the Revolution begins. Sashenka by now is working in the office, typing articles for Comrade Lenin. She has been arrested by Captain de Sagan but released and is now protected by Comrades Hercules Satinov and a young man named Ivan \\"Vanya\\" Politsyn. - Both of whom we will meet later.     Skipping along. Book Two - Moscow 1939. Sashenka is married to Vanya and is a loyal Party worker. She's the editor of what in America would be the Ladies Home Journal. Vanya is in the Directorate of Security (one of it's operatives - forcing confessions?). They have two beautiful children - Volya (Snowy) five and Karlmarx (Carlo) three and a half. They are among the Party elite - a dacha, car with chauffeur, best schools. There's a tea where Sashenka entertains the party elite, including Stalin.      Then Sashenka, who has always been a Party Faithful and faithful to her husband falls head over heels in love with Benjamin (Benya) Goldman, a writer who has a sense of gaiety, a sense of humor which is so completely lacking in the Party Faithful; and there is an affair. However, there is a slight problem. In his capacity with the Commissariat Vanya had suspected the affair and has taped a meeting between Sashenka and Benya. The taping alone world not involve State Security but there's an accidental glitch which brings the matter to the attention of State Security and both Vanya and Sashenko, always loyal Party members are under immediate suispicion with the near certainty of arrest and the horror which always follows. But what will they do with the children? The common policy is that children of \\"enemies of the state\\" are either killed along with their parents or split up and sent to adoption agencies in far parts of the country.      Enter their friend Comrade Hercules Satinov who arranges for the children to be adopted through better means into better homes and saves them. But no one can save Vanya and Sashenka. We know Vanya is shot. Sashenka, however, is brutalized and at the close of book two eventually confesses to being a spy.     (An aside: Monefiore is particularly expert in Stalin's methods and his description of the Lubianka prison and the means used to extort confessions is great reading - if you like that sort of thing - but one can't help wondering why these people confessed as they did.)     Now back to third book: Describing everything with a wealth of detail Montefiore takes us inside the archives of the Stalinist era where Katinka is examining documents in her attempt to find the parents of Roza. What she finds and how she finds it, who she meets from the past - particularly the 93 year old now-Marshall Hercules Satinov - makes this part of the book an exciting story and a literary detective story of the first magnitude and provides a great, surprising and satisfying ending. I won't tell you about it here. You have to read the book.     A great book, great story; and it will be - or should be - a great movie! Read it!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Ignore the critics.  The old adage that \\"Those who CAN, DO; those who CAN'T, CRITICIZE,\\" fits like a glove here.  I seldom go to a movie theatre, but--after seeing the Broadway show--I just HAD to see the film.  The fact that Meryl Streep sings and acts in the film is just like waking up and winning the filmdom lottery!  So, the movie is so fabulous, that I just HAD to have the 2 disc edition DVD.  All those extras!  Yummy!  Chick Flick be d---ed!  My husband, who refused to see the show or go to the movie theatre, enjoyed the heck out of the DVD.  (This is the guy who watches Outlaw Josie Wales every time it's on TV--so often that I almost have the dialogue memorized.  You wouldn't want to fail to enjoy missing that!)   So, do yourself a huge favor.  Get Mamma Mia!

B0013FSL3E|4.0|For me as an adult the movie started out a bit slow. Once Wall-e met Eva then it got more interesting. Wall-e is a robot left on earth to clean up all our trash since humans ruined the earth. They went into space where robots and computers did everything for them. They all got super fat.<br /><br />Eva comes from space to see if life as in a plant has returned yet. There she meets Wall-e and he goes back into space with her. It is sweet how they talk to one another and take care of each other.<br /><br />On a more serious note it does speak volumes about how we as humans do produce too much trash. And if we are not active and let machines do everything for us we continue to get fatter and fatter. It is a funny movie but it does have this moral.

Though the title implies this is for animators, the skills one learns in this text have applications for adding more life in works of fine art, or anywhere else where the human figure is required to show depth and emotion, such as in graphic novels, comics, etc...    Looking forward to reading Mattesi's other book on designing characters with force, which I've ordered and on it's way.

1427085722|5.0|Brian Tracy has synthesized an incredible amount of material into a fairly quick read. Are there things you may have seen before? Likely, but so what? If a good idea is truly a good idea, you can never get it from too many perspectives. There are, however, plenty of tasty bites available that will no doubt be new to you. These books make a great tool to keep in your brief case, with your contact information on the inside...give them to anyone who asks for your card. It's far more memorable, and they'll benefit from Tracy's wisdom regarding time management!
0385736002|4.0|An adventure of two days where the world and all we know about it is turned upside down. A adventure that takes the reader through magical battles as one Goddess faces another, with extraordinary and ancient magic. Within the battle the keys to alchemy, the art of turning base metals to gold is introduced.<br /><br />The Alchemyst, sulfur, is introduced as a character, who never fully tells things as they are but who is actively committed to guard the secret Codex. His wife, mercury, caught in the hands of the enemy and yet often the source of rescue. The twins, salt, represents the human race as they find themselves deep into a foreign world of ancient beings, all in a battle for power and survival. The enemy, Dr Dee, is a man of great knowledge but no conscience, is a foe who will not back down. He is willing to kill a Goddess and work with the most fowl to achieve his personal aims. Only with the help of the ultimate warrior, is the Alchemyst able to stay one step, sometimes less, ahead of Dr Dee's entrapments.<br /><br />In the midsts of all the characters it is the boy, with a loose tongue with his golden aura and his twin sister who is more reserved but confident that stands out as the unlikely hero's that must step up to the game. They represent the duality of alchemy, the sun and the moon, which must be brought together. The future of the human race lies hidden within the human race itself.<br /><br />One's magical power will be awakened and the other's will remain latent, so that when the one and the zero is brought together they will form a perfect ten. Duality is established to give birth to creation. Like with many of promises of alchemy no gold is produced in the end...the journey has only begun.<br /><br />Overall, the book is an easy read and the story line is stripped from complexity. The movement from one scene to another is easy to follow. This is a joyful read that will enthrall the teenager who still have an imagination. References to modern technology, dates the book, but yet makes it more assessable for young readers. The chapters are short and concise and each a story within the story. The book allows for an enchanting escape from the pressures of a modern world into a shadowrealm of fantastical characters.et makes it more assessable for young readers.

Now, for the body language. If body language is something you are interested in, this is one book that needs to be in your library.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|I agree with those who love the original and feel the remaster is not as good but how can you go wrong? This album is amazing!! Each song is great, this is an album you can't be without if you are a fan of metal or Megadeth.  Just dont expect it to arrive on time if you order it or anything else from this site.
B00005QAPK|4.0|Edgar Allan Poe may have been the most European of our 19th century writers and so, you would think, that three masters of European cinema would give him the understanding and visuals he deserves.  Actually, not so.  When filtered through the lenses of Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Fellini, Poe comes out looking more American than ever (which is probably why no one has ever topped Roger Corman in bringing Poe to the screen).  \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" isn't bad.  In fact, it's really very good.  But Poe would probably be a little embarrassed by the end result of this movie.  Sure, Poe was symbolic ... but he wasn't THAT symbolic.  Not Fellini symbolic.  And certainly not as obvious as Vadim and Malle.  But ...    Jane Fonda is absolutely beautiful and alluring as a spoiled princess who falls for her cousin (in fact, Peter Fonda plays this part ... now that's ripe with Poe and Freud and even Dr Westheimer) and then burns down his stables when he refuses her.  One of the horses comes to haunt her and lots of pretty horse-riding ensues.  All nicely photographed, and compelling (my vote for the best piece in the movie).    Alain Delon plays a soldier who is dealing with his double ... a nicer and more justice-driven person than he is.  Every time Delon tries to kill, injure or humiliate, this doppelganger comes in and saves the day.  Delon engages in a nifty sword fight with the double and then confesses to a priest before the final, kinda silly, climax.  Perhaps the most obviously symbol-driven piece in the movie.    Finally, Fellini treats us to something so loosely based on Poe, we just forget that Poe was even a starting point.  We watch Terrence Stamp (who, in his youth, may have been as pretty as Jane Fonda) as he drunkenly deals with all the demons fame and fortune has dealt him.  He takes out his Ferrari for some therapy and some fast driving and headlessness ensue.  This one is certainly the most visually arresting of the three stories and possible the most entertaining.  One can go through this segment and find something new each time.    The three masters of European cinema don't quite get Poe right, and that's a puzzler.  But they combine to treat us to a very unique take on a dark and symbolic American writer.  For real cinematic Poe, go to Corman's \\"Masque of the Red Death.\\"  For an odd treat full of weird beauty and compelling performances, \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" is your ticket to ride.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Someone please tell me why this movie is ranked so high?  I have never seen anything so boring.  There is no dialogue for the first 40 minutes.  My son will usually watch anything animated and he couldn't last through it.  I kept watching thinking it would get better.  It was a complete waste of time.

0393061310|1.0|This poor pampered professor while struggling at his work strolling along a beach in New Guinea is posed the question as to why Eurasian cultures have succeeded with technological developments but others haven't. IN over 300 pages he struggles to present an answer that could be presented in one sentence.     Its their BRAINS - they are wired differently     Its clear there are many physiological differences amongst various races. Eurasians for whatever reason are compelled to invent technology.     The fact of the matter is the laws of physics are not relative. They work the same for everyone - nothing is stopping a non Eurasian from inventing something new based upon the fundamental and consistent laws of physics.     If you buy this professors reasoning then ask yourself this question ...... why did two Europeans invented calculus at the same time ?   OH i see its because they had access to pencils and no one else in the world did     Like most professors he is woefully out of touch with the common person. All he need do is spend an hour in a gear head shop to understand the driving force in the Eurasian mind to tinker with technology. Of course then you cant sell a book - I returned mine immediately and asked for a refund - RUBBISH

B001F7MSFW|5.0|True to the story so far. My family and I really enjoyed this film. We all agreed that it was good to see that it had been carried on from the last one, which made the story line easy to follow, (even though it is not one of those films that is that hard to follow). The action was good for this type of film and it kept you entertained for the duration.
0792838068|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A pair of virtuoso performances and innovative direction help elevate this story from a simple story of boy-meets-girl to something far more profound and affecting; though the \\"interview\\" scenes with Elizabeth Shue don't really work, the meat of the movie is a powerful drama recommended to just about every adult.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|yes im gonna say it. rob zombie can draw, he can sing, compose music and direct movies but he can't do em all at the same time and make em worth while. this album was the first album by rob I ever took directly back tot he music store after listening to it and tryed to return it because it sucked so bad.  there's barely anything on here worth listening to and the songs that ar eokay have pieces to em that seem like he was just going through the motions or should ahve stopped a little earlier than he did. dont ge tme wrong, listenign to sherry moon zombie moan 'oh yeah give it to me baby\\" in a loop is hot but it gets annoying after you hear her say it after tow or three loops.   the only song really that sticks out is let it all bleed out as worth listening to. hoefully this album is not a sign of things to come for mr. zombie and he'll get back to his hellbilly roots we've all known to love.

B001J53X9U|1.0|First I will say this movie is great!  5 Stars!<br /><br />However, I would have to agree with others on the bad points.<br /><br />1. The Batpod is made of very cheap plastic, worth maybe $2.00.<br /><br />2. The DVD's are stored in the plastic shield of the Batpod with no standard DVD case.  The biggest problem with this is that once you open the main box and discover how cheap the plastic really is, it is too late.  You will most likely not be able to return it as the shield that holds the DVD's does not have a seal.  Intentional???<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy the Blu-Ray DVD+Digital Copy for $23.99 without the Batpod!  Do not waste the extra money. Use the extra $24 to buy another DVD and have 2 movies instead of 1 and a cheap piece of plastic.<br /><br />This was a Christmas gift.  I only wish I had read these reviews about the Batpod before putting it on my wish list.  I will see if I can exchange it.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|The Bottom Line:    The Pianist is both a harrowing drama about the Holocaust and its effect on men and a gripping story about survival; on every level this film succeeds and I can hardly recommend it more highly.
B001M6KTLG|1.0|I don't have to go into details, this is just my input, the film was awful, everyone agrees.
B00005JO20|4.0|The Bottom Line:    King Kong is far too long, gains nothing from its two lead males, and has a tendency to drag, but features a stirring conclusion at the top of the Empire State Building and a sweet relationship between Naomi Watts and the CGI ape--it's a mixed bag, but worth seeing.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|I don't notice the transfer things. The movies play as they should , and they look awesome, and they're not scratchy. I don't get what the others are complaining about.    The Matrix- 5/5, best out of the series. Most compelling plot of the 3 (or 4, if you include Animatrix), and is the most interesting.    The Matrix Reloaded- 3/5- The movie had more action than it did substance, and depth stoy-wise. It looked nice, but the movie itself was a little short on story. It's worth watching if you want eye candy. Some things are really unexplained and weird though. About 30 minutes in there's an underground rave in the real world, and it doesn't make sense how they got the instruments, clothes, and technology. The clothes was the weirdest part. They were all modern, and perfect, unshredded. You'd think after thousands of years underground, they'd lose the time to make decent clothing when they're in the middle of a war.    The Matrix Revolutions- 4/5 A pretty good ending to a great story. Makes up for #2, but still not as good as #1    The Animatrix- Not Rating- Some of it was interesting, some of it was dull. The animation is nice I guess. It's nothing amazing like Triplets of Belleville.    Overall this is a great set, because it is cheap, and you get the movies in good standard definition.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie that captures perhaps better than any other the weariness of being an assassin far from home, Munich sometimes feels too long (especially during the scenes in America) and ends inconclusively, but supplies so much good material that I can recommend it without reluctance.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Rush adds another great DVD to their catalog - this one is as good as R30.  Nice crisp picture, terrific sound (I watched in 5.1 with a 'rock concert' setting on my system and it rocked).  Very generous set list and even the so-called 'bootleg' songs are very good (not sure why they called them bootlegs as the quality is quite good).  Excellent camera work and great editing, plus the extras on disc one are nice additions.  Rush is a band made for the DVD medium.  The band shows off their sense of humor in some of the short clips and totally tears it up onstage.  Now that i think of it, having seen them many times, i don't think they ever give less than 100% onstage, and this DVD reflects it.  Excellent value for the money.  Here's hoping maybe they can bring out some vintage shows next......
B001CLG6RC|5.0|I felt an intensity of vibrations inside me listening to this production that I couldn't experiment with the previous 6 main productions or additional remixes. The elements of classical, not only european instruments, but world rythms involved ,sound very different from the 2nd production which has a lot of oriental in it. I really don't like to compare Cretu's masterpieces because I feel his true emotions behind each production are very different from each other. Each one has its own feelings; the ones we let others see, the ones we hide to ourselves and the ones we had inside we didn't recognize before listening to ENIGMA. For me ENIGMA has been a key to unlock many things through this seven faces and in this one I can say I finally understand beyond myself. I dare everyone, from children to adults to enter in the ENIGMA experience through SEVEN LIVES MANY FACES. Is the music that liberates many things that I think somehow where missing before. Seven is perfection. Just enjoy it.
B0010X745K|5.0|This is an awesome & classic film, & despite its obvious departures from the original short story, it's still certainly one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's works to date. In \\"The Mist\\" everything leaves you with a momentum of unease, isolation, & dread that only the formula of Stephen King could muster & director Frank Darabont has done an amazing job in bringing the story to film. Thomas Jane gives one of his best performances as the protagonist who struggles against the ever dwindling possibility of survival & the enormous scope of utter terror & madness. A truly great achievement in the horror film genre because it surpasses the genre.
B000GRUS22|4.0|Definetly A POSTERIORI is a movement of reflecting our lives into our innerself. We clearly see how being the 6th strong musical creation is based in the human placed in this world. Is not only about the rythms or just the musical composition, but the feeling to it. This production remind me that I'm in a journey, that I'm leaving a legacy through my acts, my words and my influence in others. Is an excellent music that will make you, maybe not dance on your feet, but dance inside yourself to your own emotions smiling and crying just the same. Don't miss the opportunity to listen well to this CD.
B00005JO20|5.0|In my opinion Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the best films of 2005. It's about the struggle of people during the depression, adventures on and island full of dangerous creatures, and the relationship of man, and of course woman, with a misunderstood beast. In a nutshell is about human nature during adverse circumstances, and it's one hell of an entertainment and exciting ride from begining to end.     Let me adress the biggest complaint the movie recieves: it's length. Yes I think it could have been shorter, particularly in the first act, but I've seen this movie three time and never have I thought the movie really drags very much in any area. The second act, the longest of the three acts, that takes place on the island, is nothing short of spectacular, with no less than four amazing intense action sequences. I'm certainly glad Jackson went all out in that middle act; it's something for the ages. And the third act, back in New York city, is done very well with a lot of heartfelt emtion and really needed the time it uses to build to the powerful conclusion.     The acting is all round solid, with Naomi Watts, in the famous role Fay Wray played more than seventy years prior, giving the film's strong performance. The rest of the cast, Adrian Brody and Jack black, along with supporting roles of the crew of the ship, are good enough to not slow the momentum of the reall stars. Watt's Ann Darrow may be the only standout human role, but that's fine because she backed up extrodinarily by Kong, Skull Island, and New York city, all which look great and never are uninteresting.     I highly recomend this movie. The single disk edition that I bought has no special features of note. There's also a three disk edition and soon there will be a blu-ray version. Do yourself a favor and pick this up in some form.

0805079831|1.0|This book is neoliberal propaganda which libels and intentionally distorts the great Milton Friedman beyond all recognition.      The real \\"Shock Doctrine\\" is the shocking ability of libs like Klein to fabricate blatant lies to further their agenda of repressive government tyranny.    Indeed, the next crisis will be the complete meltdown of the U.S. economy resulting from the debasement of the dollar by Bush and Obama.  The solution we choose will determine whether we are going down the road to serfdom, or shaking off the final grasping tenacles of socialism.  I would hope we will embrace the precious freedom we inherited from our founding fathers and protected by the sacrifices of our brave service men and women.    However reading reviews by the kool-aid drinkers, I am not optimistic that we have learned the important lessons which Friedman taught.  I fear we will repeat the mistakes of the past and suffer for generations.  This will be most tragic for our children and grandchildren.    Milton Friedman was a kind and benevolent man who is largely responsible for the spread of freedom, democracy and free markets around the world.    It is ironic that Klein claims that Friedman's policies made Chile worse off!  Actually Chile is rated as the eighth most free country in the world economically.  But the reviewer faults Chile with having unequal income distribution -- just like the U.S.  Never mind that the poorest folks who live in freedom are more prosperous than the richest in Marxist \\"utopias\\" like Klein adores.    [...]      For a more comprehensive review see the excellent essay: The Klein Doctrine:  The Rise of Disaster Polemics  by Johan Norberg.  [...]
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This is a hilarious show!  All the characters complement each other, and work well together.  Barney, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is in my opinion the funniest one of all.  All though all of them have their moments, Barney seems to stand out in each episode.  Also, knowing what the public knows about Neil Patrick Harris' sexual preference, and him playing the role of a womanizing bachelor, one would never guess.  He is simply a great actor.  Anyone else liking the Barney character should also check out [[ASIN:143911000X The Bro Code]].
B001H5X7I4|4.0|OK, up front, \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is a Ben Stiller movie--written, directed, produced, and starred in--and that makes the film suspect. But wait! It's a fun, fun movie! I had to watch it twice to list all the allusions to other movies, mostly parodic allusions, sometimes serious, mostly not.<br /><br />Ben Stiller as Tug Steadman is a Rambo imitator, including the number of sequels of the first successful Rambo movie. These films are previewed at the beginning of \\"Tropic Thunder.\\" In fact, these previews ARE the beginning to set up the actors as actors. Jack Black is a gross Eddie Murphy and all the other characters played by Jack Black in his take-off of \\"The Nutty Professor.\\"<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. plays a fabulous method actor who \\"lives\\" his characters, including Neil Armstrong (when they found him in a Hollywood alley trying to re-enter Earth's gravity via a refrigeration box). He has had himself surgically made up to look like the black character he is portraying. But which actor? I narrowed it to Omar Epps or Morgan Freeman, but it could be Tim Meadows from Saturday Night Live, who imitated every black person who ever lived. Whatever, you won't recognize him until he removes his black facial maskings to reveal Mel Gibson or Crocodile Dundee (as Downey is an Australian actor). Being a great method actor allowed him to learn Mandarin Chinese for one of his five Oscars (another nod to parody).<br /><br />In another acknowledgement of great actors Downey also plays Peter Sellers (I'm not sure which role). But the BEST paeon to other actors is Ben Stiller's nod to Marlon Brando in \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" the scene at the end when he has has turned inward as the master of the village. This \\"Brando\\" is the master of an acting role as \\"Simple Jack,\\" another bow to Robin Williams in \\"Jack,\\" both supremely failed movie projects. As Downey's character tells Stiller, \\"Never go full retard,\\" and he lists all the movies that actors played and won awards for characters \\"not full retard.\\"<br /><br />This is awful to say but I think Nick Nolte plays a failed actor (himself), trying to redeem himself through heroic actions. But the best role goes to Tom Cruise as a tough corporate studio head. Ironically, he resembles Bill Gates and the name of the studio is IMAC Corporation. I didn't like this guy until I realized it was Tom Cruise, then the role became a study in actorly talent. His rap dancing is a great way to \\"wrap\\" the movie.<br /><br />Matthew MacConaughey pretty much plays all the characters he ever plays in a parody of himself, but he shows deep concern when TC is going make money off the death of Ben Stiller. How he saves Stiller is not to be missed (or believed!).<br /><br />So, I've presented the redeeming features of this surprisingly entertaining film. There is much more:<br />1. Brandon Jackson--I loved this character, Alpa Chino (say it aloud), who squealed an imitation of Chris Tucker, who co-starred with Jackie Chan.<br />2. Jay Beruchel as the young actor who plays young soldiers who become men during the course of the story<br />3. Brandon Soo Hoo, the boy leader of the drug cartel in the Laos/Cambodia/Myanmar drug capital (Golden Triangle), in acknowledgement of the little boys who are made into vicious, killing soldiers in war-torn areas of the world and an Asian actor, who, of course, is a martial artist!<br />4. Downey's two lines: \\"No Man Left Behind\\" -- a not-so-subtle reminder of \\"No Child Left Behind\\" and its failure, and \\"Be all you can be.\\"<br /><br />At the risk of damaging my reputation as a respectable reviewer, I embrace this movie for what Stiller did with it. The many references put together work really well in celebrating other movies, even if presented in parody. If you are a movie buff, watch \\"Tropic Thunder\\" not for itself, but for what it represents.awful to say but I think Nick Nolte plays a failed actor (himself), trying to redeem himself through heroic actions.

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Like others, I've been looking forward to seeing this supposed masterpiece. But after two and a half hours, you are left empty and confused.  Joker, the main antagonist who is seen working alone (though we're told there is an army of gangsters behind him), appears almost super-human.  He manages to rig a hospital full of explosives all while locked-up in prison, and the moment he escapes there is a seemingly endless set of events which he had already planned for, catching everyone off guard.  Then there is the character of district attorney, who after 20 years of fighting crime turns into a villain overnight (because his girlfriend got killed and half his face was burned).  Are we to believe that a man of such strong moral standing would be corrupt by a 4-minute motivational speech by the Joker (who, let us not forget, killed his beloved girlfriend).    In the end, Batman disappears into the night, being hunted by a pack of K9s, and another moral line is spewed out \\"We must hunt him not because he should be hunted, but because..\\"  I forget the details.  The movie packs superheroes, action and constant barrage of philosophical and moral lines.  There are moments when three separate action scenes are going on at once, in three separate settings.  How can anyone keep track of it all?     I'm usually spot-on with critics, but this movie just annoyed me.
B0001I561E|2.0|We purchased this DVD for our 2.5 year old daughter and are very sorry we did so without first watching ourselves. It's full of sword fights and menacing characters. The film's action is cut really fast so it has a pretty high \\"over-stim\\" factor. We're trying to find our way back to the Jungle with Mowgli! Definitely for older kids.
B0018P4L8I|3.0|If you are considering buying this version, be aware that there are no English subtitles. The film is in Italian and there is Russian voiceover translation. (You hear the Italian and someone translates it into Russian.)
0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman is a stunning fantasy adventure that should be read by all those whom have ever once read a book. Gaiman creates a world underneath modern-day London called Below London (clever) and a cast of characters that are amazingly unique and yet easy to imagine.<br />Richard Mayhew is a director for a security company who, through a good samaritan-act, finds himself in Below London being chased by two venemously evil characters that are in search of one of his companions and will stop at nothing to do what they are hired to do. This small plot description nary does it any justice. Gaiman is one of the few authors where I have to stop reading and actually say out loud \\"How the hell does someone think of this stuff?\\" and yet makes it so easy to visualize. If you ever begrudgingly got yourself through a book in your time, do yourself a favor and read this one. You will be finished before you realized you even started.
0739368044|5.0|I truly enjoyed the continued story and hope that there will be more books like these in the future.  I dont have time to read so I am able to listen to the audiobook while I am traveling back and forth to work.
B00000IMTF|5.0|Of the entire Rainbow oeuvre this album is the creme de la creme. After Rainbow's debut, virtuoso guitarist Ritchie Blackmore retained only vocalist Ronnie James Dio. He then added mercenary drummer Cozy Powell, songwriter/bassist Jimmy Bain, and keyboard wizard Tony Carey. This lineup would create a solid groundbreaking album that still stands as one of the greatest hard rock albums ever. Each member really shines and there is not one rotten apple in the bunch. Granted there are only six songs but it still feels like I've been on a musical journey by the time the last song finishes. It is rare when so many great musical talents come together and make an album (and so only Dio remained for the next studio album). If you like 70s guitar rock with superb vocals and a splash of excellent keyboards then you will grow to love Rising!
B00005YJMX|4.0|my 15 year old likes horror films so I got him this to see \\"where it all started.\\" It's been a big hit and he's gotten interested in seeing what other films the director made. Great value too
B00009XITP|4.0|I'm a fan of Amanda Bynes' work myself, so I enjoyed this movie. It is considered more of a teen movie, but I like it for the simple fact that there is a mixture of drama and comedy. If you dont like \\"girly\\" movies, its probably not the movie for you, but if you like any other movies Amanda Bynes is in, you'll probably enjoy this one also.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|My entire family loved this movie. Both the story and the animation were excellent. The short with the magician and the bunny was so funny, all of us were laughing hysterically. The short was worth the price, let alone the movie and all the bonus features.
031606792X|4.0|While attempting not to spoil the plot, I really was a little let down by this book of the series.   The main climatic action of the novel, (the so called vampire war) was really over drawn out, and didn't end in the way i would have liked it too.  Other people i spoke with felt the same.  I think Stephenie Meyer may have struggled to end this wonderful series, and it's probably not even really over :) but that'so k, because if she came out with another one i would read it too.  All her books have a delightful twist on the normally macabre.  I discovered her books long before the madness of the series
0545128285|1.0|this book is exactly what is says it is; they're are like 4 baby stories with analyzations from \\"dumbeldore\\". it was truly boring and took me like 20 minutes to finish; no joke. read just because its a part of the harry potter series (im rereading all the books all the time and now at the very end of fourth; part where \\"moody\\" reveals himself). but your expectations shouldn't be high.
B000RZGIQ8|2.0|Well, this was really a mixed bag for me. Top Gun was always one of my favorite movies growing up, and I've owned it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. The lack of aspect ratio information on the box is quite telling, as there is no TRUE widescreen - all video is letterboxed, even on a 16:9 HD LCD TV. The \\"widescreen\\" is simply a cropped version of the full screen edition, with black bars. This was very disappointing to me, as I was hoping for some full 1080 F-14 action.    That said, the EXCELLENT DTS 6.1 sound track nearly makes up for the visuals. The encoding seems theater-pure, and is one of the best BD audio tracks I've heard. It's really astonishing how defined the audio is, especially the spatial effects and rumble during the flying sequences. Simply superb audio.     Hopefully, Paramount can dig up a better quality version of the master and give us a TRUE widescreen, full HD experience for Top Gun. Until then, this is the best that we've got.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The characters are great, the music is even better and the story is a lot of fun. This started out as webisodes, but I'm so glad they made it available on DVD.
1569242739|1.0|I borrowed the book from library trying to take a look at the recipes before deciding to buy one.  Looked at most of the recipes, one thing caught my eyes -- most of the recipes call for 3/4 or a full cup of suger!  It's true that they don't contain dairy but such a mount of suger is not healthy even in baking.<br /><br />If you already have a baking recipe book, learn to substitute unwanted ingredients (like using rice milk for milk) and cut down the overdozed ingredients like suger or fat.  For example, my daughter (11 years old) recently pulled out a muffin recipe from the Betty Crocker cook book - substituted any fat or butter with olive oil, milk with rice milk, suger with honey or apple sauce, white flour with oat flour, and cut down the suggested suger (substituted with honey) amount by more than half.  The result was the best muffin we have ever had - delicious and healthy!<br /><br />So I won't buy this book.
B000N6UERK|4.0|I enjoy movies with interesting subject matter, believeable or not. I like to be entertained and this movie did just that. Thought provoking. The blu-ray video was good quality but not the best. Audio is PCM with use of surrounds but most of the sound does seem to come from the front speakers. Good LFE.
B000002A3T|4.0|I have only seen Pink Floyd once and it was their last tour shortly after this CD came out.  Needless to say, I was totally and completely blown away to the point that I traveled around the U.S. to see them four more times - I had never done that before or since.  This is my second CD as the last one disappeared after close friends came to visit.  With each listen, I am at that first Pink Floyd concert.  What a rush!
B001DJLD1M|1.0|FIRST TIME I WATCHED THE FIRST MATRIX FROM THIS SERIES OF DVD'S, THE MOVIE SKIPPED THROUGHOUT 2 SCENES EVEN WHEN I BOUGHT IT NEW.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? ITS LIKE A BOOTLEG GONE BAD...WAS TRYING TO SHOW GIRLFRIEND HOW GOOD THIS TRILOGY IS, BUT KIND OF HARD WHEN 1 SKIPPING SCENE TAKES THREE HOURS.
B001BNFR6W|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of all Will & Grace episodes and I love having it at my fingertips to watch whenever I need to watch those crazy wonderful characters.
B001CTA1S4|5.0|No predictions here about who will win Academy Awards, but this film is certainly the best I have seen in 2008. Meryl Streep is superb as Sister Aloysius, the principal of a Catholic secondary school that faces a coming era of change in 1964 when this drama is set. The night before I saw \\"Doubt\\", I watched the DVD of Mamma Mia! How can one woman be so talented? Meryl Streep is simply amazing. Philip Seymour Hoffman has to be a lock for best actor performance in my book. He matches Streep stride for stride, and convinces us of his role with subtlety of facial expression as well as a huge dynamic range of tone and timbre in the delivery of his lines. Best Supporting Actresses -- and there are two. The larger part belongs to Amy Adams, who is superbly nuanced as Sister James. In her role, we can almost feel the innocence of the 1950s becoming the breakdown of authority in the 60's and 70's. Little foxes running rampant in the vineyard! I was stunned by Adams' acting skill in this very difficult role. However, I cannot give her my supporting actress award by herself. Viola Davis, as the mother of a troubled black student at the school, has only one long scene plus a short later appearance. She handles it with consummate skill. Try conveying a realistic portrayal of a mother who is willing to accept a lesser evil in the life of her son in order to avoid a much greater evil. But both options are evil and destructive. Davis carries the day to perfection.<br /><br />Well, I don't have time to go through all the other badges of excellence this film should receive: best script (one of the best EVER), subtle direction, superb cinematography -- you feel like you are watching a black and white film at times, even though it is in color, because the cinematography matches so well with the somber mood of some scenes.<br /><br />Message. Lots of small messages that add up to one big message. A person has only so much capacity for dealing with and surviving the ravages of doubt. If you spend all of your certainty potential on a minor matter (oh, and you may be wrong about that), you won't have any left to deal with the really big decisions about God and your relationship with Him.<br /><br />Summary: This is a movie for thinking adults. If you are willing to invest a few hours in it, you will reap a huge return. If you are only looking for a light-hearted hour of entertainment, you might want to avoid this one. But, then, you will have missed the Best Picture, the Best Actress, the Best Actor, and the Best Supporting Actresses of 2008.

B000VNMMQG|4.0|This a good representation of the work of William Wilberforce and highlights the little known fact that the slave trade was abolished primarily out of economic considerations rather than men moved by humanitarianism. Moreover the treatment of John Newton is a good addition to the work and gave good support for the history of the famous Christian song. Interestingly Whitney Phipps has also highlighted the musicology and slave link to the melody of this song. A good movie and one that should be of interest to the youth
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I thought I had seen everything that movies had to offer until I saw Mamma Mia! last night on DVD. What's new is seeing Meryl Streep unwind and let it all fly -- singing, dancing, acting -- well, we all knew she could act with the best, but who knew she could sing and dance as well? A great team of supporting actors and actresses, all of whom could sing (Pierce Brosnan excepted). Actually, I enjoyed Brosnan's performances, including his singing. Sometimes a little less polish and a little more realism carries the day. Brosnan could always deliver a line, and he has some key ones in this movie. I thought the big production numbers were very entertaining. I even enjoyed the plot line, although there were some cruel twists at the end. I won't spoil the movie by revealing the twists I didn't like, but they soured me enough to knock off what would otherwise have been a five star rating.<br /><br />As usual, it is best to ignore the professional movie critics. Something happens when you take money for your movie reviews, and it is not good. My wife and I enjoyed this fine, entertaining movie. I thought most of the cinematography was very good to excellent. The scene that a lot of people seem to be complaining about features a pretty amazing performance by Meryl Streep. That was captivating enough to draw my attention away from some supposed faults in the cinematography. Oh well, too busy enjoying the movie to be hypercritical. I think you will be, too.
0553384775|3.0|Like most of the other negative reviews, I found this book to be a waste of money - at first.....however, once I got past the first couple of chapters and his constant references to showing off his long lost wealth (like the $120k hand made carpet, the $12k chinese silk comforter, the $60k crib for the baby....etc, etc), I found that I could not put the book down.   Sure there are plenty of far fetched claims, such as his daughter being able to speak FULL sentences from the age of 12 months, the fact that he is still here to tell the tale after the copious amounts of drugs that he apparently consumed and the fact that he was able to quit drugs without any withdrawal symptoms (or at least none that he makes reference to in the book).   I found the book to be rather humorous in parts and very readable, particularly for a first book.  However, as a CPA Accountant, I may not be the best person to ask about how well written the book is.    I find it amusing that he claims to be this very intelligent man, yet to this day, he still lusts after the foul-mouthed, gold digging duchess and seems to be oblivious to her sexually manipulative ways. I wonder if her new husband is as well off as Jordan used to be and if he has to buy her expensive gifts before they have sex.  I'm surprised that he didn't think to use more than one alias when replying to reviewers' negative comments about his book.  Surely he doesn't think that all amazon reviewers are that stupid.  Anyway, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the wealthy lifestyle he led, up to the time the FBI catch up with him. After that period, I suggest the internet, and even some of the reviewer comments are helpful in this regard.     I do not regret paying for this book or the time I spent reading it.
032147404X|1.0|This book is useful to absolute beginners, to photography. BEWARE!    DO NOT waste your money on this useless book, because all you're doing is lining this x-wedding photographers pockets. There's not a shred of useful info in here that you couldn't learn on your own simply by taking pictures and paying attention. ALL of the suggested f/stops he mentions can be found online. All of the tips he has sold you can be found at Ken Rockwells website, and I highly recommend him. There are so many better books out there, look elsewhere.

B001M6KTLG|1.0|Just as Von daniken tried top pass over Palenque ruler PAKAL as an ancient astronaut in his fantasy \\"non-fiction\\" work Chariot of the gods, so too does lucas and Spielberg in this film try to bring back the idea of ncient astronauts visiting the earth and \\"teaching\\" mankind how to do things. ( as if we couldnt have figured out by ourselves basic agiculture).<br />  Other problems --The temple in Peru looked hardly like any cultures in the Nazca  area. ( Dont film makes want to get their facts right? )  We see copies of the Aztec Calendar stone no fewer than 3 times in the movie --located in a --mish -mosh of a Mayan building.  This film is an insult to a person's intelligent. i HIGHLY think its a waste of time to watch. Waste of CGI technology .  Other problems with the film: The unknown son --silly story. Indy now has a son--ok so what? Bullets hitting everything  and everyone EXCEPT for Indy. Raiders of the Lost Ark, though not a perfect movie is worth seeing again--DO NOT BOTHER with this one. TOTAL waste!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|While I was not alive during this time period, I really felt like I was living the Apollo program.  I have watched documentaries and learned about our space flight history, but this series lets you live that history from different points of view from astronauts and engineers to the media and families.  I was astounded at how well it was done.  It was inspiring and I hope we experience another period in history like it where all of mankind was unified in watching a momentous event.
0811821846|4.0|I bought this as a christmas gift for some friends who are diehard Star Wars fans and they loved it! I considered it more of a novelty item then an item based on the merit of it's recipes. Overall Great gift and good quilty book!

0545128285|1.0|Dear JK Rowling,   If you really wanted people to donate to a charity...could you not have just asked? I would have preferred that to getting all excited about a new \\"book\\" from the wondrous mind that created Harry Potter, waiting for its release, running to the store on the first possible day and buying it...only to later feel disappointed... and, dare I say, swindled. The Tales of Beedle Bard are dull and demeaning to your readers. It screams PLOY to make money before Christmas. The \\"stories\\" are not well thought out and are a few short pages long before lengthy, confusing, and meaningless \\"notes\\" from Dumbledore. I can't stress enough the disappointment I  feel after being so dedicated to the Potter series over a good chunk of my life. Please, next time, save the \\"writing\\" for another day and if you really want to give us a \\"gift\\" for a charity donation, make  it something worth while.  Love,  Harry potter Fans
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Perfect product. Saw this on Discovery, but like the BBC version better. Better narration by David Attenborough.<br />Fast ship, excellent experience. Thanks
B0016OMFPW|5.0|Roy Hargrove's new release is innovative and exciting.  His new pianist, Gerald Clayton (son of bassist John Clayton) is stunning and he really drives the rhythm section.  The song selection is a nice blend of originals and a few standards.  This group truly finds the groove. And Roy's playing is, as always, tasteful and clean. Highly recommended.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|This sequel to 'In the mood for love' showcases brilliant acting and cinematography. The depth of the storyline and characters is incredible, you won't be able to remove your eyes from the screen. This is one of those movies that you have to watch a couple of times to really understand.
0385512058|4.0|Here's how it works. A few years back a friend was on a plane to Tokyo and his seat mate was a upper executive of Air Canada (Asia). They talked through the flight and exchanged contact info. Each year they sent holiday greetings to one another, nothing more.<br /><br />My son had an opportunity to study in Tokyo last year and I put out a general call to everyone I knew if they had any information on living in Japan. This friend immediately came back with the executive he met on the plane. He emailed him and got his permission to give me his email. I emailed and he was a wealth of the type of information I needed.<br /><br />All because I read Keith's book. I learned to ask. I now have a new friend. Never keeping score, I hope I can be such help to someone else some day.
B00003CXUM|5.0|You will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. This movie is breathtakingly beautiful and it showcases some of the best acting on earth. Much of the story is told with body language and facial expression rather than with words, and the direction and cinematography are brilliant. In my opinion, this is one of the all time greatest movies ever filmed.
1400063515|5.0|I urge any professional, executive, or manager to study Taleb.  He reveals the flaws in how we and our peers think.  He has a philosophical approach but has little in commmon with most academic philosophers.  He draws from his experience in financial derivatives trading, but has little in common with most investment bank analysts or economists.  Instead, like Socrates, Taleb shows how supposed \\"experts\\" systematically delude themselves and their audiences into believing they know much more than they really do.
B000L45YEW|4.0|I have every Jackie Chan movie that can be purchased. This is not one of my favorites, but if you're a big fan it's definitely worth having. It is funny, and you get to see Jackie doing many things you haven't seen him do before. Unfortunately he did not do all of his own stunts in this movie due to an injury, but it is neat to see him on screen again with his little brother, Yuen Biao. There are many extra features and footage included with this release.

B0000DDAU9|4.0|I like this band cause it keeps up with its name, especially in this album. Though it's not my favourite, it comes to you like a giant crushing everything between its music and your ears. I prefer the following albums, where Mastodon shows that they learned how to \\"tame\\" their music and know when to unleash the beast and when to keep it calm. This album is somehow to me confusing, but I guess that's what Mastodon is.  This album is a good start if you want to become a Mastodon fan. If you like this, you'll love the others.
B001F290E4|5.0|This is a great CD. It was a Christmas present and the entire family loves it.  We listened to it twice as soon as we opened it, including the younger ones in the house (24 & 27).  His voice is so soulful and the choices of songs were just great.  Everyone in the house wants their own copy now.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|I just went on this site to see if I wasn't the only one who wasted his/her time watching this movie.<br /><br />The dialogue sucks.  I can't see how any fictitious character would enjoy Owen Wilson's company.  Are we supposed to think he's charming???.<br /><br />The story is equivalent in sucking as it is to Owen Wilson's \\"character\\".  Boring, dumb and stupid.  They are on a \\"spiritual journey\\" which includes them getting into some of the most uninteresting, plain, dull mishaps, I have seen in any movie.  Watch it to see for yourself, or just read the other reviews that state how BORING it was.<br /><br />Jason schwartzman, who helped write this, does have 1 clever piece of dialogue near the end of the movie, asking his brother's opinion on a book which he has only written the ending for.  The \\"short story\\" he wrote, is hilarious, and kind of out of place for this movie, because nothing else was at all as funny as that.
1416594884|3.0|Prompted by an NPR discussion of John LeCarre, I purchased this book. It was my first John LeCarre book.  I am familiar with some of his other works, specifically those that were made into films (e.g., Constant Gardener).  I enjoyed the book overall, but was left disappointed at the ending which left me unfulfilled.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This movie is not light and airy and fun.  It is intense, violent and masterfully told.  \\"The Departed\\" is not generally my type of movie, but it was well done.      Here's what I liked:  1)  the plot was not predictable (even for someone who usually foresees the end in the first 5 minutes of a movie), 2) Leonardo di Caprio was amazing, 3) Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson were great, 3) there were several twists.    My only criticism might be that Mark Wahlberg was a little over the top.  Then again, his character was supposed to be.      This is a very violent movie and although I would rate it in my top 10 movies of all time, I will never see it again.  It's just not that kind of movie.
B00004YYDI|5.0|First, a word of warning: Don't mistake the bland US version (\\"The Professional\\") with the genius of the original version (\\"Leon\\").<br /><br />The backstory:<br />Leon (Jean Reno) is a man with a past; having fled to America to avoid prosecution for killing the man who murdered his love (the upper-class father of the girl, who'd rather see his daughter dead than involved with the lower-class likes of Leon), he's taken under the wing by Tony (Danny Aiello), who cultivates the murderous tendencies of the young lad, and turns him into the best of the best: a lone, dedicated \\"cleaner\\"; a professional hit man that knows no equal.<br /><br />Mathilda (Natalie Portman's movie debut) is the daughter of a small-time drug-pusher, who shares her life with her little brother (whom she dearly loves), her dad (who beats her), her stepmother (who doesn't care) and her half-sister (with a mutual dislike that borders to hate). The dysfunctional family life has turned the 12 year old girl old before her age, and what little love and care she has left in her is devoted to her little brother.<br /><br />The story of the movie:<br />D.E.A. detective Stansfield (a deliciously over-the-top performance by Gary Oldman) runs a little side-business - pushing drugs (what else?); when Mathilda's father decides to make a bit of a profit by holding back some of the drugs Stansfield left in his care, he invites the wrath of the detective, who - in a blind rage - murders the entire family. Mathilda, who was sent shopping before Stansfield and his crew arrived, comes back to the apartment while the carnage is still going on, and turns to the only other person in the apartment building she knows: Leon.<br /><br />Reluctantly, he decides to let her into his apartment, and this is the start of an uncomfortable yet moving relationship between Leon, the lone cleaner, and Mathilda, the confused and angry little girl. It's a relationship that changes Leon's life profoundly, shakes him to the core of his very soul (a soul he'd denied having since having killed his one love's killer.)<br /><br />The difference between \\"The Professional\\" and \\"Leon\\" (contains spoilers!):<br />\\"The Professional\\" is the American cut, which misses 24 minutes of the story; the cut was made because it was felt (rightly so, judging by some of the other reviews) that the American audiences would be uncomfortable with the original cut. \\"Leon\\" starts with the hit man on an assignment, sent out to teach a small-time drug dealer a little lesson (missing in \\"The Professional\\"); this scene is essential to introduce us to the man that is Leon the cleaner... an invisible force of violence that knows no mercy, with catlike moves and no qualms.<br /><br />After this, we're introduced to Mathilda and her family, and the crazy (addicted and furious) detective Stansfield; after the carnage, Mathilda flees into the arms of Leon, and a one-sided love story develops, with Mathilda growing incessantly devoted to the cleaner; besides her wish to avenge her little brother's meaningless death, she clings to Leon with a passion she hasn't yet learned how to deal with - and all the time, Leon rejects her attempts to either make him her lover or her teacher.<br /><br />When faced with her final rage and despair (another removed scene in \\"The Professional\\", where she holds a loaded gun to her head to drive the point through), he decides to at least meet her halfway... and because he can't love her the way she loves him, he offers her the next best thing, and the following cut (removed from \\"The Professional\\") shows Leon taking Mathilda out on his \\"jobs\\"... her initial training as a cleaner.<br /><br />People who say that the original version is a perversion with pedophiliac tendencies haven't *seen* the cut... because even though Mathilda keeps pushing Leon towards her mistaken and misguided idea of love, Leon never gives in, except near the very end, where all he does is concede to lie next to her, to sleep, insteadof sleeping in the armchair near his window. This is also the defining moment in Leon's life, where his soul-searching reaches an end... as one finds out in the tense and heartbreaking finale that follows immediately after.<br /><br />All in all, where \\"The Professional\\" is just a decent action movie, \\"Leon\\" actually has a well-defined story to it (and real character development), that has you sitting on the edge of your chair for 2 hours and 16 minutes, with the occasional burst of laughter (Luc Besson always manages to add some - albeit dark - humor into his movies.)

B001EN71DQ|4.0|It may seem unlikely of me to give a positive review of this re-release, but to make it short- I never owned the prequels anyway, so if you don't own the prequels already and you're looking to pick them up in a box set, then this is worth the money. It has the original DVD releases, and all the special features. Nothing has been bastardized, so if you don't already own the prequels, this is worth it.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|As usual, Dido addresses the angst of love in life - from the sultry 'Burnin Love' to the acquiescence of settling down (and settling?) in 'Look No Further'.  Dido has a message across the whole gamut of emotions, and uses her wonderful voice to accentuate the underlying mood.<br />The 'meticulous' is in reference to the very crisp instrumentation that is at times subtle, but always a key element in he songs. The lilt in 'lets do the things we normally do' in the midst of a somber farewell is especially  notable. The sultry instrumentation in Burnin Love makes the simple (but tragic) lyrics come alive. Makes one want to meet the missing person for an intimate slow slow dance of love. Of course, who is coming to who is always an issue.<br />This is her best CD so far, as she continues to mature as a musician while also in the arena of life.
B00011F5DK|5.0|After reading the reviews, this game had a lot to own up to.  The reviews are right -- this game is excellent.  You can sit down and play it right when you get it.  Each game you get better and better and want to play it again.  We opened it today and we have been playing it for HOURS without stopping.  We have a 5 year old, 9 year old and two adults.  It is FUN!  Like the box says \\"minutes to learn, lifetime to master\\".  I highly recommend this game!

0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has written another fantastic story, as he always does.  He is without a doubt the best author of this genre in the country today.  The story has great characters, a great and original storyline, and the perfect ending.  All of his books would get an A+ in my book, but his five best are, in my opinion: 5. A Bend In The Road, 4. True Believer, 3. The Lucky One, 2. The Choice, and 1. Dear John.  Can't wait for Sparks' next book.

B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I purchased the Nikon SB-900 AF Speedlight after reading most of the reviews and comments here at Amazon and others on-line. I was a little concerned about the temperature problem, however the SB-800 is not available anymore. I shot a wedding two days after I received the flash and did not have a great deal of time testing it. I am an amateur photographer and agreed to doing the candits, but leave formal portraits to the studios. After shooting 107 pictures inside a church the flash over heated and it took me by surprise. It happend very quickly. I was aware of the problem and carefully selected batteries. The flash does not like rapid firing and the indicator on the LCD clearly shows the temperature increasing. It took an amazing 10 minutes to cool down. Afterwards I closely monitored the temperature indicator and slowed down taking pictures when the indicator reached the half-way point. That seemed to work for me and I took an additional 500 pictures in three hours. Still suffered overheating it one more time when the bride tossed the bouquet. I used the diffuser most of the time and I am very satisfied with the quality of the photos. I will need to take the time out and learn to run the flash with less energy output, adjusting it in the manual mode. I recommend packing an additional camera and flash when shooting a wedding or other time critical event. I still love the flash!

0316017922|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell is beginning to make a cottage industry out of apparent statistical anomalies, better explained thorough alternative forms of reasoning. As he did in both the \\"Tipping Point,\\" and \\"Blink,\\" Gladwell goes behind the data to probe its deeper meaning, and each time he comes up with counterintuitive explanations for individual success that are usually equal to or superior to the conventional explanations and understandings.<br /><br />In this book, Gladwell demonstrates that it is not always individual aptitude, whether physical or intellectual, that is responsible for exceptional individual success. Often it is more mundane things and sometimes serendipitous advantages such as hockey players (or thoroughbred race horses) being admitted to competition based on their birthdays. Or, as was the case with Bill Gates having exclusive access to one of only a handful of university computers in existence at the time. Gates was able to rack up some 10,000 hours, while even the most brilliant and committed computer geeks had only a fraction of this amount.<br /><br />In each of these (and many other) cases, the author demonstrates that it was not so much individual abilities, that was the deciding factor that led to success, but a slight advantage in access, or slight head starts, being a few months older, etc, that made a huge difference in the successful outcomes.<br /><br />For those of us on the outside looking in, we have long known all along that a great deal  of success depends on chance, circumstances, on even the slightest edge coming out of the starting gate, and who you know, rather than entirely on innate abilities or talent alone  \\"Outliers,\\" among other things confirms that one must come to the front prepared, armed, and then pray for luck.<br /><br />Three stars

1847245560|5.0|This is the follow up to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I suggest you read that one first, though this novel is reasonably self-contained.<br /><br />This book opens with Lisbeth Salander enjoying her newly ripped of wealth lazing in a hotel in Granada.  No one knows where she is (as usual), and  back in Sweden, Millenium magazine are preparing a an expose of the sex slave business in Sweden.  The journalist who is preparing the expose is murdered, along with his partner, and Salander's legal guardian.  Salander, now back in Sweden is the prime suspect, and the police hunt is on.<br /><br />To say things get complicated from this point is an understatement.  There are multiple investigations (Salander's of course, the police and Millenium's), multiple suspects, more murders, red herrings galore, and just general mayhem.  Dark as all this is, it is actually quite funny in places: the police have no idea at all what is going on, despite a well meaning and competant detective in charge.<br /><br />This is all tremendous fun for the reader.  It is as anything remotely boring (and probably realism suffers) has been  left out, yet despite the novels sheer page turning ability, (I read this too fast, I will need to read it again), it still has the power to inform.<br /><br />So buy it, read it once, and then read it again.

033046406X|4.0|After the disappointment I felt with Jeffrey Archer's last book, Cat O'Nine Tales, a collection of short stories, I didn't know what to expect with his new book, A Prisoner of Birth.  Fortunately, whatever his weaknesses may be with short stories, Archer still writes a good novel.    A Prisoner of Birth is a modern re-working of The Count of Monte Cristo, with Danny Cartwright as the falsely accused criminal.  The crime he is charged with is the murder of his best friend, who also happens to be his fiancee's brother.  The real killer is a high-born lawyer, but he is backed up by similarly upper class friends.  Cartwright, an illiterate (though very bright) auto mechanic stands no chance when his word is put up against theirs.    In prison, however, he befriends Nick Moncrieff, an aristocrat who helps educate Danny and also inadvertently offers Danny a chance to escape from prison.  When Danny does so, it's by faking his own death and taking on another identity, one that offers the potential for great wealth as well as new enemies; Danny, however, is more focused on revenge against the four who killed his friend and damaged his life and that of his fiancee, Beth.    The novel is divided into roughly three equal parts, the first with Danny's trial and prison life, the second with the establishment of his new identity, and the third with his revenge (which is far more clever than mere killing, which is good because Danny is not really a violent guy).  Archer shows off his strengths at pacing and plot twists, but it is not a perfect book.  Danny's successes are aided a lot by luck, particularly the luck of meeting the right people.  And when we get the inevitable reunion of Danny and Beth (who thinks Danny is dead), it doesn't have the dramatic effect it should.  Flaws aside, however, this is another good novel from Archer; now if he could only improve his short stories....
0312370849|5.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" is heartbreaking tale of the personal individual costs felt by the victims of the Nazi Holocaust.  The personal story of the titular character, Sarah Starczynski, during that awful time runs parallel with the current story of journalist Julia Jarmond, an expatriate living in the modern era France and assigned to research one of the more shameful incidents during the Vichy French collaboration with Hitler's Germany, the Vel' D'Hiv roundups in 1942.       The character of Sarah was one of the thousands of French Jews who were rounded up and sent to concentration camps where nearly all of them would perish.  Unbeknownst to Julia (until she began her research), Sarah's story has a direct connection to her own life and family.  As Julia uncovers more of the details behind the Vel' D'Hiv roundup and Sarah Starczynski, she finds that she is also uncovering secrets that threaten to hurt her family and undermine everything she thought she knew and understood in her life.        \\"Sarah's Key\\" is one of the more gripping personal novels I have ever read regarding World War II and the Holocaust.  The book is an absolute page-turner in spite of (or because of) the heart-breaking nature of the story.  The meshing of the Julia's modern day tale of research and discovery with Sarah's story of heartbreak and attempt at survival is never jarringly out of place.  Instead, the time period changes bolster the story and each builds on each other.  The font style in the book is even different for the two periods.       I have read that \\"Sarah's Key\\" is comparable to Meryl Streep's Holocaust epic \\"Sophie's Choice\\".  From what I know of that film, I can understand how well the comparison fits.  The Holocaust was one of the most brutal, horrifying and shameful events in human history.  However, as long as there continue to be tales (fictional or not) written such as \\"Sarah's Key\\", the impact of the cost on humanity will never be forgotten.  This is a must read.
0545128285|5.0|For those who've read the Harry Potter series and long for more adventures from that same universe, The Tales of Beedle the Bard may not be fully satisfying, but it does offer a pleasant look at the history behind Harry's world.  This brief read (just over 100 pages, with not much text on each page) is a collection of Wizardly fairy tales, with Beedle as a fiction versional of the Brothers Grimm.  This translation from the ancient runes is done by Hermione Granger.    The five stories are both short and good but not great.  \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\" has the son of a great wizard who learns what happens if you aren't generous.  \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\" deals with a magical fountain that can give great luck to one person a year.  \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" describes the dangers of shutting yourself out from the outside world.    \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump\\" deals with a powerful not very bright king who not only wants to learn magic, but be the only wizard in his kingdom.  And in \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" (a story that has particular relevance to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows), the title siblings match wits with Death himself.    What makes the book so much fun has less to do with the tales than with the commentary by Albus Dumbledore, which provides the \\"history\\" of each story and often a different take on the moral of the story.  None of the five tales will be replacing Cinderella, Snow White or Rapunzel in the canon of fairy tales, but this short book is a worthy read for Potter fans.  If you are not familiar with the Potter series, however, this book will not be nearly as much fun.
B0010HOZS0|5.0|Unappreciated \\"Invasion\\" is how I would describe this film. I was not sure what to expect after reading all these negative reviews, and all I can say is that I'm shocked. This movie was much better than expected. It's been a long time since I've seen \\"Body Snatchers\\", but I still thought \\"Invasion\\" did a pretty good job bowing down to the original. In my opinion, it's a great upgrade for our time. Sure it could have been scarier, but this film was fantastic for what it was, and had a message!    4 1/2 stars. Give it a shot. More people should have checked it out... instead of falling asleep!    ~Cookson
0393327655|5.0|Is religion the bane of all existence or the only thing that gives life purpose?  As a matter of popular opinion, the latter seems the more likely answer, but is that really correct.  Certainly, in recent years--likely because of the rise of the \\"religious right\\" in the U.S.--faith has played a more significant role in politics than it has in previous decades.  It would be expected that there would be a backlash to this resurgence, and Sam Harris's book The End of Faith is on the forefront of this backlash.    The general thesis of The End of Faith is that religion is bad.  Whether God exists or doesn't is almost superfluous to Harris; the more important issue is that all organized faiths cause more harm than good, and in fact, and benefits from religion--such as ethics--can also be derived from other sources.      Although \\"religion\\" in general is attacked by Harris, there are two faiths that are particularly derided.  Islam is the faith that Harris is most critical of, with its declarations of violence (and glorification of martyrdom) that are hard to avoid and that are used to justify all sorts of murder.  Christianity doesn't fare much better, with a history that includes witch hunts and Inquisitions and even today has some dubious practices.  On the other hand, Eastern religions come off more lightly, probably they have a philosophical and spiritual basis that Harris can relate to.    You'd think that so-called fundamentalists would be the villains of Harris's book, and they are, but not the biggest ones.  The worst people are the \\"moderates\\" who don't embrace the worst aspects of their religion but tolerate those extremists.  It's these moderates who also offer hope of a better world, but only if they get off the fence and condemn the fanatics.      Religion, to Harris, is an ancient, irrational concept that should be discarded like other superstitions like alchemy or phrenology.  Harris makes good, well-argued points, but he is no doubt preaching to the choir: the very religious are unlikely to shed their beliefs after reading this book (of course, I doubt Harris would expect them to change; if the religious are irrational, they will not listen to his appeal for reason).  On the other hand, there may be some more moderate people who can learn from his book that tolerance of extremism can be as damaging as the extremism itself.
0385338732|4.0|Twenty-something single Lexi Smart has a life that is going nowhere.  She is not very attractive, her career is nothing great, and her love life is lackluster at best.  Then, running for a cab, she falls and hits her head and wakes up three years later stunningly beautiful, super-successful, and married to a \\"perfect\\" man.  But she has no memory of the past three years!  Lexi is thrilled she is living the life she has always dreamed of...but is it all too good to be true?<br /><br />I like this book with its deft blend of humor and heartache, along with a budding romance and an intriguing office quandary.  'Remember Me?' is in company with some of Kinsella's best works - which for me include 'Can You Keep a Secret?' and the original 'Shopaholic'.  I listened to this one on audio CD and was hooked right from the start.  Reader Rosalyn Landor (who is superb and is a favorite of mine) skillfully handles a wide range and age of characters, has excellent comic timing, and really knows how to work one's emotions.  I often had a lump in my throat while listening to Lexi's travails.<br /><br />It is Kinsella's story itself, though, which earns most of the credit.  Lexi Smart is a winningly imperfect heroine, and I was quickly consumed with how she got where she was and where it all was heading.  I veered between laughter and tears over the absurd circumstances in which Lexi found herself, the off-the-wall behavior of the supporting cast, and the heart-wrenching situations she was forced to endure.  While the romance element is fine, it is Lexi's journey of discovery that really makes this book.  And I like the message as well.
0446615641|4.0|A couple books ago in The Collectors, David Baldacci did what I consider a cardinal sin in a thriller novel:  he left a major storyline unresolved.  While multi-book stories may be fine for science fiction or fantasy (and even that's debatable), they aren't appropriate for thrillers, which by definition, are novels of suspense.  The payoff for the suspense should be in the same book.    In Stone Cold, the follow-up novel to The Collectors, it looks like Baldacci is about to repeat that sin.  As in The Collectors, Stone Cold has two almost separate plots running parallel to each other.  Happily, this time, Baldacci resolves both of the plots.    Stone Cold is actually the third novel featuring the Camel Club, a group of four loners who have a knack for uncovering grand conspiracies.  The leader of the club is Oliver Stone, the long-held alias of ex-government assassin John Carr.  Stone may have faked Carr's death, but the ghosts of the past are coming back to haunt him anyways.    One plot focuses on Harry Finn, a nice family guy who happens to also be a killer.  He is murdering individuals linked to the death of his father, a group that included not only Carr, but retired intelligence chief Carter Gray.  Finn's father was killed as a government-sanctioned hit, supposedly because he was a traitor; Finn doesn't buy it and is out for revenge.  Though Carr/Stone is not on the hit list because he's presumed dead, Gray (who knows what's really going on) intends on changing that, endangering Stone and his friends.    Meanwhile, in the second story (unresolved in The Collectors), the Camel Club is assisting Annabelle Conroy, the beautiful con artist who is on the run from nasty casino owner Jerry Bagger.  She had conned Bagger out of a heap of money, principally out of revenge for Bagger's murder of her mother.  As Bagger closes in, the Camel Club tries to assist, with the aid of their honorary Club member, Secret Service agent Alex Ford.    With a good deal of twists and rapid-pace suspense, Baldacci atones for his past crime.  Nonetheless, I would not recommend reading this book until you've read its predecessors, The Camel Club and The Collectors.  Once you have, this book should be a fine addition to the series.
0515142247|5.0|I was quite pleased with the service from the company that sent me this book.  It was just a few days after I ordered it that I got it in the mail.  Thank you so much.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|Ok lets be honest with ourselves, those of us who watched this movie (and saw the previews before hand) knew what this was probably going to be like when we sat down to watch it. What some people wont do however is confess that they actually liked it. The fact is that Death Race is exactly what it was made to be: entertaining.<br /><br />The plot to this movie is very simple and easy to follow: Man gets framed for murdering his wife, he goes to jail, he gets propositioned from the warden to drive in Death Race to earn his freedom, man finds out warden is behind his framing, lots of driving, explosions, and dying follow suite.<br /><br />To me, this was a decent movie. Yes the story could have been done better, especially since there were some plot holes that begged to be filled. But with a movie like this, we don't really go for the plot. We go for the really cool racing scenes with the post-apocalyptic looking cars and to see guys like the Reaper get splattered against the hood of Tyreese's car. Tyreese by the way, does a so-so job of being the not so bad \\"bad guy\\" of the film, which I don't think is much his fault, it was just the role he was given. Ultimately his bad guy role is overshadowed by the Warden anyway. Jason Stathum does his thing; you know, the strong silent guy who kicks butt every three scenes or so.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a great action flick to sit and watch on a dull night. Its fun, has some humor, and best of all, they aren't shy on the blood and gore. There's enough Twisted Metal type carnage to give to the whole family (not literally of course). Don't sleep on it, its worth at LEAST a rental, if not something to own so you can watch every now and then for kicks.<br /><br />P.S. I really do think this would make a friggin awesome video game. There hasn't been a Twisted Metal styled game in a long time, this could be great if its done right (no RockStar Gaming)
031606792X|4.0|Ok, so I waited and waited and finally on August 2nd 2008 I finally got the book I had been waiting a year for.  Initially I was dissapointed.  Why was Jacob's point of view included in the book?  This was suppose to be Bella's story, her happily ever after of the entire series! Then it started making sense to me when I was reading it.    Book 1 Bella  I loved this part, Bella getting married to Edward the momment we've all been waiting for. It was very descriptive, the perfect wedding. Bella said goodbye to all of her non-vampire friends, and her mom and dad. She was prepared to never see them again to become a vampire and forever be with Edward. Jacob made his apperance and of course made Bella feel guilty, but whatever, the perfect wedding.  Then the honeymoon.  The specific details of Edward and Bella's first time were implied but not in the porn sort of way. Which is good, I was not reading this for porn, but apparently some people were...  Then the prologue makes sense, because Bella gets pregnent, and she actually asks Rosalie for help! Weird I thought, but it was a logical decision. It showed that Rosalie was truly selfish, willing to kill Bella for a baby, and Bella was selfless and stupid willing to die for something killing her, no surprise there.     Book 2 Jacob  This it told from jacobs perspective because Bella is in a lot of pain and her perspective would be very depressing. Also this shows how much pain Jacob was in and how much he loved Bella, and how she had ruined his life basically.  Jacob forces himself to watch Bella die. He is miserable, but still manages to be funny and make fun of Rosalie and Edward at times. Jacob watches Edward the \\"burning man\\" fall apart. Jacob is totally in love with Bella, and Meyer makes that point obvious, but he is unable to let her go.   Then Bella has the baby, Edward CHEWS through the whatever you call it around the baby, which made me want to vomit. EWW Stephenie. Bella almost dies, but Edward injects her withhis own venom and she lives. Kind of romantic in a sick twisted sort of way.  Jacob imprints on the baby \\"Nessie\\", one loose end tied up. The love triangle is done with, which may be a little bit of a stretch for the story, but whatever, it's a good way to fix the love triangle mess.    Book 3 Bella (again)  Bella becomes a vampire, goes through the excruciating pain. I personally was waiting for her to become a crazy newborn, but she didn't she skipped right past that phase magically. She has a shield power.  Then there's this whole drama with the Voturi, and them thinking the Cullen's created an immortal infant. Alice bails on the Cullens. Then Volturi come, the Cullens know they're going to die. Bella is prepared to have Jacob take \\"Nessie\\" away to save her. Alice comes back, saves the day, everyone lives, and Bella and Edward live happily ever after.      So, yeah, Bella gets everything she wanted. That was the point of this book, her overcoming everything and finally getting the life she chose. It may have been a little too perfect the way everything worked out, but this is fiction, almost like a fairytale ending. Personally I think thinkn it was the perfect way to end the series.    It is worth it to read this book!!!
0440419514|5.0|It is a great story that keeps you wondering: \\"what else could happen?\\" It is both a good fantasy and an interesting hard-core critic to the fanaticism that is sometimes part of many religions. The mixture between both fantasy (or rather, fantastic elements) with science makes it a great story.

B001M5UDGS|1.0|Sorry, but I did not get this.  I am a fan of Firefly and Serenity, but this I do not get.  The music is bad, the story is silly, the singing is comparable to Mamma Mia (and that is not a compliment), and most of the jokes miss the mark.  Nathan Fillion has his moments, great actor that he is, but nothing can save this exercise in wannabe camp.  Watching this made me realize how hard it is to create \\"camp\\".  Rocky Horror Picture Show was not an accident and neither was High School Musical.  Creating camp takes a lot of work.  You may not know you're creating it, but you will know it's hard work.  This on the other hand doesn't look like it took much work.  If it did, sorry.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I gave this CD for Christmas stocking stuffers and as gifts at work and I had NO negative feedback from anyone!  Very few CDs have songs on them that appeal to everyone at some level and this CD has it all.  David Cook is a true artist for his generation.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves good, well written music.
0930289234|5.0|Being a long time comics fan this book was kind of a no-brainer required reading, however, once I began to penetrate the subtext and truly understand what Alan Moore was attempting to do with this deceptively simple story, I was hooked right through to the end- wishing there was more so that the story didn't have to end even after 12 issues!<br /><br />A true and absolute page turner in every sense of that phrase, Watchmen is a seminal work that should be required reading by all capable of doing so, and not just the comics fans who can't escape the long shadow cast by this story on the medium we cherish so much.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|Paul McCartney has produced an experimental-sounding set with each track focused on its musical ideas.  The packaging is unusual with a book with disposable pictures and little information about the recordings.  No songwriter credits are listed; although one assumes that since the copyright is by Paul's MPL Communications that he must be the composer.  The website announces \\"Paul is the Fireman.\\"  Many of the tracks seem like song sketches, but are very interesting.  \\"Sing the Changes\\" is one of my favorite tracks with its driving rock beat and echo chamber vocals, \\"Feel the fire; feel the thunder.\\"  \\"Traveling Light\\" begins with atmospheric keyboards before Paul's esoteric haunting vocals, \\"I swim in the blue sea.  I walk on the sand.  I fly through the blue sky to wherever you land.\\"  \\"Highway\\" rocks with a chorus of thousands of background vocals, \\"Everybody's wondering what's that sound!\\"  \\"Sun Is Shining\\" bubbles like a cheerful morning.  \\"Lifelong Passion\\" has Beatlesque echoes on a track that floats in one ear & out the other, \\"Give me love love love love, Be my lifelong passion.\\"  \\"Is This Love?,\\" \\"Lovers in a Dream\\" & \\"Universal Here, Everlasting Now\\" seem like sonic experiments.  \\"Electric Arguments\\" is a good disc because it puts the emphasis on the music, rather than on clever song ideas.  Paul shines with much of this effort and is always fascinating.  Enjoy!
0060578793|5.0|Well worth the price. If you ever needed it you would be glad you spent the money on it. Anything you could imagine if you were in a survival situation this book has.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Well, what can you say about this monster that already hasn't been said?  Tour de force, mind blowing, jaw dropping, those are some thoughts that come instantly to mind.  This is truly a piece of art that in my opinion is as good as it gets for this band, or for any band, period.    I have read that Jimmy says that this is his favorite album and that to him, \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is his favorite Zeppelin track.  I love \\"Achilles\\", but to me this stand out of this album is \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\".  Man is that one powerful piece of music, that sucker has been getting me out of my head and into a better place for close to twenty years!  Unbelievable, can't say enough about that track.    When I'm asked what my favorite album of all time is, it is an easy decision, and I don't simply say \\"Presence\\", but say side two of \\"Presence\\".  Every track on side two I absolutely love.  I just saw that amazon is offering this as an LP version. Do yourselves a favor if you're reading this, buy it on vinyl.  Get yourself a decent system with a record player (they aren't expensive, garage sales, estate sales, they are all over) and play side two of this album.  It really doesn't get any better than that.  I've got a couple thousand titles now, from all eras and a host of different genres, but I can truly say that this is the one album that I listen to the most on a consistent basis.      Take care all and happy holidays, let's hope that boys reunite and Bonzo, wherever you are you are missed, loved, and thought of often!!!
B0000542D2|5.0|Good quality film and acceptable sound on the first disc.    As for the second disc, the interviews with various tangiential players is for the most part fascinating, above all that with George Martin, although he comes off a bit snobbish.  Among other pieces of knowledge he imparts, he explains the significance of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and its twelve-bar blue structure.  It's a bit surprising how little he thinks of some of the other hits, such as \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You.\\"      Two particularly fascinating bits of trivia for me:  the truant \\"Southerner\\" boy in the Ringo scene turns out later to have been a regular supporting cast member in the \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\" UK TV sitcom, one I've frequently watched.  And it's finally made clear why Paul's grandfather is \\"very clean\\" (it has to to with Wilfrid Brambell's prior role as the father in Britain's predecessor to our \\"Sanford & Son\\":  \\"Steptoe and Son\\").      We also gain insight into the photography and lighting of the film, and most interestingly, into the groundbreaking directing style of Richard Lester.  What is it about HDN that made it so special?  Not worrying too much about the directing, the rehearsing...  just going with the flow.  The very natural and yet unusual camera angles.  Many cinematographic techniques first showcased in this film are still used today.  I found Lester's reasoning behind inserting early in the film surreal frames like the boys inexplicably running alongside the train in order to prepare the viewer later for the dreamlike, surreal quality of the \\"I Should've Known Better\\" sequence fascinating.    Though the bonus features might be considered dry and of marginal interest to some, this edition offers a lot for the buck.  I was happy to replace my old worn-out VHS home-recorded copy with this nice DVD package.
B00003CXI1|5.0|We have all of the Harry Potter DVD's. They are well done and the layout on disc is great. You get extras on the DVD's too. We have all five so far. They always say the movie is never as good as the book... These movies come pretty close! Great stories and awsome special effects!
031606792X|4.0|Perhaps the fact that this book wraps up the series as a whole puts it in forth place for me.  Perhaps it was because I was expecting more.  Or just maybe it's because the book was split into three parts, Jacob taking the spotlight for the middle portion of the book.  I understand why she wrote it that way, and I cannot fault her for ending the book the way she did, (this is, after all, HER creation) but I thought it left something to be desired.  You will either love this book, or you will not.  Read it for the conclusion of the series, but do not forget that, first and foremost, this saga is a Romance.  You will have to read this book for yourself and form your own opinion.    *Spoiler*       For those of you that are hungry to see Bella as a Vampire, keep reading, 'cuz it's in here.
B000UJCALI|5.0|From the cinematography to the cast, this film is by far one of the best I have seen.  The story of John, Wendy and Danny Torrance's experience while takeing care of the \\"Overlook Hotel\\" for for the winter months is masterfully told.  Watching Jack Nicholson portray a man teetering on the edge of sanity and finally crossing over the line while terrorizing his wife Played By Shelly Duval is mesmerizing.  A modern classic of horror.
B000001GGV|5.0|Though sometimes criticized on his interpretations, his touch&eacute;<br />and rock solid tempo's are like those of Vladimir Horowitz to me, realizing their playing an also their Scarlatti sonaten are very different.<br />I happen to like Ivo's sometimes new and non conformistic interpretations and I think they are in one word superb. Not only because they are non conformistic, but also because I think they are very clever and sensitive.<br />This album with, some of the nicest Scarlatti's piano (yes, no fuzz, simply piano!) sonata's is very nice and light to digest I think, even if you're not a classical music fan and sets new standards, despite this album being a little older.

0786852550|4.0|I listened to this audiobook with my 13-year old son.  We both enjoyed it immensely.  After a bit of a slow start, there is a gripping, inventive and sometimes surprising plot that, coupled with excellent writing, made the book a real pleasure.  We are moving right on to book two of the trilogy.    What makes the book different from others of its kind is that instead of good and evil, there is not-very-good, pretty bad, and evil.  The author shares George Orwell's view of the effects of power, and offers selfish motivations for nearly all his characters.  So the book has a cynical realism as part of its fantasy world, which adds to the appeal for adults and young adults.    On its own level, the book leaves many loose ends untied. I suspect, indeed, expect, that it is because this is a trilogy and those will be addressed in the two remaining books.  If not, that would be a real flaw.  This is also a book about boys and men; the women in the book play a small, peripheral role and, unlike the brutally real male characters, are portrayed as absurdly one-dimensional support pieces.  These criticisms notwithstanding, we greatly enjoyed it.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I purchased this set for my sister who only recently discovered Friends. Each day she calls me with a.....do you remember the one where....question. Although my our phone bills are higher, it's worth all the new memories we share! Great buy!!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|What is there left to say that has not already been written in the previous 300 odd posts? Nothing. So I'm just going to say simply, that this is the best period piece and the best BBC miniseries I've ever seen (and I've seen them all). The story is beautiful, the actors are fabulous, there is not really a single misstep in the entire production. But with that said, I do think that parts 3 and 4 of the series are a bit rushed, I think the series would've benefited from 5 parts instead of 4. Especially with part 4, so much was condensed and covered into 45 minutes that it didn't quite match the pace of the first two parts, and because of that felt a bit fragmented.     Anyway, if you're thinking about buying this, than I couldn't recommend it more. Just do it. Everyone that rents it I'm sure ends up purchasing it. And unlike a lot of BBC dramas (and dramas in general), this definitely stands up to repeated viewing. Strangely enough, it even seems to get better with each viewing.
B00006AFF5|5.0|I love this version and recommend it for all families to enjoy for the holiday seasons. Jim Carrey does an excellent job inthis film and makes the cartoon look like childs play. Very funny movie
1600243916|5.0|Outliers was written by Malcolm Gladwell, whose first two books (The Tipping Point and Blink) were both number one on New York Times best sellers lists.  Outliers is even better than his first two books.    The premise of the book is that there are often a lot of factors that affect one's ability to become a superstar in one's area of endeavor, whether it be sports, computers, or practicing law.  While he doesn't discount the importance of individual effort, he provides compelling evidence that such extraneous factors as one's birthdate can make an incredible difference in one's level of success in life.  I realize that his hypothesis may seem absurd at first blush, I think you will subscribe to his point of view after reading the book.
0517214628|5.0|I bought this book back in 1994 when I saw the Winona Ryder film version and loved it.  It was 578 pages but I was never bored.  It's about the March family.  It was first published in 1868.  Their father is off to the war but Mrs. March and her four daughters (Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy) fend for themselves.  It's basically a coming of age book as we follow the four girls into becoming women.  Some of the details may be lost on younger readers (remember--this WAS written in 1868) but I think the episodes dealing with the girls' issues and problems are still relevant.  It is too long but I was truthfully never really bored--and I'm a 46 year old guy!  The characters are realistic and nobody is very good or very bad (except for maybe the annoying Aunt March).  They all have good and bad qualities--just like real life.  This isn't for everybody (I think teenage boys will avoid this like the plague) but it's a well-written and interesting story of four girls becoming women.
0545128285|4.0|Well written, as everything always is that Ms. Rawling does. I also love the idea that the proceeds go to the children's charity she co-founded.   Unfortunately For me it was far too short, though very enjoyable...
B000J0NIIW|5.0|This little sweeper does exactly as advertised!  It's not a major cleaning device - and wasn't intended to be one.  It's a quick and easy picker-upper and it works just great for that.  We have hardwood flooring and a few low mat carpets in the living an dinning rooms - and we use this little baby daily for the simple and quick clean-ups - it's so light and easy to retrieve that it's a pleasure to use.  In a couple minutes, all of the daily crumbs and debris are gone.  For heavy cleaning we bring out the Hoover.  Battery life is actually very impressive compared to other battery cleaning devices (my Dustbuster gives out after about 45 secs - this device has not petered out on me yet even after 15 minutes straight use).  Note: I bought this in 2007, so maybe they fixed the battery problem.    Drawbacks - it gets hung-up on higher pile carpet and will lock-up.  It needs to be emptied frequently.  And, hair and fabrics get tangled in the rotor brushes and need to be cleaned often.    Hint - buy a new one on Ebay for under $20.00 and avoid the infomercial shipping/handling/ and BS that goes along with it.  I got mine new for $18 and a reasonable shipping charge.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|It's funny...Pink is sort of like a human Tootsie Pop. She would like us to believe that she's all tough and bada**, complete with a hard outer candy coating. Yet inside, as she grows older and matures, there's a soft center that reveals the true Pink.<br /> Not as engrossing as 2006's I'M NOT DEAD, but certainly much better than 2003's image-over-content TRY THIS, FUNHOUSE showcases an artist at a crossroads...now nearing 30, it's obvious she wants to branch out and try new things, but a part of her is still reluctant to fully let go of the past. Consequently, she's once again working with most of the same producers as her last few albums, touching upon many of the same tricks and stylings.<br /> The result? Much of FUNHOUSE has a rehashed feel to it, sort of a watered down, reheated version of I'M NOT DEAD. Don't get me wrong...it's a good album. But at this point in her career ~ particularly after the stunning brilliance of I.N.D. ~Pink should be striving for great.<br /> Things start off strong with the wonderful \\"So What\\", a pop/rock gem with attitude to spare. Yeah, she's bad, and, yeah, she's in your face, but it's with a wink and a nudge. This is the sort of song that made Joan Jett a superstar twenty years ago, and Pink pulls it off just as well, if not better. A smart choice for a first single, she now has to find a way to hold onto this style, yet redefine and grow it as her own.<br /> \\"Sober\\" is going to be a tougher sell as a second single. Darker, more somber, Pink peels away the layers here. Amid strong vocals, tight instrumentation and earthy lyrics (\\"I don't want to be the girl that has to fill the silence/The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth\\"), she bares her soul, unafraid to be blunt, sincere and direct. And more power to her!<br /> \\"I Don't Believe You\\" is a gorgeous ballad. It's here that things really take off, that Pink proves she's a SINGER, first and foremost. Cushioned by nothing more than lovely guitar, bass and atmospheric strings (LOVE that cello!), Ms. Moore's vocals swoop and soar, all sweet, sexy and sad. Make no mistake about it...when she puts her mind to it and just does it, Pink is one of the best female vocalists of her generation!<br /> \\"One Foot Wrong\\" has a nice groove to it, but Pink gets a bit lost in the cut. Shades of Alicia here, a little bit of Christina there, some generic rocker chick tossed into the mix around half way thru, this song could be cut by just about anyone. Almost every album has SOME filler on it, and this track is the first entry in that category for FUNHOUSE.<br /> Far better is \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\", a fun slice of pop perfection. Anchored by a lilting pop/rock arrangement, Pink practically bleeds the simple, yet clever, lyrics: \\"How did I become so obnoxious?/What is it with you that makes me act like this?/I've never been this nasty.\\" This is a smash single just waiting to happen, as well as one of Pink's best songs to date. Awesome!<br /> Things take another step (or three) backwards with the bloated \\"Bad Influance.\\" A silly little dance ditty that would have fit perfectly on TRY THIS, Pink comes across as more of a brainless poseur than as a serious artist. You can still have fun without presenting yourself as some sort of vapid musical Paris Hilton wannabe. Without a doubt, FUNHOUSE'S low point.<br /> I also wasn't nuts about the disc's title track, at least not after my first listen or two...it just felt like an old No Doubt outtake, with Pink's vocal dropped in over Gwen Stefani's. But, I gotta say....between Tony Kanal's chugging bassline and Pink's sly, spirited vocal...well, it's grown on me (I'm still not crazy about the Joplinesque bridge, but I LOVE the \\"do, do, do's!\\"). Not great, but a good, solid album cut.<br /> Much like \\"Dear Mr. President\\" off of I'M NOT DEAD, \\"Crystal Ball\\" displays a maturity far and above most of today's young pop stars. With it's gentle folk rock arrangement and earnest lead vocal, Pinks dances over some tender lyrics (\\"I'm learning to be brave in my beautiful mistakes\\", \\"Irony, irony/Is hating love, hating love/For what it does to me/What it's done to me/What it's done/Done\\"). A true gem.<br /> \\"Mean\\" is another winner, but I wish Pink and her cronies had been a little more adventureous with the arrangement. The current straight rock one is O.K., but with more of a country flavored take....well, someone like Carrie Underwood or Miranda Lambert could have a HUGE hit with this song (I particularly love the lines \\"We opened up the wine and we just let it breathe/But we should've drank it down while it was still sweet/It all goes bad eventually\\").<br /> The last quarter of FUNHOUSE is spotty at best. \\"It's All Your Fault\\" is another nice enough song, with a somewhat haunting arrangement, but it's been done (and better) elsewhere on the album, both lyrically and vocally, while \\"Ave Mary A\\" has a nice bit of a J.D. Fortune/INXS edge to it's vocal during the verses, but the chorus is too over the top and run of the mill. Once again, filler that Pink should have moved beyond at this point in her career.<br /> \\"Glitter In The Air\\" is the best of the three. Pink's subdued, yet strong, vocal is backed only by piano and guitar, and the result is magical. It's in these bare-bone, totally honest moments that Pink now seems to be shining the most.<br /> So...does Pink continue to grow by becoming a balladeer? No...I think she can continue to grow and stretch while still rocking out. I just think it would wise for her to A) work with some new (maybe female) producers, say Missy Elliott, Alicia Keys or Sheryl Crow for the new kids, June Millington and Joan Jett for the vets, and B) continue to go with her gut vs. what she thinks people expect from her. Maybe then she can fill in some of the empty rooms of this FUNHOUSE, not to mention any future endeavors. (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).in my beautiful mistakes\\", \\"Irony, irony/Is hating love, hating love/For what it does to me/What it's done to me/What it's done/Done\\").

B000YAA68C|3.0|\\"P.S. I Love You\\" is the story of Holly (Hilary Swank), a young widow whose recently deceased husband, Gerry (Gerard Butler), launches a posthumous plan of helping his beloved wife survive her first year without him. To help Holly deal with her grief, Gerry arranges for a series of special gifts and letters to be delivered to Holly after his death. With the help of her family and a few girlfriends, Holly begin to lift herself out of her depression and embrace the chapters of her life that have yet to come.<br /><br />This is a sweet story that's romantic and incredibly bittersweet. The movie includes many flashbacks that depict the life Holly and Gerry shared together, which are touching and allow the audience to connect with Holly and feel her pain. There are also several beautiful sequences shot in Ireland and a strong group of supporting cast members. Obviously, so much of the film's events are incredibly unrealistic, and I also didn't care at all for Holly's relationship with the oddball David (Harry Connick, Jr.), but fortunately the film resolved that subplot very well toward the end of the film. \\"P.S. I Love You\\" is a decent movie about love, loss, and living life to the fullest, but there are definitely better romantic films out there.
032147404X|1.0|I purchased this book hoping to learn a bit more about the basics of photography. Unfortunately, this book seems to be more about the author making a horrendous attempt at being humorous and general style tips for photography: how to shoot weddings, wait for the rain, don't plan on changing lenses at sports events, tripods are good, etc; as opposed to actually explaining the basics of photography. If I had a better grasp on depth of field, aperture, ISO, exposure and all of the combinations therein, then some of these tips may be useful for the creativity side of things, however I wanted a book to explain the basics that I could work from in a factual credible way, not a book filled with annoying sad attempts at being cute in order to self-validate a mistaken perception of comedic talent while stating what I feel is reasonably obvious when it comes to photographic style.    If you're looking for a book on style and creativity, then this book may hold some basic tips for you, however I would imagine you'd get a lot more in depth views, explanations and details from another book than this one. None of the tips go beyond a paragraph with a half page picture example illustration, and none of the pictures contain any sort of detail as to how they were taken.
B001DDBCUK|1.0|THESE ARE THE ONLY 2 WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE, SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT. I AM A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW AND CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DISORGANIZED THIS PLOT WAS. IT WAS LIKE A BIG POINTLESS RUNAROUND. IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING, NOTHING GAINED, NOTHING LEARNED, NO INSIGHT, NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO PROGRESSION IN THEIR LIVES. THEY ACTUALLY DID THE OPPOSITE AND REGRESSED. I HOPE THE WRITERS OF THIS MOVIE READ THIS AND TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IF THEY ARE TO MAKE A SEQUEL. I FEEL LIKE RETURNING THE DVD FOR WASTING MY TIME AND MONEY.
B001CTA1S4|5.0|The best picture of 2008.  Period.  The writing, acting and directing were all top drawer.  It doesn't get better than this if you're the type of person who goes to see thought-provoking movies.  The title \\"Doubt\\" can mean many things.  On the one hand, it could be the doubt that the head sister had of the priest--whether he was indeed a good man or not.  She had no concrete evidence so that accounted for her doubts.  On the other hand, it could be the doubt of the non-believers of God or Jesus Christ.  When we intellectualize things and need concrete proof to remedy our doubts--like the head sister or the non-believers--then we'll never be true believers of anything.  But if we feel something--that the priest is a good man or that Jesus Christ is our savior--then we cast away all doubts from our soul and are the true believers.  This is why I consider \\"Doubt\\" to be the best film of 2008.  It is one of the few films to answer the question: \\"Why do I believe in God?\\"
0452289963|5.0|This book OPENED my eyes on many levels and challanged my own \\"way of thinking\\".  One must read it with an open mind beyond religious and other beliefs and you will be MOST grateful you did. It really prompts one to LOOK in the mirror, take responsibility for your life, let go of the rest and connect to what is beyond our comprehension and the greater good!!!!
B00004Y6NW|4.0|Wow, 30 years went by quickly, didn't they?  I can still remember popping this 1978 disc into my new CD player around 1980 and checking this group out, recommended by my brother. Boy, he was right - this is a great group and Mark Knopfler, in particular, a great guitar player.   Since then, \\"Markie\\"  (as Clapton calls him) has given me thousands of hours of music entertainment.    This \\"debut album\\" is very, very tame when you compare it to the Dire Straits CDs that followed, but that's one reason I like it so much.  It's laid back, very mellow and always pleasing to hear. It may sound primitive to a younger crowd, but it has a less-commercialzed feel and sound to it.    My CD still sounds good, but after reading reviews here, I wonder if I shouldn't re-invest in the remastered version?
B00005NGZX|5.0|I'll just say off the bat I don't consider myself a hardcore kid at all, but I do enjoy a fair amount of the good music from the genre. I recognize though and consider it shameful the high amount of mediocre and often just plain moronic bands in the genre nowadays. Hatebreed, Terror, and Killswitch Engage are unbelievably cliche by this point, and their mob-mentality tactics give a bad name to the scene. To that I say, thank God for Converge and \\"Jane Doe\\". The band is intelligent yet aggressive, brutal and direct yet subtle and intricate, and could appeal to non-hardcore kids as well. Listening to this album, its easy to see why this changed the lives of many people from my generation. There really wasn't anything that sounded like this before. The guitars cut away like buzz saws and the addition of the theremin works much better than it should. Unlike many other hardcore bands, the drum work manages to make its presence felt and isn't simply window dressing. The bass isn't immediately noticeable, yet carries the rest of the band. As for the vocals, Jakob Bannon is an acquired taste, but his fury and passion is undeniable. Ultimately, he makes the band. Even when the lyrics are unintelligible (which they often are), the emotion comes through fully. This is definitely the most perfectly conceived album of the modern hardcore era. From the grinding opening of \\"Concubine\\" to the cumulation title track, a single note isn't wasted. What Black Flag's \\"Damaged\\" was to the 80s and Fugazi's \\"Repeater\\" was to the 90s, this is to the 00s.

B000957O82|5.0|I just took the time to watch this film instead of wholesaleing it to a buyer. I've always liked Will Smith but the low ball price for this film was $1.28 and I make more selling it like that instead of individually at that price. Let me say this about that and this movie. Buy - Buy it you won't be disappointed. I laughed a lot and the connection Will Smith and Eva Mendes have is only exceeded by the chemistry that Albert Brennaman and Will have. If you think I'm wrong - E-Mail me and I'll buy it from you and give it to my friends at that price. By the way my copy's not for sale at any price.
0060557818|5.0|I love this book. I'm biased, because I love Gaiman, but it's my favorite of his by far (and I've read quite a few of his novels). I really don't envision Gaiman having any kind of philosophy or politics with what he writes, because it seems to me, he attempts to remove us to a world as far from the mundane as possible.    However, I think everyone knows what it feels like to rant and rave and tantrum, to scream as loud as their lungs allow, and to be heard for a second and then ignored, just like our protagonist. We're all slipping through the cracks...
B001FB55MG|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because it deserves it,how did disney do it make an adam sandler movie that is actually understandably funny for both kids and adults alike I am 17 and I saw it I do not usually see PG rated movies but I went with my family on the 26th.  I laughed through most all of it.  you probaly would not want to read the other reviews as they have minor spoilers. Unless you want it to br ruined for you.  Really not crude not bad language but still funny. Anyone taking thier children for a show should check this out.  I will definitely buy it on DVD

B0018QCXGY|2.0|This movie at least has a decent monster.  I just wish it would have been less Blare Witch.  I got tired of the camera always not showing stuff and jumping from one time stamp to another and always bouncing around like a home movie.  This movie does not even end in a concluding way.  You do not know who lives or dies.  You do not know if the monster lives or dies.  I give it a two star rating only because of the alien's quality monster.  It is cool and the Blu Ray has a sharp picture.  Rent his movie or borrow if from some sucker like myself who bought it thinking the director of Lost would not let a movie this bad passes his desk.  Oh well, guess we all make mistakes.  Buying this movie was one of mine!
B00009W0WM|5.0|A nice additional to your video library.  The bonus disc is nice but nothing overly special.  The print of the film is fantastic.  I have watched this disc a couple of times all ready and this film holds up over time.  Although Citizen Kane is still my favorite movie of all time this one rates as the best romantic film.  Buy this film in any packaging the second disc isn't mandatory but it's nice.
1904380190|5.0|This is, without doubt, a special book which combines personal judicial memories with an historic understanding of the history of the Liberal Party in second last half of the twentieth century.  It is a very `human' book, which is to be expected in view of the author's experiences, and it gives a new insight into some of the hitherto unknown aspects of political life from the end of World War Two.<br /><br />The latter part of the book illustrates some candid commentaries on contemporary judicial thinking at the time and John Baker is not inhibited when describing some of the individuals he has become involved with professionally since 1972.<br /><br />It is clear that Judge Baker was a loss to the Parliamentary world, but it is also interesting to reflect, as I have done, on how many active politicians I have met from all three main parties who fall into the same category as Baker. My Tory colleagues have often described election to Parliament as a lottery and, I am afraid I have to agree.  Of course, luck plays its prominent part but politics was not to be for John Baker - the Bench was all the better for this course of events.<br /><br />It was fortunate for the English judicial system that the Courts Act arrived when it did (long overdue), enabling Baker to participate in one of the more exciting reforms of the late twentieth century.  He is probably lucky he does not have to put up with the current `reforms' which are more to do with expediency and cost cutting after some ill-thought out extravagancies from 1990s which have left the criminal justice process in a complete mess.  He is also lucky to have escaped the crusading media who are clearly out to criticise lenient sentencing and `outing soft judges' when the media don't know what it is collectively talking about.<br /><br />Whilst much has been written of John Baker's political life, it is for his judicial work that he will be remembered.  From chapter 7 onwards with `Starting on the Bench' he describes, with some candour, the plight which can confront newly appointed judges.  I suspect his practice as a solicitor gave him an additional insight into what the Lord Chancellor expected of Her Majesty's Judges in 1970s - thankfully, a role now firmly in the hands of the Lord Chief Justice.<br /><br />Any member of the Bar who has an interest in pursuing a judicial career should read this book.  It is written very much in the personal style of the man himself and paints a most useful picture of the path which the judiciary have taken since the big changes of the 1970s and the creation of the Judicial Studies Board.  The mixture of everyday people and the various celebrities which one meets in both politics and law is well covered and dealt with deftly by Baker who has an amiable but firm approach throughout.<br /><br />I have read many judicial biographies and autobiographies but this one stands out for the serious business and the special cause which John Baker has stood for: it is a great addition to the world of judicial biography.ght which can confront newly appointed judges.

B0010X745K|5.0|It is incumbent upon me to post a review about this movie. How tame and idyllic it began, with beautiful scenery and a generic storm and it's aftermath of destruction. How quickly things can depart from the norm. In the course of mere minutes, a very disturbing, yet believable presentation of horrror, both of monster and of man in his baser mindset, splattered across the surface of my HDTV. This cinematic effort has indeed been a reminder of all that is creative and chilling about Stephen King. This is the stuff that true nightmares are made of!   I say well done to those who made \\"The Mist\\" a reality!  Respectfully,  Rodney Kase Tyrone (a.k.a. the Warlock)  12-28-2008  5:20P.M.
0060555661|5.0|If you lost big in 2008 it is your own fault.  I lost 7.5%, I should have made 10%.  READ this book carefully and follow its concepts.  It is my litmus test for anybody in the investment field, if they have not read it (and probably 90% have not) I ignore their advice (or consider doing the opposite).  read it follow it and you really do not need so called professional investment advice.  My definition of investing is buying something for less than you think it is worth, Speculation is buying something today because you think someone will pay more for it later.  Be an investor.
1591841666|4.0|This book is confusing. When I first read it I was down-right angry - it seemed trivial and a complete waste of time. I even went as far as to write a horrible review about it here at amazon. But...    On the next day I was studying Japanese and it was so difficult I seriously thought about quiting and that's when I heard Seth's voice \\"Hard things are the successful man's best friend...they ward off competiton, they make you unique...embrace them\\". At that point the thought about quitting was no more and a few days after that I even felt I was starting to get the hang of this Japanese thing.    Smart fellow this Godin dude. My suggestion ...    Buy the book and try not to be too upset after your first read. the book (although written poorly) contains a very powerful idea.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|While this collection includes most of Springsteen's classics, several important ones are missing (My Hometown, I'm On Fire, Better Days, Secret Garden, Waitin' On A Sunny Day).  It does however include some songs from his first two albums, which I would not call \\"essential.\\"  If they are going to call a collection THE Essential, then it should include every top 40 single the artist has released to date.  This album does not do that.
B001GKJ2DO|2.0|I was a huge ABBA fan as a teenager. I have all their music and still enjoy listening to them. I even liked the stage play Mamma Mia.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />the movie stinks! First of all, why on earth did the filmmakers cast actors who cannot sing? And if they had to cast these actors, at least let them lip sync. I adore Meryl Streep but she is not that talented when it comes to singing. Pierce Brosnan is so atrocious that I had to fast-forward his numbers. Ditto for everyone else in this movie (well Christine Baranski is not too bad). I don't see how anyone could appreciate Abba's music after hearing it here.<br /><br />The only thing I did enjoy was the cinematography and the incredibly colorful Mediterranean setting.
B001CQONKY|5.0|Love CSI - greatly do. great episodes. love catherine (my fav)  love owning every season to watch whenever i want, But I'm mildly Ticked that they took off the \\"play all\\" feature. So instead of being able to just put the disk in, hit play all, and wander around doing whatever I want, cleaning, art, whatever - I have to stop at the end of each episode to play the next one. and to me. That sucks!    but other than that. Love it!

Details, drama and adventure - all that is good in fiction.  The death bed scene of Sashenka's mother should be read by anyone learning to write fiction.    Deltas:  As others have noted, there are sections that were slow for me too.  A few contrived events to move the story along.    Overall:  If you are curious about this period in Russia - this will make you even more interested.  I suggest reading the first half of the Acknowledgements before starting the book.
031606792X|2.0|It was terrible. Gaping plot holes anyone? However, i enjoyed jacob's point of view and that gives this book an extra star. Don't waste your money.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|After the disappointing second movie outing for this console game, I was expecting the third instalment to be a disaster of epic proportions and signal the franchise's demise. Wow, was I surprised! This is a really great action movie. The set pieces are all cool. The way they further develop the character of the lead is interesting. The special effects and story both bring something new to the franchise.    There were a few minor niggles: the Vegas location could have been exploited for more; the super zombies were a little easy to kill with a knife to the throat(?); the climax battle was a little short. But all in all, I'll enjoy watching this again - always the sign of a good movie experience.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|I'll say it up front that some of my favorite movies are the long, dense and actor-driven films that have come out over the past 40 or so years but you know what? Occasionally I just want to have fun, tear loose and pop in a movie that gets you pumped. Is it badly written? Naturally and in addition to being not particularly depthful or well-characterized people, it's a film that says \\"you know what? Grab some buddies, nachos and drinks and just have fun\\" with a between-the-lines requirement that you shut off your brain first. Paul W.S. Anderson has in certain respects stopped being the poster child for bad filmmaking since now that the inexplicable \\"directing\\" by one Uwe Boll has been set loose, we now look at Anderson as the good bad-movie maker and so we have Death Race, a remake of the old Roger Corman film and looking at it you can level all the complaints you want at it but you'd still have a blast anyway.    Set in 2012, the prison system has become home to one of the most popular forms of entertainment on the web, that of the Death Race, a 3 part race where drivers literally fight to the death in hopes that they'll make it to 5 wins and earn their freedom out of prison. Headed by the devious Hennessey and her cronie guard/bodyguard Ulrich, the prison also houses the famous racer, Frankenstein who dons a mask since his face is so disfigured from previous races. But when he dies after a race, in comes Jensen Ames who's been wrongly imprisoned for murdering his wife so Hennessey and Ames cut a deal: with 4 races won by the original Frankenstein, if Ames wins that next race and dons his mask for ratings purposes, Ames goes free but surviving the race is one thing, surviving a warden who isn't exactly going to let her golden goose disappear is another.    Returning to the director's chair 4 years after he made the slightly-average-but-still-disappointing Alien vs. Predator, Anderson returns with Death Race and quite simply if you've ever seen any of his previous movies you know what to expect here and one can say that strangely, it's his best film in awhile. Resident Evil was a fine movie to me however it was not a horror movie and considering its source material, that's a disappointment while AvP was just too tame for the battle royale that it was supposed to be. Death Race is along the lines of say Event Horizon or Mortal Kombat where yeah, it does have issues but honestly, when the film's this fun, I could care less.     That doesn't mean he can't improve and disregarding the usual suggestions of \\"make better movies\\", he's gotta learn how to properly make an action sequence work since he still does that hyper editing where he tries to out-do Michael Bay in that instead of showing an exciting sequence, they gotta cut it up and make it so frantic and chaotic that it looks exciting, like being on a rollercoaster with your eyes darting all over the place. Then of course there's the writing which is filled with cliche lines or just bad one-liners but look at the movie uncritically and it passes, fixate on minor details and you're practically checking off all the goofy parts.    But enough about that, let's talk about the sexy violence since let's face it, we're dealing with cars outfitted with napalm, smoke, machine guns and when damaged a lot, they explode really nice. The hyperkinetic action is really the highlight for those into this kind of thing and in this area, this makes Anderson's new movie arguably the better one he's made in years. In fact to its detriment strangely since the races are so visually exciting and filled with balls-to-the-wall stunts and action that when they stop to tell stories and have character moments,the film deflates a bit too much. Nice to have a breather sure but here it becomes a bit too slow and doesn't quite have the downtime it needed. Plus this downtime doesn't include Natalie Martinez playing Case, Ames' side driver who fulfills that sexy role very nicely but since she only shows up in the prison the day of the race, you kind of miss looking at her. But we do have Robin Shou from Mortal Kombat in a very small cameo and Ian McShane of Deadwood fame is always awesome so there's that too.    In the end, Death Race is for adrenaline junkies, the kind of people who can watch action movies for the sake of getting your kicks out and Death Race does this. Might not be a lasting movie in the home, but it's a fun one when it's on.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|According to my grandson, for whom I bought this, it is excellent and he is very happy with this Christmas present.
0956010903|5.0|The collectors edition is so beautiful and well put together, it would be a great addition to any Harry Potter collection. Just because the story is not about Harry and friends doesn't take anything away form it. I bought both the collector's edition and the regular one and both are worth having. The collectors edition took my breath away and it was pure magic to open, feel, look at and read. Thanks to JK Rowling for another wonderful read (but too short - please write another!) and a special thanks to Amazon for selling such an amazing thing... and the money goes to charity so what could be better?
B001ED7C58|4.0|Listening to this CD reminds me a lot of the movie - the attitude of the film is captured in the songs that have been chosen for this soundtrack. It doesn't try too hard, like some movie soundtracks. It's great music to have on while working or driving around.     If you like the feel of the film, you will probably like the CD.
0545128285|5.0|I bought both the collectors edition and this edition so I could read one and keep the other. The collectors edition is so beautifully put together and presented it is a perfect gift item for any Harry Potter fan. The standard edition is also nicely done, with notes from Dumbledore that continue to add to the magical world JK Rowling has created. This is not a Harry Potter story but if you have read the books it continues to add to the story. I highly recommend not only this book, but the collectors edition as well which is stunning.
B0002DB52M|1.0|The storyline presumes to impart some profound social message.  It strives to inform us humans are inherently evil so we may just as well throw in the towel and join the Mafia. One is left with the impression  the entire budget was spent on big name talent leaving not a scrap to spend on scenery, setting, plot, costumes, music or action.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  For the first time I saw James Caan deliver a lousy performance.  Even he seemed bored and embarrassed to find himself playing this role. The movie has zero entertainment value and actually takes it a step beyond into the negative number zone of displeasure.  Expect no comic relief. It does not even deserve one star.  The film is a DOG.

0198326769|5.0|When I first started reading, I didn't find the simplistic writing style appealing and thought I would be glad to finish the book so I could move on to another more challenging. It wasn't long before I became engrossed in viewing the situation through the eyes and voice of the 9 yr old boy, Bruno. I did not critique what I was reading from the perspective of what a 'real' 9 yr old living in that era should or should not have known about Nazi Germany.      I decided to write this because I was disappointed by the comments of a couple of the other reviewers who were upset that the book did not include historical accuracy. I never thought I was purchasing a history book, and therefore did not expect to receive a history lesson. To me the message of the story is broader than the era it is set in. This is the tale of an unlikely friendship between two 9 yr old boys.  That friendship is allowed to grow because of their innocence, and because they do not judge one another by their stations in life. It's a very powerful, moving fable. I loved it for exactly what it is.

0743289692|5.0|What I loved most about this book is the author's courage, strength, and candor. What an incredible life she has had! I found her opinions on Islam and the Muslim culture very thought provoking, and pondered them long after I finished the book.  She writes about things that many people don't want to believe or think about. This is a perspective-expanding book, and I have recommended it to many people I know.
B000MV9026|5.0|This movie was amazing!  I am in awe over an animated film that made me FEEL the music with every song that was sung and every step that was tapped.  I could see Savion Glover in every dance move Mumble made.  That was amazing!  The music mix was outstanding (the youngsters with their \\"Heart Songs\\" and the elders with their ancient chants). On top of all of that, I loved the messages (old school vs. new approaches, accepting people for who they are and what they have to offer, save our environment and the creatures that dwell here, etc.).  If you DO NOT like R&B and soulful moves, THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. It is a MUSICAL ANIMATION WITH A MESSAGE not the all out drama that warrants all of the expert movie critic reviews that have been given here (musicals aren't for everyone, some people don't really appreciate animation, and some people just hate getting a message). Enjoy the entertainment.     P.S. HD is the best way to watch this movie.  It brings everything to life.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|\\"Death Race\\"  stars Jason Statham, Joan Allen, Ian McShane, and Tyrese Gibson.  In a place called Terminal Island, in the not-too-distant future, the world's hunger for extreme sports and competitions has grown into reality TV bloodlust.  The most extreme racing competition has emerged and its contestants are murderous prisoners.  The rules of Death Race are simple:  win five events and you're set free.  Lose and your bloody body is shown across the Internet.     Speedway champ Jensen Ames (Statham), an ex-con framed for the murder of his wife, is forced to put on the mask of the mythical driver Frankenstein, a Death Race crowd favorite who seems impossible to kill.  Ames is given an easy choice by Terminal Island's ruthless Warden Hennessey (Allen): suit up and drive or never see his little girl again.  To claim the prize, Ames must survive contests against the most vicious criminals, including Machine Gun Joe (Gibson).  Trained by his coach (McShane), to drive a Mustang V8 Fastback equipped with two mounted mini-guns, flamethrowers, and napalm, Ames must destroy everything in his path to win the most violent spectator sport on the planet.   Statham is very good as Ames, Joan Allen cold and menacing as a cartoonish warden, and Ian McShane enjoyable to watch as the head of Ames' pit crew.  But it's the action that takes center stage here, with amazing stunts combined with CGI to produce one thrill after another.  The film is a remake of \\"Death Race 2000\\" (1975), which starred David Carradine and did not have the benefit of today's technology.     The Unrated Edition (which also contains the theatrical version) has two features that race car lovers will enjoy: \\"Start Your Engines: Making a Death Race\\" and \\"Behind the Wheel: Dissecting the Stunts.\\"  There's also feature commentary with director Paul W.S. Anderson.

There is some weird enough photos that a girl looking through this might want some serious explanations.  I've gone in a search for removable stickers for the adventurous type.

B000IFSDZQ|3.0|I cannot for the life of me understand why some of the reviews here are so biased against this product.  As a hardcore Roxette fan since the age of 11 ( I'm 31 now ) I have to say that for the price it's not bad.  You can't expect every song they that has ever been a major hit to be on here, it's totally up to the discretion of the people who compiled this ( in this case Per ) but it's amazing to see that most of the \\" lost \\" hits that never made it on any album are here, like \\" Myth \\", \\" New World \\", \\" Help! \\", and most of the others that I could never get my hands on besides with this recording.  \\" Always Breaking My Heart \\" was in itself a real treat cos being such a mega-fanatical Roxette fan I did go out and buy Belinda Carlisle's album which had this Per Gessle penned-hit ( 1993's A Woman and A Man ) along with \\" Love Doesn't Live Here \\" which made it on Per's 1997 album \\" The World According to Per Gessle \\".  I wouldn't have added the alternate version of \\" Almost Unreal, and \\" The Voice \\" should have definitely been on here, one of Roxette's most lovely songs which is not readily available except on what I expect is now the mega-rare Rarities CD from 1994.  I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars over 20 years on Roxette's CD's, singles and demos, they are by far my favorite band in the whole wide world and I love them both to death and I fully support Per's decision on what finally made it on this compilation.  There just is no way to get every single one of Roxette's hits unless you're a megafan like me, Per has written literally hundreds and hundreds of songs and there have been remixes, megamixes, outtakes, demos, etc., the list goes on and on.  I live in California and I just ordered \\" Party Crasher \\" from this guy in Norway off of eBay and I'm still waiting for it.  By the way 80's Roxette is definitely what brought us all to the dance, or am I silly?  Really?  Stupid joke, I know.  Anyway, why don't you all flood Per's mailbox in Halmstad before some other psycho fan steals it so you can get all of his songs on CD, or else quit whining about this boxset since he calls the shots!re some other psycho fan steals it so you can get all of his songs on CD, or else quit whining about this boxset since he calls the shots!
B000A3XYZA|5.0|I'm a bit hypersensitive to hammy operatic acting, and this particular staging used hammy silent movie acting as a deliberate choice, so it took a bit for me to get past it.  In the end though, it was worth it to make the mental shift.  I wish the shift had taken less effort for me, but not being a silver-screen fan, I think that's more my thing than a failure of the staging.  And to be fair, once I did put in my mental clutch and make that shift, it was effort well spent.    So ultimately, this DVD was lovely.  Rodelinda/Antonacci's voice wasn't quite as champagne-colored and sparkly as I might have liked in a baroque soprano, but it was really wonderful, and Bertarido was of course fabulous.  (He descends into chest voice for a few notes, and the resonance and precipitous drop in range literally made me gasp.  My 74-year-old mom, who was watching with me and comes from an Italian family that worships 19th century Romantic opera, now thinks Andreas Scholl walks on water.)    Unulfo was lovely, Garibaldo was a delightful moustachio-twirling baddie, and Grimoaldo surprised me in that he was able to make the shift from slapworthy bad guy to really a rather sympathetic remorseful ex-villain.  Only Eduige left me rather cold; I find that character more sympathetic than she was made out to be here.  All of the voices were delightful, full and nimble although I could tell that some were perhaps better suited to opera buffa than the earlier stuff.    An excellent DVD overall and well worth the price -- and aside, why do so many of these DVDs have no special features?  I enjoy watching \\"making of\\" features on movie DVDs, sometimes more than the movies themselves.  They need to start putting things like that, interviews and BTS featurettes, on operatic DVDs as well.

B001AQO3WY|4.0|\\"Generation Kill\\"  is a seven-part mini-series that looks at the first 40 days of the Iraq War as seen through the eyes of the elite U.S. First Reconnaissance Marines who were at the forefront of the invasion.  We see the barren landscape of Iraq, where the military often have to improvise their plans because of unexpected obstacles.  We see the confusion caused by a nonuniformed enemy that is able to blend easily in with civilians, and feel the never-ending tension they feel.  The documentary shows how the men of the First Recon Battalion combine their skill, resolve, humor, and dedication to do the work they are assigned and survive day after day.  What makes the film so involving is that it puts faces and personalities on the men who fight America's wars.  Bonus features include a roundtable discussion with members of the First Recon Marines led by Evan Wright, author of \\"Generation Kill;\\" a making-of featurette; six audio commentaries; deleted dialogues; and an insert with military glossary, chain of command chart, and mission map.

0956010903|1.0|How can she be ok with her name on a book that has at least 3 typos in it?  My outside book has an extra glob of glue on the front dark brown part along with some other line mark, and the inside velvet pouch has a couple of spots of something that stained it (water, glue?).  If I hadn't paid $100, who cares, but all of these imperfections do not equal a \\"collector's edition\\", which is what I was told I was purchasing.  The quality control was obviously abysmal, perhaps in the rush to capitalize on Amazon's purchase and the upcoming holiday spending season. I think Amazon should reprint this and re-send it to everyone who spent $100 and was promised a Collector's Edition, and JK Rowling should also insist since it's her name on it.  I think I'm going to just return mine.

The second disc has some uninteresting stuff; a little about the Bat-Pod, the music, a really stupid sequence of videos in the vein of a Gotham City news-cast revolving around the D.A. elections and the vigilante Batman, IMAX footage(Yeah! Gonna get the IMAX experience on my 37\\" or 42\\" TV!), and some photos.    Where is the good stuff? Two-Face's make-up, special effects, info on the hand-to-hand combat sequences, locations the movie was shot in, cut scenes, hard decisions made by director and producer, interactions between the cast, cast interviews, etc. There should have also been a featurette about Heath Ledger; didn't need to be his life story, didn't need to be tabloid dirt, but something acknowledging a masterful performance and someone who will be missed.    Again, the special features are garbage. Save your money.
B000002G30|5.0|\\"Dopes to Infinity\\" is Monster Magnet at their absolute best. Listening to Dave Wyndorf and the gang's recent output it's hard to even compare, such is the fall from grace. Thankfully though, this album and its predecessors are superb. Catchy, melodic, fuzzy and spacey, the sound is irresistible.<br /><br />In fact, the first six tracks on \\"Dopes to Infinity\\" make up some of the very best stoner rock to come out of the 90s. Tracks like \\"Look to Your Orb For Warning\\", \\"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\\" and the title track perfectly blend grooving, fuzzy riffs with melodic hooks, all encapsulating Wyndorf's raspy and powerful vocals. There's slower, more psychedelic edged tracks, the best of which \\"All Friends and Kingdom Come\\" wonderfully forges a kind of melancholy, trippy atmosphere. It's all great and consistent listening. Monster Magnet at their best are superb; it's a real shame it went downhill from here.<br /><br />I've noted someone has tagged this album as 'mean'. Damn right, this is mean f**king goodness. Yeah.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|\\"Mamma Mia! The Movie\\"  is based on the long-running Broadway play.  Its thin plot was conceived to tie together a catalogue of ABBA songs.  Donna (Meryl Streep) is an independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on a picture-perfect Greek island.  Her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is about to be married and Donna has invited to the wedding two lifelong friends from her one-time singing group, Donna and the Dynamos -- multi-divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski) and practical, no-nonsense Rosie (Julie Walters).  Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own.  Longing to discover the identity of her father so he can walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier -- Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan), and Harry (Colin Firth).   Streep's Donna is far afield from any role the actress has played before.  It's light, almost buoyant, as Donna sings her heart out, dances on a pier, or looks mortified when she meets her three beaus from decades past.  The songs by ABBA include \\"Dancing Queen,\\" \\"S.O.S.,\\" \\"Take a Chance on Me,\\" and \\"Money, Money, Money.\\"  When you finish watching the film, the songs will remain in your head for hours, if not days.  You'll have to decide if that's a good or a bad thing.  Both Baranski, with her trademark deadpan delivery, and Walters, with take-no-prisoners energy, provide ample comic relief.  The two-disc Special Edition contains a making-of documentary, a detailed featurette on the staging of one musical number (\\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\"), a music video, deleted scenes and outtakes, and a digital copy of the movie.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This album is a GREAT FIND ! I've enjoyed Emmylou's music since the early 70s and it's hard to imagine her music could get any better, but that's what I get for thinking. She seems to shine with any kind of music. My last E.H. disc was with Mark Knopler and was elated with what I heard but All I Intended To Be is a consumate work of art. Thank You Emmylou Harris.

081186510X|5.0|Amazing photography and a must have for any fan. Great behind the scenes look at the one of the best bands of this generation.    Book is full of well over 100 photographs detailing REM from the 2001 tour to their Hall of Fame induction in 2007. Perfect coffee table book. About 20% of the photographs are captioned by Michael or the other members of the band.
0545128285|4.0|My daughter enjoyed it, but said it was more for her kids as it is like fairy tales.
0440238153|1.0|I read this trilogy because the minister at my church condemned it from the pulpit.  Usually (at least in my church), that's a pretty good indication that a book might have some interest or that it might give a good expression of an interesting point of view---even if it is not the interesting point of view that I accept as true.  In this case, this contrarian form of guidance proved useless.  The minister was not correct, but his error was in making the book appear as something when it is hardly anything at all.<br /><br />Most people I know regard this book quite favorably.  They suggest that it is \\"just fiction\\" and \\"just a fun book.\\"  From that point of view, it is reasonable to say that the author is a decent journeyman wordsmith, neither distinguished among professional authors, nor much worse than most.  The editing of this third volume seems to have been very loose.  It is paced quite slowly and more chaotically than necessary.  It is, all things considered, less well crafted in its layout than the previous volumes.<br /><br />I demand more of a book than \\"good fiction.\\"  To be worthy of my attention during this short stay on Earth, any work of art has to express something useful and, if at all possible, profound.  This book is clearly the fictional construct of an atheistic author.  Perhaps he is, indeed, as someone else commented, the atheist answer to C.S. Lewis.  If so, the atheists are pretty short of spokes-people.<br /><br />The book likes to repeat unhappy sayings about the Church of its world, about the corruption of the clergy and generally the need for a better institution.  If that theme were carved on the pages in the literary equivalent of bass relief, then we could have fun together. Even as an avid church goer, I think we have seen no more urgent time for restructuring and purification of the Church since the time of Thomas Aquinas.  So, we could have had fun.  We could have agreed, but this aspect was sketched as a cartoon---hardly worth mentioning.<br /><br />More of the philosophical effort of the book goes toward denouncing the author's idea of the unseen spiritual forces that lie much more toward the heart of religion.  He makes the Creator God into some sort of extraordinarily pitiful God, perhaps suffering from some version of Alzheimer's.  He makes the high angels, who serve before the throne of God into lustful bullies.  It is not just irreverent, but ludicrous.  Einstein was fond of saying that we cannot solve a problem from the same frame of mind that gave rise to the problem.  We cannot understand the higher wisdom of deep mysticism from a cartoon caricature.  It is so absurd that a grown person should be ashamed to put such a thing in print.  It's just plain rubbish, and that's much too kind a phrasing for it.<br /><br />This book may be amusing if you wish to read it for just entertainment.  It's message is a caricature and unworthy of the time a person might spend reading it (even if you read very fast indeed).<br /><br />The song \\"Shenandoah\\" or the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony are, indeed, melodies.  However, because they strike generation after generation as lyrically beautiful and hauntingly expressive, it would be wrong to say they are \\"just songs.\\"  They are masterworks of music for the ages.  That's what I want.  My associates who claim this is \\"just fiction,\\" are quite right.  It is really \\"just fiction.\\"  It does not rate as highly on the scale of memorable art as some of the worse German drinking songs, and it certainly makes no comparison to \\"Im Himmel es Gibt Kein Bier.\\"philosophical effort of the book goes toward denouncing the author's idea of the unseen spiritual forces that lie much more toward the heart of religion.

B001KW0C96|3.0|If you think that your going to watch another movie like HEAT (at least I did!) your in for a not so good shock.<br /><br />Robert Deniro is as outstanding as always, Al Pacino...I've seen better,I mean this is the Godfather here he could have done a lot better, The movie starts out in a way that makes you feel it's going to be great, even though the story has been done before but quickly you realize that it's just average.<br /><br />25 to 30 minutes in the movie you get the picture and realize the end, from there on it's just a matter of enjoying the performances by the actors john leguizamo was also very good.<br /><br />Near the end the events stop making any sense it's like they wanted to finish the movie and put whatever they found on film.<br /><br />I would buy this just for the fact that it has Robert Deniro and Al Pacino together.
B000P0J024|2.0|I really enjoyed the 2 or so hits on this collection. The rest are pretty hard to listen to. After Roy died, so did the band. Better off getting the debut CD and forgetting the rest.

B0011N1WE8|5.0|Penelope is wonderful!  The character, the story, the film...all of it.  The visuals are stunning and fabulous.  As someone who is jaded about fairy tales, I was pleasantly surprised (though not too surprised) and I am glad that this is a very strong character and a good feminist role model (wedged amongst the many other typical story lines in Hollywood, no matter how well done).  Not only is the story fantastic, the visuals and design of the film just blows me away.  I watch it again and again sometimes just for the set!  Her room, especially, fills me with admiration.  It's not often I want to emulate a set from a film with such ardor and passion, but Penelope's...I do.<br /><br />If you haven't watched it, watch it!  :)  If you haven't noticed the visuals, well start paying attention!  :D
B001AJVR5M|5.0|All songs are perfect except \\"BB Good\\". Because it sounds so FAKE. I'm repeating ALL SONGS ARE PERFECT!! You must buy this album. Because if you are a real JB fan this album might become your favorite. Actually I realized that in this album Nick has more part, I mean Joe sings less(In a way I'm not sure if it's good or bad). Well, I also liked this album so much because, you know breakup stuffs. That situations made the lyrics and the way they sing and play deeper & more emotional. Remember the song \\"Sorry\\". I mean somebody most be choking and killing Nick or broke his heart very deeply bad. If you are an emotional person and love Nick you may cry just like a friend of mine did.So I think this album is perfect and it deserves 5 huge stars.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Have an artist like Pink go through a divorce and you are going to get quite the album.  I won't say I love every song on the album but it is most definitely a Funhouse ride through her recent life.Some of her vocals just blow you away.  If you like Pink you will really like this album.

1439102813|4.0|Around twenty years ago my favorite aunt came to visit me at my home, about an hour and a half from hers.  My Aunt Ethel had always loved me, even when to all others I had been an unlovable teen.  She always asked \\"How's MY girl been doin'?\\" even when no one else seemed to care.  Most of our family was there that day she came to visit with her husband.  There was a lull in the coversation, and for a moment the room fell silent.  \\"I've got Alzheimer's,\\" she said.  \\"And I am going to lose a little bit of my mind at a time, until it is all gone and I won't remember anything anymore.\\" Then she burst into deep sobs and tears poured down her face.  I didn't know what to say.  I wanted to take this away from her, but I knew I couldn't.  All I could think of to say was \\"I love you.\\"  So that is what I said.    Since I spent six years watching my aunt gradually die from Alzheimer's, I was very interested in reading this book.  I sensed the scientist and the science in the book, and found that knowing that the author has a Ph.D. in neuroscience gave the factual information presented a very solid grounding.  I also felt there was a lot of compassion in the book, and that it offered a glimpse of what it is like to be someone with Alzheimer's experiencing your abilities leaving you.  Dr. Genova also did an excellent job exploring the relationship issues that emerge when someone you love has Alzheimer's.      I can see that someone just starting to walk down this path as a person who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, or a loved one, would benefit greatly from the wisdom and the compassion in this book.
B001DU8T6I|4.0|This album is very very good. But it's not perfect. Cuz Demi worked with JB like in every song and the song \\"Believe In Me\\" is not her very best. But ALL Songs are superduperamazingexellent. Also she sings high notes very very good. I actually think Demi is Jennifer Hudson of teen pop-rock. So i gave the album \\"Don't Forget\\" 4 stars(probably it deserves 5 stars but who cares).

0312360266|2.0|I read Twilight and loved it, like most other teenage girls in the U.S. But before twilight, I've always liked the Vampire spin on stories. I watched Buffy and Angel at young ages (too young, probably), and one of my favorite movies is Interview with a Vampire. I love Anne Rice. I really would have liked to enjoy this book. The idea of it is interesting, a girl becomes \\"marked\\" by a vampire and escapes her horrible step-father and brainless mother to a school full of attractive vampire fledglings.           But unfortunately, I couldn't stand the authors' writing style or character development. Zoey, the main character, is almost sickeningly perfect (pretty yet modest, confident in herself yet supportive of others, nice and cool, gets the hottest guy in the school but still doesn't have an overinflated head). She doesn't seem to have any flaws, which makes her boring to listen to. She jumps from feeling like an outcast and dealing with difficult adult situations to gushing over the hot guy at school who is like, \\"totally delicious\\", and who, unsurprisingly, likes her back. she uses words like \\"gihugic\\" (uh, what?), and over uses words such as \\"totally\\" and \\"ohmygod\\", which detracts from any kind of adult attitude she might have.            Her friends are also disappointingly two dimensional. Her best friend from the south (Zoey repeatedly mentions her \\"twang\\") is a sweet, loveable girl who is a pushover, and sticks up for herself later with the encouragement of Zoey. The twins, two girls from completely different backgrounds, races, families etc. and yet are exactly alike in every way. And of course, Damien, the gay boy who at the beginning Zoey claims is gay but in a subtle way, and yet from the rest of the book is so obviously in your face gay that it's hard to ever not notice how gay he is.          The same with Zoey's love interest Erik, and her nemesis Aphrodite (Erik's ex-girlfriend who still wants him back and is the leader of the school, of course.) who never developed fully. Erik is bland with his \\"totally hotness!\\" and nice guy tendencies. Aphrodite seems to be one of the only characters with actual personality flaws, and thus made me look forward to her appearances in the book.          Although I was very offput by the poor writing style, the plot itself is very interesting, catching, and easy to get involved in. the book is readable if you have the talent to ignore or even just cringe through the inconsistencies, the vocabulary, and the utterly boring and stereotypical characters, then you might find yourself with a book you can enjoy.
0385340567|1.0|I am just glad I read the previous Jack Reacher novels before I read this one. If I had happened to read this first I would never have gotten to enjoy the others. Flat characters, rambling storyline, improbable and implausible beyond hope.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Great story, phenominal animation, and lovable characters, especially Wall-E who has as much depth and expression as many Oscar winners.  The film's messages about human's slothfulness, waste, and the dangers of monopoly capitalism are both timely and impactful.  What really amazes me about this movie is how much attention the folks at Pixar pay to physics: they really worked on the dynamics of the robots and the items they interact with. I know firsthand from having met John Lasseter at a party and discussing how they modeled the spring motion of the headpiece on a toy soldier's helmet (this was years ago) how much work goes into this part of their movies. It makes the whole experience that much more believable as you don't have to deal with the traditional \\"cartoon physics\\" that tend to exemplify the genre.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The local paper/magazine reviews for this show weren't great, so I wasn't expecting a lot, but I got hooked in the first 10 minutes.  Very enjoyable show, well written and acted. I was impressed with the way they brought the story full-circle and ended the first season in a satisfying way, yet left a number of open storylines for the next season (I think that's got to be a lot harder to do than it sounds).  Yes, there is a lot of sex and nudity and a certain amount of violence, but that's to be expected on HBO. I went back and watched some of the episodes from the On Demand feature more than once.  I plan to get the DVD when it comes out.  One of the (IMO misguided) reviewers said the only thing he liked about the show was the title sequence, which I agree is great, but give the show a chance even if you're not sure, or you don't like vampires, or whatever.  It just may grow on you.
031606792X|1.0|Well I finished the series, begrudgingly and only because I could not stand not knowing. I am not always good at expressing myself on paper but I will try. I am very, very angry. I should warn there could be spoilers in this review.    This series had so much potential, the characters were well thought out; but I agree with Bella: why the heck were they together? There was no explanation, she smelled good? he was gorgeous? At least the author could have written in a vampire version of soul mates.     I almost feel the author could have done all this in one book, why drag it out for 4? I am tempted to say to watch the movie instead (I have not seen it) but it might be more succinct.  Towards the end I was skipping whole pages just to get it over with. I have re-read those parts since and you know what? I missed nothing.  The first book was great.  The second book, I could tell you the ending about a third of the way through; no I am not that great but I have graduated from high school so I have finished most books on the recommended reading list for high school English, plus in case you missed it she only mentions the play over and over. Heck the finale is in Italy, she might as well have made it in Venice. The third book, Bella is rereading Wuthering Heights, and imagine this, the plot of the story follows the book quite well.    I agree with one of the previous reviewers just read the first book and pretend at the end Edward bites her and makes her one of them. It will be much better that way.
B001C46P2A|5.0|I loved this film. Baz has directed it beautifully. Nicole (whom I don't particularly like as an actress) was good, Hugh doesn't have his shirt off enough but when he does phew! But it's the young boy played by Brandon Walters who plays native boy Nullah (the heart and soul of the story) who steals your heart in this epic movie. It has everything a grand epic tale should - good battling evil; never give up attitude, racism, love, war, hate and revenge. Beautifully written, superbly directed and good acting by all the cast. It's definitely NOT too long - I wouldn't cut a thing and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It should be an oscar contender for the scenery alone - the Cinematography was awesome.
0545128285|1.0|Again like other reviewers I loved the Harry Potter series. I thought this would be a good stocking filler for my seven year old. Luckily we decided to read this at bedtime together. Firstly a lot of the language was way beyond his comprehension and I found myself making substitutions. Then we came to the \\"Hairy Heart\\" story, which was more entertaining than the first two stories, but when we got close to the end I could tell from the illustration that I might want to read ahead myself so I ended it there for him and I finished it. Thank goodness I stopped, I am under no illusion that fairy tales are fairly gruesome but slicing out a heart and licking it? Not an image I want in my child's head.
0895260131|1.0|A book for someone with the emotional maturity of an 8-year-old.  This so-called incorrect guide holds back its conspiracy ranting till the second half.  There are sufficient facts presented that the book may be worth a tenth of its price, but you may get a headache weeding through the propaganda.  Said spin is quite sophisticated, taking the form of debunking the PC opinions that the author says you have.  Eventually you will come to understand that the Politically Correct comprise a monumental conspiracy holding - surprise, suprise - any opinion about the subject that the author disagrees with.  Ultimately the book is as much about the righteousness of some other religion, but that idea backfires to the point that the underlying message is that all religions are pernicious.  The book is divisive, war-mongering, and retro.  Whether it is true or not isn't especially relevant simply because the human race will never progress or overcome while our thoughts are guided by children.

B001ILHY1I|5.0|Death Race is one of the best movies of the year. This movie is non stop action.  I think that Jason Statham gives the performance of his career.  Joan Allen gives an excellent performance too.  I loved watching the bonus features on this DVD.  Director Paul Anderson and the actors had so much fun making this movie. They share their experiences of making the movie on the bonus features.  I loved watching how the cars were transformed into driving machines equipped with weapons. I enjoyed everything about this DVD.

B00005NICK|5.0|The single disc version of \\"Familiar To Millions\\" is way better than the bloated 2-disc edition. All the fat is trimmed here like \\"Helter Skelter\\" and Noel's Neil Young thing. Plus, at 74 minutes, you can leave it on and enjoy a great Oasis concert, rather than having to change discs to hear the rest. And, the sound quality seems to be much better than the US double disc. Highly recommended.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Sometimes a movie comes along that connects with people for possibly all the wrong reasons. The real world is in a dark place: The economy is failing, terror-wars are raging, and the climate is threatening our existence. Usually superheroes help us escape the bitter pill of our reality. This is not the case with The Dark Knight. The film takes us on a hellish nihilistic ride that is never soothing yet somehow manages to be darkly beautiful and strangely entertaining. Perhaps this movie reflects our real fears in the controllable enviroment of a movie theater. There is an uneasy sense of safety sitting in one's seat as a world worse than our own goes down in flames.<br /><br />I don't know which is scarier in this film: Heath Ledger's soul scorching performance as The JoKer(how much of this was really acting?) or watching good guy Harvey Dent's fall from grace. Either way, both are more important to the core of this film than the hero, Batman. Batman serves as a foil for the nihilistic JoKer. Batman's life seems to be the only one the Joker cares about. Without Batman's light, the darkness serves no purpose. Hey even a nihilist needs something or someone to care about.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is a dark journey through the heart of darkness and dares to ask: Will our HUMANITY save us?. Heavy stuff, indeed. Now \\"That's Entertaiment!\\"
B001CTA1S4|4.0|At a Catholic school circa 1964, doubt has begun to enter a world of certainty.  Times are changing and the Catholic Church is becoming more liberal.  This sets the stage for a battle between principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) and Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn of inappropriate behavior with a student (Joseph Foster II) on very circumstantial evidence and makes it her crusade to remove him from his position.  As she says, she has no proof, but she has her certainty.    It is this certainty which seems to make her a monster, as she dismisses each bit of information or alternate interpretation of events that would cast doubt on her belief.  But this would not be such a rich film if writer / director John Patrick Shanley had made it that simple.  The viewer is never given satisfactory ground for completely siding with either the sister or the father.  While it is very clear that Sister Aloysius is very rigid, cold, and judgmental, it is also possible that she is right.  I admire the way Shanley encourages us to think about the issues raised and draw our own conclusions, which is why I was very disappointed in the final moments of this film, in which Shanley makes explicit a element of his theme that would have been better left understated, ending his script on a rather jarring note.  Amy Adams, who plays the young sister caught in the middle of this battle, and Viola Davis, who plays the boy's mother, also deserve mention for their powerful performances.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|Starring Mickey Rourke as an aging wrestler with few choices left to make in his life, this 2008 film has already been nominated for numerous prestigious awards.  Directed by Darren Aronofsky, this character study is a demanding role for any actor.  But it is especially poignant because of the inclusion of explicit wrestling scenes which form a backdrop for the development of the plot.<br /><br />This film is nothing short of a knockout blow.  It picked me up threw me down right into the middle of the world of professional wrestling.  There were points that I felt myself nauseated and repelled.  There were parts of the film that the physical tortures that these men put themselves through were impossible to watch.  But, at the same time, I felt the exhilaration of knowing that I was watching a truly great film which will linger in my consciousness for a long time.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, now over 50 years, old, is cast as the aging Randy \\"the Ram\\" Robinson.  He had achieved a peak of success in the 1980's but now, 20 years later, he is no longer in the spotlight, but is wrestling in shoddy downscale matches which put incredible painful demands on his body.  He needs to wrestle for the money, and he needs to wrestle just because that's what he does.<br /><br />Supporting performances by Marisa Tomei as a strip club lap dancer who encourages him to reconcile with his adult daughter and Evan Rachel Wood cast in the role of the daughter are perfect.  Through his relationships with these two women, we see the vulnerable side of the man.<br /><br />The theme of this film has been done before and might have come across as stereotyped in the hands of a less talented director and lesser actors.  But The Wrestler was made by Hollywood's best, and everything, including the camera angles and editing was perfect.  I therefore give this film a high recommendation but it is certainly not for children or anyone who is uncomfortable with graphic violence.  It was even a little strong for my tastes, and that's saying a lot.aying a lot.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book.  I became quite enamored with the characters...even the rotten ones. I would recommend this to anyone.  It is written in diary format which I know is difficult for some to get into, but it is such an easy read.<br />A great book for a weekend get-away.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|We rented this movie last night and became so bored with it, we turned it off midway. The 1st five minutes with the false trailers are mildly amusing and so we thought we were in for some belly laughs. Nothing could be further from the truth. The premise had potential, but there is nothing funny about this movie, no snappy dialogue, no quick comebacks, not once did we laugh after the opening. Sure, it has star potential, but the script was just awful, the characters weren't even decent parodies. Reviewers who say this is a good movie are just pandering to its extraordinary cast, but it was painfully clear that none of the cast actually read the book, er script (one of the \\"jokes\\" in the movie), and put it all together. The best thing about the movie was the panoramic scenery, which was gratuitously blown up, over and over. If you want belly laughs, see Step Brothers. Ben Stiller, you need new writing partners. I wonder if Will Ferrel is available?
B00006CXXU|4.0|Hello, I am just joing to tell you how these songs rank on my scale.    Stripped intro pt.1- It is a really cool intro, but it's a little risky for someone so sweet.    Can't hold us down- It is just like Vanessa Hudgens \\"Never Underestimate A Girl\\" except this song is worse and it has curse words.    Walk away- Good song, A little boring.    Fighter- AMAZING SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     I don't feel like writing about the other songs. Here are just my favorites:    Beautiful  Fighter  Dirrty (ft. Redman)  Stripped pt.1  Stripped pt.2  Can't hold us down  The voice within
B000UX6THK|1.0|What can I say? Being a fan of odd movies and bizarre TV shows like Northern Exposure and X-Files, people begged me for years to check into this show. I finally did, and 3 of the 10 discs are so scratched they skip. Some online research showed me that a LOT of people had scratched discs. More people even said they couldn't navigate the menus on some discs. I'm sure the show is good, but this is to review these DVD's, and they suck.
0545128285|5.0|As a stay at home mother (whom is also a big harry potter fan), I can't always pick up the big books of Potter anymore with a three year old running around, but when I recieved this book for Christmas I couldn't have been more satisfied. Yes the stories are short and yes they are more 'fairtales for witches and wizards', but that is what makes the book so interesting. The only problem I had was wanting more stories out of this book. If you are a big Harry Potter fan, young or old, I recommend this book.
0316143472|3.0|I love David Sedaris' work and was looking forward to reading this newest collection of essays.  It was disappointing to find that a lot of the essays were from previous books.  If you haven't read any of his previous books, you will thoroughly enjoy Sedaris' low key, quirky sense of humor, but if you are a returning fan, you will be disappointed at the \\"regifting\\".
B001EO2UJK|4.0|This is a top-notch product. The sound of the recordings has been incredibly improved compared with the original recordings.  I want to state one little issue, there is no region code given on the DVD's but, they are region 1. Sobefore you buy, check your region code. Just an advice
B001EO2UJK|5.0|This box set will surely stand as the most complete collection of every key track and video available from the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis. This does not include their first release \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\" but that is understandable as that early work is more pop than \\"prog\\".  Most of these audio recordings have been available before, save for some unreleased material recorded circa their first serious work, Trespass. But I can't imagine that these will ever sound better, and each record is provided in both stereo and 5.1 remixes.  The only possible improvement would be if they used SHM-CD materials and process, but this is still a rarity outside Japan.<br /><br />In any case, the real revelation here is the video content, as just about every known minute of video footage from the era is presented throughout the set.  Hard core fans have traded most of this content over the last 30 years on tape or disc, but the copies were typically 2 or more generations removed from the source materials, and at times were unwatchable.  Now the band has collected everything I have seen and more from this era, presenting the best versions possible in almost every case.  Best of these is the Genesis TV special from Belgium, filmed in a completely white room, just after the \\"Nursery Crime\\" record. This incredible footage includes the band tearing through \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" revealing their early chops perfectly. Also included are two versions of the \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" tour - one live in auditorium, and the other recorded live in studio for French TV. Finally, most collectors know there were sadly no video recordings of any merit made from the brief Lamb Lies Down tour which ended after just about 100 shows with Gabriel's departure from the band.  I saw a tribute band, \\"The Musical Box\\" recreate this show in it's entirety, which was amazing to behold.  Apparently, all the work they put in to re sync and match the three-panel slide shows from the tour paid off, as they are included on the DVD 5.1 mix of both albums.  Not only are the slides presented, but they are matched by photos of the band, and a few available 16mm video clips, to recreate as much of the visual experience as possible.  Having seen the tribute show live, then seeing this official DVD version, I can say that any new or old fan of this work  will find the cost of this set worth every penny after experiencing the feat of engineering applied to \\"The Lamb\\".<br /><br />Genesis have always been an amazing visual experience but particularly during the Gabriel era when they presented themselves as \\"rock theater\\".  So for this fan, after 30 years of collecting artifacts of this band, I can say that the interviews, photos and live video make this set the definitive statement for Gabriel era Genesis.as they are included on the DVD 5.1 mix of both albums.

B00005JPF9|3.0|\\"Alatriste\\" stars Viggo Mortensen as the title role Diego Alatriste, a veteran soldier (and a hired assassin) in the service of Spanish King Philip IV. Known as \\"Capitan,\\" Alatriste, always faithful to his duty, witnesses the slow fall and decline of the empire while he himself continues to fight in the battlefield. The film also includes a romance between the hero and a beautiful actress Maria de Castro (Ariadna Gil) as well as many battles and swordfights.    Set in the 17th century and based on Arturo Pérez-Reverte's best selling novels (five volumes so far), \\"Alatriste\\" is beautifully shot, but suffers the rushed pace and underdeveloped characters. Those who have knowledge of the Spanish history might feel differently, but to me the film's story unfolds too fast, sometimes leaping from one scene to another, giving almost no clue as to what really happened between them. The cast, all talented, do their best and deliver solid performances, but few of the characters are memorable.    \\"Alatriste\\" is said to be the most expensive film made in Spain and if you watch the film, you will not be surprised to hear that. The film is visually superb, with impressive production designs and costumes. Some of the film's images look as if taken directly from paintings (one scene recreates Diego Velázquez's \\"The Surrender of Breda\\" for instance). Also of note are the swordfights and battles depicted in the film, which give more emphasis to the brutality and violence of the fights. The swashbuckling in this film is not dancing; it means killing in the most brutal way.    \\"Alatriste\\" is not all that bad. It just needs much more time to be an emotionally involving film. I watched the 147 minute version (probably the original Spanish version) and it is still too short. It is quite regrettable.
B000002LQR|5.0|From the second \\"Power Of Equality\\" starts, the sheer energy of this album becomes apparent. On this release, the Chili Peppers took their funk-infused sound and took it to a whole new level. This album, while very put together and well produced, sounds raw and authentic as can be.    The Bass, courtesy of Flea, is not the same slap bass we heard in the 80s, it's  funky, heavy but very smooth and polished. The drums are heavy hitting and precise as it gets, completely coordinated to the bass. John provides some seriously funky guitar on some tracks and very melodic grooves on others. The vocals are pure energy, Anthony Keidis has this almost rap-like style on here which sounds great.    If you're into the chili's more recent work, this album is quite different. If you're into their 80s p-funk days, this album is somewhat different too. But anyway you look at it, this album is just stunningly good. That's the magik of this band, they can switch their style up and still get it right without isolating their fans.
0205632645|1.0|It is such a damn shame that essentially all you get is a new cover for the incremental $$ you pay.  Would have been nice if they had actually made an effort to give something in return, such as stylistic considerations in today's age of online media.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this book's content, but at the least they could be donating $2 to \\"one laptop per child\\" or some other literacy related nonprofit if they can't add any incremental value to the original book.
B00122O0X8|5.0|This is a great album, each song is great, I would recommend it to anyone.  There are great lyrics and music.
0307383415|5.0|The purchase was one of the best products I have ever purchasesd.  I kept going back to listen in my spare time.  I would recommend to all ages and any ethic background.
087349976X|2.0|I was disappointed in this book.  First, a lot of the projects are VERY basic, and similar projects are covered in other books, so if you've read one or two other wireworking books, this will be a repeat.  Since the instructions are not very detailed, so a beginner might find other books more useful.  There were very few projects I would want to wear, though, in all fairness, I found a few good ideas that might inspire me. There are also a few bead stitching projects, something I did not want to see in what I had hoped was a wireworking book. While some obviously liked this book, for the most part, I didn't.
1401216676|3.0|This isn't bad i like the story, it's just missing something if you ask me I'm just not sure what it is. this joker to me was kinda a wuss totally awesome  but he just seemed like he could have been so much better. the best part of the whole book was the end when he beat down batman that part was cool but the story up to it not so great
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|this is my favorite of jodi piccoults books. there were many different elements to the book that kept it interesting. i would highly recommend this book to anyone.
0956010903|5.0|I purchased this as one of my gifts to my mother for Christmas and obviously did not unwrap it.  As she was taking off the paper and opening it, I was amazed at the quality and beauty of the book.  It was just gorgeous! I decided to order one for myself only to discover that they were sold out at the $99.00 price and are now selling from other retailers for over $300!  That's a pretty good investment if you ask me!
0385340990|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much and thought that the use of letters to write it was a wonderful choice.<br />The main female character becomes pen pals in a round about way with residents of the Channel Island, Guernsey. They tell of their literary society and life for them during World War II. Julia, the main character becomes very entrenched in lives of these people, and she soon goes for a visits. She then becomes even more a part of their lives.<br />The stories of the residents survival during the war are sometimes sad and all the time heartwarming. But what they had was their literary society, and this kept their spirits up when things did not look good.<br />My favorite character would probably be Ilsa. She definitely brings an comical and eclectic mix to the group. Reading her letters to Julia and others I found my self thinking what a colorful character to know.<br />The story will definitely tickle your heart strings, but there are definite moments of laughter.<br />A really beautiful story that would make a great movie. A definite read!<br />And now I fell I must find a way to the Channel Islands!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Now, for someone who almost missed the horrible boat, I am happy that JINX saved me.  I got the newsletter, which came to me on the day Act 3 was released, and wondered what this Dr. Horrible thing was all about.  I went to the web site, and saw the three acts online, and watched them, when they were up for free.  I loved the songs, I loved the story.  I watched all three acts, and became close to obsessed.  I started telling friends to watch, promoting the featurette.  So, when I heard a DVD was coming, I had to get it, and placed my pre-order.  On a further note, let me break it down by parts:    The Featurette Itself    The actual Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog is excellent.  The story is funny, the sets are cool, especially since it was done in some guy's house, made up by Monster House.  The songs are clever, funny, catchy, and addicting.  I thought that every actor in it was perfect for their part.  Felicia plays Penny extraordinarily, NPH IS Dr. JHorrible, and Hate was PERFECT for Captain Hammer.  Joss Whedon should take great pride in this project, and be more than satisfied with the finished product.  I can only hope that things half this good come next.    Commentary! The Musical    This was an original diea, which really caught my attention.  I watched the whole thing, not knowing what to expect.  Doing a musical commentary, about a musical, is creative, and great.  Also, it really allows a talent showcase, for those who may have been overlooked.  Stacy's \\"Ten Dollar Solo\\" is a great song, which really shows taht she has a great singing voice.  Zach's song, \\"Zach's Flavor,\\" is also awesome.  I enjoyed this extra as much as the original featurette, and think this alone was worth buying the DVD.  By the way, \\"Ninja Ropes,\\" is hilarious.    Filmmaker's Commentary    I usually have zero interest in hearing what the actors and writers have to say.  I made an exception, and was glad I did.  I enjoyed listening to them talk through the entire thing, and loved hearing their take on the different scenes.  Hearing all the stories, about when they were filming the scenes was hilarious, especially knowing that they did the Bad Horse chorus a few dozen times.  It shows that Nate is a good sport, considering they had him harnessed to the van for half a day.  Also, finding out this was almost done, by the Whedon's, and Maurissa, on a webcam, was an interesting piece of information.  Again, this was another worthwhile quality of the DVD.    ELE Applications    The very first application aws great, and the Zombie Princess, and puppet priest, were also great.  The others really didn't make me laugh, or hold my attention too much.  It actually disappointed me, and made me feel like I shoudl have sent in my own, and I would have, had I had the video equipment to do it.  It is still a worthwhile feature, and I congratulate those who did have their videos shown.    Final Thoughts    I definitely hope to see more of NPH, in projects like this, as I think that he fits in well.  I admit, despite her being engaged, I think, that I am officially in love with Felicia.  I'm even her friend on Facebook.  Ha-ha.  Anyway, I really do believe that every single person, who worked to make this project a reality, deserve nothing but the highest of praise.  I thank Joss Whedon for his hard work, and dedication to the business, showing that not everyone in Hollywood is just in it for the money.  So, with all of that said, I hope that anyone, who was not quite convinced to buy the DVD is now, and that you will buy it.  It is more than worth every penny, and is a very important part of my 1,000+ DVD collection.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|Lord, I love this band.    Keane's third full-length CD is a fairly daring departure from their first two.  Synthesizer effects and 1980's-style electropop sounds abound, as several other reviewers have noted.   But attempting to pigeonhole the music, it seems to me, leaves something out - namely, that no matter what the style, Keane brings to it their incomparable melodic sense and their gift for the emotionally stirring.      The record isn't quite as hummable as their debut \\"Hopes and Fears,\\" but then what record is?  Upon first listen to this one, my first impression was that it was the weakest of the three albums, but by the third listen, I found the pieces as fully infectious as those on \\"Under the Iron Sea,\\" which is for my money their greatest.  With each of Keane's terrific discs, we're talking in shades of five stars.    Unquestionably, there are some choices, particularly in the first couple of tracks, that are off-putting.  I think in particular of a horrid synthesized \\"WHOOO!!\\" that rings in the opener, \\"Spiralling.\\"  An otherwise strong track is badly undermined by sonic effects that sound like they were lifted from a bad dance film circa 1983.       More often than not, however, the counterintuitive choices work.  The third track, \\"Better Than This,\\" begins with a weird, dissonant high synth sound, soon joined by Chaplin singing in a falsetto so high that even his super-elastic voice must strain.  But soon the cut melts into a melodic refrain that is joyous, irresistible and impossible to categorize.  It sounds to me part juju, part Jamaican, definitely World Beat-ish - my wife found it to be purely 1980s retro.  Whatever; it's a distinct, incongruous blend of sounds, and it works.  You'll be singing this one festively in little time.    Generalizations first:  the music here is more complex and textured, certainly than on their first album, and at least as much as on their second.  Piano isn't often used as a straight rhythm instrument here - when itappears, it's usually to add a note of delicacy to a fuller, lusher sound.    Despite the high concentration of up-tempo tunes on the record, the lyrics are fairly bleak, finding Keane often in a state of heartbreak, depression, disappointment or ennui.  It's far from one-dimensional, though; their lyrics are achieving a touch of fine poetry, with the capacity to precisely evoke a distinct moment.    In contrast with their first record, which blasts out of the gate with five unforgettably catchy numbers, Perfect Symmetry has a somewhat reversed flow.  The pieces grow in strength and meaning as the album moves along.  Some of the first few seem a bit quirky, but by the middle of the album and on to the end, Keane is at their gut-wrenching best.    Chaplin is still the finest pop singer around, and on this record really tests the limits of his vocal range and power.  His voice isn't presented \\"up close and personal\\" to the extent of the first two albums, though, so the listener has fewer opportunities just to luxuriate in his timbre.  Still, there are a few cuts on which his voice will leave you gasping.    There are no bad songs on the album; they're all good, and some are truly great, adding to Keane's growing catalogue of classic pop pieces.    Now on to specifics:  two highlights of the album are two gorgeous ballads, \\"Love is the End,\\" and \\"You Don't See Me.\\"  \\"Love is the End\\" is the more intense of the two, and will no doubt be seen as one of Keane's greatest performances.  \\"You Don't See Me,\\" however, has a gentle beauty that is not to be overlooked.    One cut, \\"Black Burning Heart,\\" exemplifies my reaction to this album.  When I first heard it, I shrugged and found it unremarkable.  On second and third listens, however, I found it haunting, perhaps the most emotional on the record, despite its standard up-tempo construct.  This one really sneaks up on the listener; don't overlook it.    Two other standouts are \\"Again and Again,\\" which may be the prototypical track on the record (80's style synth, urgent lyrics, danceable tempo) and \\"Better Than This,\\" described above.    Upon repeat listenings, I find very little to criticize, other than the unfortunate opening to \\"Spiralling,\\" and a sense that the song \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" isn't as portentous as Keane tries to make it sound.  But still - those are both very good tunes.  And for the record, I also like the jovial \\"Pretend That You're Alone.\\"    Keane continues to grow, change, and to deliver the most distinctive, meaningful, exhilarating pop music around.  This is yet another five star recording.
B00001U03Q|5.0|All his best songs are on this, at least the ones I wanted. I highly reccomend this to anyone wanting to experience Eric at his best.
0316172324|3.0|this follow-up to The Tipping Point was a bit of a disappointment. There was a lot of good data in it, but I felt that his entire thesis was flawed. Its all about \\"thinking without thinking,\\" by trusting your \\"gut.\\" Yeah, that always works out... there was some good data about folks who could read emotions by observing facial muscles, and how the mind operates when under stress, but otherwise it wasn't very thoughtful.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|My roomate introduced me to John Mayer's music a couple of year's ago and this was the first record she played for me.  It is wonderful - he is an amazing guitar player and songwriter and is one of my favorites.  Though everyone knows \\"Change The World\\" one of my favorite songs is \\"Belief\\" and its lyrics.
6303983812|4.0|After watching 101 Dalmations about a million times with my son, this is a nice change!  Yes, it's kind of the same story, but with cats in Paris, but still so much better than most of the junk that is being put out now.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I am a Twilight fan who read the books and saw the first movie.  I am a fan of some of the bands on the soundtrack so when I heard it, I knew I wanted it!  First song on the soundtrack is awesome, great way to start off the CD.  Paramore's songs and Rob's song are my favorite.  You have to listen a little harder to the lyrics on Rob's song, but nonetheless, still sweet!  Recommend to Twilight fans!
B001EYGOG0|3.0|I wanted to really get excited over this release, since I really like jazz big bands doing holiday music - with or without singers.  At 37 minutes and 6 seconds, this CD reminds me of an LP and is very short on music.  The Basie band is \\"featured\\" on only 6 of the 11 tracks and is very subdued.  As described on the \\"Making Of\\" DVD, Tony Bennett has his own tempo - and this is a tempo different from the normal Basie band tempo.  This \\"Making Of\\" DVD also has the Basie band working with Bennett on \\"A Christmas Song\\" for a brief segment, but this chart is not on the CD for whatever reason.  The Deluxe edition (apparently only available at Target) has a \\"Live in Concert\\" DVD add on in addition to the \\"Making Of\\" DVD that covers only 4 of the Basie charts with Bennett (genereously considering that \\"My Favorite Things\\" is a Christmas song).    I would really want to give any Basie & Bennett collaboration all the stars possible, but with the Basie band on a little more than half the songs, with the 37 minutes of music around half of a normal CD, and with the music coming across as half of what it is capable of being, 3 stars is quite generous.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Another great purchase: My son had come home from a friend's house in the beach area.<br />He an a friend of mine drove to 3 stores searching for this dvd and came up empty.<br />I suggested that we try Amazon: there it was and in less than a week it was in our friends mailbox and in perfect condition. It was an Amazon item as apposed to another vendor. It's very rare to have any difficulties shopping on Amazon.<br />Thank you again.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|The minute I put this CD in, I felt happy and rocked to every song.  She has a passion for writing, singing and conveying her message through her music.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|The Star Wars motion picture saga told the story of one Anakin Skywalker.  The Clone Wars is here to tell the stories of other Jedi and of the clones.  To a lesser extent, The Clone Wars fills in the gaps and answers some of the many questions the motion pictures failed to explain. As someone who has been a fan of the saga since day one in May 1977, I always wanted more than Lucas was ever able to provide on the big screen.     The focus of The Clone Wars is the clones.  This movie, and the 30 minute episodes shown every week on The Cartoon Network, go to great pains to show us the clones are individuals with their own personalities and quirks.  They realize they are just Bantha fodder in the great Republic war machine, yet they fight and die without question.  If you're hurt, just a bit, every time a clone dies... that was point of this exercise.    Not only do we learn of the clones, but also of the other Master Jedi.  The Sith and the Separatists are explored in great detail.  The Separatist droids provide the comic relief.  You'll recognize Lucas's dated corny-ness in every moronic thing the droids say.      If you don't like it, no big deal.  Go watch the original triology on Laser Disc and enjoy.  Star Wars is George's story done George's way... not yours, mine or ours to tell.  The Clone Wars isn't perfect.  Some parts are down right annoying.  I've changed a lot since May 1977... and so has Star Wars.
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|Great addition to the Viva La Vida.  Some of the songs sound more like the old Coldplay tunes.  The Jay-Z cut of \\"Lost\\" is great too - I like that any artist can mix with the ever changing beats of Coldplay songs.
0156034565|4.0|Economic development is a complex, culture-based activity.  There are many reasons to have economic development; there are perhaps as many different means towad economic development.  This insightful and entertaining story portrays some of these reasons and means.  The setting is water-short, conservative Yemen.  This alone is worth the read.  The development theme is one of introducing salmon in Yemen.  Read this book to have some laughs, to reflect on ironies, to ponder the difficulty of change in our world.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I am not one for buying American Idol cd's but this one caught my attention.  He had more of a rock edge to his sound which I liked.  It took me a couple times listening to the CD to appreciate each song.  The first time around, they all sounded similar.  Give it a chance like I did and you'll be a fan.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Would have to be one of my all time favourite classics. It has everything to offer in a movie. Julie Andrews at her best. A movie that would never be out dated. The first scene in particular, flowing over the mountain ranges to the green hills where Maria (Julie Andrews) is standing, is an ever lasting image.
B001CTA1S4|5.0|One may be initially drawn to Doubt because of the star power of Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, or even Amy Adams. About ten minutes into this phenom of a movie, you become drawn into this tale and await the thespian standoff you just know is coming. And what a treat it is!<br /><br />Sometimes, plays that become movies, despite the authors attempt to \\"open it up\\", just end up looking like a filmed play, static and overly talkative. John Patrick Stanley, who authored the play, clearly knows his stuff. The screenplay sparkles with the spoken gems of the stage production, yet moves through the screenplay with panache and vigor. He quietly allows us to get to know these formidable characters, their strengths and weaknesses (if any), and them lets them loose in the story to wreck havoc amongst each other. This is truly a character driven drama.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius Beauvier (realized fully by Streep, and is this the same woman who gave us Donna in [[ASIN:B001GKJ2DO Mamma Mia! The Movie (Two Disc Special Edition)]]?) is a stern and discpline driven principal of St. Nicholas school in the Bronx, run by nuns trying to educate their students and care for their souls. Father Flynn (Hoffman) is a radical new priest which immediately runs into opposition by Beauvier, clinging to the old ways. But this is not merely a new versus old conflict. Stanley interjects another story, one more modern, concerning the revelations of the Catholic Church's decision to hide its abusive priests from the public. Flynn may or may not have done something improper in the rectory with a new black student. Kind Sister James alerts her boss to the suspicion, and, pardon the expression, all hell breaks loose in the school.<br /><br />The brilliance of the script is Stanley never allowing any of his characters to fall into stereotypes. Beauvier cares for her students and fellow nuns, revealing a softer heart than you might think; Sister James is not merely a bubble headed optimist, but truly has depth to her compassion; Flynn has his motives, unspoken as they are.

B000V4UFZK|4.0|This is an all around good scary movie. It scared me as a kid and I still like watching it.
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I know fans of musical artists give 5 stars to anything thier music heroes put out there and get upset when people give lower ratings. However for us more objective consumers this album lacks anything to rave about. It is slow, minimal, boring, depressing, a funeral procession. She should have mixed some uptempo songs into this melancholy slide into the sleep state. It is definately inferior to her first two albums. I gave it 3 stars because there still is that wonderful, comforting, velvet voice of hers that is worth alot by itself. About five of the songs are good and apreciated when played singularly. Only in a rare certain mood would a listen of the entire album be enjoyed. The last song ruins it the most for me. That 12 minute diddy is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. A person almost asleep could have played the drum part. Actually in this case its more of a drum kit whose batteries are almost dead. It's the exact same three drum hits for 12 minutes straight. Then at the end of the song we get nothing but those 3 drum notes for the last 15 seconds, as if we hadn't already had enough of that to pull our fingernails out. Somebody wrote that song and actually thought it was good enough to put on an album for mass consumption. Oh, that was Dido. Well, in the right somber mood you can enjoy some of the songs on this album so it gets 3 stars from me. I think I'm being a half star too generous though. Unless your a huge Dido fan I would be cautious before spending money on this one.
B00008L3U1|5.0|This is such a sweet and touching movie. Robin Williams is a great actor and he played the part of Jack so well. I enjoyed watching this movie with my family.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a great movie about battle, courage, and honor. It incorporates both tremendous victory and dire loss. Russell Crowe does a fabulous job portraying a Roman gladiator and a husband/father who wants nothing more than to return home to his family. The film work and special effects are great and the acting is spectacular. With an R rating, this movie is obviously not OK for kids, but for adult, my husband and I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up!
1594201927|4.0|Quite a good book on money and how it's use has evolved. There are a number of amusing quotes which add a bit of spice to what might otherwise be a rather dry subject matter. A good book on the subject but don't make it your only one.     Gorg

B0013FSL3E|1.0|We had seen the original movie in the theater and had looked forward to seeing it again.  However, we were very disappointed with the disc.  This DVD has scenes cut from the original movie.  There are enough scenes cut that it loses some of the quality that made this movie such a delight.  The version that we bought is the Widescreen Single Disc Edition.  I do not know if this also applies to the BluRay version.

0140277447|5.0|From Kenneth Ellman, Box 18, Newton, New Jersey 07860.  Email: ke@kennethellman.com  Well what can be said. I have read this book more times than I remember over a period of many years. Published in 1997 perhaps it is no longer necessary to give another review. But some books form a bond with your mind and the author and the story become part of you. Iris Chang's story &#34;The Rape of Nanking&#34; is just this kind of book. What it did to the author who later committed suicide we can only imagine. You reread and reread it over many years because it is easy to read (very well written), very well factually supported (so you know it is true) and most important because it is such an extraordinary story the truth of which tells so much about the Japanese but perhaps most significantly about human beings and ourselves.  Importantly it again discusses the well established extraordinary German Nazi hero John H.D. Rabe. You could not make Rabe up in your imagination if you tried. You don't have to though because he, Rabe, is real and true and what he did was saintly. Perhaps this book, this story like other genuine historical facts, truly meets the phrase &#34;the truth is stranger than fiction&#34;. Ironically remember while Rabe the German Nazi, saved Chinese from the Japanese, Sugihara a Japanese diplomat (of whom many books have also been written), not much later on, was saving Jews from Germans.  We want to think we are not like the Japanese of that time and place the same as we want to think we are not like the Germans who manufactured helpless children and adults to death. The terrible killing and military work of soldiers in warfare is not what affects us so much, because inside we expect that and know it is what a soldier is to do and a war to cause. We also know that in war civilians, woman and children, will  die through the natural course of the destruction of countries and cities that warfare brings. That is not what shocks or surprises us.  But it is  the intentional, purposeful and planned killing and torture of so many helpless people that makes us see a different side of what humans are, and what the Japanese were, in this case and what the Germans did in that same time period.  Keep in mind the Japanese are not the Germans. They did not utilize engineering processes to burn and kill. They did not build ovens and chambers with poison gas. As Chang so clearly shows (and most importantly as the historical documentation shows), the Japanese were far more straightforward and simple in their actions. They just militarily conquered this city and then immediately raped, raped, raped and as a policy then burned, tortured and killed the inhabitants. How interesting that the Japanese, in some of the cases, would attempt to force the fathers to rape their daughters and the sons to rape their mothers. This was all done with simple brute military force of guns and bayonets etc. And it was done quickly.  What can we say. These events only define a part of what human beings are capable of. We know both the depths of evil and we also know the extraordinary heights to which human beings can attain. We know that both Rabe and Sugihara were examples of real people who stood against this at great personal risk to themselves.  I read the reviews here and see some challenge the facts of what occurred. Remember, this is not an account of a war from two thousand years ago where we might argue over what occurred. It is an account of a war so recent that it is still almost contemporaneous with our current lives. World War Two is just like yesterday and many of us have or had immediate family who lived through that period of time and served in that war and know what happened. Some are still alive today.  SO, I do find it somewhat strange that there are reviews here that have challenged whether this Japanese destruction and torture of human beings in Nanking even actually occurred. I must assume that such reviews  are knowingly false. In any large event there will always be some dispute of a specific act or incident which occurred in the scope of a massive human turmoil or tragedy. But to argue about whether this occurred at all or is a fabrication, is not an argument. It is merely an effort to escape history and history will not allow such an escape.  Keep in mind that in addition to all of the eye witness accounts, newspapers accounts and both American and Japanese and other documentation, we have the extraordinary event of Rabe sending a detailed report of what occurred to Adolph Hitler and this report is available today to be read.  This type of history along with those human beings who acted so heroically in opposition to these human tragedies such as Rabe and Sugihara, should be part of the curriculum and education of all students. It helps us to teach our children what human beings are capable of in a very gut personal realistic level, the choices people may make and the heights to which they can rise in contrast to the depths to which they can sink. My heart and respect goes out to the family of Iris Chang for this accomplishment by their now deceased daughter. Kenneth Ellman, Box 18, Newton, New Jersey 07860. email: ke@kennethellman.com
0316789798|5.0|I got this book for my son for Christmas, and it looked like fun--the animals in it, though very simply made were incredibly cute--so I just had to try a few of them out before I wrapped it. Soon I was filling page after page with colorful, adorable Emberley-style creatures. Oh my, how sweet they looked! I love the giraffe, the lion, the lady bug,...well, all of them, really.     These guys are going to be my new \\"doodle-bugs\\" instead of my usual lines which I do when I am bored. Everyone will be so impressed at how talented I am! Seriously, Emberley is some kind of genius to work out all these amazing critters to draw.     The animals are colorful (I like to do them in markers best), and are made of just a few basic shapes and lines. Each step in the process (about five steps, I think) is clearly outlined, and fool-proof.     My son likes the book, too. Oh, and he is a college graduate, 23 years old, and he says, \\"all of my friends are artists, but I can't draw at all\\". Pretty much, true. It was sort of a gag-gift, but a real gift at the same time.     You can also give this book to children.

I liked Pulse from David Gilmour but this DVD is as good if not better, Roger plays songs that Gilmour wont, Dogs, Welcome to the Machine, Set the controls for the Heart of the Sun....damn.......great songs. Gilmour wont touch these songs. oh well, great DVD highly recommended.....
1582701709|5.0|In other words, the book is just another version of what some TV preachers have taught for decades, namely, if you will sustain the right thoughts, words, and feelings, you will receive whatever you want. But The Secret adds this important twist: your thoughts can bring anything into your life because you are god.

B00005QW5X|5.0|John Cameron Mitchell is a one-man force of nature here, as actor, director and writer. He'd performed the role many times, but there's a freshness of the futilty of poor Hedwig that can't be denied. As a stage effort, it was slow to gain momentum, and when it was finally established, no one thought it could be done by anyone else. Well, many did, including Ally Sheedy and Sarah Bernhard, and this is all brought out in the extras on the DVD. Mr. Mitchell is in command of this enigmatic, complex character, and one can only sit back in awe of the presentation. Sad, reflective, scorned, hated, abused...it's a character that everyone can identify with.
4789004546|5.0|A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar is basically intended for 1st and 2nd year students and teachers of Japanese for whom the grammatical explanations from textbooks were not good enough.  One common complaint of language textbooks is that they tend to be exhaustive in drilling a small amount of grammar.  This approach seems to be favored by foreign language departments at universities, but has the inherent flaw that it withholds some of the most interesting grammar until the second or third semester, thus leaving beginning students crippled when they want to say certain things.<br /><br />What this book does have:<br />Comprehensive dictionary of \\"grammatical words.\\"  This includes, but is not limited to: particles, qualifiers, special noun/particle constructions, verbs that give other words a different meaning when used in a certain pattern, and verb endings.  The reason I love this book is that it's actually readable, and is not necessarily just a reference.  Look up some obscure usage of \\"o,\\" and you may find yourself reading about the various nuances of using the \\"o ~ ni naru\\" construction or learn a new word in \\"owaru\\".  There are more than 500 pages devoted to this sort of thing, and each entry comes with clear, and detailed explanations, as well as 1-4 (avg. 2) pages of examples and further elaboration.  Particles with multiple meanings are given multiple entries to give each usage ample space to be explained.<br /><br />There are also about 100 pages of basic grammar contained in the introduction and the appendicies.  This includes basic sentence construction (incl. detail about word order tendencies, the parts of a Japanese sentence, pronouns, polite speech and a variety of other subjects) and ensures that the reader will have not just a basic, but a solid fundamental understanding of Japanese grammar.  Additionally, there are appendices for how to use certain words that take irregular particles, counters and how to generally predict the irregular formsthat a given counter takes, which I found helpful.  Each Japanese word in this book is written in romaji, but is also accompanied with its corresponding Kanji, which is also nice.<br /><br />What this book is not:<br />This book is not a short overview of grammar, but nor is it a complete instructional method in itself.  It's intended for people who are already learning to speak Japanese either in a college course, from self study or whatever method, but want more detail about grammar.<br /><br />One thing that disappointed me was that I thought I'd find verb conjugation charts with explanations on how to use each conjugation.  Most textbooks tend to only teach grammar little by little, and even then all the usages may not be listed, so finding everything in the same place would be a plus.  This book lists many verb endings alphabetically, including many of the derived ones like \\"~nakereba naranai\\" which means \\"have to/must (+ verb)\\" but is derived from the \\"if (I) don't ~\\" construction; however, skimming through 500 pages of alphabetical entries which may or may not be verb endings is not what I'd call a convenient verb conjugation chart.<br /><br />I'd like to mark a point off for being a grammar book without a convenient explanation of verb conjugation, but I know of no other book that has such comprehensive examples and explanations on the other topics all in one place.  Definitely a must buy for every student of the language.
B0000AZKLF|4.0|Great music but the talking breaks the spell. Tracks 2,5,7,10 should have been omitted from this album because they are just talk. Four stars because of talking.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I loved the movie Groundhog's day and I was impressed with this version. The DVD has a clearer brighter picture which made the movie that much more enjoyable. I also enjoyed the insight provided by the director, writer,and producer in the bonus features. The way they discuss this unique story line of the man having one day(albeit over and over again) to get it right; I am left with a better deeper enjoyment of the movie. Usually bonus feature ruin the movie's original effect but this time I found the bonus feature to heighten this movie watching experience
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall E is a wonderful and heartwarming film. The collaboration between Disney Studios and Pixar is once again MAGICAL. A muat see! Wall E is a true romantic and sweet little character.

B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is a very cute movie. My daughter loved it. She would watch it every night before bedtime.
B001I82RVS|4.0|From the producers of \\"Machine Girl\\" and \\"Death Trance\\" comes a film that is so outrageously bizarre, full of \\"pink\\" violence, blood-splattering horror effects, TRULY bizarre characters, that will definitely make some people stop the film, others will cheer, but no one can deny that the film is brilliant in a very different and original way. If you think you are ready for \\"TOKYO GORE POLICE\\" then you have another think coming. Once you see the film's opening act of dismembered full frontal nudity with lots of blood and gore, you may get the idea that you are in for something very unusual. So, Do I have your attention yet??<br /><br />In a far distant future, Tokyo's police force have been privatized and they are locked in constant combat with a group of genetically enhanced killers called \\"Engineers\\". These genetically modified super-murderers can bio-infuse their open wounds with weapons, turning self-mutilation into combat form. Ruka (Eihi Shiina, Audition) is the daughter of the police chief's murdered right-hand man, is now the police corporation's top engineer hunter. With cold-blooded efficiency, she cuts through the psychotic engineers and leaves them very dead. Nothing can keep her from her duty, that is until she encounters a mysterious engineer called the \\"key man\\" and she learns the truth behind her father's death.<br /><br />\\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" is the directorial debut of Yoshihiro Nishimura, the same man who is responsible for the effects and make up for \\"Machine Girl\\", the man had brainstormed with Sion Sono for \\"Strange Circus\\", and if those two films are any indication, you can imagine just how outrageous and chaotic this film can get. I am at a lost for words, this film had left me almost speechless. Nishimura definitely pulled out all the stops in his debut film, but unlike \\"Machine Girl\\" which felt almost like a humorous, gore-riddled stunt show, \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" manages to execute everything with a straight face and what you will get is something no one would expect. The film is a thematic affair, and the film is very dark--in a very pleasant way.<br /><br />Amid all the brutality, dismemberment, blood and a whole lot of GORE, the film has a commentary on the excesses of society that may lead to its collapse. The TV commercials give a hint of the film's current popular culture with the products they sell. Apparently, suicide and self-mutilation is the \\"in\\" thing amid the teens and video game consoles such as the Wii have games that allow the player to mutilate and kill within the comfort of one's own home. The film also borrows the element from \\"Robocop\\" regarding the idea of a corporation that runs a city's police force. The police force's uniform bears a resemblance to ancient samurai armor and western elements. (except for Ruka, who wears a sexy uniform--somewhat dominatrix style). The self-mutilation idea may have been lifted from Cronenberg via \\"Existenz\\" and the film's look and feel is definitely anime-inspired; the imagery may have a little bit of a comic \\"bookish\\" atmosphere.<br /><br />The film definitely has a lot of things to say and it would be very easy for the viewer to shut off his brain and let the violent (if campy) imagery just wash over him. The film has its share of outrageous and oddball characters; there's a freaky bondage club, there's a snail woman (who may be a Yokai character), there`s even some hinted S & M. Then if we begin to talk about shocking images and gore, then nothing to this day may equal \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\". Blood just drops like a strong rainfall; there're boobies that spew acid and ones with teeth, one man has  literally a cannon for his male genitalia, a huge deathtrap of a female genitalia, organic bullets, knives, blades, brains being cut open, penises being bitten off--you name it, this film has it. The film is remarkably INSANE.<br /><br />The action scenes are quite reminiscent of \\"Machine Girl\\" but dare I say, it does succeed where the former failed. A bazooka and splattering blood are used to propel oneself that adds somewhat to its silliness and outrageousness. These are not negative comments but the film lives and stays aloft on this style. There are some uses of slow-motion in the action, and it is not so much as how hard-hitting it is, as to how bloody and gory one action scene may get. The make-up efx go from a pure \\"camp\\" to quite bizarre with the blood splattering all over the place including the camera view. (it does minimize CGI blood and uses old-fashioned prosthetics and red ink). The film's tone takes on some serial killer elements to a cautionary tale of fascistic and social paranoia with restrained aggression, with some competitive subtle quips about China and Japan.<br /><br />The film's plot may not be complex, and the screenplay isn't without its flaws. Some of its elements may seem a little tiresome after awhile but it does display director Nishimura's potential as a filmmaker. Keep in mind that this is first directorial assignment, and it is no fault of his that some of the film's storytelling is unrefined and feels a little convoluted. Eihi Shiina is very fitting as the film's lead. The woman is as cold and emotionless as in \\"Audition\\". However, Shiina exhibits a particular type of sex appeal that's both frightening and alluring. Ruka's character is a woman sworn to her duty and manages to shut off almost everything in this chaotic Tokyo. Her past is told in the form of flashbacks (as with most of the film's character developments) and her one link to order and sanity is her relationship to a kindly bar owner (Ikuko Sawada).<br /><br />\\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" wasn't exactly what I expected but boy, it was one fun ride. It was far more than I wanted to see or prepared myself for. The film is definitely NOT FOR EVERYONE, the film delivers its outright silliness and \\"mutated campiness\\" with a serious tone; that while it may seem funny--once you take it all in, it is a lot DARKER and bizarre than what it was at first impression. This type of film just doesn't give a smile nor will it get a thumbs up from mainstream audiences--you know why? Because of all the cut-off limbs, mutated and disemboweled body parts, the film would probably have everything torn away in PURE Bloody fashion. The only thing the film may be missing is a \\"rainbow\\", only instead of colors it would be made from blood.<br /><br />Again, watch it if you dare....<br /><br />Recommended Timidly but a HIGHLY Recommended rating to fans of Japanese cinema and Blood/Gore.<br />[4- Stars]<br /><br />Note: There is a very strong hint that this is Yoshihiro Nishimura's first installment of blood and gore.<br />Video/audio: 1.77 ratio anamorphic widescreen.

B001GM28HO|4.0|This CD is good not great. It needs some work. The songs all sound alike. But it is still really good CD. She has a great voice but Once again she needs to branch out I await her next CD.
B0012Q732O|1.0|10,000BC? The story could've been set any time any place - and has been, and has been told far, far better in many other movies. Guy loses girl; guy fights to get girl back; guy gets girl. And that's probably all the script itself said, considering the quality of acting and dialogue.    But my biggest problem with this pile of garbage is the marketing. When you look at the packaging, you see a guy going up against a monstrous saber-tooth tiger. And again on the back of the case they show this creature. You think, wow, this must be man battling the hellish monsters of old. With today's CGI that could've been so cool. Instead, the tiger is in the movie for about 60 seconds - there's no battle, the thing doesn't even bloody its claws.     Oh, there's a few mammoths that stampede, yeah. But when you compare that to the similar elements in the climax battle of Return of the King, it's an absolutely pitiful scene.    The only saving grace is the giant bird scene. If the movie could have developed along similar lines it could really have been a great movie. It's this few minutes that give it the one star, otherwise I'd have complained about not having a zero star option!    The marketing is a con. Don't be suckered. Let this garbage rot then maybe the producers will get the message and give us something decent to watch next time out.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|Anyone on here who gave this horrible remake of a classic movie more than 1 star hasn't seen the original!  Terrible script with a few of the classic lines from the original movie thrown in(and certainly don't work in this version, either) a decent cast who struggle with this trash, it stinks from beginning to end.  Not even a few shining moments....so disappointing.  It does prove that the writers, directors and actors of today can't hold a candle to those from the golden era of film.  Watch the original if you want to see a classic, funny and well acted from beginning to end.  This version sucks, plain and simple!
B000W1V5VU|1.0|Okay, if your idea of a good movie is one in which you get to do nothing more than swoon at the male lead, this must be your dream movie. On the other hand, if you like your movies to have a story, character development, suspense, intrigue, action, great dialogue, interesting locations... well, just about anything other than a hunk to stare at, you are seriously out of luck here!    This is a truly abysmal movie. Not least because the writers/director/producers just went through the motions. For example, on countless occasions the characters tell us about some absolutely impossible problem they're up against and yet, within seconds, they've overcome that 'impossible' problem with almost no difficulty or thought. There is never any 'will they succeed or won't they' suspense created. There is no action to speak of. There is no intrigue surrounding the characters or story. There is not cunningly elaborate scam. As for character development? Okay, you don't always need a great deal of that to make a great movie, but here there's just squat! Really, the characters all appear - all cardboard - go through the motions with a plot that gives them nothing to work with, then the movie finishes. That's it.    This is one of the worst movies of recent times. It offers nothing. The only people who may like it are those who are easily satisfied by being able to drool over Clooney, Pitt, or Damon for an hour or two.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Great Series - This collection is well done and includes lots of extras and behind the scenes.  All the seasons are good but the first one is essential!!  You really discover the basis of the main characters and how they came to be the Dean and Sam of the currect episodes.  I just became a fan recently and was so glad I went back and bought the seasons to catch up.
B0000042MY|5.0|This soundtrack is awesome.  If you aren't familiar with the soundtrack from the movie but you like violins and drums in a celtic-like style then this is for you.

But he is flagrantly dishonest about his alleged atheism: in an interview to a Brazilian newspaper, when    asked if God is obsolete, he answered that \\"when science will be able to explain the universe as a whole, God will be obsolete\\". So, as science will not be able to explain the universe \\"as a whole\\" in a foreseeable future (probably never, I think) for Dawkins, God is not obsolete, and will not be for very long! He confirms this view in his book, when he discusses \\"The poverty of agnosticism\\", proposing a \\"spectrum of probabilities about the existence of God\\", featuring 7 classes of belief, class 1 being the churchgoing believer and class 7 the full atheist (!) and placing himself in class 6 as \\"very low probability but short of zero, \\"de facto\\" atheist\\". As weird as it may sound, can there be a \\"de facto\\" atheist, os is he just a \\"very weak believer\\"??? His claim the be \\"attacking God, all gods, and everything supernatural wherever and whenever it may or may be invented\\" sounds totally untrue, deceitful! So, when he shows himself \\"fighting against all sorts of belief\\" he is actually keeping (exactly like Pascal) the door \\"just slightly open\\" for something \\"else\\", turning his \\"crusade\\" into a pantomime! I wonder how nobody else, as far as I know, noticed this flagrant contradiction, as I never saw it mentioned in any of the books reviews.                                                               By the way, his claim to be fighting for the \\"liberation of humanity from all sorts of belief\\" seems extremely stupid to me, as the ambiguity of our human condition clearly requires \\"cruthes\\" and \\"cranes\\" and some sort of \\"hope\\" for the overwhelming majority of people, and it does help them to withstand their difficulties and suffering. Where are those many believers supposed to go? Oh yes, it is very important to keep religions out of government and education,but it is useless to do it in his rather intolerant absolutist way. Real atheists will always be a minority of humanity, not to be opposed...but Richard Dawkins is certainly not one of us! [...]

I should also mention that I like all types of movies, meaning not just Hollywood blockbusters, but this one left much to be desired.      Quirky, yes.  Interesting, no.  Fortunately I caught this one on cable and I would not buy it nor would I pay to rent it either.   Forgive me if this review is in disagreement with the others that rave about the film, but I just did not like it.

0375826726|1.0|If you are a patient person, this book is worth a read, especially if you liked the first two books.  However, it becomes very apparent that Paolini's creative process is starting to diminish.  I hope it is not forever, because I really think that Paolini has potential.  Paolini is young, and I think this hurts him, as the insight he projects into the book feels borrowed; not his own.  You all know of books that engage the reader to the point that the characters come alive and seem to act of their own will?  This book struggles with that, and at times when I read the dialog, I loose sight of the character, and all I see is Paolini struggling in front of a word processor.  In order to make the story enjoyable, I had to mentally edit the content and change words and phrasing so that the story came back to fruition.  This book feels capitol, in that it was pushed for market too soon before it could naturally create itself.  An author should never impose his will on the characters, he should allow them to thrive through his hand.  This is the tell-tale of a good writer. Paolini has this potential, but if keeps succumbing to external pressure he will fade away as a good writer.  I for one am not too critical because paolini was rushed into the spot light.  It is hard to deal with success.  Book three shows that Paolini is struggling.  Future publications will tell if Paolini pulls out of it, because if he keeps writing books like this one, he will loose his audience.
B00139XZF4|4.0|As I am sure many people, I am not a part of the breed of fans that have read the book and then hastily decided to check out the film. In fact, until this film arose, I had never heard of anything-called \\"The Golden Compass\\" so it is quite an interesting film. After all a film that stars both Daniel Craig and the wonderful Nicole Kidman, regardless of whether I've read the book or not I was going to see this film.<br /><br />I have to be perfectly honest and tell you that although it was a good bit of fun with a very out there premise. Set in an alternate universe where, rather than a persons soul being encapsulated within their body it manifests itself as an animal form outside the body known as Daemons. The main character Lyra is fascinated by a presentation she accidentally stumbles upon by her uncle Asriel about mysterious particles known as Dust, which is apparently a way of transporting between universes.<br /><br />Her uncle is due to travel North in search of these particles, but holding no hope of going with him, she is asked to travel north with a very mysterious woman known only as Mrs. Coulter as her personal assistant. During that time, she comes into possession of the mysterious Golden Compass, which allows her to see all truths along with her companions also such as her Daemon and a large ferocious polar bear.<br /><br />Even before its release, thanks to the oppressive Magisterium in the film. The Golden Compass brought in unwanted controversy as it was believed that the Magisterium was a religious undertone relating to the Catholic Church. I suppose really that unless your child is extremely intelligent, that controversy and \\"message\\" means pretty much nothing to them.<br /><br />Due to it being a high budget fantasy film it required a lot of CGI and let me be honest and say, sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not. In one of the ways it did not, work was the attempting interaction between the actors and their chosen daemon. It was especially apparent when Kidman's character hit her daemon and then attempted to apologise by hugging it. The mix between reality and CGI did work, but the faults were noticeable, but it is passable due to what it did achieve. The fight scene between a King bear and Lyras polar bear companion was also another way in which the CGI worked very well. The look of the bears was spot on and quite realistic at some points the fighting was intense and very attractive.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the whole thing was the superbly frightening acting by Nicole Kidman. Her role as Mrs. Couter was something to be experienced and she really plays the role of a manipulative evil \\"ice queen\\" of sorts very well. Daniel Craig, although not a particularly prominent role, still managed to make the movie special and hold my interest. After all, I could not expect anything less as he is one of the reasons I decided to watch this in the first place.<br /><br />It was a wonderful fantasy film and about the only thing I have negative to say about it is in relation to the Daemons. From what I saw there seemed to be no explanation as to why the Daemons took the shape they did. Lyra's Daemon was that of a cat most of the time but took different shapes from time to time. Mrs. Couters Daemon was that of a golden monkey and Uncle Asriels was a tiger.<br /><br />Other than that little discrepancy, there is honestly nothing to complain about with this picture.hit her daemon and then attempted to apologise by hugging it.

0060557818|4.0|I've only read a couple of Gaiman books before, so i can't say how well this stacks up to his corpus in general, but as a relative outsider I liked (though not loved) it.<br /><br />The Pro's: It's fast-paced, and held my interest. The setting was intriguing, and I liked the characters -- especially the antagonists. It even made me chuckle in a few places, which helped lighten the otherwise dark mood that is the general tone of the book.<br /><br />The Con's: The plot structure reminded me of an old computer game: each stage is essentially a quest to get to the next part, and this format came dangerously close to wearing out its welcome. Also, there are a **couple** of major plot-holes in the story, though I won't discuss them as they are spoilers. Admittedly, they didn't immediately jump out at me: I had to reflect upon the situation after-the-fact to realize \\"um, wait a second...\\" so I don't know how much of a speed-bump they will be to other readers. Even then, it could be a misunderstanding on my part: this novel seems to have an internally-consistent logic EXCEPT when the plot dictates otherwise and it's \\"convenient\\" for something to happen. I kind of have a low threshold for that sort of thing, but others probably will be more forgiving.<br /><br />Overall, the book's positives outweigh the negatives, so I conditionally recommend it to people who like dark, off-beat quasi-fantasy fodder. If nothing else, it's a fast read and holds the reader's interest, so give it a go.
0930289234|5.0|The only real reason I read WATCHMEN is because I saw a preview for it during a watching of the Dark Knight and realized I have never read this particular book before. So a purchase was in order if I was ever to watch the movie with some dignity and understanding.<br /><br />And displeased I was not. This is by far the darkest, yet most appropriate superhero graphic novel I have ever read. The artistry is phenomenal, each detail in the book has a very significant meaning. Each character even has a very fulfilling storyline.<br />I sear not say anything about this wondrous piece of literature than that anyone who likes comics has to read this one, if almost by necessity.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This is one of those albums where EVERY SONG IS AMAZING!<br /><br />Hints of Nickleback and Daughtry tinged songs will make fans of both swarm to the kitchen to get a little taste of this album!<br /><br />DECLARATION: Starts off quiet and then builds to a little more of a louder rocker anthem song.<br /><br />HEROES: Another rocker song, with edgy guitars keeping rhythmn as that classic David Cook signature sound comes through.<br /><br />LIGHT ON: Rock ballad about breakup and words I am sure we can all identify with. David explores his more raw scratchy voice, that we all love!<br /><br />COME BACK TO ME: (my favorite) breakup song with the guy saying he will let her go to find herself and then she can 'come back to me'. Beautifully put together lyrics about love. I absolutely LOVE the break in the middle, where it builds up and the drums get a little solo! I rewound that part over and over! (it's around 2:24).<br /><br />LIFE ON THE MOON: Deeper vocals on this one, very poppy song again, about relationships. Nothing really about what the title suggests!<br /><br />BAR-BA-SOL: Wasn't that the name of a shaving cream?! Edgy guitars chew up this song. Chorus sounds like it is going to go off in the direction of cheesy harmonic song of the 80's, then edges off! A little rock-n-rollish.<br /><br />MR. SENSITIVE: Effortless singing as always from David. He is just SO good! Held out note in the chorus, make this song one of the more 'quiet' rock songs.<br /><br />LIE: A rock ballad, double vocals in harmony throughout the entire song. a nice easy-going song.<br /><br />I DID IT FOR YOU: Anthemy song with a catchy chorus. This song didn't do much for me.<br /><br />AVALANCHE: Again, another song with an interesting naturistic title! Slower, more acoustic sounding, especially in the beginning of the song.<br /><br />PERMANENT: The only song that opens up with a piano on the album. Strings blend in and offer up a bare bones song with David's edgy power vocals cutting through this very beautiful ballad.<br /><br />A DAILY ANTHEM: A bit of a strange song, where in the middle of the chorusy chorus crazy guitars come in and play random notes it seems. Definitely an 'anthem' song. Can you say \\"oh-oh-oh-oh\\", that is pretty much all you need to know for this song!<br /><br />THE TIME OF MY LIFE: Probably thanking American Idol in this song! He should have ended the album with A Daily Anthem, considering how it ends. But oh well, I didn't produce this!<br /><br />Who should buy it?

B000VUQ4HW|5.0|This was the 1st time I have ever seen this movie all the way through.  I am more of a fan of current newer dracula than older but this movie really changed my mind and has my respect.  I had seen clips as a child and remembered it being a favorite amongst many people.  I have recently gotten back into old films and find myself enjoying them more now than when I was younger.  Nosferatu and I mean the version from Kino has great film quality and I was amazed at how well it looked.  I have seen some really bad transfers from companies I guess trying to make a dollar and have them look like a mess.  Every movie so far I have seen from Kino has exceptional quality and so far I am happy with them.  I know people are picky about their favorites and I don't know much about the films history but it looked great in this version.  The sound was good as well with I think it was three separate audio tracks.  I have heard people get mad when the movies they like are transferred and look like garbage.  I enjoyed watching the camera tricks of the twenties and how the film was pieced together.  This movie is not for everyone and I know I could not watch this with my younger neices and nephews and have them have an appreciation for it.  The frights from this wont make you jump or anything but its great to see where movies come from and how far they have come.  This movie is a classic horror and it will go in my collection as such and though some people would hate it I find myself impossible to do so.  I see why now it was a favorite amongst my peers when I was a kid.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have never seen Metropolis before but this genre of old classic films really intrigue me especially the silent films.  I saw all the reviews of Metropolis and figured it might be worth a see.  This company Kino always deliveries quality in their movies and as I watched this one I was happy to see a nice picture without a bunch of distortion or fuzz.  The audio is 5.1 surround sound and it sounds great.  The music is very good and it really captures the mood of whats going on.<br /><br />I don't know what the original was like but I am very happy with what I saw and heard.  Like I said this is my 1st time seeing this so I don't know whats missing or what versions are available or whatever.  Most movies from the silent era never really grab me as much as this film did.  What is going on onscreen really captivated me and I was amazed at the time it came out and what it had accomplished.  For being such an old movie it was still enjoyable for me to watch today so I know it will be a classic favorite in my collection.  The subtitles when active give a somewhat glimpse of whats trying to be conveyed and some stuff I would never of thought of like seeing doors shut behind people as a relevance to something.  The subtitles are very helpful if you have no idea of what you are watching or even if you do the insights are still a very nice extra.<br /><br />Though the special features are a little light it does give a little insight into the restoring process.  There is also a documentary that goes into the German film industry at that time and scenes that were left out.  These extra features though kind of short but still were interesting to watch.<br /><br />Odds are if you don't like silent films or films that require a open mind to whats going on or even a respect for the time period you probably won't like it at all.  There is a lot of weird imagery going on so you kind of have to think sometimes about what is happening and if it has some other meaning.  I found the subtitles to help in this regard.  Overall I know some people would not have patience for a silent movie nor care for them but I have a great respect for older films and when I find one that I enjoy I know its worth my five star rating.  Everyone should see it at least once either for love or hate.itles to help in this regard.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is the series that just keeps on giving. It's amazing how some things in politics just never seem to change. Shows that where written 10 years ago still seem to be politically and news currant.  7 season's with 154 episodes that won 26 Emmy Awards including 4 Best Drama Series, who but the most hardened right wing conservative nut, could argue that this wasn't the best non-violent drama series never.. Watching this series will teach, as well as entertain you about the inner circle of presidential politics. From political fights, smear campaigns, appointees to pardons. A great cast from start to finish.. This series has it all..         I always liked this show, but because it aired mostly before my DVR days, I missed a lot of shows, and you really can't enjoy it as much when you're skipping episodes. I now have a DVD player devoted strictly to the West Wing Series. It's so great watching one great episode after another commercial free..    I'm sure you'll be happy with this series, no matter what you pay for it, this set will be worth it...
0316017922|5.0|Few would argue against the notion that to be successful, a person would have to be talented enough in an area of expertise to attain mastery, or that a lot of hours have to go into practice in any field.    What is surprising to learn from Malcolm Gladwell's book is the degree to which the events surrounding a talented person's beginnings play into his or her success or failure. By now, knowing the history or women and persons of color, we ought not be so surprised, but the cultural folktale of the \\"self made\\" individualist is hard to shake.    In the face of some legitimate criticism made elsewhere (does Mr. Gladwell \\"smooth the curve\\" a bit much?), this book is still very much worth reading. It makes the convincing case that success isn't what we think it is, and that there are specific, practical and achievable ways we might create opportunity for those with talent who aren't lucky to be born into a societal context that allows their hard work and ability to flourish, and not go wasted.    Along the way, the reader will absorb some very interesting facts.

B000NA28I4|1.0|This is the first time that I can ever remember that I walked out of the theatre angry.  I had loved the book and found that the movie completely botched the story.  The producers added things that were rediculous and removed characters and scenes that are vital for the book.  I know that they were just trying to make it more view friendly (such as adding the love interest between Arya and Eragon) but the book sold well without this and I felt that it drastically diminished Arya's character. Even if I had not read the book, I would still be disappointed with this movie.  A lot of questions are not answered and the flow was very poor.
0316017922|3.0|I was incredibly excited to get my hands on Outliers after reading both Blink and Tipping point in years past. I often call Gladwell my favorite author.<br /><br />However, his 3rd book is a poor followup to his past best sellers. In short, this book seems forced. Like he wrote it only because his fans expected another book from him, not because he was passionate about the subject.<br /><br />There are 2 sections of this book and they couldn't be more different. I struggled to transition from the first to the second which really took away from my enjoyment of reading.<br /><br />I will say that the individual topics he writes about are interesting, but he just doesn't dive deep enough. That deep dive compared to other authors writing on similar subjects is what I came to love about Gladwell, and it is flat out missing from this book.<br /><br />If you have read his past work you will probably be disappointed by this attempt. If you are new to Gladwell you will probably find some enjoyment in this book. It is more Freakonomics than it is Blink. That is, it's more amateur than it is professional.

0142001104|3.0|\\"The Art of Possibility\\" was a bit \\"out there\\" for me, somewhat whoo-whoo, New Agey.  It would probably benefit from a second reading.  The Art of Possibility is co-authored by Benjamin and Rosamund Zander. Mr. is the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra.  His wife Rosamund is a family counselor.  From these disparate disciplines they bring a framework that attempts to shift the way your approach life problems, viewing challenges as opportunities.      I read this book after I heard it being recommended by Jason Womack, a productivity coach.  I heard a snippet of a lecture given by Benjamin Zander.  Intrigued, I got a copy of \\"The Art of Possibility.\\"    I found the book encouraging but somewhat lacking in specific action steps for the reader to take.  Team Zander does a good job of offering specific anecdotes about how they had in different problematic circumstances reframed problems into opportunities.  Applying these tactics to our own lives encapsulates the challenges in \\"The Art of Possibility.\\"

There is coverage of India, China, Middle East and America, however, such coverage were quite short and very cursory compared to the fairly detailed chapters on anything that happened in Europe.  That being said, it is still a good read, especially for children starting to learn history.  Just keep in mind that it is not a broad perspective and it needs to be supplemented in the future.

The recording sessions for Let It Be were finished before 1970 and were recorded the same time during the sessions for the album, \\"Abbey Road\\". By 1969 The Beatles had wanted to get back to there roots like many other bands at the time. Let It Be is like the part two to Abbey Road being just as good, except for some reason Let It Be gets a really bad rap though its a good album.<br /><br />  The album was mainly recorded live and some songs recorded on there famous rooftop peformance, the songs that were recorded live from that were, \\"I Dig A Pony\\", \\"One After 909\\", and \\"Get Back\\". Let It Be is filled with great songs and an album that should be bought by all Beatles fans everywhere so the fans can hear how it all ended.

0143038419|3.0|I started reading this book months ago and I was very excited about the first part in Italy. I thought she was a very compassionate, human person, who I really identified with. However, once she got to the Ashram, I stumbled and felt very sorry for her, but in a less than comapssionate way. I had a hard time getting through the self doubt, postulating, incredibly sad person she wrote about and put the book down--for months. I recently picked it up and was able to get through India and found the journey and time spent in Indonesia a little easier to understand and she became more identifiable to me. I don't really get the medicine guy's importance, because she quickly threw him over for the boyfriend. In the end, I don't understand what she running from, she never really conveyed what was so miserable about her life that wasn't self inflicted. I wish there were 1/2 stars, because this is between a 2 and 3.

B000OPPBEQ|1.0|Extremely disappointed! I'm a big fan of the trilogy, but this so called Blu-ray version is nothing more than a regular DVD.  There were moments when the movie had qualities of a Blu-ray, but would return back to the disappointment that it originally was.     I put in another Blu-ray movie to see to see the difference in picture quality, and boy was their a difference.  Try playing the Bee Movie right after you just watched the first couple of scenes of the Matrix, and you'll see the disparity of the two films.  Seriously save your money, this is just another scheme to rip off the average household of its hard earned money.  Another gimmick by Corporate America to make more money, and keep their stock holders happy, not worth a penny.     If your intent on buying the film contact me and I'll gladly sell it off to you on ebay.  Terrible.....just terrible.

B000683VI4|4.0|It's easy to just sort of shrug this movie off at first glace as a classic \\"girls\\" movie, but the actors, especially Gosling and McAdams make this film special.  The chemistry between these two is electric, so rare in movies these days, and Garner and Rowling are good as well.  I really was not a fan of Gosling before this, but in The Notebook he exudes charm and he really makes you root for him.  The movie, though long, really never wains, the pace is evermoving and the leads keep it interesting.  There are few moves by McAdams character that make you puzzled and certain other characters are a bit, uh too charatible to be believed, but you really dont care because your so vested in the out come of the leads.  If your looking for a romantic movie, that will touch your heart than you wont be disappointed in this film.  If this movie does not make a tear run down you face, then you need to get to a cardiologist and have him check you for a heart.
B00008BRBG|4.0|As assured a rock debut as any, these enforcers blazed onto the scene with a potent combination of bristling energy, cultured chops, and undeniable chemistry. Even when more straight ahead neo-punk structures take the foreground, one cannot help but to feel moved, particularly with Copeland's outstandingly crisp beat-keeping.
B001KZG99A|3.0|I was very excited to know that i can watch this movie for 99cent but the down side was that it was cut off towards the end and now i would have to either rent the movie from itunes or just watch on cox demand. Thanks amazon you have come true again!

031606792X|5.0|The publication of Breaking Dawn, the fourth book in Stephenie Meyer's vampire saga, was met with a firestorm of protest in some quarters. Disgruntled readers, unhappy with the direction the story takes in book four, tried to organize a campaign against the book, urging others who were unhappy with the novel after reading it to return it. The strategy would effectively rob Meyer and her publisher of royalties that they had earned legitimately from the book's sale. The response, a bit of childish foot-stamping, is ridiculous: readers aren't guaranteed a plot that pleases them or their money back. And the protesters' desire to punish Meyer--an author who has presumably pleased them over the course of the series' first 1800-odd pages--is mean-spirited and distasteful.<br /><br />The response is also difficult to understand. Breaking Dawn offers the most exciting plot of the tetralogy, and it ties the story together nicely. The book's conclusion is both satisfying and sensible. And the book is at least as well-written as previous installments in the series: that is, if readers didn't enjoy Meyer's prose in the first place, they shouldn't have made it as far as book four to complain about it.<br /><br />In some ways, the relationships in the book evolve along old-fashioned lines. A soap opera's worth of modern-day issues are addressed in the midst of a vampire's coven, but in the end life is defended against darkness; love and the conventions of marriage triumph; and familial bonds are strengthened. It's just that the family that forms in these pages is an untraditional one. This is all very vague, as summaries go, but I don't want to give anything away. In short, I think Breaking Dawn is the best book in Meyer's series. Don't let the fringe lunatics dissuade you from giving it a shot.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel

0756404746|5.0|THE NAME OF THE WIND by Patrick Rothfuss<br /><br />I just finished reading THE NAME OF THE WIND from DAW Books by Patrick Rothfuss. He is a true poet and brilliant writer. THE NAME OF THE WIND is a very intriguing book about a fascinating character: Kvothe. This fantasy is set in a realistic medieval-type world, not our own, and is quite believable. It chronicles the life of a famous man who has an epic tale to tell. He is in hiding in the beginning of the book, a non-descript innkeeper in a backwater village.<br /><br />The truth is that he is a very famous/infamous man known far and wide for his exploits. The novel tells of his early years, growing up as the son of the best traveling performers in the land, then after a harsh and lonely time in a brutal city, his eventual admission into The University where he hopes to learn real magic--and much more.<br /><br />This is not Harry Potter at Hogwarts. This is a truthful look at the life of someone with no money or safety net. Kvothe has to use his wits and hard work to make his way in a world that crushes most people down. This novel is about what determination and skill can accomplish--but it's about so much more. THE NAME OF THE WIND is a deep look at human nature and how forces shape a person into what they are, and what they're going to become. It's a poignant and captivating study of a most remarkable person.<br /><br />I was very entertained by this lengthy book (662 pages in hardcover), and savored the moments when I could read it for long periods. Life interrupted me several times, as I had deadlines related to my own novels or stories, so it took longer than it should for me to finish reading. Also, I read the hardcover version, which is quite heavy and not very portable. The paperback is now out and I would advise picking that one up--as many people have making it a New York Times bestseller.<br /><br />Now I look forward to reading book two: A WISE MAN'S FEAR, coming out soon.<br /><br />If you're interested in epic novels that get to the heart of what it means to be a hero, and the cost of that path in life, THE NAME OF THE WIND will give you hours of entertainment, and a depth that most novels rarely achieve.<br /><br />Paul Genesse<br />Author of The Golden Cord<br />Book One of the Iron Dragon Series<br />[...]what it means to be a hero, and the cost of that path in life, THE NAME OF THE WIND will give you hours of entertainment, and a depth that most novels rarely achieve.

0316286850|5.0|I just look through the book, because I`m finishing reading Voque Make Up, and it`s a bomb! It`s very easy to read, all the tips are highlighted in the ovals for quick come back. Also I loved the makeovers with the picture before and after. What I found useful was a full characteristics of the make up from different decades; I knew the look and now I know how to achieve it.  Awesome and highly recommended! (Much better then Voque Make up).
B00006D295|4.0|I received this as a Christmas present, and I thought it was pretty good. My favorite character was Dr. Frank N. Furter. It was awesome to see Tim Curry dressed as a transvestite and I loved the song he sang about being a sweet tranvestite from transexual Transylvania! It was also awesome to see a young sexy Susan Sarandon being in a bra and panties practically the whole movie. I also loved how it had the classic look of the 70's! I would highly recommend THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW!!!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This is a compilation of a series shown on TV that we loved.  This Doctor is interesting and engaging and the special effects are great.
0316017922|4.0|gladwell's always an interesting read whom i never agree with completely and here slightly more and halfway. the premise that a certain minimum amount of time need be spent to master any particular activity i agree with wholeheartedly it's of particular relevance to slacker generation who seem happy to do everything in life superficially.  it also espouses alot of deterministic, evolutionary biological ideas and cultural stereotypes which the pc'ers may find at odds with their kumbya ideals and for which gladwell harbors not a shred of ill will against the groups he identifies and discusses.  this is especially important in the analysis of culture in air crash investigation. as a pilot, i discussed this with several friends who all fly at majors and they agree. when the lives of 120-150 passengers are in your hands, the idea of offending anyone \\"sensibilities\\" is rightly seen as trivial.  gladwell will always be \\"out there\\" and i'm glad to see any new thinking which might help get us out of the current severe mess we're in. youtube also has have the colbert report interview where he discusses this book.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|A great remake of the original made all the more intriguing due to the stellar performances delivered by both Annette Bening and Meg Ryan.  In this tale, Meg Ryan's picture-perfect marriage appears headed for disaster when it is discovered by her best friend (in news delivered by a gossipy manicurist), that her husband is having an affair.  Annette confides in their close circle--a circle consisting of gender bender Jada Pinkett-Smith and the ever-pregnant Debra Messing.  But delivery of the news by her friends is not necessary...as a manicure by the same nosy gossiper relieves them of their duty.    Cute and fun, this movie is simply a story about women--with nary a man in sight--and a celebration of their friendships.  Watching this one is definitely time well-spent.        DYB
0307387178|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book. Having read \\"Into Thin Air\\" before reading \\"Into the Wild\\", I was already a big fan of Jon Krakauer.  \\"Into the Wild\\" did not disappoint.  If you have a wandering spirit, this book will inspire you.  In our current fallen culture, the fact that there are still those who are willing to venture out on their own personal \\"vision quests\\" is reassuring to me.  Thank God we still have a few who maintain the warrior spirit in a culture full of couch potatoes and X-Box athletes.
0142000671|5.0|Yeah, they make you read this stuff in high school in a country where most kids find it challenging to read the back of a box of Cap'n Crunch. And because it's forced reading, the novel itself becomes as ossified as one of those dismembered appendages found in Eastern European reliquaries. But if you break the glass and give it a sincere read, you'll discover it's one of the greatest novels ever to come out of America, whether it's the economy of style, the simple power of the language, or its heart-breaking finality. It's not just that Lenny bites the big one, it's that George and all the other guys, they die too. And suffer more.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|When the show aired on TV it came on at 10:00pm and I didn't stay up that late. Then AMC had a marathon Sunday of Mad Men and I got addicted. I love the DVD because it gives you added commentaries of the actors as well as the creator Matt Weiner. The only negative is the fact that Mad Men Addicts (known on the website as \\"Maddicts\\") have to wait so long for the DVD of Season 2.
0684803356|5.0|Yes, I said \\"historical novel,\\" because, even in H.'s day, history passed by very quickly. It's this novel A Farewell to Arms, and The Old Man and the Sea that, for me, are the real crown jewels of Hemingway's output. Even if you're just interested in the historical aspect of the The Spanish Civil War, you'll get much out of this work. There isn't much more I can add that hasn't already been said.
B001FB55MG|3.0|My girlfriend loves everything Disney, so being a nice guy, I sucked it up and was actually surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There were several scenes that made me chuckle. It's obvious that this is aimed at kids, so they will likely have a blast. I will admit that some parts were painfully bad and there was quite a bit of poor writing, but that was expected going in.<br /><br />2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
006113127X|5.0|Chronicles Bukowski's picaresque quest to define himself--without letting the world shove its own definition of him down his throat. Reality blurs into fiction that blurs into autobiography, but never sentimentality.  If I had to bet, I'd say, like everything else, it's 99.9999% true.  Despite the pain, there's a lot of humor here, Rabelaisian, roaring when you least expect it out of the sad muck he finds himself mired in. I refuse to watch the movie; the actors are just too pretty. There's a reason why Buk had a wrinkle-scarred face that looked like the side of a glaciated mountain. If the director couldn't understand that much, it means he didn't get anything right.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I had played this game several times at a friend's home and really enjoyed it. I bought a game for my son and his family for Christmas.We all took turns playing it.(young and old !)I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge but not a mind breaker.Only 4 can play at a time,but a game only takes about a half and hour.(a little longer if you are just learning). I like the game so much that I also bought one for my husband and myself.
0743297334|5.0|Hemingway's first (real) novel. (Torrents of Spring was a practice run of sorts.) H. emerges as a writer in full with this one; all the trademarks are here. What I enjoy most: his ability to craft sentences whose empty spaces tongue-and-groove perfectly with the act of reading, creating a seamless fiction experience. Hemingway's greatest gift was a distinctive style in which the words become invisible.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|Death race is the true definition of an action flick. From beginning to end there is action in almost every scene. Which make the movie very entertaining. The down side is the plot/story is very weak and at time predictable. also Tyrese is a horrible actor in almost every movie I have seen him in and this one is no different. Everyone else in the movie just gave an average level of acting. All in all the movie gets 3 stars strictly for the action/entertainment factor. Don't look for much more beyond that.

B001EO2UJK|4.0|I've read the one star reviews and all that comes to mind for such credentialed folks is you're much better served by writing Peter, Phil, Tony, Steve, and Mike directly. I'm sure they would LOVE the chance to be have their music expertly remixed/remastered by those who are in the one star brigade. What with their perfectly atuned hearing coupled with their infinitely deep musical theory it would be a once in a lifetime oppurtunity to have their music set right once and for all. I'm sure they'd be humbled by such genius. I'm tempted to forward the criticism for their own sake. The rest of us can only HOPE that such a union takes place!    I guess some people have the bar raised so high that nothing will serve. For those of us who have varied interest and choose to spend our money differently, so that mid-range audio equipment suffices instead of tens of thousands, the 5.1 mixes are a huge step up. Everything is much more clear and the low end has a visceral pounding like I've never experienced. So for the NORMAL crowd, this set is a step up. If this is a step down for the narrow living tweekers, then simply go with whatever older mix/master suits you. Making out like you could do better just makes you look silly and self absorbed.     And the new interviews are very interesting. For instance, Steve Hackett must have the Guiness Record for the most area between his nose and his upper lip, and therefore the longest philtrum I've ever seen.
B00004RFFW|2.0|This one had a lot of what made the first one good (action and violence) but it got a little too preachy (dolphins and South Africa) and a little too Three Stooges buddy buddy goofy ha ha for me. Mel hams it up so bad that it is really obnoxious and takes away from the movie. And he and Danny Glover have developed a homoerotic love fest between them for this one. The villians are still good and the violence and action are still exciting and also the hot chick that of course is drawn to Mullet Gibson at first sight is also hot and nude in one scene. Aparently Mullet must be on Lexapro or Lamictal in this one cause he is no longer wanting to blow his brains out but still just acts like and obnoxious blabber mouth who is trying to be the biggest ham on the police force.
B001DDBCUU|1.0|I will be returning this product as I received both special features (Disc 2) and no movie disk in the package.  I'm thinking that is something that should be looked at before sending an open product to the end user.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This movie is just regurgitated garbage from Speilberg and Lucas. It like its lead actor is a tire old worn out mess. And what do they do to spruce up this old hag of a movie? Why they throw in a young sidekick! And who better than to play it but Mrs. Speilberg herself Shia 'I am not really good looking, not really talented, and not really anything special... except to Stephen) Lebeouf! Yipeee!<br /><br />Save your money and rent 1 or 3 and if you want to prove how bad this pile of dung is watch 2 it is even better than this.<br /><br />Harrison Ford? Retire please. You are worn out and  you haven't done anything origional or even good in years. Lucas? Keep sitting on  your big pile of money and keep producing the same two movies over and over and over. Speilberg? Take your girlfriend and get on Death Star and go to Dantooeen forever. This movie is a bloated old worn out mess.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|When \\"Good girl gone bad\\" first came out i got it, and wasn't to impressed with it! Her first two CDs were great, but this one wasn't impressing! The case that came the normal edition came out the case it was in was bad, what i mean by bad is every time i would remove the disc it would leave a mark on the bottom of the disc! So i decided to pick up this one, and well it was almost the same! The plastic case is really good to have, but the song list doesn't improve. The 3 new tracks on there really don't fit the album! my favorite is the remake of \\"If i ever see your face again\\" with rihanna in it! The other two are good but to good for this CD! If you already own the normal edition of this CD Don't even bother getting this one, just download the 3 extra tracks!
B00004STDN|1.0|Stallone is unbelievable as a bodybuilder/mountain climber. He doesn't look like a mountain climber. He does climb like a mountain climber and he stinks as an actor. And the one bad guy who screams ever line of his (\\"FETCH\\") is really irritating along with the stereotypical British accent bad buy stolen straight from Die Hard. This movie is just Stallone garbage. I only wished that Michael Rooker would have reverted to his Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer character and that he would have stabbed Stallone in the eyeball with a hair dressers teasing comb and then ate his big stOOpid head.
B001ED7C58|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure about some of the songs....but then as I listened more, I ended up really liking mostly all of them.  The lyrics go with the movie and the selection was well thought out.  I fell in looove w/ Paramour's DECODE.  It's now my fave!  Was worth buying as this was the first CD I bought and listened to in full in years....I usually download individual songs.
1881273156|3.0|In THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES, Gary Chapman explores what he believes is the cause of all marital dysfunction and breakdown:  the different languages in which love can be expressed.  According to Chapman, we each respond to one of the five \\"love languages\\"--affirmation, time, gifts, service, and touch--and will only feel sufficiently loved when we're being spoken to by our mates in that language.      The breakdown of the five love languages was fascinating, but Chapman's \\"love is a choice\\" philosophy is so bogus, it's not even funny.  It's that kind of bass-ackwards thinking that lead many people into unhealthy relationships in the first place, and he wants to keep them there?  Please.    According to Chapman, \\"real love\\" is a benign act we engage in willingly--like picking up cereal or refilling the gas tank on the way home from work--while being \\"in love\\" is a fabricated emotion built on obsession.      \\"...falling in love is not real love,\\" writes Chapman, \\"because it is effortless.  Whatever we do in the in-love state requires little discipline or conscious effort on our part.\\"    The points Chapman makes are valid, but he approaches them with the kind of anti-divorce tunnel vision that is far too common in these kinds of books.  You can no more choose to love someone than you can choose to be a blond-haired, blue-eyed mermaid who lives in an oversized clam shell off the coast of Maine.  Oh, sure, you can bleach your hair, pop in a pair of contact lenses, and pretend you're a mermaid who lives in a clam shell off the coast of Maine, but that doesn't make it real.    And that's exactly the point I'm getting at.  Chapman derides the \\"in love\\" feeling as being synthetic emotion, and yet, when push comes to shove, insists that when it comes to \\"real love\\", choosing to fake it is the way to go.  Um.  I don't have any fancy-schmancy degrees to back me up, but if you ask me, a forced act of love is about as genuine and meaningful as an effortless act of obsession.  It'sthe wavering between the two extremes that leaves this book cold and sterile.  I imagine the real \\"real love\\" is a happy medium between those two extremes--neither self-destrucive nor impotent.    All in all, I'd say the author gets it about half right, as much as his own personal values will let him.  I would've been more pleased if the focus had been on choices made and physical actions done out of love than a crash course on how to fake it 'til you make it.  There are a multitude of reasons why two partners fail to make a real and lasting connection with each other, and not every divorce is a failure.  Sometimes that' the only way for the family unit to survive without being severely damaged.  Asserting that we should all assign blame where there should be none is nothing but a recipe for resentment.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love this series.  Have bought all three seasons available.  Can't wait until season 4 comes out.  It's scary enough to be fun to watch, and the whole family can't wait for new episodes to come out.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I can't add to other comments, except to say that not only is this movie in my top FIVE, EVER... I'll add that I would be willing to bet that anyone who ever met Alvin Straight NEVER, EVER forgot him!    Thoroughly enjoyable!    And NO it's not slow, it takes patience to watch this amazing true story unfold.    It's worth your time, and you should have your kids watch it too.

B0001WTUH6|3.0|I guess that was my first notion when I saw this movie. Kate Beckinsale: she's hot. (In an English sort of way.) Once I got past all Beckinsale dressed up in a tight-fitting PVC catsuit (Every man's dream!) I realized that this was a pretty well-developed movie. In terms of its story, it's been done before; but I am a sucker for the Westside Story/vampire werewolf love angle. As the movie moved along, I became impressed by its level of creativity and invention. And it's a beautifully styled film as well. In the extended cut, we are treated to lots of extras, included a very entertaining audio commentary by the director, Beckinsale, and Scott Spedman. In addition, the documentaries that are included in this set offer loads of information on the entire process of creating this entertaining movie.
B000E1155E|5.0|\\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" is the debut album by the Arctic Monkeys, and what a debut it is! The Sheffield lads waste no time in showing that they're a force to be reckoned with, as evidenced by the explosive first track, \\"The View From the Afternoon\\". Things get even better when \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" makes its way out of your speakers. The band gives you time to catch your breath at the beginning of \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\", only for the song to erupt into a wall of guitars at the climax. Next, the excellent \\"Dancing Shoes\\" sets the tone for the next two songs, \\"You Probably Couldn't See For the Lights, But You Were Staring Straight At Me\\", a short but rockin' number, and \\"Still Take You Home\\", which ends the first half of the album on an incredible high.   The second half kicks off with \\"Riot Van\\", a tender two-minute ballad about an encounter with the police turning ugly. While not a bad song, it does seem to bog things down just a bit, but it's short enough that you don't have to think much of it, as \\"Red Lights Indicate Doors Are Secure\\" quickly puts the album right back on track with more loud guitars and powerful drums. Alex Turner's vocals really shine on this track, as well. Next up to bat is \\"Mardy Bum\\", a nice mellow number amidst all the thrashing guitars. Speaking of guitars, you'll find plenty on \\"Perhaps Vampires is a Bit Strong But...\\", which features a jam session halfway through reminiscent of early Smashing Pumpkins, only better. After that, you're lured into a false sense of relaxation at the beginning of \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\", only for the mellow acoustic guitar sound to be shattered by electric guitars and pounding drums. My personal favorite on the album, \\"From the Ritz to the Rubble\\", starts out with an almost spoken tale of trying without success to get into a club, which then moves into a powerful chorus, and eventually to a triumphant climax. The album ends on an excellent note with \\"A CertainRomance\\", which starts off loud, only for the drums to fall away to reveal a very melodic bassline accompanied by some plucky guitar, and some of the best lyrics/vocals on the entire album.  If you're a fan of British rock, or just music in general, pick this up, I guarantee any music fan will find something to love on this amazing debut. And if you like this, I suggest \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\", the bands's second album.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Okay, so this movie has Helen Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Malcom MacDowell...but were you expecting a classic screen version of Gore Vidal's literate account of the corrupting influence of power, performed by the brillance of English theatre talent. Are you on drugs?! Penthouse Magazine is the producer of this thing. In any case, apart from the porno scene additions, this movie does have legs, if you can commit yourself to believing that it's somewhat Fellini-esque in its portrayal of Imperial Rome. The performances are, uniformly, well-done by all the principles (At least by those who took the whole thing seriously.) and the art direction is impressive. And this is the unrated version, so go crazy! As for the much talked about lesbian scene, well, it has been better done elsewhere. (Not that I would know anything about that.)
B001GJOL22|5.0|It's Amazing how bands like Rush have sticked together for 34 years and they still play live concerts for 2 and more hours! I think this would be a great example for the new bands that only play for 1:30 hours! Listening to Rush play old and new songs live is amazing, especially on how they play them as if they are in the studio..<br />Long live Rush...
0439023483|3.0|The book was hard to put down but it was also violent. I'm not sure I'm glad I read it. There are a lot of good books around that are hard to put down without relying on disturbing scenes. It was recommended for my 12 year old son and I think 12 is too young to be reading something like this.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|What a gorgeous collection of songs!  Choose a quiet spot and just sit, letting this music pour through your soul...enchanting.  My favorite is  \\"Noel Nouvelet!\\" sung in ancient French.  Loreena is a uniquely talented  artist, taking you away to another time and another place.  Exquisite, and not just for Christmas.
1577311523|3.0|The first third of this book, the one that sets up the theme to which the title refers, is good. It basically states that the majority of our pain comes from our focus on the past (guilt, regret, blame, anger etc.) or the future (stress, anxiety, worry). The only thing we can impact, and the only thing that is truly real, is the now. Tolle encourages us to focus on the present moment, and he gives us ways that we can settle our thinking mind in favor of just being in the Now.<br /><br />As Tolle expands on his concept, he weaves in concepts from Eastern thought and modern meditation/philosophy, such as the Watcher (the thinker who observes our thinking mind), and the unified consciousness. But then the book devolves into New Age mumbo-jumbo as he tries to encompass everything from improving marital relationships to improving our immune systems to ending world hunger. He makes grand statements as if they're fact, without supporting them in any way, and then goes on for a page building on those statements. For example: \\"Even a stone has a rudimentary consciousness; otherwise, it would not be, and its atoms and molecules would disperse.\\" Oh really? It's a psychological bond, not a physical one that holds atoms together? When I read sentences like that, it's hard not to become cynical. But let's put cynicism aside, and let's avoid the temptation to argue science vs religion, because that's not my criticism of the above statement. I'm sure there are belief systems that would support that atoms are held together by consciousness, but I'm not going to take Tolle's word for it. He needs to lay some groundwork.<br /><br />He makes an attempt to incorporate different belief systems, Western and Eastern, but he does this by force-fitting bits of scripture that support his point rather than dealing with the themes of these belief systems. Trying to be holistic is good, but, again, I much prefer someone like Ken Wilber, who lays a foundation and thoughtfully creates a map of the systems.<br /><br />There are also a couple of stylistic elements that I found annoying: First, the entire book is written in a question-and-answer format. I've seen this convention before, and in itself it's annoying enough, but in a few instances the \\"answerer\\" didn't even answer the question asked, or admonished the \\"questioner\\" for asking the question. Pointless. Second, Tolle has the arrogance to insert a special symbol into the text when he wants the reader to stop and, not just consider what he's said, but to \\"become still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just been said.\\" Give me a break. (By my estimation, he greatly over-uses the symbol.)<br /><br />But my biggest beef is that the last two-thirds of the book reads like the underpinnings of The Celestine Prophesy. Tolle takes what is a great premise at the beginning, then bogs it down with unnecessary chapters of New Age jibber-jabber. One example: \\"When you are fully present and people around you manifest unconscious behaviors, you won't feel the need to react to it, so you don't give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that is not peace disappears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and reaction. Animals, trees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it.\\"<br /><br />It's unfortunate that Tolle finishes the book with this kind of stuff, because the first part has some great, concrete and original thinking.There are also a couple of stylistic elements that I found annoying: First, the entire book is written in a question-and-answer format. I've seen this convention before, and in itself it's annoying enough, but in a few instances the \\"answerer\\" didn't even answer the question asked, or admonished the \\"questioner\\" for asking the question. Pointless. Second, Tolle has the arrogance to insert a special symbol into the text when he wants the reader to stop and, not just consider what he's said, but to \\"become still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just been said.\\" Give me a break. (By my estimation, he greatly over-uses the symbol.)      But my biggest beef is that the last two-thirds of the book reads like the underpinnings of The Celestine Prophesy. Tolle takes what is a great premise at the beginning, then bogs it down with unnecessary chapters of New Age jibber-jabber. One example: \\"When you are fully present and people around you manifest unconscious behaviors, you won't feel the need to react to it, so you don't give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that is not peace disappears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and reaction.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|I went into this film with great expectations, considering the cast. The film crashed and burned with in the 1st three seconds! Everyone I was watching it with (party of 12) fell asleep at some point. Now I know that you may suggest that it may have been only interesting for certain audiences, but we are all avid fans of SPY films and we all know great knowledge of the World Wars, so clearly they did something wrong! Robert De Niro's debut directing effort sucked! He needs to stick to acting. I heard he will be directing 2 sequels for the film, all i can say is...don't WASTE YOUR TIME! You will crash and burn in hollywood, once again buddy! So yes, don't waste your money/three hours of your life you could spend with family and friends on this poor poor attempt at entertainment. You could however, check out a better film like the Dark Knight or listen to a Leona Lewis CD. Good luck in all your endeavors, Robert, but please don't make any more films, because frankly they are abominations and atrocious reels of film! Peace, Love and Happiness to all! <3 Mrs. Priestly

The opening credits were longer than it took to make myself a full dinner for my party of 14 (including my monkey, Robin, and terrier, Leanne). But that is besides the point, i guess...well, not really. Well, now that it's 2008, just watch the new one. They obviously re-did it for a reason. Why else would they make the same movie twice in ONE decade? Mhmm...exactly. So, EDWARD NORTON is so FOIIIINE (Hot, sexy, good-looking in modern pop-culture lingo). So go watch the remake [2008] cause when i watched this version, my face turned the color of the HULK...hahahaha. Or if you dont want to ever associate yourself with the HULK again, watch the Dark Knight or listen to a Leona Lewis CD/Bleeding Love/Better In Time/I Will Be/Run.   Wait..hold on...alert the media...WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS PAGE!!!! THE NEW MOVIE IS ALREADY OUT on dvd, hidef, blu ray, selected VHS, so please find your AMAZON search box and type in \\"The Incredible Hulk (2008)!\\" You won't be sorry...or maybe you will, I have yet to catch that one!  <3 Mrs. Priestly

0060899220|5.0|Whether or not this account is 100% factual, it IS 100% entertaining, provided one has the stomach for such debauchery. Sure, there's a bit of \\"Hey, look at me!\\" but it takes a healthy share of that to even bother writing down one's memoirs. If Chef Bourdain is to be believed, it takes that same well-fed ego to become a chef, so it's hardly unexpected.    As someone who can barely scramble an egg without courting disaster, I found it fascinating. Many friends who have WORKED in the cooking industry (not just attended culinary school and aspired to Bourdain's status), have touted its accuracy, so who am I to question?
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Its very difficult to put into words what the music of 'Elbow' has come to signify in my musical world over the past 4-5 months.<br />Lets put it this way - the 20-25 albums that I have heard after that - the comparison is always with 'Elbow' and this album in particular. No wonder then that this album won the Mercury Prize for 2008 as well.<br /><br />Spell-binding ..right from the word go - as the first notes of Starlings hits your ears to the last track 'Friend of Ours' - this album is a miracle in its own right. The sounds are crystal clear, the vocals are amazing, the lyrics are stunning and of-course this is Indie Brit rock at its best.<br /><br />Just one more thing - if ever you get a chance to attend an Elbow concert - do it without thinking twice. They sound exactly the same in person as they do on CD.<br /><br />-A
081292343X|5.0|Very Compelling. I bought this book to learn more about Barak before he even started to run for the Presidential ticket.  I was very pleasantly surprised how he told the story about his life as an eloquent novelist (and a very good one).  A very good read, and definitely one that was hard to put down.  Even if he were not the president-elect, this book would still be just as fascinating.

0198326769|5.0|I read this book in the summer and I was so shocked at the ending it has haunted me for months. I am going to see the movie today and am highly looking forward to it.<br />(Update: the movie is a bit different than the book, the same end result but gets there a bit differntly.)<br /><br />I had never given too much thought to how a child of a Nazi officer would go thru the war. Bruno is so sweet and innocent about what is going on. He is living right next to what you equal in your mind to be Auschwitz. His father is the top Nazi of the camp.<br /><br />Bruno is clueless to any of the horror or what his father does. Hitler even comes to dinner at his house. He knows he is a cross man but still nas no idea.<br /><br />Bruno thinks those people behind the bars are in their pajamas just walking around. Then one day he meets a boy his own age at the electric fence and they become friends. Again Bruno is still so innocent. They talk about coming home from school and having to be moved from their homes...Bruno thinks it is the same and how lucky the boy is to have someone to play with. The boy tells him they don't play.<br /><br />A fast friendship develops that Bruno has to keep secret. I cannot tell you any more or it will ruin the story for you. This is a MUST read. It is difficult to read and heartbreaking but necessary. A new and differnt way to remember and think of how it could have really happened as the story tells.<br /><br />This is 5 stars PLUS!

B0019X3YXM|5.0|Elisha Cuthbert stars as Jordan Roark and Jesse Bradford as Charlie Bellows, two apparently mismatched New Yorkers who randomly meet on a subway platform.    The packaging and parts of the movie stylistically say \\"romantic comedy.\\" And there are funny parts, but not based on the now common gross gags or sexual double entendre. But the humor is not the core of the movie. Charlie Bellows is a typical romantic comedy straight man, so it's easy to see where viewers might be misled. Jordan Roark is not the typical inhabitant of a romantic comedy. In fact she's the mystery. What makes her so volatile and emotionally dangerous but compelling?    The movie was deeper than I expected with a real reward at the end. I couldn't take my eyes off of Elisha Cuthbert. The story builds somewhat slowly but the nuance is there in Elisha's characterization to explain everything in retrospect. I found her compelling. There was no mystery why Jesse's Charlie Bellows fell in love, despite the Elisha's manic behavior as Jordan.    It wasn't the romantic comedy I expected, but it was a rewarding, surprising and oddly compelling drama by the end. I've rewatched it several times and found additional subtlety, emotion and meaning each time. My Sassy Girl was much better than anticipated, and perhaps expectations play a role.     Those viewers that saw the original Korean version have vastly different expectations and apparently wanted the same movie in English, and didn't get it. Those that want and need a light romantic comedy would also be disappointed. If you're willing to ride along and let the movie develop on its own merits, there's more meaning and drama than meets the eye in the first half of the film.    Recommended.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|It seems that the progressive heavy metal groups do not suffer from the same problems that plague their neo-prog counterparts (namely stagnation) and offer up one potentially viable direction for progressive rock in the 21st century.  Dream Theater achieves this by fusing aspects of the classic 1970s progressive rock style with contemporary trends in heavy metal and other experimental styles - the fact that they favor more direct and relevant subject matter for their lyrics also helps.  Indeed, Octavarium (2005) is a fresh sounding album that provides me with the same level of excitement that albums like Relayer (Yes, 1974) brought me many, many, years ago.<br /><br />The lineup on this album includes three former Berklee College of Music (Boston, Massachusetts) students: John Petrucci (electric and acoustic guitars); John Myung (electric bass guitars), and the Neil Peart-influenced Mike Portnoy (drums, percussion, and vocals), along with James LaBrie (vocals) and Jordan Rudess (keyboards, Hammond organ, synthesizers).  Joining the core group are various woodwind players (there is a nice flute solo on the Octavarium suite), a string quartet, and an orchestra on Sacrificed Sons and Octavarium. Dream Theater may very well be the most technically proficient progressive rock outfit currently active.  Dense ensemble playing and Olympian scale feats of pyrotechnics on their individual instruments dominate - fortunately however, they backed off considerably from the frenzied shredding and riffs they used so heavily on Scenes from a Memory (1999).<br /><br />While the group favors the tone colors of heavy metal (high pitched vocalist, distorted guitar played at a crushing volume), there are also acoustic textures here and there.  In addition, Jordan introduces elements of the classic progressive rock style (Hammond organ, mini-moog synthesizer) - which make a grand entrance on the 24 minute long Octavarium suite- and even some brief references to the sequenced synthesizer lines characteristic of techno.  Unfortunately, I wish more had been made of his considerable abilities.  Last but not least is poor John Myung - apart from 10-15 second solos here and there (to apparently remind the listener that a bassist is in fact present), he is virtually invisible.  I really need to check out his side projects.<br /><br />With a total running time of 75:58, Octavarium is comprised of eight tracks, with individual pieces ranging in length from 4:22 to 24:00.  While thunderous heavy metal tracks dominate (Panic Attack is a great example), there are quiet pieces (The Answer Lies Within), catchy and highly melodic pop tunes (the U2 inflected I Walk Beside You) and the massive prog-rock rave up Octavarium.  Although I enjoy the heavy metal tunes, the Octavarium suite has got to be the finest large scale prog rock composition that I have heard from the newer groups - even though the introduction is lifted directly from the spacey synth introduction to the Shine on You Crazy Diamond suite (Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd, 1975).  While the thrilling Octavarium suite has been compared to compositions by the neo-prog groups, I do not see (or hear) any parallels.  I should note that I do not care for the neo-prog groups that much, so I am hopelessly biased.<br /><br />In terms of the CD package it is pretty good and features the lineup and the lyrics. Unfortunately, the production quality is not so hot (Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci produced the album). Specifically, the keyboards are buried in the mix (save for the solo sections) and poor John Myung has all been mixed out of the album. As can be imagined, the drums sound pretty good and John Petrucci is, well, everywhere.<br /><br />I think that some DT fans might not like this album as much because it draws more heavily on elements outside of heavy metal including progressive rock and prog/pop.  Fortunately as a prog fan, I found a great deal to like here and really appreciate the fact that these guys\\"mix it up\\".  Recommended along with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002) to heavy metal fans that do not mind prog rock, and prog rock fans that do not mind heavy metal.h Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002) to heavy metal fans that do not mind prog rock, and prog rock fans that do not mind heavy metal.
B000H7JCIW|4.0|Liza shines in this wonderful created concert/Special. One thing I really like about this DVD is that its not Liza trying to re-record her greatest hits. In this concert, she did yes, sing some of her classic hits. But most of the material sung in this concert where not typical Liza songs. Such examples would be \\"Live Alone and Like It\\", \\"So What\\", \\"Sara Lee\\", and \\"The Men's Medley\\" were all new great new songs for Liza to introduce into her songbook.    Their were although some things that I didn't like about this performance. I felt that at some spots through out the first act Liza is singing so low, and backing away from the power of the song's moment, and it becomes hard for you to understand what she is trying to sing. In other words you could say at some parts she seems to mumble. But through the second act she was totally fine, due to most of the songs in the second act were uptempo; Which brings me to my next pint.    Most of the songs in the First act were ballads. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with ballads, but In my opinion I think the first Act should have been longer, and started out with more up-tempos. Then after about maybe four up-tempos, then go into a pattern of ballads and up-tempos. Instead of doing ballads straight in a row. Like how the first act did at some points.    As for the second act, I think it was perfect. Especially for the Men's Medley, Liza and her dancer did a great job of incorporating so many different types of songs into this medley. The one thing I Did not like about the second act is this whole Bob Fosse, Imagine, Smile medley thing. I'm glad it wasn't in Liza With a Z because I felt it dragged on for way too long. It looked like Liza and her dancers were doing a very bad imitation of Liza's performance of Bye, Bye, Blackbird in Liza with a Z. Besides that, the second act was perfect. Some great songs were the \\"Here I'll Stay Medley\\" and \\"The Man I Love\\"    I would DEFIANTLY recommend this to any Liza, Broadway, of showtunes fan. It is full or great numbers, and terrific dances.

031606792X|3.0|To recap, I fell passionately in love with the soundtrack from the Twilight movie, went to see it, and then devoured Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse in record time. And then I started Breaking Dawn. Together, at last, in a corny but plot-necessary wedding, and able to be together, despite his immortality and her fragility...<br /><br />And then \\"the little nudger.\\" I almost died of horror. \\"No!\\" I thought, \\"She can't be doing this! She can't be jumping shark like this! A half-vampire baby, no, no, no!\\" I felt as disappointed as any Star Wars fan at Padme in Revenge of the Sith. It took me two weeks to get through the horror of Bella's pregnancy, and then the seemingly perfect outcome of a happy, bouncing baby *and* Bella the Vampire, at last. I was almost sick reading her happiness. And Jacob's utter happiness with Renesme, completely forgetting that he *made out* with his intended's mother not a season earlier.<br /><br />Disregarding my personal issues - the name Reneme, Charlie's quick acceptance of the \\"new\\" Bella - the middle was nothing but a cut-and-paste human-gives-birth-to-half-vampire travesty, followed by a love-story-resolved-because-the-third-wheel-found-someone made levels worse by that someone being the daughter of his would-be lover. The resolution of the book, if you could call it that, was a relatively short *discussion* in which the ultimate deus ex machina comes in the form of another half-vampire Alice drags from out of nowhere who tells everybody everything'll be fine and Renesme will grow up to have a normal, perfectly happy life with Jacob in a few years, and her family can live happily forever after. Add Bella suddenly discovering a talent that saves the day *and* allows Edward to hear her thoughts, and you have a very awful, very pathetic end to the Twilight Saga...<br /><br />In Jacob's words (p.189 hardback) \\"Tell me what the point was then, Bella! What was the point of me loving you? What was the point of *you* loving him? When you die how is that ever right again? What's the point to all the pain? Mine, yours, his! ... So what was the point of your twisted love story, in the end? If there is *any* sense, please show me, Bella, because I don't see it.\\"again? What's the point to all the pain? Mine, yours, his! ...

B001DJLCRC|5.0|There's an old saying: The most dangerous man in the world is the man with nothing to lose.  If this is the case, no one in his life should want to cross Walter White, Sr.<br /><br />Walt is a 50-year-old man with a pregnant wife, a teenaged son with CP, a life mortgaged to the hilt, a bad cough, and a thankless job as high school chemistry teacher to the usual bunch of bored, overindulged kids.  In his spare time, to make extra money, he works at a car wash.  His wife brings a few extra bucks selling knick-knacks on eBay.<br /><br />One day, Walter's cough causes him to keel over, forcing him to see the doctor, who hands him a devastating diagnosis: inoperable lung cancer.  This diagnosis is devastating on several levels: first, of course, is the knowledge of his impending death.  Second is the realization that cancer is a very expensive disease to treat and his crap health insurance is not going to cover him very adequately in the face of this financial disaster.  Third is the conclusion that he'll leave his family nothing but bills when he's gone.<br /><br />There was time when a man could hold down a respectable job and support his family on it without having to take a second job.  His health insurance was adequate to the task of covering catastrophic illness and he could count on being able to live a comfortable middle class life without having to resort to a second job.<br /><br />Nowadays, this ain't necessarily so.  People like Walter are being squeezed into a financial corner in an era of stagnant wages, rising costs, and instability in their jobs.  Increasingly, the middle class is just treading water, in danger of drowning when the next big wave comes along.  So it's not entirely unexpected that some folks, believing that the social contract is being violated in their lives, take drastic measures.  Welcome to our show, ladies and gents.<br /><br />Walter White, when Breaking Bad opens, is standing by the side of the road, half-naked, holding a gun, with a dilapidated RV in the background that seems to be on fire, and facing the sound of sirens in the distance.  That image is one of the best metaphors for what is to come that I've encountered since the opening paragraphs of The Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />Walter has decided that, lacking any other means to provide for his family after his death, he is going to raise some quick and dirty cash by cooking meth.  To that end, he teams up with Jesse, a former student with connections to the local drug trade, and embarks on a dangerous second life.<br /><br />He soon finds himself engaging in activities that his previously law-abiding, milquetoast self could never have imagined.  And by the end of the 1st season of this excellent show, in a showdown with a psychopathic drug dealer, he is the most dangerous man in the room.<br /><br />If you missed this show when it first aired on AMC, keep an eye out for it in reruns or buy this DVD set and watch it.  You won't regret it.  It's a brilliantly told story of our times, a life of disappointments, unrealized dreams, downward mobility, and crushing burdens.t seems to be on fire, and facing the sound of sirens in the distance.

My family and I can watch it over and over again and we still end up laughing so hard we cry every time...in fact, knowing what's coming up makes it even funnier. We are constantly quoting from this show...it's pure genious.  I wish they would have included a blooper reel, although the jacket says it includes a \\"behind the scenes look\\". I haven't watched this, yet, so I couldn't say if this is a blooper reel or not.  If you've never seen the show, buy this set, sit down, and prepare to laugh outloud and hard!
0307346617|3.0|I was very hopeful when I cracked this book open, but was ultimately disappointed by the lack of stylistic variation, which is crucial since the author is recounting stories from many different survivors of the Zombie War. Not only that, but there are several plot holes that are distractingly blatant. These, in addition to several typos (how does a book go through as many printings as WWZ and not have them corrected?) broke the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" that would be necessary to really become immersed in a book like this.    With these drawbacks, I still give World War Z three stars for being an imaginative new take on the zombie genre. But if you're really interested in a gripping, horrifying and engrossing zombie survival tale, pick up Robert Kirkman's \\"The Walking Dead\\" from Image Comics.
B00006RIO7|4.0|This is one of the greatest examples of Musical Theater. The songs in this Film couldn't haven't been done any better than besides the greats; Fred Ebb and John Kander. Its sad that it took about thirty years after the Broadway Production for it to be made into a movie. But I guess it was worth it to get such great stars as Catherine Zeta-Jones, and newly introduced to Musical Theater, Queen Latifah.    I sadly would have to say that from what I have heard of Liza Minnelli's performances of songs in Chicago, are not as great as Zellweger's were in this film. Although Liza does a great \\"All That Jazz\\", Renee shows Liza how to get the number \\"Roxie\\" done.    One thing I really like about this soundtrack is that is olden type of music, and its not remastered old songs, but it old songs performed by Modern artists, and presented in Modern, \\"High Definition\\" audio quality. Its like Michael Buble, he does the old standards, but manages to share them with the old standards to us with great, new, modern, quality. And thats exactly what this film does, It still presents the great old classics; But does it in a great modern, and perfect audio quality way.    One part I think that could have been done better by someone else is the part John C. Reiley. From what I Heard he is a singer, but from what I have seen in this movie, he isn't the greatest one. \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" is one of my favorite songs from this film, and I think John C. Reilly makes the song look like a joke. It's supposed to be a very touching song, and I don't think his vocals met those requirements. And also, I think the whole vagabond outfit for his character was completely dumb. I think the whole lonely stage setup was great, but the whole, homeless, vagabond thing, just made the song look like a joke. When it really is a very touching song.    Besides that, the film and soundtrack where great. And I loved the two extra tracks on the soundtrack by Queen Latifah, and Anastasia are great.This album completely deserved the Grammy Nomination it got, and I would recommend this album to any Musical Theater fan.

It mixes fantasy and reality to such an extent that even those who don't go in for fantasy can get caught up in them.  The characters are fully realized people and the situations test and challenge.  His prose is well done and the story is fast paced.  You can see it on the screen of your mind like a film.  The only drawback is that it is not original enough to merit five stars.  There are some rated R elements (especially violence), but over all this does not distract from the story.  Suffice it to say this is not for younger readers.<br /><br />All in all a great way to spend a cold weekend.
1591396190|5.0|Blue Ocean Strategy is very popular book with over a million copies sold. The subtitle contains a lofty promise as is often the case with strategy books, presumably so they'd sell more. \\"Making the competition irrelevant\\" always sounds good. But despite the numerous copies sold and, one would assume, attempts at creating a \\"Blue Ocean\\" as the authors call markets with no competition, we still see quite a bit of competition in the world in most or all industries. So what gives? Is the promise overstated and is the book just another useless strategy book out of which comes no practical value?<br /><br />Yes and no. Of course it doesn't magically make your competition irrelevant just like that. But Blue Ocean Strategy is also far from impractical or useless. So what is a Blue Ocean anyway? It's an area of uncontested market space, where there are no competitors (yet). Traditionally companies strive at surviving in so-called Red Oceans, the hotly contested traditional markets with clearly defined boundaries and competition. The Blue Ocean Strategy is about a systematic approach to creating Blue Oceans.<br /><br />One could be forgiven to think that there are no more Blue Oceans left in the world, that the hyper-competition has exhausted all possibilities of new \\"virgin\\" markets. But that would be a mistake. All you need to do is to think back only, say, 30 or 40 years, and you will find that many industries we now take for granted simply didn't exist. One of the biggest in the world, one of the few trillion-dollar industries today, was nowhere to be seen 30 years ago - mobile communications. Or biotechnology, nanotechnology, discount retail, snowboards, home videos... the list is surprisingly long. And then think forward 15, 20 or 30 years - wouldn't it be simply unrealistic to assume no new industries pop up? There are Blue Oceans, but the question is how to get there.<br /><br />So how does the book help in this task? By providing a number of useful tools, processes and frameworks, the book actually does help in accomplishing that. One of the key tools is the strategy canvas - a visualization of a companies strategy mapped as a graph of key principal factors. We've used the strategy canvas at work and it's a quite nice visualization tool. There is also a plethora of other frameworks and tools in the book, including some with very poor names - or what comes to your mind from a \\"PMS Map\\"? ;) (it's actually a pioneer-migrator-settler map, luckily one of the less useful tools in the book)<br /><br />Like many good books, one of the best offering in the book is the wealth of case studies and real-life examples. It's interesting to note that household names such as CNN and JCDecaux were once seen as radical companies, in effect implementing the Blue Ocean strategy very successfully. There are also many valuable points that may seem counter-intuitive; for one, customer desegmentation is often called for when looking for Blue Oceans, going against the current trend of increasing customer segmentation and targeting. And, despite the pompous subtitle, the authors at the end do acknowledge that companies need to be good at both Blue Ocean and Red Ocean strategies - furthermore, there are no permanently excellent industries or even permanently excellent companies. To stay at the top, the company would need to constantly be re-inventing itself, but very few or no companies actually manage to do that. That alone ought to be a sobering lesson.<br /><br />Blue Ocean Strategy is certainly a very good book and I definitely plan on continuing to use the tools I've learned from it. Of course it's not perfect; for one, it's missing some important innovation process information (making \\"How breakthroughs happen\\" a good companion read). The book also attributes perhaps too much weight on the new strategies in the lowering of NYC's crime (you'll recall the Tipping Point providing an alternative, or at least complementary, explanation). Still, the shortcomings are relatively minor - the book is excellent. Read it. But then again, merely reading it will do nothing for your company. If you don't do the significant footwork involved, expect to get nowhere.is excellent. Read it. But then again, merely reading it will do nothing for your company.

B00002DE0S|5.0|I am a fan of Chopin. Played some of his works such as<br />- Etudes Opus 10 No. 9<br />- Etudes Opus 10 No. 12<br />- Etudes Opus 25 No. 1<br />- Etudes Opus 25 No. 12<br /><br />I have also listened to and possessed some of Chopin works played by different artists such as Arrau, Ashkenazy, Pollini, Zimerman, Lang Lang, and Yundi Lee etc.<br /><br />I am not an armchair critic; I just want to share my opinion on this piece of work from Zimerman.<br /><br />I love Zimerman plays the Chopin Ballades. Each one of them is a wonderfully crafted and dynamic piece of art. I admire the way Zimerman interprets the work of Chopin, they are so poetic and emotionally filled.<br /><br />Let's talk about the Piano Concerto No.1 here. I have heard another pianist before listening to Zimerman. Initially I thought Zimerman's work was a bit slow. Probably I had strong influence from Pollini's work especially on his Etudes. However, the more I listen to Zimerman's interpretation, the more I realise the music is speaking to me. I felt that the heart and soul of Chopin which had encoded in this music had once again revealed by Zimerman and his orchestra. Many other conductors and pianists had fallen into the constraints of the tempo on the sheet of the music. However, this is not the way how music from Romantic period should be played and I believe Zimerman had the true understanding and played very well in this recording.<br /><br />I don't have many fancy words to describe the performance of Zimerman and his orchestra. However, one thing I need to mention is that when I put on my headphone and listen to the Agitato climax of the 1st Movement, I just couldn't hold my tears from coming out. I felt the emotion was overflowing from the music but yet it was suppressed by an unknown external force. It is like you wanted to express your love to someone but you couldn't. It is like your heart is crying inside but you try to hide your feeling from outside. Zimerman was using the exactly sametechnique in this and in the climax of Ballade No. 1.<br /><br />Zimerman has inspired me to take on the challenge to play the first movement of Concerto No. 1. Hopefully I will manage to finish one day.
1400063515|3.0|The major ideas in this book are without question very important but unfortunately,in my view, poorly elucidated.The arguments are presented in a rambling confused way with lots of superfluous material that serves to obfuscate rather than clarify. The author seems unable to make a point clearly and succinctly and then leave it alone. The interminable stories, name dropping and confusing exemplars make reading large sections of the book sheer drudgery. In addition by  basically calling everyone who disagrees with him a moron he casts himself in a very poor light.I also suspect that English is not Mr Talebs native language and this explains his awkward somewhat stilted prose. At the end of the book I could not help but feel that an opportunity for a great book had been squandered for want of a good editor.
0545128285|5.0|I love all the harry potter books and this was a great addition to the novels.  I love the childrens stories for wizards and witches.  They were very imaginative and good
B001F7MSFW|4.0|I bought this movie for Del Toro's sumptuous imagery and imagination. I was not disappointed. It is certainly a feast, and deserving of great acclaim. The story, however, is uneven at times and could benefit from a tighter, clearer vision similar to, for instance, Pan's Labyrinth.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If it didn't come from a major network, I would have sworn they were making this stuff up. I can't even imagine how long and how much effort it took to get this footage. I have watched half the episodes in the first three days after I got the set, and I can't wait to watch the rest. The Blu-Ray HD quality is superb, and the disks load fast and play great on the family Playstation 3. My kids, who aren't instrinsically interested in nature films, have so far stopped what they were doing to watch the episodes with me. This series will set the standard for nature films for years to come.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Only very seldom has Joss Whedon managed to disappoint me.  Whether it was Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, or his comic book work; the man has always managed to deliver.  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is no different, taking Whedon's love for superheroics and musicals and smashing them together with hilarious and even surprisingly touching results.  Sadly, I missed out on Dr. Horrible when it had originally debuted on the internet, but thanks to this great DVD, we can all enjoy it over and over again.  Neil Patrick Harris stars as the title character who seeks to propel his career in evil and woo Penny (The Guild's Felicia Day) whom he met at the laundromat and is way too shy to talk to, but his plans get foiled by his arch-nemesis Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion), a self-obsessed superhero who Penny soon falls for.  The musical numbers are wonderful, and Harris, Fillion, and Day are spectacular as well.  The only real flaw of Dr. Horrible is that it has to come to an end, and while the ending itself may be flawed, it is however fitting to Whedon and co.'s overall blueprint.  The DVD extras are surprisingly plentiful and worth the price of admission alone, and needless to say that whether or not you've seen this online or missed out on it like I did, if you're a Whedon fan then Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is an essential pick-up that you will enjoy again and again.
031606792X|5.0|I think the last one keep me the edge of my seat. It was just as good as the first one in the series. I just wish she didn't end it. I think she should write more on the series. I would definatly take a shot and read this series. It doesn't take long and I feel it is worth it.

031606792X|5.0|this is an excellent book it is an excellent series i look forward to reading more of her books
1400067936|5.0|I loved the rant and I loved the stories. While sometimes a little bit hard to stay in the flow of it, I think I learned as much of value from this book than anything I read in school. Really drove home some key value lessons about finance and way beyond.     Better lucky than good though best to be both!
B000K7VHQE|1.0|I don't know if I'm more grieved or outraged by this film; grieved that this is the kind of film choice that's out there when you want a fun, sit-back-and-enjoy movie to relax with, but especially grieved that this film has received so many accolades, a true reflection of how low we have sunk as a society. Where has our human dignity gone? I'm outraged that this film is marketed as a fun, bright (just look at the DVD jacket), family film-despite its R rating-but is packed with such dark topics, as suicide, pornography, illegal drugs, and topped off with more than a smattering of profanity. Also, the movie exploits the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" of the film, a delightful ten-year-old girl (give or take a year or two) who innocently performs a strip-tease  (at least she remains decently dressed throughout), which she dedicates to her grandfather because he taught it to her. Oh, did I mention that by this part of the film the grandfather is dead from a cocaine overdose and is stashed in the trunk of the family car? Fortunately though, before the grandfather dies, he has the opportunity to leave his grandson (Li'l Sunshine's brother) with a bit a worldly wisdom: get lots of sex from as many young girls as you can before you get too old. Yep, great \\"heartwarming\\" family entertainment! This movie is like The Emperor's New Clothes; all the \\"importants\\" like Ebert and Sundance film critics have said how wonderful it is, yet in reality it's trash.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|There is nothing more to be said about this movie - probably the best superhero film ever made, with a mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger as the embodiment of chaotic evil - this is a 5-star DVD if ever there was one.  But there is a LOT to be said about this awful, feature-free, completely inadequate 2-disc set.    On Disc 1, the movie itself provides no alternative soundtracks, no director/cast/technician commentary, no \\"music only\\" version, no alternate versions, no deleted scenes, nothing.  You may as well watch it on Amazon Unbox given the utter absence of extra features.    On Disc 2, things get much, much worse.  There are exactly two mini-documentaries - one on the design and implementation of the new Bat-suit and the quasi-motorcycle Bat-pod, one on the evolution of the Joker's \\"theme sound\\" for the movie soundtrack.  Both are interesting as far as they go, but in the immortal words of another Warner Brothers hero, \\"That's all, folks!\\"  Everything else on the disc is worthless.  I'll list here and you can decide for yourself:    - A gallery of movie posters, production stills, and trailers.  The posters and stills are not even presented full-screen - pathetic.    - IMAX scenes - The major action set pieces for The Dark Knight were filmed in IMAX, which I had the opportunity to see for myself at an IMAX theater.  The effect in the theater was interesting - when the action took off, the somewhat over-sized widescreen image suddenly exploded into full IMAX.  But what exactly is the point of this feature on DVD?  It's NOT IMAX, obviously, so all we're really seeing is how these scenes looked in their original IMAX-style framing (which is, um, pretty close to 3:4 \\"full TV screen\\", kids) before being trimmed down to the \\"widescreen\\" format of standard movie screens and newer televisions.  I guess this \\"feature\\" might be of interest to fanatics who worry about what they missed at the top and bottom of the screen during those scenes, but to the rest of us, this is a complete snooze-fest (unless you just like the idea of watching all the action scenes back-to-back).    - \\"Gotham Tonight\\" - the most inexplicable feature of all is this collection of 6 episodes of the fictional \\"Gotham Tonight\\" show featured throughout the movie as background and/or commentary on the action from the perspective of local TV news.  Not sure where these came from, or why they were produced, but whatever value they might have had as \\"deep background\\" (if that is indeed why they were made), in this context they're just DVD shovelware.    Folks, THAT IS *IT*.  The above is *everything* on Disc 2.  Not even a *mention* of the late Heath Ledger, much less the sort of documentary a lot of us would love to see, perhaps featuring recollections of cast and crew about how he created the character that made it onto the screen.  Given this, the fact that the picture used to label Disc 2 is a close-up of the Joker's face just adds insult to injury.    I share the opinion of many other customer reviewers I've read here - this is clearly a holiday season rip-off, a quick-and-dirty scheme to rake in a few extra bucks from unsuspecting clods like me who expected WB to release a package worthy of this great movie.  Instead, what we have is an insult to the fans and the film makers.  Save your money and get the single disc if you must, but better still wait for the proper \\"deluxe edition\\" that's sure to come next year.  As it stands, the current \\"special edition\\" is really, really sad.    UPDATE:  I hope we ARE getting a true deluxe edition of this movie on DVD, but you might want to take a look at the product description of the Blu-ray disc.  Apparently, WB has decided (at least so far) to save all the decent supplemental material for Blu-ray customers.  There's no technical reason for this - a 2-disc DVD set has all the capacity needed to carry the extra documentaries, etc., included on the Blu-ray edition.    Blu-ray and its flaky BD+ anti-piracy technology have given many of us pause.  1080p's nice, but not if it doesn't work, and until I'm convinced that the dust has settled on the stability and compatibility problems, I'm sticking with DVDs (assuming I still have a choice).  If WB's handling of \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a harbinger of things to come, if the studios are going to try to force us to buy Blu-ray by needlessly withholding material from DVD editions, the most significant effect may just be to kill the \\"deluxe\\" DVD business.  I know that from now on I will wait to read some detailed reviews to see if \\"special edition\\" DVDs are worth the premium before buying - no more pre-orders!
B001AQO41E|5.0|I am sooooo happy that this movie finally came out in Blu-Ray format.  Poltergeist was scary, creepy, fun, and captivating all at the same time.  The Blu-Ray version is crystal clear and sounds great.  A must buy for anyone who likes Blu-Ray quality or scary movies.
1416562605|5.0|Very funny dialogue of supposedly modern India. Exposes the truth about  how people really live there in a very comedic fashion.
B001H5X7KC|3.0|This movie came highly recommended by my friends so I bought it immediately.  Every actor did a great job playing their part but when it all came together it was a little weak.  There were some very funny parts here and there and at some points they tried to squeeze in some emotion.  Great Blu-Ray picture.
0545128285|4.0|A great book to round out the hardcover HP series collection.  And all profits go to children's charities (since JKR is set for life now).  Gave this to my 13 y/o daugher along w/ the \\"Hogwart's School Books\\" (Quidditch thru the Ages & Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them).  She's had a blast reading them, and has picked up the HP series again.
B001GKJ2FC|3.0|Angelina Jolie looked great as always but it would have been nice to see a little more skin.  The guy who played the lead male role was unmemorable and could've been replaced by any nobody on the street.  The action was fun and the story line moved well.  The Blu-Ray picture looked great.  These newer BR movies are worth every penny.
0307455874|5.0|This was a great read!  However, some of the events that happen throughout this text are trite--which sometimes lead to a devastatingly mundane read.

0316066524|5.0|Brilliance--pure and simple, being qualifications of brilliance--or rather, the qualifications of the qualification of brilliance, as in anyone can see this novel is a product of brilliance--not the novel, which is dirty and complex and: BRILLIANT. This is how God writes. You could swear this book had at least three authors as its motley of characters communicate with a detailed affectation that seems impossible to foster in a single individual. Please note: I resisted the urge to parenthetically state there was no pun intended after \\"foster\\" in the last sentence. Too cliche--something Wallace would execrate. If you're fascinated by drugs, the human condition, tennis, and/or violence, then this book is for you. This is an excellent book for aspiring writers; this is an awful book for people of average to less-than-average intelligence. DFW, requiescat in pace. I love you more than anyone I've ever known.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|This was a decent shoot em up flick.  I gave it 4 stars because I can still recall  the plot-so many are forgetable. Its a bad attitude Bourne type movie and I liked Walberg as lead. If you liked Last Man Standing and Reindeer Games, type of off beat rough; you will probably like this.  Not warm-Not fuzzy.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I watched this movie twice (once in the theater and once on DVD) and I enjoyed it each time. Although I think some of the \\"close calls\\" were quite unrealistic and would probably never happen in real life if someone actually fell to the center of the earth. Anyway here are a few of the close calls that I remember from the movie. I took notes on all of the close calls because they were so cool and had me at the edge of my seat the first time I saw the movie.<br /><br />1) Trevor almost steps into a 200 ft deep cliff but Hannah the mountain guide pushes him out of the way at the last minute.<br /><br />2) When all 3 of them were climbing down the rope wasn't long enough so Hannah cuts the rope and lets Trevor go or else the 3 of them will plunge down. He was actually already at the bottom and Hannah played a trick on him!<br /><br />3) MY FAVORITE: Going over the broken tracks in the mine and where Hannah has to jump onto Trevor's car.<br /><br />4) MOST UNREALISTIC- An actual smooth landing into the center of the earth after a 10 minute plunge when the muscovite breaks through (they end up swimming for a long time which is quite unrealistic since they don't have oxygen tanks).<br /><br />5) Where both Trevor and Sean are chased by a big dinosaur, and the dinosaur falls through the muscovite. Trevor almost plunges down, but he catches the top of the cliffhanger. He is VERY LUCKY like he said in the movie.<br /><br />6) Exiting the center of the enter (VERY COOL)!<br /><br />These are the 6 out of the total of 11 close calls that really stuck out to me in the movie.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|With a few deft, ingenious strokes, the writers created an intriguing yet easy to understand world for the little ones.  The animation is just jaw-dropping.  Wall-E is an appealing cross between R2D2 and Woody Allen.  A real joy to watch with small children.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I have watched this movie fully at least 5 times so far in my short life (maybe up to 15 when I saw selected scenes). I can't think of any late 20th or early 21st century movies that even come close to beating the Sound of Music. Many of today's movies have too much crude humor, violence, and especially sex. Even some of today's PG movies are not very appropriate for children.<br /><br />I believe every child should be required to watch this movie and write an essay on it at least once before graduating from high school. There are so many life lessons that can be learned from this great musical such as the meaning of family and how music can bring people closer together. I would give the movie six stars if I could. The actors and actresses (and the whole crew) of the movie must have worked super hard back in 1965 to bring this brilliant masterpiece together! I was more than impressed by Julie Andrew's voice and I thought she was perfect for her role as 'Maria Von Trapp'. I still enjoy Julie Andrew's acting and watch movies that she stars in such as The Princess Diaries 1&2 and Mary Poppins. She has a great voice and is lucky to have played a central role in the most famous movie of all time. After all these years the movie is still a worldwide hit. I am guessing it will still be a classic in the year 2100 or at the dawn of the 22nd century.<br /><br />Anyway almost 45 years after the movie was made I definitely recommend everyone to see the movie at least once in their lifetime. It is the closest that you can come to experiencing \\"Heaven on Earth\\". I just wish that more stores would start carrying this movie on Blu-Ray, although the film is just as good watching it the prehistoric way which is on good old VCR! :)
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This CD is as good if not better than their \\"The Long Road\\".  It has the same sort of music in it.  Absolutely fantastic....

B00000IQC8|1.0|I don't remember too much about this movie (speaks volumes) other than the fact that it was boring and the c-rate actors over-rehersed their lines.  The latter flaw took me awhile to pick up on, but once I did it was all I could focus on!  I can't imagine sitting through this twice!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have had this 30 Day Shred dvd since the summer. I still use it everyday. There are times when I switch to the other biggest loser dvds, but it just doesn't compare. There are 3 workouts, easy, moderate, then intense.I switch the workouts everytime I use it. They all make you sweat. On the easy mode, I use weights for the cardio to make it a little harder. The 3 segments in each workout makes time go by faster, and it doesn't seem like the workouts are dragging on like the biggest loser #1 workout.  I have other biggest loser dvds but this is definitely the best. It is short and to the point. I have lost 15lbs (I wasn't heavy but wanted to be toned). This dvd works out on all the body parts and it is very professional. I highly recommend this dvd. I don't think it can get any better than this.
B001ED7C58|5.0|The Twilight Soundtrack is an amazing collection of songs. I listen to this CD as I am falling asleep and any time I get in the car. If you loved the movie, I'm sure that you will enjoy this, too.
0425188809|5.0|Except that this was great! I'd always kept \\"Watchers\\" waiting on the back burner, not wanting to be disappointed like I was with \\"Strangers.\\" And when I pulled it off the shelf, I made it a point to flip through it to see how long the chapters were going to drag out. I groaned in disgust, thinking that this was going to be another strenuous read. Well, to my surprise, it wasn't, and I figured out pretty quickly why \\"Watchers\\" is considered by many to be his signature book! I loved it!<br /><br />If you take a man at the end of his rope, just looking to be alone in the wilderness, then you'd have Travis Cornell. But then along comes a friend, quite an unexpected friend, in a golden, beautiful dog, who carries with him more than just \\"Roll over and play dead,\\" tricks. And if you were looking for a woman who's never gotten out in the world, Nora would be it as well. And through the help of this dog, Einstein, the name Travis gives him, things get interesting.<br /><br />But things are even more interesting, because things have escaped from a laboratory, Einstein's one of them, and a horrific monster-like man made creation is another. And people are looking for both of them. And Travis and Nora could be in grave danger when the location of them is found out.<br /><br />Koontz always has floored me with how human his writing actually is. And his brilliance is even better, especially when he's on! So what can you say when you pick something up by Dean that isn't quite up to snuff? Hey, just look back on his great works, like \\"Watchers,\\" for instance. That's reminder enough that the genius of Koontz still lurks about. I think one of these days he'll cut loose once again and amaze us all! I can't wait.
6305428050|5.0|If it had been titled \\"The Big Night Out\\", people may have thought the movie was about Elisabeth Shue's big date with her \\"boyfriend\\". Then people would have thought that night was to be filled with wondrous and fun adventures on the big night out.  However, the title is not the best, but the movie is.    There are a few naughty words in the movie, but they fit the situation.  The movie is cute. There are several scenes that make me chuckle inside.    I recommend this movie to anyone, even hardened old crones. ha    Vincent D'Onofrio of Law and Order:Criminal Intent plays a very significant part.

B00004SVIK|5.0|This will be the closet I can ever get to being at a Pink Floyd concert. I can only imagine what it must of felt like to be in the audience at Earls Court.  The music is amazing with two additional songs not on the CD studio album. The book is a great piece to get a feel of what each member and producers thought about this whole concept.  The photos and vellum drawing that shows the set design is cool.
B00139W3NE|4.0|I've never read the original books by author Philip Pullman, but I heard much about them leading up to the release of this much anticipated film adaptation. One of the things I hate most about such pre-hype for a film like this is that you can't help but form biased opinions about the success or failure of the project even though you've yet to see it with your own eyes. Given that the original books were written as an expression of Mr. Pullman's atheist beliefs, which though I disagree with, I have the utmost respect for, and having heard that the movie had been changed to downplay that particular angle, I was afraid that what would be left would be a watered down, generic fantasy with a lot of special effects and action but little or no depth. So I'm happy to say that when I finally saw this film the other night, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, one of the gripes I do have with the film is that I'm not sure that it ever really provides the audience with a full understanding of what's at stake. We quickly learn that on this world, daemons are living, physical manifestations of a person's soul that walk alongside their human counterparts, appearing in animal form. There is also reference to Dust, which is believed to connect this world with the many other parallel worlds out there, and which is somehow related to why a child's daemon can change form at will but an adult's cannot. Lord Asriel, played in the film by current James Bond star Daniel Craig, believes that he can use this discovery as a way to travel between worlds. Meanwhile, Mrs. Coulter, portrayed in a wonderfully scary way by Nicole Kidman, represents the Magisterium, an organization that seeks to, for some unexplained reason, control people through their beliefs. The Magisterium also has been kidnapping children in an evil plot involving the children's daemons. Lyra, portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards, is Lord Asriel's niece, an orphan being raised at Oxford, who is given a device which is capable of discerning the truth of things. Lyra, along with her alethiometer, or golden compass, proves to be a child prophesied long ago who will ultimately determine the future of everyone.<br /><br />While I can sort of fill in the gaps on my own, I never felt satisfied that I had been given a firm explanation for the Magisterium and the full implications of their plan. I suspect that this is the point where the removal of any anti-religious content may have left a gap in the story, a missing piece that was left ambiguous rather than filling it with something contrived. That absence, along with parts of the story early on that felt a bit rushed, keep me from giving the story 5 stars. But it is beautiful visually, in some ways even more so than Lord of the Rings. The story is certainly more than exciting enough for the young and young at heart, and if you pay close attention, even with the missing allusions to the books original undercurrent, you can sense the message is still there, and I felt that was a very big plus.<br /><br />I will definitely be looking forward to the anticipated second film in the trilogy, and I think once you've seen it, so will you.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks, author of [[ASIN:1440471282 The Summoner]], and other booksle of discerning the truth of things.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|DA CD IS A CLASSIC I SUGGEST ALL TO GET IT, MRS HUDSON HAS A VOICE ON HER.
0810994739|5.0|My 9 year old daughter loves this series. I bought this for her as a Christmas gift and she was 130 pages deep by the second day. I can hear her laughing out loud in the other room while she is reading this book. I've already pre-ordered the next book in the series.
B0001I562I|5.0|This was another one of the movies that I had to have for my collection.  Another one that I grew up watching, and loved.  This is a great movie!!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Granted, I still have a lot of movies to see, but how it could get any more heartwarming than this is beyond me; and since I don't generally flock to those type of movies I think it's safe to say that this may be about as heartwarming as I'm going to see.  That said I think I should fill you in a little bit on my thoughts going into `WALL-E' before I tell you my take on the film.<br /><br />My best friend raved this movie.  He said that it was the greatest animated film he'd ever seen.  In fact, the world raved this movie, claiming it to be heaven-sent almost.  That hype scared me a little.  I hate hype, because it preordains a response from the audience.  If you invest in hype then you walk into a movie expecting to adore it, and if it falls short of your expectations in even the slightest way you walk away disappointed.  If you are the type to disregard hype you can walk into a film actively looking for reasons to rip it apart because you don't want the critics to be justified in their raves.<br /><br />The best thing to do is ignore everything and everyone until you've had a chance to see the movie and process it for yourself.<br /><br />So, with that said, I walked into `WALL-E' expecting to be let down.  Supposedly this is the greatest animated film ever and so I was expecting it to fall short of that praise and become just another overhyped mess that I didn't `get'.<br /><br />You know what; I got it.  Sure, this is not the greatest animated film ever.  This isn't even Pixar's greatest animated film (`Finding Nemo' anyone) but this has just as much spunk and just as much heart as their other offerings (minus the abomination that was `Cars').  What starts out as a beautiful look at loneliness and love transforms before our very eyes into a smart and satirical look at consumer waste and the deterioration of our society.  In short, `WALL-E' is a very interesting and poignant look at humanity and the innate desire to `live'.  Beautifully constructed and crisply animated, `WALL-E' is a splendor to watch and a film that will captivate and astonish you at times.  My daughter got bored and went to sleep (the slow sweeping silent scenes in the films beginning, while moving to adults, may be boring for small children) but I was engaged throughout the entire film.<br /><br />The film tells the story of WALL-E, a small waste management robot who has been scoping up Earth's trash and disposing of it for years while humans have been getting fat and lazy on cruise-ship-like spaceships for hundreds of years.  When a robot named EVE is sent to collect any living specimen from the desolate planet the two robots meet and form a relationship.  When EVE is taken back into space WALL-E follows her and sets himself up for a crazy adventure that makes him mankind's most unlikely hero.<br /><br />My one pet-peeve with the film is the fact that (SPOILERS PEOPLE) almost every robotesque film feels the need to go the route of, say, `iRobot', where the robots take over because they think they know better than humans.  It's just a little tired in my opinion, but whatever, it's not a huge deal.  There is rarely any originality out there today, and for the balance of the film `WALL-E' is very original, so it can afford to `go there'.<br /><br />I loved it.  I won't `rave' it as the best of anything.  It won't make my final five this year as far as `Best Picture' goes, but it is truly beautiful and an entertaining family film that parents and children (not too young) will really enjoy.  Hype doesn't always do a film justice, but this time hype is at least mostly justified.to watch and a film that will captivate and astonish you at times.

B001FB4W16|5.0|Robert Moore's review above was VERY accurate, but I think his 4 star rating tended to leave me feeling I needed to boost it to a full 5 stars.  The show is down to earth, provocative, with timely political overtones (vampire rights struggle similar to gay rights issues), etc.  In many ways, it seems more like a good story than a vampire tale.. vampires seem to take almost a back burner to the whole supernatural world, even though they're central to the plot.  Character development is stellar.  Sometimes it's hard to pick a favorite character between tough Tara, sassy Lafayette, sweet Grandma, or sensational Sookie.  Each and every one of them shows some backbone and vulnerability at the same time. Some sub-plots seemed to drag a bit too long for my taste (the v-fantasies, the demon subplot, etc), but the overall story was believable and credible.  If you watched the show first, as I did, you'll be very impressed.  There are definitely some differences in the books, though at least initially, the books follow much of the same story line, if missing a lot of the TV introduced side stories.  Spoiler alert:  do NOT read the books before the show, or simultaneously with the show, as they have different timings for revealing plot items which make it MUCH easier to learn what's really going on a LOT sooner than you otherwise should.  The show is DEFINITELY not suitable for minors.  Nudity, language, violence, and sexual tension or just outright sex make this not a show for the feint of heart or easily offended, either.  But, if you like vampires, like a good story, and like your limits pushed, this show is for you!  It's a perfect blend of taboo and tantalizing that will make it your next guilty pleasure.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack co-directed \\"King Kong\\" in 1933 and forged the first gargantuan beast on the rampage classic of the sound era. The success of their super-sized simian spectacle sired countless sequels, remakes, and imitations, notably \\"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\" (1953), \\"Godzilla\\" (1954), and \\"Gorgo\\" (1961). \\"King Kong\\" qualified as a New Deal in film-making. Nobody had made a movie about mammoth monsters since Harry Hoyt's landmark silent epic \\"The Lost World\\" (1925), based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel about an expedition into an imaginary land of dinosaurs. Cooper and Schoedsack hired special effects technician O'Brien, who had pioneered the stop-motion behemoths for \\"The Lost World,\\" to create their eponymous protagonist. During the 1930s and the 1940s, Hollywood filmmakers produced a number of movies about murderous apes. For example, Robert Florey helmed the risqu&eacute; Edgar Allan Poe film \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1932) about a mad scientist who wants to find a white woman as a bride for his ape.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" opens at night in New York Harbor. Aboard the Venture, Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher of \\"Topaze\\") warns Denham they must soon weigh anchor. \\"Insurance company found out we're carrying explosives the Marshal will be aboard tomorrow or the next day.\\" Denham fears if word leaks about the cargo, they'll be tied up for months. \\"With enough ammunition to blow up the harbor,\\" Englehorn complains, \\"What do you think the marshal will say to these new gas bombs of yours? Denham brags that he must have a starlet \\"because the public, bless them, must have a pretty face to look at.\\" He complains, \\"Isn't there any romance and adventure in the world without having a flapper in it?\\" The critics have told Denham that a love interest will generate twice as many receipts. \\"Alright, the public wants a girl, and I'm going to give them what they want.\\" Denham leaves the ship to search for a suitable woman for his film. He discovers a starving girl, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), who once worked as an extra in movies. A Times Square fruit vendor accuses Ann of stealing an apple. Denham pays for the apple, dissuades the vendor from taking legal action, and buys Ann a meal at all-night diner.<br /><br />As the Venture leaves New York, Ann approaches rough-hewn Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot of \\"Dodge City\\"), on deck where he clobbers her accidentally. Their relationship gets off to a rocky start. \\"I guess you don't think much of women on ship?\\" Ann says. \\"Women on ships,\\" Jack shrugs, \\"No, they're a nuisance.\\" Denham joins them on deck. Interestingly, Ann takes an interest in a little monkey called Iggy. She kneels to pet the spider monkey in what constitutes an ironic reversal on what happens to her when she encounters King Kong on Skull Island. Denham observes, \\"Beauty and the beast.\\" Meanwhile, Jack denies his love for Ann his infatuation in front of Denham. \\"You think I'm going to fall for any dame?\\" Denham knows better. \\"Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look, he cracks up and goes sappy. You're a pretty tough guy but if beauty gets you, I'm going right into a theme song here.\\" Denham outlines his picture. \\"The beast was a tough guy, too. He could beat the world, but when he saw beauty, she got him. He went soft. He forgot his wisdom and the little fellas licked him.\\" The Venture enters a thick, eerie fog bank surrounding Skull Island. Denham and company enter a village in the middle of a ceremony. The natives argue that their ceremony has been spoiled because of the appearance of these intruders. The chieftain and his followers spot Ann with her blond hair and demand that the whites make a gift of her to them for Kong.<br /><br />Safely back aboard the Venture, Denham and company relax. Later, they discover that the Skull Island natives sneaked aboard the Venture and abducted Ann so she can serve as their gift to King Kong. Englehorn arms the crew. The natives lash Ann to an altar. Forty-seven minutes into the film, we see King Kong's makes his initial appearance. He claims Ann as his prize and Denham and company pursue him.<br /><br />Denham is reluctant to leave Skull Island without Kong. \\"We came here to get a moving picture and we found something worth more than all the movies in the world.\\" No sooner do Jack and Ann appear than King Kong charges into sight. They shut and barricade the huge gates. Eventually, Kong breaks down the doors, chomps on three natives, knocks over a platform with warriors hurling spears at him, and crushes two natives under his foot. Denham resorts to a gas bomb to knock out Kong.<br /><br />At this point, \\"King Kong\\" leaps forward to New York City as ushers lead patrons who paid $20 a ticket to get in and see the giant ape. Jack and Ann are backstage with Denham and the press and Kong secured to a huge platform with chrome steel chains. Denham unveils Kong to the packed house. \\"He was a king and a god in the world he knew but now he comes to civilization merely a captive, a show to gratify your curiosity.\\" The photographers' flashbulbs set off King Kong. Kong breaks free of his restraints, stampedes out of the theater, grabs Ann and heads for the Empire State Building.<br /><br />Four bi-planes equipped with multiple machine guns soar off to the Empire State Building. Kong sets Ann aside and slaps the air at the planes as the gunners pour hails of gunfire into his humongous hulk of a body to no apparent effect. Weakened by the loss of blood, King Kong loses his grip on the tower and plummets to the earth. Carl Denham makes his way through the crowd and gazes at the corpse of the gorilla. He provides a memorable eulogy for Kong's demise: \\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\"<br /><br />The second DVD in this two-disc collection contains a massive 2 hour and forty-eight minute documentary about the production of the original King Kong that Peter Jackson made as a documentary on the vintage filming techniques of Cooper and Shoedsack.

0743496736|4.0|I love Jodi Picoult's books. She is such a good writer, but she can also be very stereotypical at times too. I am in high school and I can tell you that shy people do blend in, and unless they are jerks then they do not get picked on as much as Peter in this book by a long shot. Also, popular people do have true friends but they just tend to think about themselves more. Sometimes the things that the book portrayed about teenage life was right on and sometimes it was just not right at all.   But other than those things the book is amazing. You will fall in love with just about every character and the ending is *spoiler-ish* very very sad and very shocking but almost expected, I love it.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I have heard both good and bad concerning this album.  The good is that Taylor Swift has an amazing sound and is an appealing individual (in looks and music).  The bad is that her music is basically \\"teeny-bopper\\" country.  If one is willing to overlook the fact that yes her music is basic and isn't even \\"real\\" country music then I would say that it is a very enjoyable cd that can be listened to straight through.  I would recommend this cd to a friend.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I hadn't really heard much about this movie before seeing it other than seeing a trailer for it and knowing some of the critics didn't care much for it. I thought it was just fantastic! It's one of those movies just make you feel good. Whatever they said was wrong with the filming, singing or direction may have been true, but for me it just worked. It made me want to get up off the couch and dance and sing along.<br /><br />The scenery was absolutely gorgeous. The costuming was appropriate, the acting superb. (What's not to like about Meryl Streep?) The Abba music was wonderful and the singing was...well, they sing like the rest of us, and there was a certain charm to that.<br /><br />Mama Mia! I have to give this movie a two thumbs up.<br /><br />I found a Wii game that lets me dance and sing a bunch of the great songs from this movie and get some exercise in the process.  [[ASIN:B005LBDOLK ABBA You Can Dance]]
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie was an instant classic especially since the musical was so popular even before the movie came out.  This is one that could be watched over and over again without being boring.  I especially love it due to the dark nature of the film and how it presents a message of overcoming that darkness with kindness and beauty.  I would not recommend younger children seeing it but the rating of PG-13 suffices in that I believe a thirteen year old could handle it.  It's a great movie that is good to watch with a significant other.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had my doubts about ordering this video, but thought I could add it as a supplement to my regular workouts.  I do a bit of cardio first, maybe 1/2 hour on the bike, a walk or a X-country ski and then do this and it just kicks my butt.  I almost didn't start at level 1, but am glad I did.  Now I am alternating between the two and haven't even made it to level 3 yet and still feel like I'm getting a great workout.  If you want to work out with weights, but have limited time, this is a super workout!
1600241824|5.0|Be prepared to be embarassed as you are caught at a stop light laughing hysterically while other drivers stare quizzically at you!  For me, it was the same stop light each day on my drive to work - invariably, I was laughing out loud, by myself, in my car.  David Sedaris' quick, cutting wit will have you nodding in agreement and laughing out loud, too.  I can't imagine anyone else reading these stories aloud with the same sarcasm and wit.  Everyone will find some story or detail to which s/he can identify.  My first Sedaris' audio book - what a great introduction to a funny man!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I enjoyed this. Ther are really two books here. The first is a tale of life in Stalins Russia. The other is a murder mystery. The end is a bit contrived but for a first novel it was quite an impressive debut. I found it to be worth reading.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I was impressed by the cast (and having never been able to see the play) willing to \\"Take a Chance\\" on \\"Mamma Mia!\\"  I am so glad I did.  I rarely purchase DVD's to own unless the film REALLY impresses me in some way.  This one did.  Not only does it bring back memories from my high school days (YES!  I was an ABBA fan!) but it was just plain fun!  It looked as if the actors were having a fabulous time and so did I!  Uplifting and entertaining - what a pleasant surprise!
0316776963|5.0|One mark of a great book is when you laugh out loud alone.  This book accomplishes the feat, and my main complaint is that it didn't last longer.  Sedaris is an engaging presenter live, and I'd suggest watching or listening to him speak before reading the book.  You'll understand the comic timing and the absurdity of some of the stories more.  Highly recommended.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I love the Gilmore Girls wit and banter and this season was no exception. If you've ever watched the Gilmore Girls before then you are sure to love this last season. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel once again make a mother daughter pair to die for!
B001F12J48|1.0|The original movie and DVD were very good. The 3D version is another matter. To say this is poor is an understatement. Do not buy it. Check the blogs first. I wish I had. This movie (3D version) is not watchable. I have tried it on multiple TVs and DVD players. It is full of ghost images and characters with 4 eyes and 4 eyebrows. Save your money - buy the original version.

B000ETQR3Q|3.0|The Nerf N-Strike Longshot is Durable and easy to put together.  It would of been nice to know the small gun that attaches only shoots one shot at a time.  the long shot will jam if you try to shot to fast in a battle.  Over all I think the price is a little high for all the better it shoots  I bought 2 for my grandsons and the small Nerf guns they got were more accurate then the long shot
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I haven't been this disappointed in a Loooooooong time! This movie was awful and very predictable. It's not the same Indiana Jones that I love. Indiana Jones and Aliens? Who knew!
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|good price, familly was happy to have it for Christmas, it was delivered before the expected time and i was verry pleased
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I liked this movie because it didn't make me fall asleep like some newer action movies out there. I most likely will buy it and add it to my collection. I'm glad I waited to see at home and didn't pay to see it on the big screen.
0930289234|5.0|A fantastic work of countless twists and turns. Truly great artwork and story line make Watchmen a graphic novel that deserves to be re-read over and over again.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|The Movie was fantastic and the soundtrack is music to my ears...The soundtrack got my boyfriend in to the Beatles (he's a hip hop fan) and we own the movie on blu-ray. Needless, to say this album will stay in my collections for many years to come. It was worth the money the first time and I will be re buying it because I sadly misplaced it while moving :(
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|I can make that claim after having seen every Bond movie, for better or for worse.  There is simply no Bond movie that is start to finish action like this one, and no Bond quite like Daniel Craig. Its a new direction for the franchise, but one that needed to happen, and it is executed almost flawlessly.  In my opinion, many Bond movies tended to lean towards an almost feminine-Bond, but Craig is an evolved combo of might and muscles, and although he is a far more serious Bond, I think its what the series needs for believability.<br /><br />You arent going to break into this movie slowly, and it doesnt let up for the entire ride.  This is no small feat with a movie this long, and if this is the direction the Bond movies are taking, sign me up.
0545128285|5.0|The book was as stated and shipped to me in a timely fashion.  Good service.
0385340990|5.0|Juliet Ashton, a writer from London, wrote a much needed light-hearted newspaper column under the name Izzy Bickerstaff during WW ll. Her writings were later published as a much read book. While looking for her next subject, she receives a letter from a native of Guernsey, the Channel Island that was occupied by the Germans during the War. The inhabitants were cut off from society: no radios, they lived on turnip soup and without spoiling anything, they formed the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society to cope with life.<br /><br />This novel depicts life for Juliet and the islanders via letters. It can be read in short spurts as letters are no longer than 3 pages. You will want to read more than one letter at a time. The story is both entertaining, witty and a history lesson. Mary Ann Shaffer, an editor and librarian wrote this book with her niece, Annie Burrows, a childrens book author. Mary Ann's health failed while she was writing the book which caused her to have Annie assist in finishing the book. Unfortunately she did not live to see the book published. She was inspired to write this book after a visit to Guernsey. There is a memorial fund set up in her name to assist female authors.<br /><br />Guernsey is a very clever book and self effacing - which makes it a delight. Since it's set in England I'm giving myself license to call it a delight. (Regression: Wasn't there a line in Wuthering Heights, where marriage is accepted because \\"he's handsome and a delight to be with\\"?) The words flow. The characters are well developed. The setting is well-established. You'll want to believe these are real people and you'll want to spend time with them. This work is heartfelt and enjoyable.
0780626966|5.0|I recieved this for Christmas this year and loved it. The bonus booklet that comes with the set is very interesting in regards to fun facts about the series and script notes. I have always been a fan of these movies as opposed to the 'Halloween' movies so for me this gift was perfect. There is also a bonus disk included that you can use in your CD rom drive on your computer that includes a game. The set also insludes two sets of 3D glasses for one of the disks    Also, I read through some of the reviews and must admit that even though this series can at times be a little hokey its a classic in my mind. Alot of the individuals leaving such negative comments are forgeting that we're reviewing the item, not the movies themselves..( the old saying 'everyone's a critic sure does show in this case)    Please recognize this iotem for what it is: A much loved set of movies put in a box set, no more than that. So if you dont like the movies, dont buy the item
B00005JPGO|5.0|Wow, after seeing this I just had to recommend it to everybody. The story is riveting and the acting is superb.(especially Djimon Hounsou) This is one of my favorite movies. I highly encourage everyone to buy it, or at least watch it.
B001NB6IN8|2.0|I loved the first two albums and even though the preview didn't thrill me I thought it might grow on me. Well it didn't, it just isn't good this time around. Most of the songs sound very bland, lacking the catchy beats of previous material.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|First let me say that the content on the disc itself is great, but Amazon is not being completely honest with it's product descriptions.     On the top of the page, it says that the disc format is DVD, but if you buy it, there is a possibility that they will send you a burned DVD-R instead of a pressed DVD disc. This can be an issue because DVD-Rs are not as durable over time and some DVD players cannot read them.     You can tell if you received a DVD-R if it is a purple backed DVD-R disc. I didn't even realize this was a possibility until I opened the package and saw it since the product description doesn't even mention it except for in small print at the bottom of the page. I'm disappointed that Amazon couldn't shell out for a release of consistent quality.    UPDATE: Amazon recently changed the DVD logo on the top of the product page to DVD-R making the product description more accurate.
076790382X|2.0|After reading \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything,\\" I became a fast fan of Mr. Brysons writing style. I felt that he inserted humor and wit with accurate fact.    However, this book takes on a very hostile, almost scathing review of the USA. I pity the foreign reader on what seems to be a very downtrodden review of the United States as a whole.     Granted after not living in his country of birth for over twenty years, it is not nearly as terrible as Mr. Bryson makes it out to be.     The book starts out with humor and wit, and turns sharply to a very disappointed view of what the USA has become in his absence. The book is riddled with what seems to be one constant complaint about everything and anything. I am sorely unsatisfied with the contents, and would not recommend this piece due to it's brief chapters and sore dissatisfaction with living in America.
B000002QWD|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  It's the music I grew up listening to as a child.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for the good old days Christmas music.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|IT WAS EXACLTLY WHAT SHE WANTED FOR MY PRESENT . SHE WAS A HUGE FAN BUT THE DVD WAS IN THE VAULT AND I COULDNT FIND IT. PERFECT COPY WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL INSERTS. DVD CAME TO MY PLACE WITH NO INCIDENT OR DELAY
B0001I55NS|4.0|This was an outstanding SCI-FI movie . The acting was very good and the plot was excellent. Great special effects and a stong cast. The DVD Was in good shape and played well. Great deal for .88c
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|Before I begin I will say that the movie is AMAZING. This rating is for the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD and not the movie itself.<br /><br />I received this as a Christmas gift so I don't feel cheated but if I had purchased this item with my own money I would have asked for my money back.<br />With so much amazing guerrila campeigning that was done for this movie and all neat little features you could find pretty much everywhere you turned leading up to it's release you would expect a whole slew of special features (or at leasting include all the specials they showed on TV and the Internet) but instead you get two VERY short segments that do nothing more then glaze over some details on the production and you get all 5 GCN specials...that's it.<br /><br />I ignore the IMAX footage because your average joe will not give a care AT ALL. To me, it looked like fullscreen...nothing special.<br /><br />I have to say I am really insulted that they would try and sell people this. To add more salt on the wound they include they new thing that several studios think is somehow a brilliant idea, a Digital Copy of the movie. You know all the people who would actually care about having a Digital Copy? You know all the people who make their own Digital Copies with 3rd party programs? Ya turns out their the same people, everyone doesn't need a stupid Digital Copy on their special feature disc to fill up all the data space that COULD have been used for some real features.<br /><br />What the hell happened? Batman Begins Special Edition box had some AMAZING special features and this...well this is just a spit in the face.<br /><br />PS: Don't expect Audio Commentary, I don't know why but Nolan doesn't do Audio Commentaries on the Batman films...which was fine for Batman Begins due to all the great special features, not so much here.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|This review is not about the show itself, others have already commented on that and I can't really add anything that they haven't said, it's just a primo show. This review is on the product of the Season One dvd set. 12 episodes on 4 discs and then some bonus features on disc four which includes the first few episodes of \\"Brotherhood\\" and a real life blood splatter mini documentary. As for the rest of the set, the main menus are pretty cut and dry with episode lists and audio setup. Unfortunately, I can't find anywhere to turn on subtitles/captioning for those few hard to hear moments. The discs are one sided with selected stills of Dexter facing up on the discs. So for the set itself, a good strong 4 stars but only due to the lack of captioning. For the show itself, top notch 5 stars.

B0007X6ST2|4.0|First, the sound quality: Bob Ludwig is one of the best mastering engineers in the business, but there is only so much he can do with a poor master. This album suffers from poor recording, poor mixing, and possibly poor recording technology. It has all the earmarks of early digital -- especially the tizzy and brittle high frequencies. Ludwig seems to have filtered these out somewhat, bringing the midrange to the fore. That makes Sting's voice more natural. Generally, the sax and keyboards do not have the definition and impact they should. The drums come through with a fair amount of impact, though the timbre of the drums is not at all natural. You can hear the bang and the \\"thwack\\" but not so much the skin and the distinctive metallic shimmer of the cymbals, which sound more like white noise. In other words, the remaster tries to minimize some of the deficiencies of the original recording, but it cannot remake the record. The microphones were perhaps poorly placed or poorly equalized, and the instruments arise out of a kind of indistinct general foggy cloud. The piano and sax were mixed a little too low at times -- lacking body and not cutting through in the mix during solos -- especially the keyboards.<br /><br />OK, the sound is what it is. We can't change it. But your enjoyment will not suffer much if you buy the old out-of-print first CD release. Yes, the remaster is better. Not massively better.<br /><br />These concerts were recorded in France and Italy in 1985. Sting chose a band of some of the finest jazz players for his bass, keyboard, drum and sax backing band. Sting plays electric guitar on this tour. After all the critical things I said about the sound, the band itself is great. The songs are recognizable tunes from Sting's Police and early solo days. But here they are re-imagined, re-arranged, and in many cases amped up in energy. The drumming in particular has both the slam and slap of rock but also the intricacy and subtlety and syncopation of jazz. The late Kenny Kirkland's piano/keyboard solos are energetic and rhythmic and complex. Branford Marsalis adds a harmonious saxophone counterpoint to Sting's voice.<br /><br />This may be the best band Sting has ever played with. There is much to recommend this set. It has a great deal of energy and infectious musical grooves. The arrangements are, as I said, different and imaginative -- though more jazzy/bluesy at times. Highly recommended on this basis.<br /><br />If you want to hear the subtleties, you'll have to listen hard through the muddle of a mediocre recording. I've heard bootlegs that sound better than this. Still, it's very enjoyable, it's a great concert, and worth hearing if you like Sting/Police much at all.irkland's piano/keyboard solos are energetic and rhythmic and complex.

0091922348|5.0|Great book with original recipes. Lots of tasty salad-type dishes, just like their shops in London. Amazon never seems to have it in stock. Tip: order it from Amazon.uk; it's roughly the same price.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This was an excellent gift for my wife. She has enjoyed the various episodes on the first and second season. This was a complete set in a nice velvet pink case...which she also loved, with tons of laughs and insight. I would recommend this set for any women who loves Sex in the city.
