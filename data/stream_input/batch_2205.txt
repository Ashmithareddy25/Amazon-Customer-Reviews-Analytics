B006MW3UZW|4.0|Brilliant, good British soap, can not wait for season 4 ,get hooked and watch all the chapters and all seasons
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I had multiplication homework and I was super tired and my mom refuses to buy a calculator so I went on my app store and searched calculator and this app came up so I downloaded it. my homework was done in 5 minutes and my mom never found out
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Excellent as always. Two of the songs are previous releases with a new twist with just enough difference to make them a pleasure to  listening to again.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great game to play when you need to kill a few minutes of your day. It can be a little addicting to slash all that fruit, though!
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Great chick flick with an equally great cast!  Definitely recommend this movie for an entertaining girls' nite gathering with a happy ending.
B00B2QA9TI|3.0|The way it's filmed is very different and honestly I wasn't expecting it. I did like the movie but it was very sad and depressing.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the best. I love this game. Its easy to understand and easy to play! I love seeing my favorite ponies!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a pretty good facebook app but sometimes it doesn't refresh when I ask it to, and I know I have a notification. I wish it would sync with your kindle to tell you when you have a new notification.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|I really like this game and I got it for free because it was the free app of the day and it is fun. But sometimes you can get frustrated with this game because the ball can fall off easily and then you have to start from the beginning because there are no checkpoints.
0374532281|3.0|I don't think it'll rank up there with the classics, but the book tells a pretty good story.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It gives good insight into the thinking of a mentally ill person, which made me more sympathetic as to what they go through.<br />- It allows you to better understand why people waste time and money going to sporting events.<br />- You'll likely feel better about your family after experiencing this guy's dad (the father in the movie played by De Niro is completely different.)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Not too original.  It's funny that the main character reflects on Holden Caulfield a lot, because he was reminding me of that character almost from the beginning.<br />- I found it irritating that he refers to the mental health facility as the \\"bad place\\".  It had a cutesy Forrest Gump feel to it that felt contrived and out of character.
1608955702|5.0|This book is a must have for all photographers. Neil's book is refreshing, insightful, well written, easy to understand.<br /><br />Great images show the results of step by step instructions.<br /><br />I have been a pro photographer for over 30 years and have many books on lighting. Neil's books are the best because they are so user friendly and well thought out I find myself using his books as a reference over and over. Good initial read and great resource.<br /><br />Highly recommended! This is Neil's best book yet. Bravo!

B001EN71HC|4.0|Mike Myers and Michael York star in these comedies.<br />These films focus on groovy, secret agent, Austin<br />Powers and his adventures battling arch nemesis,<br />Dr. Evil. These are good spy spoofs and Myers is<br />great as both Austin and Dr. Evil. All films have<br />nice picture and sound plus neat extras.<br />I recommend this set.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I'm not sure how I got this far in life without having read this book. A classic Christie mystery - loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a nail-biting adventurous story of a tragic game called \\"the Hunger Games\\" which is a awful game for 12-18 year olds in the country of Panem.<br />READ THIS BOOK!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I am someone who does not watch many sitcoms on TV. After hearing many good things about the Big Bang Theory and its excellent cast, I decided to check out Seasons One and Two from our local library. By the end of the second episode,  I was hooked! I purchased Season Three after finding it perpetually checked out at the library (I had finished the first two seasons). Having now seen all five seasons on DVD, I can say that they are all excellent but that Season Three is one of my favorites! Great plot lines and character development.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The game was fun for a while and past time while waiting around for people but got boring after a week or so.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Amazing story of a modern day Hero, Poet and Musician, Rodriguez, a REAL human being, who truly &#34;Walks his Talk&#34; and lives according to his own Truth. Truly Spiritual and Transcendent.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I just do not understand why someone would think this was fun or interesting.  I see this as being violent not funny.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|the door is left open for a sequel,  but could just be the end. while i am a fan of the original michael keaton, i loved the christian bale version. i don't want to spoil the ending, but any new will not be an you expect going into the movie. enjoy and watch again!!
B006MW3UZW|1.0|Actually I enjoyed it but had to watch it on my PC from the PBS website as Amazon did not provide CC.  It seems Amazon is late and slow getting CC coverage on their shows.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|and if we can keep this queen and the snow white from &#34;mirror, mirror&#34; we might have a more perfect movie. it was ok...not my favorite.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Another fantastic role done by Denzel Washington - it kept me fascinated during the entire movie, and I was nicely surprised by the end twist.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|loved the story, good for girls of all ages, disney at disney best, it will remind you of someone (may even be you!!) stubborn mom and child.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I purchased this book on a whim and it was finished in one day.  It was difficult to put the book down!
B005LAII0I|3.0|she was seriously cast against type. the movie was cute, but nothing earthshaking, a one watch movie. on the other hand, it IS julia roberts. that's worth something.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I did like like this book as much as I expected too.  I was looking forward to reading it but I think it was hyped up too much and I was disappointed.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|because i just buy sci-fi and it look interesting and i kept waiting for it to get better. it didn't, so just save your money...
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Awesome....love the music, love getting is so fast.  Cloud is awesome way to do it!  Can't wait to get this DVD.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Liam Neesom  in a stellar performance, very intense. i would not let my young children watch it. the character obviously respected his adversary.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|It focuses on people who have been thrown into a hostile environment and showcases how they develop interests that help them deal with their situation in as positive of a manner as possible.  I find it to be very encouraging!!!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|they make a terrific pair and i know if i ever see either of them in real life, i will start looking at alends. not as good as the first, but a ripping good tale for all that.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These easily costs $2-3 per battery in store. Here you get 5 for the same price as 1. Mine came with an expiration of 6/2018 (I ordered in 2/2013). Voltages were good on the two I opened.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|ok, so it's based on an old edgar rice burroughs, from an age of more (not always, but generally) simplistic sci-fi, but this movie was just silly. no realy science and not much imagination. this is one of disney's better films. this is for very young kids and in this day and age, it may be too juvenile for them....
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A good, quick read that keeps you engaged but not engrossed. Stick with it... It is a good little story.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|another spy gone wrong story. but really? you watch, you decide.  i liked it, it was better than richard gere's effort.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel is a great actor and he is what makes the movie great.  The flight and crash scenes were amazing and so was the charter of the Capt.  I also felt quite sad for many of the characters whom had just thrown most of their lives away.<br />Overall, it was exciting but also caused pause to consider the lives of the characters and what could have been.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|i recommended this heartwarming story to all my sci-loving friends. that this was based, in part, on an old richard matheson tale, didn't hurt. (richard matheson: &#34;i am legend&#34; made into 3 movies, the omega man, the incredible shrinking man, etc) richard matheson stories seem to have a redemption at the end and this is no exception.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|this was a great follow up to part 1 and leaves Batman's story ready for continuing adventures or a general end that should leave people pleased.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|what is up with taking old fairy tales and redoing them: more action, more blood 'n' guts, romance. i liked the story, but couldn't we have done little blue cloaK?
B009GEOLM4|5.0|this story is one i was happy to see come to animated movies and wish they would make this into a big screen adaptation.
B007L6VR12|4.0|and laugh longly and outloud. it isn't going to be for everyone, but if you are willing to accept the absolute absurd and have an odd ball sense of humor, this could be for you. and if you want to see bruce willis with highwaters and white socks, then definitely. that alone will make ya laugh
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is just another in a great series. I find myself going through it all times of the day.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|with good actors, and the ending caught me by surprise. i no longer buy a movie just because a particular acftor is in it, but this is an actor always worth a second look. and this is a movie worth a second look.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|If you want a movie that will entertain you with fight scenes and good stunts then this is for you, just wish the ending was better.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|i am pretty well read, watch lots of movies and can generally figure them out way in advance (which in no way lessens my enjoyment) but the ending of this movie left me with &#34;oh, no that can't be!) but it was..... this is not an action thriller, so if you can handle a slower paced movie, you might try this.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It's fun to play,but it gives you like 15 minutes to play ,but still it's fun! Play it you will be happy.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|we had forgotten it was the oscars (don't watch them anyway) and at the end, my husband exclaimed, &#34;this deserves to be the best picture!&#34; we did not know till the next day that it actually did win.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|Great game for Pac man people who love Mario kart and Pac man games. Fast action game and fun for when you want racing action.
B002LC2DQ4|1.0|i bought this without realizing that i would not work in my older olympus, which only takes m 1gb. i think it would be ok if i knew someone that needed it, but i can't guarantee, so won't sell it.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|This movie ended in a manner that I did not expect.  It was very interesting and made me appreciate my life more.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|outstanding cast, marvelous script, exotic location. this was, i think, my pick for movie of the year last year. while good for most all ages, especially for women over 50. i loved it and so did my husband.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Contrived scenes, a little seedy at times with the drug use and a somewhat slow in plot but overall good movie.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|she only picks out the very best, so i got it for her. she loved it on tv, so merry christmas. i will get to watch it when i visit this year.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Protects screen from damage when closed & gives some drop protection as well. Also can be used to prop the kindle up for hands free viewing in landscape mode (nice 4 videos).
B008EQIEWS|3.0|but not by much, another fight amongst the gods.with all the in-fighting, it's a wonder to me that the world, according to greek, roman, norse and other myths, ever got created.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|Over all a good product with only one small complaint. I wish the pouches were actually molle pouches instead of sewn in so I could raise them just a bit higher.
B00821OX98|5.0|Enjoyed every episode.  Was glad that I gave it a try.  Will for sure watch season 2.  It's very well done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Season 3 doesn't disappoint, but I do wish the conclusion were a little more creative, since the writing is typically superb.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I rented this movie for my kids. We all loved it. Video quality was very good. Streaming process was good and uninterrupted.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I could relate to a little part of the action he expierence and wrote about on Okinawa. I was there just after the island was secured. I saw the remnents of his action and he is dead on in his desription.Good book.<br /><br />joe frank
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know what to say but, what? It was kind of gross and sweet(?) And BTW when u read this it will stick with u forever no doubt about it...
B000FC13MM|5.0|I keep going back to this book, I've bought it three times. A great read!  Now I have it on my kindle!
B003WC5EQI|1.0|I thought I would enjoy this series, but boy was I wrong. I love period shows, but this one didn't work for me at all. It was depressing to start and it just went down hill from there. Don't keep watching this hoping that it will get better, because it won't. Without giving too much away, the ending is just as horrible as the entire show.
B007P6VM04|5.0|DEF GREAT ONE TO BUY WHETHER YOU ARE A FAN OF SMASH OR NOT. LOVE ALL THE SONGS. GREAT MIX OF SONGS FROM BOMBSHELL AND FAVES SUNG BY THE CAST. BOUGHT ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR MY MOTHER :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I actually had no idea about the Hunger Games series until I saw the first trailer for the film. I immediately purchased the Kindle books and was astonished. I know the series is geared towards young adults (much like Twilight) but it has such poignant relations to politics and society that I found myself enthralled in the story. The characters are incredibly relate-able and easy to follow... The entire story gripped me and even made me cry at points. One of those book series that is a must read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|1st book gets you interested, but this book keeps you reading wanting more, couldnt wait to purchase the third book
B0001I561E|5.0|I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this item to anyone interested in buying this fantastic movie. :)
B007FROGME|4.0|Whilst this seemed a bit slow to start with I eventually got into it and it opened my eyes to what went on in Russia under Stalin. Almost makes you wonder if they may have been better off under Hitler!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My wife and daughters are constantly playing this on my wife's iPhone, sometimes to the detriment of those around them. I remember many a lonely night, or a cold, tasteless meal of PB&J while my family focused on &#34;getting that last level.&#34; After years of watching them enjoy it, and slack off, I thought I'd get in on some of that action.<br /><br />Overall, the game is fun, and doesn't attempt to be more than it is. I dislike mobile games that try to bring an &#34;immersive experience.&#34; All I really want is something that will kill time, and free my mind of the shackles of being a conservative, middle-class, Caucasian male living in America in a post-ObamaCare world. Life is already boiling over with immersion; I don't need more of it.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Good move by Tom Clancy to continue his novels through the son of his main character Jack Ryan, allows us to continue and enjoy his world affair dramas. Like All Tom Clancy novels it is an easy read with plenty of political intrigue and armed conflict.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I will wear this one out! Love it love it love it. Completely satisfied. I have returned to buy and give this one away!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Amazing book! Love the main characters. Great writing, passing very intense images.<br />Can't wait to start the third one tonight.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|I own a bull terrier. Frankenweenie (Sparky) is a bull terrier. The movie was cute and very predictable. I think children would enjoy this movie.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The ending needs help; perhaps a way ahead would be the proper method of working with such an iconic character.
B000286RKW|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and he took a few hours off and seemed to really enjoy the movie
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can hardly wait for season four.  I like the twists and turns an dthe unexpected surprised.  The actors fit the roles.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I love sci-fy movies and this one was entertaining but not one I can go off the hook for. In my opinion this is one of those movies you at least watch once but then you forget about it.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly clarkson greatest hits already. It was surprising there was only one representative from my December. Great songs can't wait for more
B005PK56TA|3.0|...can take it or leave it, but I'm a big fan of Dylan McDermott ever since his days in &#34;The Practice&#34;.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This soundtrack blew me away I liked the movie. The movie was good too.  I liked the music and the variations from the original,songs
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My eight yr old daughter was exited about this game.  I started helping her and end up playing myself!  Fun for everyone.
0785163174|5.0|Great story the two great teams taking on one another, a major shake up for the marvel universe.  Great story
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie..plot..acting..intrigue..Brings back memories of those trying times..worth watching for sure..maybe even twice..we really enjoyed watching it...thank you amazon..once again
B001OMJGD0|3.0|Great movie and too bad it is underrated as a good movie great story on the return of a legend.  Routh did a great job as superman
0062086529|5.0|I love that in a world of screens and technology there is still a children's book that encourages drawing an imagination that kids really like.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|Good movie. I really did not like the ending seemed so out of character for Bruce Wayne at the end. I didn't really care for the characterization of bane
146500632X|5.0|My daughter just loved it. She like 1 Direction a lot and she has bought their CDs, their videos, t-shirts and now the calendar. We got it in perfect condition and rapidly.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is a fun album with fun songs on it.  I really like the revenge songs those are always fun
B00340LM8C|4.0|Cary is his usual smooth self - Grace is beautiful. Great plot - Someone is emulating now retired jewel thief Cary 'the cat' and stealing jewels along the Rivera. Cary has to catch the thief and expose the thief to the authorities.
B008R14YBK|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this album at first thinking a Disney star trying to expand her time in the sun. Was I wrong good album
B0063M22QO|5.0|This app is both fun and chalenging. It is colorful and the little tones it plays add to the enjoyment. Before I tried this app I had never played MahJong before. The rules are actually simple and few in number. This makes for easy play and it is money well spent for a plesant diversion.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|The first one was good. This one was just plain nuts and very difficult to follow the story seemed to jump around
B003CI90MQ|5.0|I found out I was making many mistakes and all the answers on fixing them were here. I love that Scott is giving tips and answers on how to take the best photos without the in depth classroom material.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|well written, the best batman animated series I've ever seen. Loved the girl Robin! She was awesome. Had the Sin City feel.
B00821OX98|5.0|It was a cool show even though it was a lot like a soap. the graphics were outstanding. I saw all of this season.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|well written, the best batman animated series I've ever seen. Loved the superman vs batman battle! Had the Sin City feel.
B006QS07IK|1.0|The main reason I bought this book is because I wanted an attractive copy of Frankenstein. Approaching this through a mere aesthetic point of view, I was very disappointed. This book had absolutely horrible binding. The picture was glued on the front as if by a three year old child (crookedly) and was already beginning to peel off the moment I removed the packaging. The plastic (yes, it is plastic) that covers the book was very scuffed and peeling off very visibly. All in all, I was utterly disappointed and immediately returned the book. If you are looking to add a beautiful copy of this classic book to your own personal library just keep looking. This is not the book.
B007SNYQFC|5.0|Ridley Pearson is a great author. Captivating plot along with amazing forensic detail. If you ever wondered how arson is detected, this will get you up to speed on the subject.<br />L
1934030198|4.0|I haven't started using this yet, but I anticipate it's gong to be awesome!  Especially if it's anything like his book!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Very interesting and spooky for you horror fans! Good story line. I have not seen a horror movie quite like this. Has a very wild surprise ending!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I totally loved both Season 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey, but I don't understand why I watched them for free and have to pay to watch Season 3.<br /><br />Can you explain?
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Absolutely brilliant book, perfectly captures the pathos of childhood cancer and teenage cynicism. Well written, excellent characters, perfect mix of wit and emotion.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Great selection! Two CDs. Fast delivery! Satisfied with my order. Will come back if something else needed. Low price is also a benefit!
B007TK77QE|4.0|It's hard to beat Harry Potter but this adult novel is not bad. It takes an in depth look at a small British town and how one man's death brings up a host of issues. Perhaps she tries to deal with too much as she goes into poverty, drug abuse, teenage problems, adoption, OCD behavior, divorce etc etc, although the story is interesting and well written. The ending is a bit weak and lets down the story. Worth a read anyway.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|If you like British humor, you'll love this movie!  Filled with irony.  You do have to think when watching the movie to catch a lot of the humor.  Great family movie.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|An unconventional love story, the Pilgrimage of Harold Fry has an original and fresh story, excellent characters and it is very esay for the reader to get emotionally involved. Definitely recommended!!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|A wonderful movie.  Exceptional computer graphics!  Great story with spectacular music. Definitely 5 stars!<br />I really enjoyed this movie.<br />Deborah
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for horse lovers its like taking care of the real one just easier to take with you and the movement is fantastic!!!!!!!
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I bought this 3 cd set for my brother and he was very happy with it. Priced this set elsewhere and this was the best priced...Love it...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|There are many who call this type of writing heresy and indeed this shows little Christian overtones. And yet on reading this and the experience of Eben I could not help thinking how much his experience related to biblical descriptions of heaven (Isaiah) and how the core of his message affirms all that Jesus taught us - we are connected and we are loved.<br /><br />Open your heart and your mind and you will find even &#34;Godless&#34; science affirms what we know from Revelation and Sacramental encounters with God.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I got addicted to this show on netflix and had to buy the 5th season on amazon. I love John Hamm.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The album  contains many of the old favorites and some less familiar.  Disc one is more swingy, while disc two more mellow.
1616550414|5.0|Great History over all, HD art pictures i dunno how to put evething in to words but i can for sure say that i love the book and i'm really happy i did buy it :3
B006M4F67A|1.0|Just like all the other 24/7 Games LLC, it freezes up in the middle of a game, then it restarts on a new game.  Waste of time
B0064X7FVE|4.0|great app, i use it often always like to know what the day will be like can use multi  towns or cities.
0307891402|5.0|good job. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Collector's Edition: Prima Official Game Guide like new love it love it. and the map.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I love the twilight series. I just wish that they followed the book a little closer than what they do. I wouldn't care if each movie was 4 hours long if it went by the book. But all the same I love them........
0812993357|1.0|I am only about one third into the book but it has been so boring so far that I thought I'd check the reviews to see if other readers thought that it got more interesting as one went on.  Apparently not.  I loved Grace in \\"The September Issue\\".  I love her work in Vogue.  I was so looking forward to loving this book.  Not even close.
B0056369RO|4.0|It has some decent pop music dance tunes that are familiar to friends from the clubs.  This makes it enjoyable for throwing house parties.
B008N1LL42|3.0|I like this movie because the music makes it great, but it seems like Peter Berg uses the same kind of music that Jon Favreau uses for the Iron Man movies. The acting is not at it's best, but I do appreciate the premise behind this Hasbro inspired flick!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Rules of fight club! Tyler Dearden is a pretty crazy bad ass dude. Read the book and have watch the movie.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|(Vague Spoiler at the end of this review).<br /><br />I've been intrigued with the phenonmenon of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY since the first one.  I love the idea that they made a neat little film on no budget using security cameras and managed to create some genuine chills.<br /><br />That was the first one.  The second one wasn't bad.  The third one only had one or two moments that worked.<br /><br />But the fourth one is starting to drag it all down.  Introducing new characters (neighbors to Katie and Hunter) didn't further the storyline at all.  Just as PA3 didn't move it forward (since it was set in the past before PA and PA2), PA4 didn't move anything forward and it was AFTER everything.<br /><br />I know there will be PA5 come this Halloween, and why not?  They keep making money, at least enough to keep cranking them out.<br /><br />But they're starting to creak and show signs of wear.  They'll need to do something different.  And, please, don't end another one with deadpan witches all converging on a camcorder.  You've done that.  Twice now.
B000HA9L9O|5.0|Firefly is a wonderful sci-fi series that could have went on for years.  The characters are interesting, fun and entertaining.
0307743659|5.0|I originally read the Stand many years ago.  It is one of the few Stephen King books I reread every so often.  Was concerned that the additional material would take away from the story.  Nope!  I read ever word (something I usually don't do with S. King novels); enthralling from the very beginning.  Hated to see it end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is an app that I use when I have only a short 5-10 minutes of free time.<br />FUN, fun, fun
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Free version didn't last long at all. Wouldn't bother getting it as you don't get much without paying!!! But u played was good though.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Ip Man is a great movie with alot of action and great philosophies on life.The sequals are just as good<br />and need to be seen to get the whole story. Buy them and see what is to be said about these movies<br />for yourselves.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Action packed drama - that I really liked!  Not blood, guts & gore, nor a shoot em up, blow em up drama.  In fact there was only 2 death scenes that I remember - and no blood splatter at all!
B004X4QW42|5.0|IP Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is not  only a great movie but, it also shows how we should respect<br />one another. Great action, great philosophy as well. Buy it and see the greatness for yourselves.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Nothing like the older 007 flix.  Spent a lot of time on relationships. Many slow parts in this cat and mouse game.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Awesome movie truly an amazing film. Would finely recommend it to a friend. Nice twist as well, great graphics. Does not really tie in to the past two transformers too much
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|I don't understand why this movie was so critically acclaimed.  Inappropriate scenes, very boring.  My whole family missed the point of this movie and was glad when it finally ended.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I'm glad they gave that really good song &#34;say you say me&#34; by Lionel Richie an opportunity to be made into a film. And it won an oscar! Good for him. I don't know what the Russian ballet guy and Gregory Hines are doing in this movie. If it's called White Nights, why is there a black man on the cover. Why are they running, are they running from Lionel Richie? I'm going to assume that Lionel Richie is chasing those two men as the plot of the film. I can't believe Amazon publishes all the ridiculous reviews I write
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Very reminiscent of Mad Max movies.  Anyone with religious faith would appreciate this account of the &#34;survival&#34; of the word of God.
1582701709|3.0|There's no need to buy this book. The secret has already been spoiled by other reviewers on amazon. You now know what the secret entails. This is a worse spoiler than that &#34;snape kills dumbledore&#34; internet meme from 2004-2005 or whenever.<br /><br />This is the same self-help book you saw in the waiting room for electroshock therapy. It's about wanting to do good stuff and then doing it. And then people liking you for doing good stuff. You learn good manners in kindergarten. And in kindergarten, you got to eat cool snacks and watch awesome cartoons. This book provides neither of these things to you. Also, for some reason my copy of the book has an afterword, and all it says is &#34;haha, you really gave me money for this book, the secret is where the $20 bucks in your bank account is going to.&#34;
B001NHN7TU|3.0|Very &#34;hokey&#34; story of being eaten by underground monsters.  Many biological and physical impossibilities happening throughout the flick.  Poorly wriitten also but I like Kevin Bacon.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Let me start off by saying this is a really good Beatles album with alot of really good covers. There, that's the only normal thing you'll ever hear me say in an Amazon review. However, the advertisement that the Beatles were &#34;for sale&#34; is completely misleading. I called several 800 numbers for the record company and its divisions, and was transfered to roughly 2 dozen people in an attempt to redeem the promised Beatles that were on sale with this album. I was directed to two addresses; both of which led to graveyards. Why they would direct me to a graveyard to redeem my John and George were beyond me. What year and month are we in?
B009FZFONO|4.0|I'm having trouble understanding why the people of &#34;woodbury&#34; are so dead against the people from the prison. They are all fighting the same demons, why fight each other? I know everybody's losing their minds lately but the govenor's got to go! I will like this season better when this situation is over with and on to something else.
B007UR1OHO|4.0|Very good movie with some surprises. I love the dynamics between the couple. The plot keeps you engaged and wanting to see how it ends.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! It's opened up a whole new world of creativity for me, from craft ideas to cooking, makeup and hair tips, I've used so many of the ideas I found on here!
0374214913|4.0|The premise caught my attention. The writing held it. This book certainly requires the reader to grant a bit of latitude to the writer in terms of suspension of disbelief, but it's worth the effort. Well done.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This has been a sure delight for me.  I began very dubious as to it's ability to pull of a believable character & plot from episode to episode.  They're doing it..  I'm loving it!!
0689877692|5.0|We got this for our Grandkids. They love it. Glad we got it for them. Will buy more from this author.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I mean.. It won best picture there is little I can add to that.<br />It keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />If I loved Ben Affleck before this, now..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an excellent app, and it is free!!  I have tried others, but this one is the best by far.<br /> I recommend highly!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun app with great graphics. The kids really like it and enjoy competing in the tournaments. It's lots of fun.
B00BMKKSHC|4.0|I saw it and had doubts, now it is one of my weekly staples. All the characters are likable, and all have some kind of back story. The villains are interesting and I would say somewhat similar to Batman. Even the hero is like Batman. I would recommend people give it a go if they have a Hulu Plus subscription.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Nothing much to say about this magnificent CPU, it gets the job done with flying colors, and for 84$ what can go wrong? If you don't have the money to spend on an intel go get this baby! It can outperform the FX 4100 and 6100 not too sure about the x300 ones tho.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Since the movie has come out I was determined to read the book before I go see the movie. I am so glad I did! It was a stress reliever at its best
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The ideas behind the story are ones rarely spoken of. Always interesting and satisfying, Flynn writes with a sassy and descriptive pen. She's always making you want more of the story and surprised when you reach the end. Great read.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a great movie, if you haven't seen it you must watch it.  Great lessons and wonderfully entertaining.  All ages will enjoy.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|my son plays this, and he loves it, gives him something to do when we are gone.  Would recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I chose this rating because the contents of the booki were not to my liking.  If I had known it was this type of book, I would never have purchased it,
B007VYDFMS|5.0|This was an excellent documentary on Bob Marley's life. It focussed on his love for the music and his philanthropy. I am from the Caribbean and never really knew much about his final days. This documentary gave more insite into it.<br /><br />Strongly recommend this movie.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Great Action, Funny, Corny at times, but highly entertaining! We had a great time watching this as a family, very fast, GREAT action sequences, fun surprises.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|....and here's why.  For years SOS fans have been badgering the band for a DVD release of their material.  Well here it is.<br />This CD/DVD combo has some of the best music you will ever hear.  These new arrangements of earlier SOS material are great versions that you're sure to appreciate.<br />The DVD had good sound quality despite being Dolby AC-3 (instead of the preferred PCM Stereo) .  It's a live recording so it has live recording limitations.<br />The CD is live audio too so sound quality is basically the same as the DVD.<br /><br />Be sure to buy this as the price is good; &#60; $25 for a CD and DVD is a good deal.
0385484518|5.0|Well, I bought it for my friend, I didn't see the book but my friend is very satisfied with it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a cool app try it out and see for yourself. its free no charge and it'll keep you or little kids busy.
0547884591|5.0|The short learning summary in the first part of the book is very helpful. I appreciate that it is short and to the point.<br /><br />Often we want some long and complicated method.  So many things are simpler then we often make them.  It is in the application that the real learning takes place.  If we keep reading what to do - we do nothing.  That is why I like the short summary.  It encourages one to go out and try to do or learn something new.
B005LAII12|5.0|2 movies we went to see were sold out and ted was our 3rd choice. we eventually saw the other 2 but got more enjoyment out of Ted. cant wait for Ted 2. i ordered Ted as a gift for my friend.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|My husband and I both liked this movie. Clint Eastwood movies just get better and better and there was a time I thought i'd had my fill. Amy Adams is good as his daughter.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i  like the way it moves right after your move. no waiting around. i like that. i will probably go with the paid version soon.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|An excellent book.  Kathy Reichs never fails to write books that entertain and thrill.  Love all the Brennan books and will continue to buy every one.
B0015DROBO|4.0|the book was a little confusing in the beginning and then there are some very gruesome parts but over all it is an intense book that keeps you wanted to figure out this mystery
1449410243|5.0|This book is just plain silly, but so entertaining that I couldn't stop laughing.  As the adoptive mother of two feline sons, I could see the traits written about in both of them and have a new respect for how they view their human family.  I actually bought the book for my husband who has &#34;issues&#34; with one of the cats whom he accuses of trying to kill him all the time, and even he laughed hysterically.  As one wise sage said, &#34;A dog has a master, a cat lets you care for him.&#34;  This book proves it!!
1595141715|5.0|this is a real eye opener for some of the teens out there its sad and very intense at the same time and it reminded me of alot of the teen suicides while I was in highschool
B004LROUNG|5.0|entertaining and insightful  -  Grisham is able to accurately describe the mindset of legal practitioners from the most prestigious of firms to the  scuzziest of firms
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought this book was going to be a bit boring from the fist chapters of reading but then as it progresses you can't help but to get attached to pi and mr. parker and hope that they can get through this tragety
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is, in a word, outstanding.  I loved every page of it.  If you are looking for a first person account of what it is like to be a sniper, this will give you that.  Less than technical about the ballistic side of things, the book dives into the personal experiences of the man himself.  I really liked that side of things.<br /><br />One word of warning, if you are looking for some &#34;America is a bad country&#34; commentary on the war, this is not it.  This guy bleeds for his country.  I only wish we had more like him!!!
B000YABS8E|5.0|I love the dynamics of the actors in this movie. Brendan Frazier has an amazingly funny, and even believable, with his parents. Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken as the parents really do a great job with the nuiances of genius and insanity. Alicia Silverstone is most lovely. A great movie and it still makes me laugh.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|I love this effort.  Still angry and they still have something to say.  I love that about them!  Can't wait to see what they do next!
2070643026|5.0|My daughter is currently taking French 2 (English is her primary language). She understood most of the words in this french edition of Harry Potter. What she couldn't understand, she could figure out from the context and because she knows the story. She really enjoyed reading this book!:)
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|Alex is a widower struggling to raise his two young children by himself in small-town North Carolina following the death of his wife.<br /><br />Katie is the beautiful stranger who arrives on a bus from Boston with a sweet smile and a mysterious past.<br /><br />Despite her best efforts to maintain her boundaries and remain aloof, Katie eventually falls for Alex and his endearing children, all of whom so clearly need a woman's influence in their life. But will the secrets from Katie's past ground this romance before it can even really take flight?<br /><br />I loved this touching movie for the first 99% despite the lack of many surprises. But the very end is what really made the movie memorable with a twist so surprising that I look forward to watching it again! I thought I was going to make it through with my mascara intact, but that little twist at the end that finally forced my to pull out my hankie.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|my kids loved the movie and laughed all the way through.  I had to restart the movie several times due to performance issues with the video stream.  I had no other streaming activities taking place from machines in my house at the time.
0670026603|5.0|The friend that recommended this book to me described it as a sweet little book about assisted suicide.  I blinked twice and assumed that she was a tad on the crazy side (and I'm a psychologist so I would know), but it turns out that is a very fitting description for this charming novel.<br /><br />Louisa Clark is a quirky 27 year-old Brit on the fast track to nowhere.  She has been dating the same guy for seven years, but he's more interested in training for marathons than he is in moving forward with Louisa.  She's had the same job for ages, working as a waitress at the Buttered Bun Caf&eacute; where she is perfectly content to pour tea for the regulars.  But when the Buttered Bun shutters its doors, Louisa finds herself unemployed, broke, and desperate for another job.<br /><br />Unable to stomach a shift at the chicken processing plant, Louisa reluctantly accepts a gig as a paid caretaker for a quadriplegic man in his 30's.  Will Traynor was a hotshot business man and bona fide adrenaline junkie before a spinal injury left him confined to a wheelchair and dependent on others for even the simplest of tasks.  As a result, he is a surly \\"arse.\\"  He can't tolerate peppy Louisa and her constant chatter, but he won't have to for very long.  He only has to endure six more months before his parents have agreed to take him to Switzerland where medical professionals will assist him in carrying out his wish to end his own life.<br /><br />Predictably, Will and Louisa begin to bond over the long hours spent together; he tolerating constant pain and indignities and she trying to ease his burdens and cheer his spirits.  Will she be able to change his mind in time?<br /><br />It's not a thriller, but it is a page-turner.  It is well-balanced with a laugh for every tear.  Brilliantly written, this one is . . . as promised . . . a sweet little book.
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|my kids loved the movie and laughed all the way through.  I had to restart the movie several times due to performance issues with the video stream.  I had no other streaming activities taking place from machines in my house at the time.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Absolutely the best album I've bought this year. Her voice is so emotive and smooth and every song is an asset to the album. Can't recommend it enough.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|First of all, I am using this on a Surface Pro.  The throughput is not full 1Gb, more like 700 Mb,, and tends to slow down when in Full Duplex.  However, it still much better then wireless or 100 Mb,  so I really don't have any complaints.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|My kids said they loved it, loved it, loved it!  We wish we'd bought it instead of just renting it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am agnostic with a clearer understanding of my own view Godliness for having read this book. Eben Alexander III, a human being we can trust, has shed the light for me.
034580404X|5.0|I gave it a 5 star rating it is an exciting read, and would recommend the book<br />to all my friends  and family as well!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my grammaw talked me into playing my horse at first i thought it would be boring but its actialy pretty cool and fun
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app &amp; use it everyday.  I love all the options including the having to answer math problems before you can snooze.  I hate math personally but it sure gets me awake &amp; thinking which really helps me wake up. I also have it programmed to wake me up at different times on different days. Very handy app! :)
B004N66XYE|5.0|This continuation of the series was most welcomed.  I only watched parts here and there of the original series.  Great!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It made smile, laugh out loud, and cry. But mostly, it made me think. REALLY think about life, love, and the true importance of it all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I so enjoy watching Downton Abbey each Sunday night.  It will again be a long wait for season 4 to begin.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|Recommend for high protein dieters.  The program also offers personal coaching which seems very expensive to me but may be necessary for success.
1250027624|5.0|The book gave you a lot of information on each of the actors.  It was worth the buy.  I'm glad I bought it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones keeps you guessing, and guessing, and wanting more.  Every time one episode ends, I'm ready to jump right into the next.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Great quality, no commercials. I would recommend this to anyone that missed season 1 of Grey's Anatomy or anyone that would like to enjoy it again.
B003B96AOW|3.0|I don't have much to say about Deadpool accept he's huge! way too tall! He is at least 2 and 1/2 inches larger than most if not all Marvel Select figures. You can not play with him with the other figures so I don't recommend this for younger children. I must say the detail, accessories and articulation is great! Well, I hope this helped.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. My only complaint while reading was that the author would suddenly stack on a ton of new information without really explaining it. Still a good entertaining read.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Nevermind the superb casting and performances rendered by a stellar cast,  the setting, sets, costumes and props are a visual feast for the eyes!  Fellows has created a storyline and characters that rival the best of the recent Jane Austen award-winning films.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Great read with interesting characters and a unique story that keeps you guessing about the future of the silo. Riveting
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey Season Two proves that Season One wasn't a fluke! All the characters are multifaceted, interesting, and beautifully human. Cannot wait for Season Three!
B00AQK4EWY|3.0|The French consider this one of their top classics.  I find it badly written (by today's standards), overly long by two thirds, and actually boring at times.  Y started reading a translated version, but since I pride myself in speaking a pretty mean French, I decided to take the challenge of reading it in the original.  But even my French, honed by living in France andBelgium for about ten years, is no match for the 19th century verbose, literary French interspersed with 19th century argot.  But it's a challenge, and its a top French classic, so I intend to actually finish the whole thing soon (at 65% now, after weeks of reading).  While the story is quite interesting, the book is too long, verbose, preachy, divagating, and as already sid, in places downright boring.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is the most creative, charming brilliantly wonderful band in forever! Every track is fantastic! They combine Icelandic folk tales with modern pop to create the best CD of the year! Buy it!!!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Not as difficult as the other versions, at least in the early stages. But it is an okay way to kill some time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a very user friendly app and it is great to be able to carry the Word of God everywhere with me!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|One of the best books ever - gripping - a page turner.  I read it in record time because I could not put it down.
B008ALAHA4|1.0|Do not buy!!!!!! This is a waste of time and money. No one has $10 just to give away these day!!  And if this is the same item that Apple sells, it's still crap.  Tried plugging into different outlets hoping that would solve the problem, but it didn't. Plugged the original power cord and it charges. It even has a green light to indicate charging but there is no lightning icon to indicate it is.  Please beware.  I waited to long to test it and my 30 days had expired. Try at you own risk.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I loved this book - great plot - kept me going throughout the book.  I couldn't put it down at all.
B007MAETA8|5.0|This is by far, John Mayer's best performance.  The turn he has taken was an unexpected surprise!  It is tough to narrow it down to a favorites since all the tracks suck you in.  Hope the next project mirrors this!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|If you like Thrift Shop you really ought to give the album a chance too. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis clearly love what they do and it shines through on the album.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|It's just an okay John Mayer project.  Needs a few more listens before we can form a final decision.  Later.
B006G2124E|5.0|This was a great movie. I love how it tells the whole truth about house maids during the time of segregation
B000VLE3GA|5.0|my husband was so happy when i showed him this cd set, got a great deal and he can rock out to some old memories.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|With a fabulous cast and a rich mythology and history (thanks to Stargate SG1), couldn't go wrong with the Atlantis storyline for a whole new mythology to add to the Stargate Pantheon.
B005DJ7U5G|5.0|This movie is excellent. Very fast paced with good action. The acting is well done and the characters are engaging.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|At first I didn't like the movie (in theatre), but then I watched it again and let go of my prejudice for the original Star Trek.  The characters are all really vivid and loud and bright.  This new timeline is going to be radically different, but the rich Star Trek history is still there.  One of the biggest stars of this movie the USS Enterprise herself.  Absolutely breathtaking in her majesty, and the chance to see the operations of the ship (engineering) and prepping for take off, etc... is cool.  The bridge has to be the most awesome ever.
B001YB29HG|5.0|This movie is very funny and entertaining. I am a fan of anything Joss Whedon does and her certainly did not disappoint!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Absolutely loved the first season.  This season (2) was a little rocky at the start, but has gotten back to full-blown awesomeness!  Can't wait to see what season 3 will bring!  Our whole family loves to watch it together and talk about it after.  Haven't done that since Stargate.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Great movie! I had fun watching from beginning to end. I am a huge fan and thoroughly enjoyed myself with this.
B00BHMF578|2.0|after hearing and reading about the movie for months i finally got to see it: wow,  what a disappointment. disnt live up to my expectations for storyline or acting.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love playing this game. Its addicting to watch them grow up and make room for the babies. If you dont wanna spend real money it takes patience to play but it can be done. The quests they give you can be frustrating if you dont spend money but its still worth a good play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am so glad I finally had the opportunity to read this book.  It is one that I wish I had not read just so I can have the pleasure of reading it again for the first time.  The story of Sky and Holder is proof that love conquers all.  I was scared of where the story was going because i just wanted to fight hard for them.  i never would have imagined the ending.  Hopeless is emotional and captivating. You truly will not be disappointed.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|To get it out of the way, I'm a fan of this show (and its related book series) and think it's great and everyone should watch it. About the product: it is well made as the first season, however HBO decided to include a small case with 2 double sided DVDs with the season's 10 episodes, making the box thicker than season one's. It comes with a digital copy code, so maybe they could just enable to have them burned onto DVDs instead of adding them and disrupting the collection's package.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Better than almost every movie that came out last year. Not even nominated for an academy award, which is ridiculous. Argo can eat it. Batman kicked ass.
0062215507|5.0|This book is as well made as it first version and has some extras (photos and info) related to \\"The Deathly Hallows\\", including a small photo album of the whole journey. If you are a Potterhead and don't have the old one, go for it. It's sad they didn't save this book until all movies were made because the new stuff is great and owners of the previous one will most likely want this one as well.
0805092447|5.0|I love the book Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do You See? The colors and animals are wonderful. The children enjoyed the pictures.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Easy to read. Kept my interest to the end and kept me wanting more. Recommended it to my friends already.
0446580848|3.0|As always; I have enjoyed another Corey adventure. Yes, as others have previously mentioned; there is a bit of sacasism throughout the book - maybe even more than previous novels. But, I understand the cockeyness of Corey enough to see how it fits in and one day. perhaps, will cause his demise-when he says the wrong things to the wrong person.<br /><br />Until then ... You go Nelson!<br /><br />Ken Riley
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love being able to read it whenever I want wherever I want. Easy to read. Love being able to bookmark too. Already recommended it.
B003L77G06|5.0|Modern Family is fun no matter who you are, young or old. Each season brings better, funnier episodes. Highly recommended
0345803507|5.0|Wish there were more and more books, kind of bummed that it stopped after only 3 books. I flew through them but enjoyed every one.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I'd been thinking of getting my novel uploaded to Amazon, but never got around to it because I thought it was complicated and I would have to pay a professional formatter.  But since this handy little manual was free, I downloaded it to my Kindle and started reading through it.  In a few hours, I worked through the easy steps to format my manuscript (I already had prepared a cover image) and by the end of the evening I had uploaded the book and it was done!  Why did I wait so long?<br /><br />Get this manual and start making it happen.<br /><br />NOTE:  As other reviewers have said, if your book has lots of graphics you will need more info than this manual.  But if your book is just straight text, go for it.
0345803493|5.0|Wish there were more and more books, kind of bummed that it stopped after only 3 books. I flew through them but enjoyed every one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very entertaining and fun. This game is enjoyable. It is also a great feature to have missions. This game has great/good visual features. I don't like how the game will pause/stall in the beginning and middle of a run. Thank you for you're time and wanting of opinion
B0028O34SG|5.0|Erwin Schrott is great in this version.  The Blu-Ray is wonderful to watch.  I can find hard to find Operas at this site.
B0027WGWQ0|5.0|This has an exceptionally high entertainment value, beyond this it is also a very thought provoking movie...great acting too!<br /><br />A definite must see.
B0054YIQK8|5.0|I have this already and bought on the regular DVD but I purchase this due to Blu-ray features.  It is a well worth the purchase.  Again I go to Amazon.com for Operas
B005HSL626|5.0|I've been wanting to play this darn game forever and Is aw that it was a free app and it was everything I was expected, I was just super happy!
B0091LS07E|5.0|I only bought the CD because Girl On Fire reminded me of my granddaughter. I love all the songs on the CD, especially Not Even The KIng (my favorite of all).
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was hoping I'd be able to do something Angry Bird like on the kindle and YES this app shows up! I'm waiting for it to charge me for something though... because there's always a catch with &#34;free&#34; apps....
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A deeply affecting story where once again truth is more amazing than fiction. I am grateful for the people in this story and everyone who had a role in making the movie. A tribute to humanity.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I don't really like it... There were a couple glitches where the monster would just catch me instantly and it's really repetitive and it's annoying.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Hopkins does a great job at portraying Hitchcock. The makeup is seamless and the movie kept me intrigued the entire time. Great cast! I will be buying this on Blu-ray for sure. I love Hitchcock and this is a great story of how Psycho was made.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|I don't know why but I love this dang game so MUCH. I PLAY IT EVERY DAY NOW. AAAH. Yes.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderful story, I enjoyed it and didn't want it to end. Quick read that kept me interested through out!
030758836X|5.0|For the first time ever, I'm left speechless after finishing a book. Brilliantly written but with characters who I truly, truly despise. Hicks has managed to find the dark side of humanity, of couples, of people supposedly in love, and twisted it into a story that grabs you and haunts you, even after you've closed the book for good. Though I admit to skimming parts (Flynn's style is a bit too wordy for my taste), I could NOT put GONE GIRL down. There is a reason Flynn is a NYT bestseller. This is one of those books that I'll remember forever and think -- I wish I'd written that -- which would be followed by a cold shudder. Haunting, indeed.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The concept is imaginative...although very similar to Twilight. It is a bit like the author had a valid purpose 1/2 ways through the series and then she was influenced to make it a fairytale. But it depends what you are looking fir. As a fairytale, and an imaginative one a t that I would say it is worth it. It will also be worth it for your spouse!
B00466HM28|1.0|It worked for the first 2 day perfectly now it sometimes doesn't turn on even it's so annoying my computer doesn't recognize it any more and all the lights show up but but the mpk editor doesn't show it any more an it doesn't work with ANY of my programs including ; pro tools, fl studio, ableton live 8(the full version) I bought this stupid thing so I don't have to use my keyboard I would give it a five star rating if it starts working again it was so amazing for such a small device ... For 2 days
B0061PEAUY|5.0|It started at real fast to get you hooked! I love the TV show Bones so no problem reading this book!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Explicit, but steaming hot ! Loved main characters, especially Eva's no nonsense attitude.<br />Can't wait to read third book in series.
B00899F0G8|5.0|unfortunately this show is not on netflix yet so we watched it through amazon on our tv. we are now all caught up on the season!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Follow up of book 1, even better.Could be less explicit, but sex scenes hot ! Disappointing to not have third book available yet !
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game was okay but I found it either went in circles (you could only go into 2 rooms) or it wanted money for a full version.  The game was suppose to be free - not a lite version.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun. app just a little choppy sometimes so yeah add me its. itsme.............. I'm just a little bored and I'm doing this to get gems so yea
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great book. I finally gave in and read it to see what all the hype was about. There were so many things that made it enjoyable to read, besides just the obvious :)
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|Wow, the 1st 5 full length Ratt CD's for the price of 1 at FYE.  If you've been waiting to update your LP/Cassette collection the time is now!  I'm a big fan of all 5 of these albums, I always loved the guitar work of Ratt and the edge of Stephen's vocals.  Ratt were never quite the pretty boy ballad rock band that so many others of the glam era tried to be.  Ratt were heavy metal/hard rock by guys who could really play there instruments.  These guys could play with melody and rhythm creating memorable tunes that any rock fan could enjoy, not too heavy not too light.
0679735909|5.0|I will say that it took me several chapters to get into this book. If you don't like poetry, you have been warned - a LOT of this book is poetry, as it's about poets.<br /><br />The book's major failing is that the characters don't seem to have much purpose; on the other hand, this eventually seems intentional. It also takes far too long for anything to happen - it was only when we met Christabel and Randolph, the poets in the book, that I realized I was reading something wonderful. Their letters to one another did not give me this feeling. I think this book is also meant to be very intellectual - you're supposed to take your time reading it. It isn't a pleasure read - it's a brain read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|this was the BEST....but then I love anything with Brendan Coyle....liked the early 20th century post office setting, things haven't changed all that much...[have been a letter carrier for 25yrs.]  and the townspeople were terrific, every show in this series made me laugh and cry...I loved it
0385535147|5.0|I'm not one to usually leave reviews, but I felt compelled to promote this novel. I have read a number of Grisham's finest works, but this certainly separates itself from the rest. Without giving anything away, I recommend this to anyone who has read and enjoyed Grisham before.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Good movie for younger children, misses on compelling details so does not hold an older audiance over. Would reccomend if you can get a good deal on it.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My three year old loved this book!  He thought it was hysterical how Grover kept trying to convince us not to read on!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All the Start Wars you can handle and then some. Although I was dissapointed slightly by the last scene in episode VI that is a minor detail. Great collection.
1572810408|5.0|Is a very beauty deck. Love it!<br />And is a deck, elegant, luminous, softly, and excellent tarot. Love it!<br />I recomended it.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Couldn't wait to read it. Author wrote another great book in Nikki Heat series. Great twist and turns. Read series in order as were written so that you don't spoil your fun.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Had to have my 6 year old granddaughter she me how to play...she is better! A great babysitter for the grandkids!  HELP it is not working anymore on any of my Kindles.. it does work on my phone...what is up?
B005GRF2UK|5.0|This is my favorite version of the movie.  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg do a superb portrayal of the characters.  William Hurt is not over-the-board and therefore his character is more believable and more likeable.  It also gives a nice contrast between the darkness of the life he lives indoors and the brightness of hope outdoors filled with the color of the glorious Autumn landscape.
B0063M22QO|5.0|My new go to game.. had other Mahjong games, but have deleted them for this one. I love this game.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Don't let that they are monsters fool you! They are sweet and teach so many wonderful life lessons. My 5 year old LOVES them..as well as my 1 year old!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Always wanted to read some of the original Holmes books. I loved how the book had several of the stories in it.  Loved it.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Some people call the circus the best show on earth and as far as live shows go that might be true but when it comes to television The Walking Dead is at the tip top number one spot on my list!!!! This show is jam packed with action,drama,suspense,and just an amazing thrill that will keep you at the edge of your seat and wanting more and more at the end of each episode you'll be anxiously awaiting the next!!!! As a zombie fan this show has went above and beyond my expectations and brings my imagination to life by portraying what I have always Envisioned a real live zombie outbreak would be. I absolutely love this show if you haven't watched yet you're missing out :)
0312857063|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. I mean every book kept your entangled in the plot as if you were right there with them. I will definitely reread and reread these books.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Bosch. More very excellent jazz references, which are much appreciated. Keep Bosch alive.<br /><br />when is the next novel due?
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a fast read for me....could NOR put it down.  I highly recommend it.  It was amazing to me to learn about the training these warriors endur/complete and how the class began with a large number but only a few completed the training.  Very impressive how they function as a team and truly care about and take care of each other.  Of course, as civilians, we never know the real story of what goes on but I thought the author did a great job of giving insight into his survival experience.  I also LOVED reading about the lovely people who waited at the home of his parents and pleaded and prayed to God for safe return home.  And the awesome mental connection felt by his identical twin, also a SEAL.  We ARE all connected.  I am thankful our Warriors, these very special people, are called to serve. A good book to read and pass on to younger people who may benefit from reading about someone in a really difficult situation who kept enduring and overcame.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So awesome and addicting, better than most games. A lot of games you only get so many turns, this one never ends.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|IDEA WAS GOOD BUT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED FURTHER. ACTING WAS THIN AND PLOT TOO THIN FOR THIS LENGTH OF MOVIE.
0765325950|5.0|This book has been a very LONG time coming, and I have to say that I'm always leery of books that end a series, or even most book endings. It's just a fact of life that many of the books that I love the most leave me a little disappointed with the endings.<br /><br />This book didn't disappoint in any way, shape, or form!<br /><br />I loved the series, I loved how well Brandon Sanderson did with Robert Jordan's masterpiece after his heartbreaking departure from this life, and I loved the absolute thrill of reading this last volume in the series. If you aren't familiar with the plot, please start from the beginning and work your way to this book. If you are familiar, then I will only say that so many conflicts finally come to a head, mysteries are revealed (that I've been waiting YEARS to learn the answers to), and prophecies fulfilled that you'll wish you could read fast enough to digest this tome in a single sitting.<br /><br />No holds are barred in this volume, and it may leave you a bit surprised to find out who makes it, who doesn't, how the prophecies are fulfilled, and... oh, I can't spoil the details, but if you have any interest in this series, this book is truly the culmination!<br /><br />I'll close with a heartfelt thanks to Brandon Sanderson for a job VERY well done, my sincerest best wishes and sympathies for Mrs. Harriet McDougal, whose hard work and love shines clearly in all the pages of this series, and my encouragement for Brandon Sanderson to continue writing exactly as he is doing for as long as is humanly possible!<br /><br />Thanks for a spectacular read! I couldn't figure out how to quadruple the stars on my rating, but if there was a book to do it for, this would be it!!
0345803507|5.0|This is a great read I still have the books. I saw them on target for way more I'm glad I got the ones I got
B008220DGE|4.0|A troubled young soul in need of redemption comes to a charismatic philosopher who claims to have the answers. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Lancaster Dodd, who is obviously loosely based on L Ron Hubbard and his cult of Scientology. When Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a World War II veteran who can't adjust to civilian life stumbles aboard Dodd's yacht party, the two find a sort of common bond with each other. Freddie has a need to find answers, The Master claims he has them. For the next two hours, the 2 men circle each other in a sort of tragic dance.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" explores the bond between Hoffman and Phoenix and it is a difficult bond to watch. Freddie has issues that run so deep that even Hoffman's \\"processing\\" can't draw them out. The two men metaphorically explore what it is like to be a cult follower and cult leader. Hoffman in particular exudes charisma even when other characters point out that \\"The Cause\\" seems like it is being made up as they go along. At the same time, Freddie is so desirous of a father figure/guiding light that not only is he willing to follow \\"The Cause,\\" he is willing to fight off anyone who dares question the Master's divinity.<br /><br />The movie does a great job in showing what willing followers will do in search of the ultimate answer. Phoenix, as the troubled young Freddie, runs through the movie like a powder keg just waiting to explode. Even in the end, as the two men try to mend their differences, Phoenix can't hide that he is wound up tighter than a watchspring, even as Hoffman attempts to console him one last time. \\"The Master\\" is not an easy movie to watch. Phoenix burns so darkly and with such intensity that it is hard to wonder if he's redeemable. He earned his Oscar nomination, as does Hoffman, as the bulk of the movie remains unflappable in the faith of his beliefs. Dodd desperately wants his protege to follow his leadership while Freddie struggles between his love of Dodd and the leash that The Master keeps his followers on.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" doesn't explode. It is a slow burn of a film that reveals its greatness the hard way.s his followers on.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" doesn't explode. It is a slow burn of a film that reveals its greatness the hard way.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have a lot of fun and use the game to keep my mind active.  I am 77 and still working by choice.  Do not want my mind to go stale
1781164266|5.0|Great book for all Dead Space fans! With detailed illustrations on every page and interesting paragraphs. It also include never before seen images
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|This is another solid album from these guys.  It is truly amazing how these guys can consistently produce high quality albums.  I am horrible at giving in depth album reviews, but if you like Helloween at all, you should enjoy this album.  It prompted me to load up the 6 disc changer exclusively with their most recent works, minus the remix album.
1250027624|5.0|A must see. A must own. Bought a couple of these as gifts for my Downton Abbey-loving friends. A great gift which memorializes the show.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the series and can't wait for season 4.  What twists and turns await us next year?Julian Fellowes is a masterful storyteller.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I have read this book 3 times. It is a great autobiography. Tender, compassionate. Each time I read it, I find myself highlighting more passages. Ghandi accomplished so much through his nonviolent ways. The words in this book are very thought provoking. I had to get a Kindle version since I am always referring to it.
0307895475|2.0|For such a big book, it's jammed together, and disjointed.  I should have stuck with online information.  This is a huge waste of money.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Our church did Courageous night. I do not think there was a dry eye in the house. Had to own this Christian faith based epic. We have watched it multiple times since.
0312370830|5.0|A powerful story.  I had no knowledge of this bit of sad history that took place in France at the<br />beginning of WWII.  I loaned out my copy and others are now reading it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The masterpiece continues. I am so excited that the storyline began in the early 1900s. We have a hundred years to cover with this truly amazing series. Scenery magnificent. Charcters are rivoting. Seasons 1, 2 and 3 a prerequisite to truly enjoy the story.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums .. its so relaxing to listen to  very enjoyable all together. I would recomend this to any one looking for a good album with a different sound.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This was a good movie, there is a lot of violence in this movie and it can be difficult to watch at times, the violence is not the type that you would enjoy in an action movie, but more of the torture type that is hard to view.  However the movie itself is good enough that it is worth watching and at $0.99 right now in HD, if you haven't seen it, it is a steal in price.
B00A8LYYI0|2.0|It lacked just about everything that makes a movies good. It got 2 starts because the 3d is pretty cool. The story was bad, the characters never develop and the conclusion comes and goes so fast you are left wondering what just happened.
1601254679|5.0|This is an excellent resource which will allow GM's with a less rules heavy game knowledge put together encounters wicked quick. Like every Paizo book (with the exceptions being the early printings of the core rulebook) it's incredibly well bound and of great quality, the artwork is superb and plentiful. The book rarely goes a couple pages without dropping in another character portrait, giving the reader a feel for the styles worn by a variety of people from many different backgrounds.<br /><br />Beyond the physical appearance of the book itself it brings (in my opinion) a much needed resource to pathfinder. The bestiary's are great for monster encounters but when you want to do a humanoid encounter you have to stat the guys out yourself or search for some that someone else has already made. This book is the bestiary for humanoids, with characters ranging from lowly cut-purses to the campaign ending boss you really do get your moneys worth.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Funny premise that worked well throughout the movie.  Not for while family though, my wife didn't get it, more of guys movie.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes movie soundtracks. This was exactly as described and met all my expectations.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I like it much better than the one I ordered when I got my Fire which was bulkier and this one is much better, it is hard to hold when laying in bed to read but mostly I am sure is the weight of the Fire compared to the Keyboard Kindle.
0071636080|4.0|This is great reading and very inspiring to get the inside track. Was motivated to buy it after I read Steve Jobs' biography!
B000FC12Z0|5.0|So, I'm giving this 5 stars!  As always, it's a thinker! I never tire of her wonderful mind for mystery.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|not bad, not great.  The filmmaking team obviously put alot of work into it, and I appreciated that.  Liked the actors playing the leads, all the acting was good.  Thought the writers structured the story well enough, had enough action/fight sequences, and were strong in writing an engaging male character, not so good with the female lead - I thought she should have been quicker on the uptake, considering she was a highly educated doctor and scientist and knew she was testing spies, and working for the government.  I thought the lead male character yelling at her after he found out he'd been administered drugs that made continuing to take some of the pills unnecessary, rich, considering he did similar type of work, basically being told what to do by the government just as the doctor was, and doing it, but not liking it when it was done to him.  I thought the Rachael Weisz character ran unusually, as if she was an olympic sprinter, rather than a doctor.  Hard to get emotionally into these films, as the leads (the spy characters) are trained killers and kill their way through the movies.  I thought the portrayal of the fictitious government agency willing to turn on a dime against it's citizens was chilling (as they did with the doctors/scientists/spies working for them).  I would watch a sequel with these actors, and I'll probably eventually buy the movie (checked it out from the library this time), so I liked it well enough, though I tend not to like quick editing so much, and alot of camera movement, and these are used several places in this movie.  Sometimes the images move so fast and are edited so fast I can't keep up.  I also am not a big fan of the music used, especially when basic, ordinary work is being done in an office setting, and action music is played along side - I find hyper music played against ordinary images distracting, but that is done in Bourne movies.  I wouldn't go to a theater to see these films; I never have.  But as I said I'll probably buythis one eventually, as I bought at least one of the earlier films.  I like Matt Damon but I thought the actor playing Aaron was good too, he's basically written very similarly to Jason Bourne, kind of a spy with a heart of gold (to the woman in his life).  And I've enjoyed Rachael Weisz's work for years.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|its very reassuring to know that i am able to back up my importants...  its great!  =) =)  =) Thanks!

0345803507|5.0|I love the story, Im about to read the trilogy for the second time now. Its a good mix of drama, romance and eroticism.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It was fantastically delicious<br />And super addictive I could literally play it all day long and not get bored of it
B000I186FW|5.0|We are a family where we know what we speak of! GMO, Florid in water and other things our government wants to hide! this is inspirational and opens a small window to that our future might end up being! i love it!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|What a true joy to read.  I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book of fast paced energy and action. The first book of Morgan's I have read, but definitely not the last.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I find the app nearly as good as visiting the accuweather website.  The one thing it doesn't do is stay current.  The current time is 3:29.  The last update to the app for weather information 2:29.  Similarly, radar has to be updated manually, it doesn't refresh on it's own.  Other than that, I like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and makes me entertained. I can't wait to get back to playing it so that's my review!
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I was really excited about this new series. After I watched the first episode, I was disappointed, but watched the second one anyway. I ended up deciding to not watch any more.
B000BISBDY|3.0|when I opened it the case was broken but the disc and cover album was in very good condition. thank you !
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great follow up to fifty shades of gray. Can't wait to read the last book of the series. E l James really knows how to get your attention!
B008ROGZUU|5.0|Magnificent! The best live performance of Tosca I have ever seen, and  indeed one one the finest DVDs of any opera I have come across. Angela Gheorghiu is at the top of her game, a performance to cherish along with her Mimi and Violetta.  Jonas Kaufmann is in great voice and makes a very attractive Cavaradossi.  And I can't imagine a better Scarpia than Bryn Terfel's -  the slimiest, most lecherously evil performance of the role I could imagine, and wonderfully sung.  The overall production/staging is excellent and Pappano draws an invigorating, exciting  performance from the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Overall, a most vigorous, exhilarating and yes, beautiful performance of Puccini's great work.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|easy install, nice fan great team to the 970 mb. used for a new system build and this system rocks. over clocking is easy with gigabites programs that come with the mother board .  currently running at 3.9 but have tested to 4.6  with no heating issues
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This little mic works perfectly. Decent sound quality. Plugs directly into my Canon HF S10 camera producing nice sounding video. Just be careful and don't get tangled in the long wire.
B0086DBE62|3.0|my kids like it.its enjoyable. if your looking for a dark heavy movie this aint it. julia roberts appeared to have a lot of fun with this and good for her for taking on a role where she is the bad guy and dealing with the fact she's aging. still gorgeous but she is getting older. i appreciate this movie and her part in it. its a graceful way to say i'm getting older and can't play the leading lady forever there is some one younger and brighter than me but i'm cool with that cause i'm julia roberts
B002X3V4P2|5.0|This is a good album for Enya fans and the price was very good.  This is a great addition to my digital library.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fell prey to the hype and purchased the book. I haven't finished it and am unsure if I will or not. To be honest, I admit I'm not a fan of love stories. So this book is working uphill from the beginning.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Amazing story. Excellent movie! Worthy of oscar it received. Definitely recommended for anyone to watch. The convenience is also really great.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These AKG are not new, and they are made in China, but the sound is almos perfect. They are very light and comfortable. The audio details are amazing. The highs are clear, and never sound harshing. The bass may be lacking for some, but that's what happens when you get contamited by all the beats crap that it's out there.<br /><br />I highly recommend using these with a headphone amp.<br /><br />Must buy, no regrets ;)
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Very predictable from Lucas films, which is like a factory now days, with writers who seem to do their work on the can. Corny, stiff dialogue. Like a schlocky comic book. A routine love affair between one of the pilots and a local girl from the village near the base, which is tedious enough to put up with that I just f-Fwd through it. The computer-generated animations LOOK like computer-generated animations. Finally, the historical detail is abysmal, aluminum finish B-17s near the end of the flick, when all Flying Forts had the brown drab and beige paint scheme throughout the war; then there is one scene of the base commander talking to his pilots in the air from the base control tower with what looks like a palm-sized radio, like you'd get at Radio Shack right now, in fact, the top end of it even resembled a cell phone. Portable radios back then in that pre-transistor age were almost as big as a guy's fore arm. Do Lucas and Hemingway care? Apparently not. On top of that, the voice in this scene plainly sounds like it was recorded in a studio and dubbed onto the scene. Very tacky. Nine, ten-to-eleven year old little boys might like it, but don't count on this as any kind of adequate history lesson.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Just get the original game called MineCraft all others are just lame copies. Actually even MC for Andriod is lame just get the desktop version.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This program is so addictive I'm not sure I should have put this on my Kindle!  It's just too addictive to put down.  And it's also a big-time power user.  I must try to cut down.
B008N9AASC|1.0|Not sure why this got rave reviews.  No real story line.  Dvd is not good quality, aside from two scenes there was absolutely nothing impressive (to me) about this dvd.

B007L5GDGW|1.0|The tilt control, at least on the Galaxy Nexus, is extremely non-responsive with the default settings, which cannot be changed. The game itself is not really compelling enough to try and &quot;get used to&quot; the faulty control scheme.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Despite the headline, I did find this an entertaining yarn.  Daniel Craig is the best 007 since Connery.  The issue with this film is there is a surreal tint to the film and it is very &#34;dark&#34; in terms of the film quality.  (007 in film noir?)<br /><br />Enjoyable none-the-less
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Very suspenseful. Great intro to Jack Reacher novels. I have been reading them out of order and was delighted to finally pick up number one. Keeps the reader involved and anxious to read more.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Absolutely hysterical. Such a pleasure to see the entire cast back once again. It really felt like you were reuniting with old friends, and it had the exact same original American Pie feel to it. Such a great movie. But I wouldn't let your little ones see it. Jason Biggs is a little revealing in this one.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love this game! Very similar to Bejeweled and just as fun! Can be addicting! Can play with friends. Have fun!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have had trouble reading some of the recent Clancy books and never could get past the first 100 pages.  The story lines were somewhat confusing, there wasn't enough intrigue, the plots were taking too long to develop and the action was slow.  “Threat Vector” was true Clancy, it was full of action, full of surprises, full of intrigue, full of facts, full of technology and I love the characters.  The plot and timing were perfect considering what is happening in the world.  Having been involved in Internet security for many years I found the book to be believable fiction.
B001F6QDMW|2.0|The music documented on this LP has seen better transcriptions (see the available, re-mastered CD from Blood & Fire). Good transcriptions present the music and the harmonies in a wonderful fashion. If you enjoy Ska with a Rasta flavor then this is one of the best sessions/mixes ever.<br />However, this version of those sessions does not do the music justice.  The product includes 2 LPs. I recieved what appeared to be a VP factory sealed product that included one LP (the title LP) which was scuffed, marred, with suface scratches and ripped labels on both sides.  The second LP was in better shape, but hardly what one considers today to be grade B.  The sound on each (when not interrupted by multiple scratches and surface noise) was thin and distant.  Too bad.  The second LP included various tracks from subsequent work by the principals mirroring some of the content on the Blood & Fire CD.  Go with the Blood & Fire, it is worth the extra money.

B004JN1CW4|4.0|I love this trilogy and James Dashner. This book was my least favour out of them all but it was still really good. *spoiler alert* as in all the books in this trilogy a lot of people for, but in this one a lot of my favorite people die which is why it's my least favorite.

B005FITIIC|5.0|A great movie about the irrational and greedy behavior of people and in this case Wall Street and banks.  A must see to go along with the NOVA presentation &#34;Mind Over Money&#34;.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|Awesome Case; This Case looks good and is holding up well. It's also a lot cheaper than the local stores.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Much better than I expected.  This movie is fun to watch, the featurettes too.  Well written, good humor and it has real charm.  For 3D TV owners this is a must-have (on par with &#34;How to Train Your Dragon&#34;).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautifully filmed and well acted! Just the right amount of history with drama and wit. The storyline is magnetic flipping from the downstairs servants to the upstairs elite and, of course, how they intertwine.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I skipped through some of it to get it over with, just an okay read basically I read it to find out the ending to a long and drawn out series.<br />Honestly, I would not recommend to anyone.

B004DHAC04|5.0|This was an amazingly exciting adaption of a wonderfully exciting novel, clean and not overly violent.<br />You were on the edge of your seat cheering on a young man in his quest to redeem his honor, save his friends and defeat evil!<br />A great family film and something you can plan to watch many times following!<br />Much better than the other versions! And I would greatly urge the watching of this version before considering any of the others, in my opinion, they do not live up to it's legacy.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love all of the Star Wars sound effects in this game. Lots of fun to play. Definitely recommend this app.

The difference between taking a sweat shirt and a jacket etc.  You get the point.  I love the different screens available, and the moving backgrounds.  I also don't have to wait for the news channel to give me the weather. Sincerely,  Bobee Hoffstatter.

1250012570|5.0|Rainbow Rowell's second novel, ELEANOR & PARK, introduces readers to two unforgettable young people whose love, though star-crossed, is no less heartbreaking or true.<br /><br />Can you think of a less likely place for true love to blossom than on a school bus? Particularly in the back of a school bus filled with mean kids being shuttled to school from their lower-income Omaha neighborhood? Perhaps this setting should be a tip-off to readers that ELEANOR & PARK is not your typical \\"happy ending\\" kind of love story. But it's a love story as true and gut-wrenching as any you've encountered, regardless (or perhaps because) of its humble origins and star-crossed destiny.<br /><br />Park occupies a tenuous social position at his school and in his neighborhood. He's quiet and kind of nerdy, not to mention small --- but he manages to be just cool enough to avoid outright torture at the<br />hands of the school bus bullies. But when Eleanor --- awkward, overweight and outlandishly dressed --- steps onto the school bus for the first time, Park has a choice to make. Does he risk outright social suicide by being kind to this girl? Or does he stay safe and let her fend for herself?<br /><br />As usual, Park threads this needle perfectly, allowing Eleanor to share his seat on the bus but seeming put out about it. Over the course of the school year, however, the two gradually develop a<br />friendship based on shared comic books, music and terrible jokes, a friendship that soon blossoms into love. When Eleanor needs Park's help more than ever, though, will he be strong enough to give it? And will Eleanor be able to trust Park enough to let him see into the darkest, most shameful secrets of her past and present?<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell's novel, her second after the adult novel ATTACHMENTS, is told in short sections, alternating between Eleanor and Park's points of view. This is a particularly effective format in this novel. Readers are able to see the two protagonists' complementary reactions to events as they unfold. Also, they are able to know and understand the real depths of Eleanor's horrific home situation and her brutal bullying at school, even before Park does. This technique builds reader empathy for Eleanor right from the start and raises the stakes for Park's often conflicted, but overwhelmingly heartfelt feelings for Eleanor as they develop and evolve.<br /><br />ELEANOR & PARK is worth reading as a really funny, often raunchy and dead-on depiction of teem romance, but it does two important things especially well. It shows two unconventional people --- one of whom (Eleanor) is overweight and one of whom (Park) does not fit conventional notions of masculinity --- as being not only worthy of love but also genuinely desirable. In addition, Rowell fearlessly depicts genuine poverty in a way that most authors shy away from --- in a young adult field crowded with romances among the rich and gorgeous, ELEANOR & PARK refuses to tell its story less than totally honestly --- it both fills a niche and provides a new model of romance that, while heartbreaking, is ultimately hopeful for characters and readers alike.<br /><br />Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a great read about Chris Kyle's life story and a true American Hero. It's one of those books that's tough to put down once you start reading it. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Military Memoir's.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Was a pretty good.  Had a decent story and good mix of action.  One of the better Mission Impossible movies.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great read. Had it done in two days, could not put it down. Can't wait to see the movie now.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Movies like Pitch Perfect (you know, the kind where everyone discovers a new part of themselves and is a better person for it) usually irritate me. And although this movie is a little far-fetched at times, it was a good mix of &#34;after school special&#34; and darker humor with an added dash of they know this isn't completely truthful, but we're going to do it anyway.<br /><br />Good acting, great songs, humor and wit. Not to mention a bit of romance. Rented this movie from Amazon and watched it twice within the 48 hour rental span. Think I may have to actually buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played. It's fun active and you get prices(even though I wish they were real.). It has a variety of people to choose from. Seriously I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story continues to intrigue with every twist and unexpected turn. It is difficult to discipline myself not to watch the entire season at one sitting.
B00005KAQP|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was on a business trip to West Virginia.  The District Manager of our WV office had invited our group to go to church with him the next morning.  The choir sang a slow song and we were all looking at each other, just wondering if the song was going to take off like those in the movie!  Afterwards, we were all chuckling about it.<br /><br />Whoopi Goldberg as a nun is a funny concept in and of itself and she sets the convent on fire.  If you've never seen this movie, go rent it or buy it - it's a gem!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This book was discussed at my book club and decided to be our read of the month. Although the beginning of the story was interesting, after the ship went down, the story became tedious. It was not enjoyable to read Pi's daily travails as he watched the animals slowly consume each other nor his attempts at asserting dominance over the tiger by consuming its feces.  One of our members who saw and loved the movie asked another, who finished the book, whether numerous questions were answered at the end. When that member said no, I knew it was time to give up the ghost. I did not finish this book, a practice that is rare for me. I truly wondered what all the hype was about.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Although the series is based on fantasy books written by George R. R. Martin, it's nevertheless a study of human emotions and motives, mixed with political intrigues that even those who don't necessarily like fantasy can enjoy.  Among many notable performances by the actors in the series, Sean Bean gives a wonderful performance as Eddard Stark, the Lord of Winterfell.  He's a strong leader with no political ambitions and has been content to stay in his hold in the north.  He is coerced into becoming the &#34;Hand&#34; of the king, Robert Baratheon, whom he helped to claim the Iron Throne after the murder of Aerys II Targaryen, popularly called the Mad King, by Jaime Lannister.  Lord Stark must move to Kings Landing, the capital in the south, and learn the ways of the court.<br /><br />After the questionable death of the King, his son Joffrey Baratheon takes the Iron Throne.  Joffrey is a coward as well as a cruel and despotic young man who enjoys inflicting misery upon others, especially his fiancee, Sansa Stark.  Lord Stark's other daughter, Arya, is a delightful, but wilful young lady who tends to be a tomboy. Lord Stark begins questioning whether Joffrey is really the king's son, which leads to his political downfall.<br /><br />Another part of the storyline concerns Daenerys Targaryen, the daughter of Aerys II Targaryen.  She and her older brother fled the Seven Kingdoms after their father was murdered.  She is forced by her brother to marry Khal Drogo, but the union turns into a love match.  Daenerys wants to reclaim the Iron Throne, which she feels is hers by birthright.<br /><br />Adding to all of the political intrigues taking place throughout the Seven Kingdoms is a lurking danger coming from the north.  There is a 700 foot tall wall of ice in the north that protects the Seven Kingdoms from dangers from the north beyond the Wall.  The planet upon which the story takes place has seasons that can last for generations and winter is coming.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|So heartfelt and drawing. I didn't expect the ending but it was perfect! It amplifies and worst and best in humanity.

B004QOB8SY|5.0|It is a shame we have to wait for season 3. I came into this a little late and I am just blown away by the great writting and acting. One of, If not the best incarnation of Holmes and Watson ever put to film. This coming from someone whoes dad made him study the Basil Rathbone movies. Cumberbatch and Freeman ( the supporting cast too) are just amazing. It is too bad they are gaining (well deserved) stardom becasue it looks like season 3 will be the last.  Oh Well , we will have these forever.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We watched this with a 4 yr old and a 7 yr old. We all liked it and some some good laughs. It has a nice story line and tyhe characters are fun and interesting. Highly recommend this one!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This was a wonderful movie to see. Bought it as a gift for a friend and I'd seen the other two before but not the original. Glad I bought it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|A very fun show if you are a comic book fan.  It adds some elements of LOST and the comic universe to keep you interested with what is going to happen next.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|&#34;Songs in the Attic&#34; is Billy Joel at his best- going back to the late 1970's- early to mid 1980's period with some of his best acoustic songs and one which has become a &#34;gem&#34;- 'Miami 2017'. His voice is at its strongest, the band is tight and the songs are all classics or near-classics, getting better with time. Highly recommended for anyone who's never seen Joel in concert (I have twice- on his very first major tour for 'Piano Man' back in 1973 and in 1984 when he was at the peak of his career). A great addition to any collection of acoustic pop/rock from the 1970's- 1980's period.
1906735875|4.0|The hammer of justice is back in America in full force with the first volume of the Complete Case Files! Showcasing progs 02-60, this book contains many of Dredd's first encounters with the lawless Mega City One and the colonies of the moon! Among Dredd's amazing feats of policing are saving the town from the killer robot Call-Me-Kenneth, confronting his failure of a brother, policing the citizens of Luna-1, and fighting off some 20th-century comedian robbers! Along with his rescued, reliable robotic buddy Walter, Dredd always comes through and beats the living tar out of anyone who dares break the law in Mega City One!<br /><br />The stories here are very interesting because they actually follow the order of real time. This book starts in 2099 and continues on until 2100. Given that most comic book companies like Marvel and DC only age like a year per real-time decade, this is really unique that Dredd ages in real time. Given that the book has about 60 issues, or progs, you'd think it'd be massive but most of these stories are only a few pages long with some telling a single comic book's worth of story in several progs. This is a softcover book with a really cool face shot cover of Dredd and the printing is black and white on a newspaper-quality paper. It's not the greatest thing in the world and some of the scans here range from really well done to very poor and distorted. The writing is all over the place with some really nice stories and some really awful ones following right after. Keep in mind, the majority here are going to be Dredd encountering a lawbreaker and arresting him in some clever way. These early progs didn't have much going for them but there were some better stories mixed in. Among the plethora of writers, Kevin Gosnell, Pat Mills, and Peter Harris join in. The art's the same story, too. Some progs have some really nice art (I especially liked the prog featuring the face-changers using comedians to rob banks) and others have bad art with even Dredd's appearance changing at times. The artists include Massimo Belardinelli, Ian Gibson, and Rod Turner to name a few. Extras include the first Dredd comic as well as some of Walter's little stories featured after some of the progs. Some prog covers are reprinted as well. The color is something of a bother but, for the price, you get what you pay for and there are not really many alternatives for colored early Dredd stuff. Overall, it was a fun read and really nice to pick up if you only have a few minutes to read something and don't want to get engaged in a 100-page long story immediately. If you watched the movies or have always wanted to hop into the mix of Judge Dredd, now's the time and this is a good place to start.dd's appearance changing at times.

1594744769|4.0|This was a very easy read. It was entertaining and kept my interest throughout the entire book. I am curious to see what else this author does in the future. I would recommend reading this book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The story touches on a subject that could affect any one of us....being severely injured, unable to care for oneself and totally dependent on others for every day functions.<br /><br />The author JoJoMoyes, handles it so beautifully, actually humorous at times, and weaves a wonderful story of hope and positivity.  I couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a roller coaster, the first half was thrilling and then the second half is almost unbelievable, yet believable. The ending was atrocius. I wanted to throw the book. For a few days I was even mad I had read it. But the truth is, it is a great read. I couldnt put it down. And no one said it has to end the way it should or the way i want it to!

B005OT2YVA|4.0|I would have given it 3.5 stars, but they don't let you rate in half-stars.  It's good, not great.  Better than part 2, which I think stunk.
1907590099|5.0|I was a teenager in the 60s, and was prone to experiment with different states of mind. Mr. Huxley not only knows how to write about these mind states but looks much deeper , into why they do and should exist. My only complaint is that it is to short. Wonderfull.

0385344333|2.0|If you are a casual reader of \\"adventure\\" novels, this one might be OK, which would merit a 3 star rating from me. But I hold Lee Child's Jack Reacher series to a higher standard. If you are a long time reader of his Reacher novels and are looking for the pace and action of the first dozen or more, you may be disappointed. This one is simply BAD.<br />The story just plods along, with little to no action through more than half of the book. All you'll get is conversation and a car ride or two. The well known characterization of Reacher is mostly invisible in everything that goes on through the first 200-250 pages. Yes, there is some action over the last 50 pages or so, but not enough to match the action contained in the earlier books. I even prefer Nothing to Lose to this book, and that was a relatively BAD Reacher book.<br /><br />Save your time and money, unless you simply HAVE to read every Reacher book. I was lucky to borrow this from our library, so I am not out any money, just time. Not sure how this book obtained as many 4-5 star reviews as it did, but everyone has their own perspective and rating criteria. Proceed with caution.<br />Jim

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is a very exiting book with adventure, and excitement.<br />The only down side is that the whole story is not in one big book. But it is so good, I want the whole series. Rick Riordan makes my favourite books. If you loved this book, you should read the Percy Jackson series and the Kane Chronicles. It is not exactly like Percy Jackson, but it still has that excitement. Both very good books. I want to buy every book Rick Riordan´s ever published.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Its a clean show.  Its so much better than watching the reality crap.  I can watch it w/my kids running around. I don't have to worry about them being subjected to certain content.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the storyline and creativity utilized by the author!!! This book is difficult to put down. The 2nd and 3rd are great also!
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I could get this to work on my kindle and wouldn't sync with my google calendar.  It was a waste of my time to download.
0525478817|5.0|A great book - and not just for the YA audience it is aimed at.  A great quick read with something for everyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Between my husband and I, we are playing this game at least 2 hours every day.  It's something simple yet fun to do.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It is ok until you you have to pay for the game to play any further. They should just give the price ahead of time so we know how much it is.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i just simply love this game!... its very very very addictive. very challenging as well. im glad i downloaded it
B009GIPDQS|5.0|A fantastic novel with a very easy to read style of writing. The story telling is simple, uncomplicated, efficient and effective. Ingenious plot. Full marks to the genius of John Grisham.
B008476HBM|5.0|I am sure that when Jane Austen wrote her book, she never dreamed that it would remain a best seller for 200 years!<br />It is writing that one comes back to time and again when you're tired and weary of the modern novel!<br />There are few authors who can claim this privilege!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I find the story line and the characters very interesting, cannot wait until I get Season 3 to see what's happening!

0062127241|2.0|I just finished Townshend's memoir and as I closed it, I wondered why I'd read it. Why did I continue to read it when I knew it wasn't good material? Because I really enjoy the three albums made during the peak years of The Who: Tommy, Live at Leeds, and Who's Next. To me, these three albums form a cornerstone for classic rock music. If I wasn't a fan of these three records, and a fan of Keith Moon, the doomed drummer for The Who, this book would've ended up in the trash.<br /><br />Pretty harsh? Here's my take:<br />- Each sub-section of each chapter is a \\"here's what I did\\" moment. Townshend obviously kept a diary of some kind, because there'd be no way he'd remember things in such detail given the drugs and booze he ingested. Some passages were, to me, worthless.<br />- In some paragraphs he begins with a statement, only to contradict that statement by the end of the paragraph. This is either very poor writing or even worse editing.<br />- He drops names like a shedding cat. It became so blatant, it made me wonder if he was giving nods to these people, hoping for their approval or to boost his vanity.<br />- The writing style is bland. There's no sense of who is telling the story, no personality in the prose.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />- Townshend lays it all out there--his sexual escapades, his lousy parenting, his in & out of addictions, his religion--to let us form our opinion of the man.<br /><br />I cannot imagine someone who is not a fan of The Who reading this and enjoying it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a movie the whole family will enjoy, from Grandparents to children alike! We have watched it several times already.
1603429999|5.0|I am using this book as a reference, it is comprehensive, well written- an important addition to my knitting library
B003UBTX6S|5.0|❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤Loved it! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤Best series ever! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ very entertaining!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very well written. Outstanding story. The ending is not entirely predictable. But more importantly, the journey is vivid, believable, and hopeful.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Not much to dislike as I didn't want to put down the book, even while cooking supper for my hubby I was thinking about the story, just loved it.  If you start to read it you must make sure you have no other commitments until you are done reading!!!
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I liked this movie. My three year old son loved it. I thought it could have had a little more humor in it. Wasn't too many funny parts, but all in all cute movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I love horse and this is perfect. :) the horse is so life like and it makes you feel good. :)
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I thought this movie was so cute. The bear fight scared my three year old but he got over it. I thought the movie was really pretty with bright colors and the music was awesome. I've watched it over and over already. Way cute.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|this movie is amazing but not quite correct. It is good for children, once you get in to middle school you realize that it is not factually correct.
B005LAII62|4.0|My three year old son absolutely loves this movie. It scares him a little bit but he loves to watch it anyways. It hasn't given him any nightmares or anything which is surprising because i didn't really pay attention to it the first time i let him watch it. I watched it with him the second time and it has a lot of disturbing parts in it that are really not appropriate for little kids. Its kind of too late for me now though because i already let my son watch it and its one of his favorite movies so if i take it away now he'll be pretty upset. So i gave it a four out of five because i'm definitely getting alot of use out it but not appropriate for kids.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I was considering buy a new XBOX 360 because of the connection issues I was having with the wireless receiver. A simple $12 saved me from buying a whole new xbox.  Not sure if the repeater part helps as well, but I have only had connection issues once every few days as opposed to several times an hour.  A GREAT BUY!
B005LAIISA|5.0|This one is just as good as the other three. You just can't go wrong with these movies. They all put a smile on my face as i'm watching them and my three year old loves them. Keep em coming.
B005LAII62|3.0|I liked this, but it isn't something that I'll watch over and over again.  It is must see at least once.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This one is just as good as the other two. I love that they brought dinosaurs into it. Sid makes a great mommy. haha.
0345525558|5.0|It was heart felt and knowing her circumstances, she delt with her demons and finally got on the path to feel being loved and conquoring her fears, fabulous!!!
B00005LOUQ|4.0|I think this movie is cute. Kinda creepy for little kids i think, but all in all cute. Its great to get out and watch around Christmas. Jim Carey does a good job.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|It's pretty good! Although it wasn't the correct CD I was looking for, but we still listen to it. Very relaxing and enjoyable.
B007DIQC90|5.0|There's isn't a bad song on this CD - I loved the whole thing. Can't wait for more from Of Monsters and Men!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because  it caused my heart to race to feel happy to feel sad , and eagerness to continue reading.  Book one of The Hunger Games
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This whole series drew me in. The final book was awesome. It was worth the time to read.<br />I was worried that by the end of the book the ending would be predictable, but it wasn't.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book and I'm recommending it to everyone! Hazel meets Augustus at a cancer support group - as two teenagers they don't expect to have much life and as the roll call is read, they see their future in early death. With such a premise, this could be a depressing book, but it's more about a triumph of love and living despite the threat of death hanging over our heads. There are some wonderful discussions on the meaning of disease and dying and through Hazel's eyes we get to understand a little of their experience. This book is needed and although Green is a &#34;YA&#34; author, I think all ages would benefit from reading it. Beautiful, harrowing, special. Thanks John.
B007WPM7SO|3.0|The cinematography and score for this movie are beautiful.  They do a great job of capturing the beauty of pre-war France, as well as the horrible conditions of the war.  However, the story itself leaves much to be desired.  The character development that we would have received in the novel is missing completely.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is a free games and is awesome.you connect the dots and try to get a perfect.there are many different ways to solve the problem.
B001IF277K|5.0|Happy with this purchase as it is good value for money and work as stated.<br />Will definitely consider buying more in future.
B005PK553C|4.0|I was late to this series and am now kicking myself.  The plot was well conceived, the script was excellent.  The characters were all engrossing  -- particularly the little girl next door with Down's Syndrome -- brilliant casting.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to watching season 2 as soon as I can get the chills to stop running up and down my back.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This book was recommended by a trustworthy friend so I knew it had to be good. However, I had to push through the first quarter of the book before I was intrigued and then about half way, I was sucked in. It was a magical story tucked into a sad reality. Well written and entertaining.
B00881VLCE|5.0|best one I've  tried  to date.  i have deleted  all the other ones. lots of free pictures  and  even more you can buy.  that you can choose number of pieces and rotate them. and the pieces. are not just squares.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It takes a spectacular writer to keep you not only interested, but truly, deeply emotionally engaged for the duration of the entire book, and Stephen Chbosky accomplishes this amazing feat.  What makes this work a classic is its ability to speak to the very heart of complex emotional issues with both intelligence and compassion.  It is truly a must-read for any teenager or any person who works with teenagers.  On a more personal note, I can say that there are very few books I've encountered whose narrative so closely paralleled my experience with being an outsider.  In the course of the last two months, I've read this novel a total of four times, and it brought me to tears every single time.
B0011UBDTK|3.0|So far, 2 of the 1st 3 DVDs are scratched. This has prevented my fiancée from completing watching 3 episodes. Very frustrating.<br />Also, an Amazon $10 gift card was not properly credited at time of purchase ( my fault), however I still haven't heard back from Amazon regarding a resolution. Bob S.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|love the thinking behind each map. the construction of each vehicle is fun. scan my kids love trying this game ouy
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Great action flick...maybe a little too much action.  The special effects were great, but the story line was a little weak.  I liked Iron Man (1st one) better.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the graphics..games played well and keeps me busy between appointments :) love it<br />I am a big fan of horses so it appeals to me.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|These two actors are so excellent you really believe they're married to each other!  The story line is totally real as well!  Steve Carell is the best I've ever seen him in a straight role.  Definitely worth renting!
B001JIAK66|5.0|Great action motion picture. Very intertaining and keeps one's attention from begining to end. A must see and own. Thanks
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|If you enjoy Family Guy or Seth MacFarlane's other comedies you will likely enjoy this film.  Otherwise there are a few one-liners and funny cameo's, but overall I'm glad I only rented it.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I was great it's the one I didn't have and the one I couldn't find in the store and I checked several.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Hopefully Sanderson has learned from some of Jordan's mistakes and won't draw this series out with unnecessary character development. So far the characters are deep and a joy to read about.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love this show! I loved the Sherlock movies with Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock, so I wasn't sure if I was going to like the Sherlock in this series. But I was hooked after the first episode!! I watched all the episodes within a few days and now I'm bummed that there's none left for me to watch!!! Must-see if you like comedy and mystery.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|a great season filled with lots of twists that make me ready for season 4!  my only complaint is i wish the seasons were not so short!
B001B6PBBK|3.0|It wads hard to stay watching this movie, it seemed very slow in the beginning. It got a bit better towards the end, but don't expect much, is just a movie to pass the time.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Couldn't holds my 7 year olds attention, but it had some funny parts. Plot was serious, for older children. You had to really pay attention to get what was happening.
B00338QELU|5.0|This is the best Henning Mankell I've read. The plot is very complex, to the point that I read the book twice so as to try to understand not only what happened but why. Even the second time through I'm not sure I understood the why. But that did not detract from my appreciation of the author's amazing skill at characterization and at plotting a gripping story. The scene shifts between China, Africa, and Sweden reflect the author's amazing depth of knowledge of these cultures. If you are a Mankell fan, don't miss this one.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Lots of fun, my girl wants to learn piano now. Lots lots lots lots lots lots of fun. Thank you.
B00881VLCE|1.0|i CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND IT...HAVE READ THE DIRECTIONS SEVERAL TIMES AND AM COMPLETELY LOST!  WOULDN'T RECCOMMEND TO ANYONE.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|since macs don't seem to have a Firewire 400 port anymore, I needed this when i began digitizing old mini dv tapes from my Canon ZR70 camcorder. this is a simple, effective fix for the lack of the 400 port, works great.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Really good<br /><br />And long great cool awesome haha yeah it is really good for kids that like books and its amazing haha
B008ASGP3U|2.0|I was hoping for a bit of something old, something new.  Poor dialogue, slow pace, trite.  Very disappointing.  Just can't recommend.
B009FB3W3W|2.0|I got this on vinyl, not from amazon but from a store. The problem I found is that whoever produced the disc may not have been too bright.<br /><br />The first problem you notice isn't about the disc, but the content. \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" present on the album is not the same studio recording that comes with the digital or cd copy. I understand electro music always varies (especially live) but this version present on the album is extremely disappointing. As anyone that's listened to the song knows the 'drops' (I hate using that word) have a set progression, occasionally fading back to the melody present outside of the drop, and then returning to the bass/wobble/stuff. The problem is on vinyl this progression is entirely lost, it simply sounds as though the song is skipping (it's not, I tried two copies to be sure) around and has no 'flow' to it whatsoever. This song is not enjoyable to listen to on vinyl and I have no idea why this version was included on the album. The downloadable copy that comes with the album is the normal, good version of the song, strangely enough. And all of the other songs on the album are normal transfers.<br /><br />The second problem with the album is that whoever produced it Messed up the pacing near the center, and the album gets progressively slower as you reach the middle tracks. All of the songs are noticeably slowed near the center and as such, the pitch is off. This is not my turntable changing speed, but the tracks themselves have been fabricated incorrectly.<br /><br />Overall, I don't even really like skrillex all that much, but I liked these songs and bought the vinyl because I was curious to what dub would sound like on vinyl. I was disappointed that my favorite song on the album was not correct and also disappointed that the other songs do not play correctly. That said, I still listen through it every once in a while, because the clean, warm versions of the song produced by the vinyl medium are quite interesting.Mixing hard electro with vinyl is something everyone should try, however you should probably go with another album.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|This may be a love story but it has so many great elements about the Titanic. Will watch again and again
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great book, fun to read and like the experiments at the end of each chapter.  You can't read it just once.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always, the story line is well thought out and the action is non-stop.  Clancy will always be one of my favorite reads.  I recommend this book for a relaxing and enjoyable diversion!
B00A8KJN14|5.0|I love Tim Burton and I was a fan of the original live action short. This is a great fully realized version Tim's vision.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|You can't stay at home on your desktop all the time.  If you Facebook you'll want this app so you can keep up on the go.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We usually dread sitting through the inane kids movies that seem to hit the market lately.  However, Wreck-it Ralph was a unique story line with lots of great funny moments.  It engaged the kids and us as well.  Definitely recommend.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This book was pretty good.  I would have liked for McEwen to extrapolate more on the ending though. I would have loved to know Serenas reaction to the letter and what she would have done!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book. It was suspenseful, surprising, and incredibly well written. Once you think you have it all figured out Kate Morton surprises you with a twist.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It's a greatly put together chess game, and good for on the road. But 2 player is better than one.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Enough said this season has a lot of laughs and in my opinion is one of the best. My favorite episode is the symphony of illumination. If you are thinking about buying please do, I am sure that they appreciate the support.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers world tour is a really good game running on the train track away from the coppers really good
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Ms. Moneypenny! I thought the story was great, the action to of course. The photography and visuals worked very well. Javier Bardem was brilliant an excellent villian for Bond.
B00992CF6W|1.0|why not get the one for 3.99 save some money you get every thing in the other one that you get in this one so why not get the other one
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Such wonderful drama!  Excellent acting and storyline.  Exquisite scenery and costuming!  PBS has hit a home run with this series!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Can't get enough Bruno Mars! Love every single song! I can listen to it over and over and over again!!!Great album!!!!!!
B007BT0RKG|4.0|This is the best map application for offline GPS on my Nexus 7 tablet. I have found it to be very useful.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved this book. I had to read it so I thought it would be boring but I was wrong it is awesome!<br />This is the best book ever
0316056898|5.0|A quick read full of self-deprecating humor, life lessons and laugh-out-loud stories from Fey's early start as a comedian.  I wasn't a huge fan of Fey until reading this book and now I want more.  Highly recommend this read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like playing this new version of the Subway Surfers Rome, Even though I lost all my money from the Rio board. I rate this game at full five.
1400034779|4.0|A great beach or pool read.  Will definitely get more from the series to hear more of Mma Rmotswe's cases.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved it and my friends can play with the gyrls so good to furture and I loved it nasty
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I liked being able to go to my computer whenever I wanted and have the series available to me instantly. Very easy to access.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|i love this show it looks amazing on blu ray, digital download is absolutely a bonus because its not standard definition like most digital downloads its on hd so that is soo much better! get this if you love this show you wont regret it.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This was exciting, adventurous, uplifting all in all \\"good hearted\\" loving and caring movie!!!<br /><br />Tell Hollywood directors to make more movies that have these qualities and then make some more!! People need positive uplifting in these difficult times for everyone everywhere and movies sometimes fill that gap...at least temporarily.  Thanks...
B0060MYM7O|5.0|love this show and digital download isn't crappy sd its hd so definitely worth it! extras are great and looks absolutely beautiful
B006LXQID8|5.0|I love this movie. I watch it all the time. It was about time I owned it and didn't have to wait for it to be streaming free somewhere
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I have heard great things about this movie for years, but I just saw it for the first time.  Despite its age, it is a wonderfully funny movie.  I recommend it highly!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|What a great point of view.  May not be accurate but interesting story.  I will definitely be more tolerant of others and appreciate parents of autistic children and the love and patience they have
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|Had this one as long as I can remember on pretty much every media on which it was published.  The sounds is great, the quality is a nice thick vinyl press.  I really miss the gatefold but I don't know if that was just the American version that had it.
B001JI72AI|5.0|pros. Great scenes on leadership in crisis situations. Great play of all actors.<br />cons. Some technical aspects of the issues could be played out better.<br />Five stars.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I ordered this movie because it was my favorite. But my granddaughter also found it to be fun and exciting as well. she really loved the songs and the characters...
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Likes - very easy to select melodies<br />Dislikes - no alarm function<br /><br />Overall almost my favorite white noise machine, next to Relax and Sleep which has an alarm function
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Jim Carrey does a great job as Horton in this movie. It is one of my favorites in the Dr. Seuss series!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds. Star Wars. Enough said... The game play is very similair to Angry Birds Space, so if you did not enjoy that one, then the same will hold true here. Just tryinng to add to the billions of $$$ made be Lucus corp. & the Angry Bird empire
B005LAII12|5.0|Love this move the BEST comedy I have ever seen and both my boyfriend and I love it. Would buy it over and over again
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! We can't get enough!! Watched first two seasons last weekend and was lucky that amazon had the third! This show is amazing!
B002QS1O36|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories of all time and has beautiful cinematography and Andrew Loyd Webbers music is spectacular
B005IQ39AY|5.0|just the type of game i like.  Helps pass time.  Easy after awhile, but still enjoy playing. That is it
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great movie and even better book.  An excellent portrayal of life in the south.  It brought back memories from my childhood that have taken on a new significance in retrospect.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I didn't get to watch this show when it was on fox, poor advertising of it. I get into sci-Fi shows and this is one of the best. Good story plot and great line up of characters. A must see if you're a sci-Fi fan.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I only read this book becuase I was so captivated by her others.  It proved to be a fantastic read.  Glad I got it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This is kind of an annoying copy of Super Mario Brothers with less functionality.  It is ok, but I quickly got bored of it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great look at mental illness and it's effects on family.  Wonderfully written!  I would absolutely recommend this read and will look for more books by this author.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I started watching the TV show over a year ago when they ran a marathon of the entire series.  Since then I have been hooked and wanted to see more.  The graphic novel does kinda parallel the TV show, but there are major differences.  So far I am really enjoying the graphic novels, I just can't stop reading them!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was completely drawn in and didn't see the twists coming at all!  I couldn't put it down!  The story stuck with me for a long time.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves the show. More than the dvds, she loved how it was packaged.  It came with a cardboard box jeannie bottle.  It was super cute.  Would definitely order from here again.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I got this book after reading her others and was drawn in quickly but also a little freaked out by the story.  It was emotionally hard to read but very well written.
B000002H97|5.0|I review this Song wow its very nice and i can feel relax when i start to play this CD im really appreciated thank you.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|It is a great book, the story line is great, it has familiar themes, but a new twist, with fight clubs, gambling, mob bosses, college love, jealousy, and just plain stubbornness from both main characters. I couldn't help but feel attached to both, and I had a hard time choosing one side over the other!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game my sister and I play it all day.This game is similar to temple run but this looks more cartoony and  it is easier.When we go on car trips we play this all day.
B001TH16DI|4.0|The special effects are not what we currently have today, but if you are a real fan, the quality is very good and you will be pleased having this in you DVD collection
B0098XY5VK|5.0|It is a time filler u and is very addictive has many levels<br />I would recommend to anyone of any age
B00136NVH4|5.0|I received an e-mail from Amazon giving me a $3 credit for any music. I hadn't loaded any music on my Kindle Fire yet, so decided I would see wha they have.  I was pleasantly surprised that this album was available for $2.99.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really like the thinking and strategy that goes into playing this game. Its frustrating but you cant put it down because you want to beat the level to go on to the next one. Very addicting which is slightly morbid seeing as you end up getting addicted to infecting and killing off the human race! I would reccomend this game to adults because it might be difficult for kids to grasp the concept and understand the objectives.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great read!  Lots of twists and turns.  This book definitely gets you to thinking about what can and cannot happen in our days of advanced technology!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Must see for anyone who enjoys the genre. Couldn't stop watching it once I started. Second season is eve better.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|love this game for the grandkids when they visit and my husband likes it to, the kids think is fun seen the birds fly.
B00ABJWQXO|5.0|Awesome! Love these Bumpers. The product is exactly as advertised, works perfectly, and compliment the look of the phone. Thank You!
1449416950|5.0|I always love these calendars because it reminds me so much of how really crazy people at work are, especially the bosses.  I need humor at work to get through it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great read, I appreciated having the old Kay back. Cornwell did a magnificent job and will keep you guessing. Enjoy.
1616550414|5.0|This book is great it answers many questions about the time line.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars<br />There is alot of reading but still good the Manga at the end makes it worth it<br />I would recommend this to any Zelda fan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome and very lifelike for a computer game. Very interactive and fun. It can keep me occupied for hours.
1616550414|5.0|I've been waiting for the release of this book since I heard about the Japanese release and I could not be anymore happy with it. A great addition of any Zelda fan's collection.
0425263916|5.0|If you love 50 shades make sure to read this!!!! Could not put it down it was so good! Must must read!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I don't want to get too heavy into a review. But I've read a few King books, and I really enjoyed this one. The best part? An actually decent ending.
B001POX73C|5.0|I smiled and laughed through the entire book. My favorite Georgette Heyer book by far! If you like historical romance, it is a must read.
B0091QS88K|3.0|I played this for awhile untitled no more customers arrived.lucky I only have the free version. takes too long to load.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I honestly wouldn't have downloaded this game if it wasn't available for free through the Kindle App Store, and it's clearly a shameless plug for the movie sponsoring it, but the gameplay is what you'd expect from other Angry Birds titles. The fact that you're rescuing other birds with your slingshot as opposed to just smacking pigs with it is a nice touch.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I will never get tired of this classic video game, but this is another case of a style of game that's not well suited to the Amazon Kindle.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a wonderful series!  Thank you for making it available for free to Prime members!  It is good to have clean entertainment available.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|I'm not quite done reading it yet. Almost. What I have read is very informative and interesting. Things I never really noticed before about body language. I'm sure I will have to read it again a few times to remember it all. Its very interesting to watch others, and be aware of my own body language, so I come across the way I intend to..It certainly does give you insight into how people are feeling, as opposed to what they are saying, or if they mean what they are saying. I think it will take a lot of practice to really become better able to read people. Although certain things have become obvious now as I look at the people around me. I'm also able to see why people often say before they got to know me, I didn't come off as exactly friendly, or they thought I was stuck up, or I looked angry, which I am very far from. It also enlightened me as to why when my father would see me walking home from school as a kid, he would say I carried myself  like I was ready for a fight. I understand now what he was talking about, and why I carried myself that way. If for nothing else it may help you to understand yourself a bit.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|This book is very efficient. He does not waste any time at all. He gets into the subject matter and is very direct. It is very organized. I skipped the Bike and Swim section. Everything else is  very useful and the kindle version is a great deal.<br /><br />Once you read this book, do not get discouraged by the repetitive nature of structure. You have to remember, it is THAT IMPORTANT to keep your abs tight and BUTT SQUEEZED. He always tells you need to do it with almost every work out and people STILL drop there abs or lose structure. I like his consistency.<br /><br />Every CrossFit gym post there WOD (Work Out of the Day) for free online I believe. Most of them least. Using this book and online resources, You can seriously do them ANYWHERE! He breaks down every workout to the bare minimum.<br /><br />With all the you-tube videos and free resources, I could never understand these movements. I had my old 1990's mentality behind ALL of them. So I joined a gym. After 5 months, I bought this book and have to tell you HE IS DEAD ON WITH THE CLASS. Exactly as we do it in class, he explains it. I wish I found this one before I joined although I love the community that comes with the gym.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Intense & real.  Actually watched it twice & would highly recommend it! Eye-opening movie that reflects what our military service people go through in Iraq!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I give this 5 stars, I've been watching the AMC show since the beginning and I absolutely live for the show. So naturally I had to read the the comics. The comics are so awesome I can't believe it has taken so long to start reading them.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Could be fun if it was not so difficult. The poor guy has never lived to make the second round. I give up!
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I'm simply reviewing the movie itself not the actual product ordered because I never received it. I love this movie and ordered the Blu-Ray for my new player but never got it (post office issue). This movie is full of crap but totally action packed and just fun to watch if you're not looking to take anything serious.... not to mention Angelina looks hot!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this device originally to power two sets of earbuds at the same time, which it did admirably.  However I noticed that the added power brought a lot of inaudible midrange frequencies to center stage. Finally my tiny earbuds pick up some of the mids! This amp is by no means as good as an expensive stationary  stereo receiver, but it is damn close and at 1/100 the size, (and price), the Fiio E6 has many more day to day applications.
0425264351|4.0|Highly improbable but good action.  Fun read.  Interesting beginning to Jack Reacher.  Count me in as a Jack Reacher fan.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The outfits are awesome and the weapons are even cooler your going to really love this game.Daily bounuses give like a thousand dollars a day (which is alot in this game).
B0083Z6AH6|1.0|The language is so Old World, I found it difficult 2 understand. I read about 35 pages & decided Y waste my time on something so \\"Drawl\\". It was written in the early 1800s & I just have a really hard time/the social ladder instilled during that era. I honestly don't understand Y it's getting such high * ratings.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Absolutely pleased with the set, video quality is crystal clear and love the case as well as the book that comes with the set!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I havent even totly look at it but...it looks so pro! I already like it cuse you know so ummm....yeah thank to the Y.O.U
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks and i think this was his best book. There was a lot more to the storyline than was first thought and more suspense than with some of his other books.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was a fun game to play, I look forward to the second one. I liked that you could pick how Hard you wanted it to be.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I just could not finish this book...and I never leave a book unfinished.  Sorry.  The story in the present would have kept my interest, but the historical sections got complicated and too convoluted for me.  Funny, no.  Crazy, yes.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|This first novel by Micheal Gallagher builds up the action to the point where you cannot put it down. The fast pace takes yo around the world in a race to find an international terrorist and stop weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands. As well as the main plot there is a lot of information about the different locations and the details of the background of the events as they unfold. There is obviously a lot of research and personal experience gone into this book.<br />Sometimes the way that the information is presented seems to distract from the main plot, but, that was probably because I was in a hurry to find out what was going to happen.<br />I cannot wait for the next installment.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|WE have all three years now in our collection and have watched many times. Amazon DVD service is great. Thanks,
B007SGM084|4.0|I had  originally thought this series was going to be disappointing, especially since I've heard so many mixed reviews.  So I had low expectations.<br /><br />When I started the first book, I immediately disliked it because I couldn't stand the writing style, but after a few pages the story picked up and the writing seemed to iron itself out to something I could read.  Surprisingly, I actually have some fondness for the characters in the story.  Ana isn't actually weak, but had some spunk and took into consideration of the emotional needs of her partner. Christian was a charming, twisted, needy and likable hero with faults that made me partial to him.  The chemistry between them was good, the emotional and physical aspect of their relationship a nice compliment that I ended up liking them as a couple.<br /><br />As for the sex and kinky stuff, it wasn't as shocking or explicit as I had expected, not like the other erotica literature out there.  I think this is a good series to introduce erotica or transition romance readers to something with more kinkiness in it.  But  there's also others \\"romance\\" books that has about the same amount or even more heat level than Fifty Shades of Grey.  I got to admit, I enjoyed reading the series.
0060919760|5.0|I've read this book 4 times or more. I just can say it helps a lot to get control of your mind, begin a positive thinking and handling daily stuff in a more relaxed, happy mood.<br />I truly recommend this book.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Bond movies always live up to the hype. Streamed the video in HD to my TV and the quality was great.
0765325950|5.0|An amazing end to be best series I have ever read.  It always kept you guessing and trying to think ahead to imagine what is coming next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is an amazing game I love it. it is about takeing care of a horse and you can name yes YOU. it comes with the name beauty.
630460291X|2.0|Kevin Costner seems to be miscast and his american accent doesn't sit well with the character. Not bad but not good either.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|I think this is a remarkable film.  Perhaps it could use a a bit of triming but it's all there and a wonderful re-telling of Kong.  I also thought the price for the instant video of it was correct.  In general I think of other instant videos were in this price range more would be sold.  the fact that most streamed instant vidoes are $9.99 a price that is not that far away from the cost of the DVD's that are higher quality makes it hard to justify the cost. If the aveage cost of streamed videos was more in the $4.99 range I know I would buy a lot more.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I have found the book slow and difficult to read.  My lack of knowledge of the French language may be my problem.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The stories will not load on my android Tablet.  I have followed all the suggestions for fixing the problem and none of them work.  Works on my smartphone, but not my tablet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love  this game it's very entertaining for those who love  animals. It  great for helping kids take care of their animals.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent book, highly recommended for everyone, it shows a real picture of the life of Steve Jobs, must read if you're an Apple fan and also if you're not.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun good game to waste invaluable time on. Fairly easy and simple but interesting and easy to get sucked into.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG I luv dis game!!! I play dis game every single day non-stop !!!!I couldn't wait to rate this game hopefully everyone who rated this gives it a five star
B002RI9UBS|5.0|what a great book!<br />It's very interesting and fun.<br />Everyone should read this<br />kind of book.<br />I love it.<br /> -Byunghee-
B004SIP7US|5.0|Gangs of New York is a gripping tale of New York in the time of the Irish Migration. With the Civil War in full swing and immigration at its highest the &#34;Nationals&#34; of New York and the immigrants from Ireland battle for their place in American history.
B0057R5XRG|3.0|I loved the movies as a kid and they are still great to watch.<br />The movies came still wrapped in great condition.<br />The movies werent really updated in graphics though.<br />the movies were a good price but i had to pay extra for going over the boarder to canada so it would have been the same price to just get it at best buy and faster.
159562015X|5.0|My advisory Board of Directors each took the assessment.  We found the information provided to be extremely helpful in our communication with each other and it has provided a more open and honest atmosphere for sharing ideas and developing solutions that help each other's businesses be more productive and profitable.
B00BP4VPUE|2.0|Are people really that gullible, maybe 1 or 2 but that many? All brainwashed like little sheep. The show is going no where and everyone is a follower. It isn't realistic even for TV. No plot twists just that everyone is a cult member. Rather watch Bones or CSI.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Fantastic movie! Craig is the best Bond by far. Once again he gets the job done. He is the man!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|After reading Lone Survivor I was addicted to first hand war books and this was a great read. Mark did a good job putting the read (me) into his situations and explaining his day to day life inside the war machine. If you like Lone Survivor than you would enjoy No Easy Day.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Finally, an app that gives me the local weather with a minimum of fuss.  I hadn't been able to find an app that would give me the local weather without crashing or needing a boatload of scrolling to get to the location I wanted.  Now I can find out what the weather is like before I start to think about what to wear for it.  Btw, I have a Cruz Velocity T301 running Froyo.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  Don't know why I didn't watch it when it was on TV years ago.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|No only are the graphics great, but the puzzles are engrossing.  Play it for three stars, then play it again and go for time!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|barely got through it. soooo boring ,  25% story line 75% fluff.  not sure R.R. lost the story mojo, or just went for the money grab. He got my money for the first four books, not going to be a sucker for the fifth,  after reading the reviews.  I  really enjoyed the first three, then it was like wading through a sewer that was ten and five.... feet deep.
B001NLL93W|5.0|One of the best series I have read. It's fast paced and you fall in love with the characters. I couldn't put it down.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|The following has a very captivating story line that draws you in and keeps you guessing. The actors are perfect for their roles and have great chemistry
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Love watching this show.  Its story lines are interesting because they come from two points of view and incorporate humor and drama.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and entertaining even if gems are a pain. I highly recommend getting the game, you will love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy this series, hated the death of Matthew. Looking forward to season 4. This is a show that one can<br />watch more than one time and still enjoy what is happening.
0307352145|5.0|I am not the talker in the family.  A good affirming read for those of us that find &#34;small talk&#34; really uncomfortable and challenging.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|No other show even comes close...specially on regular tv ..their shows are like 10 years behind...thank you AMC.<br />keep making good shows
B001224WBS|5.0|This is a very enjoyable album. It reminds me of the music that's played on 80s style radio stations and 80s clubs. I rated this album highly because it contains a massive collection of classics from Depeche Mode. It's a sure buy. Listen to the previews and enjoy, then make your own judgement.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Okay I admit it I love super hero stuff this is good stuff and fits the bill when i am jones ing for this genre
B0012GMV4O|5.0|This cd is fabulous with all the original music and without the crackling noise (I love that noise, I have records and a player) but just when you wanna boogie without flipping over the record or looking for the 45
B00899F0G8|1.0|The story is just old and lame  i don't care who did it just let it be over and let them do something elsee  the characters have some redeeming qualities but the story line just needs to be done  it is like the joke that runs way too lpong for a punch line
1616550414|5.0|Focused a bit too much on Skyward Sword though. I enjoyed the manga at the end, regardless of its canon/non-canon status.
B00BHMF578|3.0|A good try to make the Carter administration look like they were responsible for the release of the rest of the hostages held by Iran at the end of the movie.  The real truth was that Iran was in fear of Ronald Reagan and and on the day of Reagan's inauguration 1/20/1981, Iran released the hostages and the crisis was over.<br /><br />By 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded. He survived a primary challenge against Ted Kennedy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 1980 election, but lost the election to Ronald Reagan, the Republican candidate. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the 52 U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day Iran hostage crisis
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so keel and so real very addicting kinds like when you own a real horse you always have to give it attention
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Dad Gummit!  Somebody's actually found a way to reintroduce Sir Arthur's flawed omniscient detective with a refreshingly believable contemporary spin.  Before ELEMENTARY, the mention of Sherlock Holmes had me recalling definitions for words like trite and banal.  The car companies made out pretty well with their retro looking Mustangs and Challengers; you should also try your luck with some of the other classics e.g. -Poe, Twain?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down until I had read it all. I was sad when I had finished and it was over.
B0097AQEG8|5.0|Great record, definetly recommend it on vinyl.  Great guitarist and great vocalist.  The one downside is the album cover is a bit of a tight fit to put both albums in it.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|I needed to replace my old White album because one of the discs got lost in a move. No I didn't have it backed up on my iTunes. Then again iTunes didn't exist when the album got lost. I have noticed that it's cheaper to purchase an album then it is to download most albums.<br />This album is a classic for fans of the Beatles and if you've never been a Beatles fan then maybe you should listen to the music.<br />The vocal harmonies and the work of producer George Martin are at they're usual achievement level just ask Rocky Racoon.<br />Don't forget the classic &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#34; is on this album. Eric Clapton played guitar for this George Harrison written song.<br />My main dislike is the packaging of the album. It's all cardboard and no jewel case for protection. It's not easy to get the discs out of the cardboard packaging which means you can damage your disc or disc's easily, if you don't take care of your stuff. If you get frustrated enough trying to get the discs out you just might end up tearing the whole package apart.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I had seen it before so there was nothing new about it expect it was on a smaller scene.  Nothing more to add.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. If Rebecca Stead wrote any more books, I would be one of the first people to get a copy.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I liked all of the Mission moves.  They follow basically the same story line but the action is different as well as the characters.  The action was there and the ending was a little different but they always get the bad person or people.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I haven't really used this app very much so right now it is difficult for me to rate it. I wll explore this app more when I have time
B0095P31L6|3.0|It was okay. It was not quite what I had expected.  But I did enjoy it.  Nothing really to say.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Childs always excels in this series of books, keeps you interested, and in suspense. A great read in the series as usual,
B009AP4MGE|5.0|If you like Glee you'll love it.  If you like musicals you'll love it.  If you like at times inappropriate comedy, you'll love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|At first I was reluctant to read this book since it had already been made into a movie but I'm so glad I did.  Safe Haven was amazing. Always keeping your attention but nothing prepared me for the end which was GREAT. I loved it
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Unlike anything else I have ever read in Science Fiction, and I've read it for over 40 years.  I originally read this book when it was first written and have reread it many times over the year.  Can't miss with this one!
B008XCJ03K|4.0|Enjoyable and relaxing. The music was not only good but true to life. I liked the way the songs were arranged.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I was delighted and intrigued throughout this story, and I recommend it to just about anyone who likes a good story.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Five stars, haven't read such a refreshing sci-fi/ fantasy novel for quite some time. Would recommend it highly to every body.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|I like the story... it's viewed like real life.. I would like that it's was like that and they are very good actress!
B005HED11Y|4.0|Would have preferred they created a wide screen version from the negatives, but that would have altered the original and we'd have probably lost something.  The color and resolution of this series has never looked better.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a great game but it should come with a warning that it is addictive.  I love it and will purchase the full version.
B003719GGS|5.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect, I went in this figuring that I knew what my love language was, but after reading through it I was certain it was something else.  I can see how the two are similar and even related, but I was sure I was wrong going in.  After doing the test at the end I confirmed my suspicions and it's amazing how you can really get a sense of what makes you happy just by reading a book.  I've already recommended this book to a friend who is having troubles in her relationship (but I didn't recommend this particular version, instead of I recommended the regular version).<br /><br />I have no idea how this one differs from the original version and how it's slanted towards men than the others, but I didn't get any great insight out of this that I don't think I would have gotten from the other version.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love this game. The hog's have awesome graphics &amp; I love that you cab enlarge to find objects. Excellent storyline. Worth the money to play this game!!!
B0002234LS|3.0|I love stephen king but i did not like this movie it was so werid and i did not understand johnny depp in this movie he has a good side and a bad side and well its to out there for me
B0018RC7QE|2.0|The plot really showed no evidence why these two would fall in love. Streep was always dressed like she shopped at an over-size thrift store. DeNiro asked a friend if he was good-looking. The director seemed to have an obscession with commuter trains and the noise of transportation.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This is a dream for anyone obsessed with audio gear or music.  Very well researched, shot, edited, and sounds great. Loved it!
B00A3SHW1O|5.0|Love , Love, Love the new album from Pitbull. Teach Zumba classes and I just love his music. It will make you want to move your body.
B000GCFG7E|2.0|I have read most of the Jack Reacher books and this is my least favorite. The plot was unrealistic and somewhat disjointed.  i almost didn't finish it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Watching this on Amazon Prime sans commercials is like watching a really long and awesome movie. No way I'd watch anything on network TV again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can`t wait till the movie comes out.  Well written, could not put the  book down.  Very unexpected ending, sad that Prim is gone.
B001DHXT20|5.0|this is a fun film and if you like looking at fun stuff this is the movie for you lots of action.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This was a great movie! I saw it once in theatre's and once again on Amazon Instant Watch. I highly recommend it to any fans of the Star Trek franchise or to those just getting into it. This is the movie that began my Star Trek fanaticism.
B003UYV08E|5.0|this is a fun movie and full of action if you are looking for a super hero then this is one great movie for you.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Great price and great quality. As expected it arrived fast and well packaged. The vinyl is great touch and the live gig was awesome
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This is a wonderful movie for the family with a young active child that loves adventures and action movies, or toys.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its amazing how this app has been the top paid for so long now. I think that's just incredibly. Definetly get this game guys.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a riveting account of a great American Warrior, Chris Kyle, who laid it all on the line for God, Country and family.  This story brings home the sacrifice that all those who serve in the Armed Forces of this Great Country make so that we as Americans can continue to live enjoying our freedom.  It takes the reader behind enemy lines and also describes the price that his family paid for his devotion to his country through the words of his loving wife.  It is a tragedy that after placing himself in harms way on so many occasions that his life would ultimately be taken by one of his own whom he was trying to help.  God Bless Chris Kyle for writing his account and THANK YOU to all men and women who freely and voluntarily serving this great United States of America, land of the Free and Home of the Brave in all branches of our Armed Forces, they will NEVER be forgotten!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I typically don't have an interest in horror movies or over dramatic &#34;B&#34; rated projects but this show is amazing, unpredictable and thoroughly suspenseful. I will be purchasing the next season.
B009MO57H6|3.0|I love the Resident Evil series of movies...this last installment didn't really have anything new to it.  Lots of action, but there are no surprises.  Resident Evil fans will like it...others will probably find it a little boring.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I've never read a book like this. It was hard to get into it at first. The more I read the more I literally had to keep reading, because I had no idea what was coming next! The story really did play with my feelings towards the characters. Not a fan of how it ended. I know people that absolutely loved the book which is why I would recommend it, but I'll never read it again.
B006S009IY|4.0|the movie had a different take on the Peter Pan movie by Walt Disney. It brought a wonderful perspective with regards to the author of the stage play. Great for all ages of the family.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|In late 2006, I was introduced to Soilwork at a House of Blues concert.  After being blown away by their impeccable performance, I bought and played Stabbing the Drama non-stop for months, which led to purchases of Figure Number Five, A Predator's Portrait, and my personal favorite, Natural Born Chaos.  All were great albums, and suddenly I had a new favorite metal band.  Unfortunately, I didn't find Soilwork's next two releases all that inspiring.<br /><br />Sworn to a Great Divide was a fun, if shallow album.  The Panic Broadcast was more ambitious, but didn't flow as well as previous albums, and featured a couple of boring moments.  Still, either album would be a career highlight for most other melodic death metal bands.  They just weren't Soilwork's best.  Luckily, The Living Infinite - Soilwork's new, monster double album - breaks their relative cold streak, and stands as their newest masterpiece.<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />Of the two discs offered, I found myself slightly more drawn to disc 1.  Spectrum of Eternity, the album opener, sets a blistering pace for the album, and may be better than Late for the Kill, Early for the Slaughter, which I found to be the highlight of The Panic Broadcast.  This Momentary Bliss, Tongue, and Vesta are all instant Soilwork classics, with blistering guitar riffs, machine gun drums, and the excellent vocals from Bjorn Strid we've all come to expect and love.  In fact, I'd say that he shows more range on this album than any previously.  From the catchy screaming on This Momentary Bliss to the flat out singing on The Windswept Mercy, Strid brought his A game.<br /><br />Best songs: Spectrum of Eternity, This Momentary Bliss, Vesta, Whispers and Lights<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />The longer of the two discs, disc 2 offers two instrumentals - Entering Aeons and Loyal Shadow.  Unlike disc 1, which didn't waste a single second, these songs come across a bit as filler.  They aren't bad by any means, but they don't stand out enoughto serve a greater purpose outside of providing long intros to two of the best songs on the entire album - Long Live the Misanthrope and Rise Above the Sentiment.  Both have been released as singles, and like much of the material on disc 1, represent the best of Soilwork's songwriting.  Likewise, Drowning with Silence is another high point on the disc.  But nothing comes close to the penultimate song on the album - Parasite Blues.  Parasite Blues features a completely different type of chorus from the band.  Again, Bjorn Strid shows off his range.  A lot like Nerve from Stabbing the Drama, the unique vocals create such a catchy song that it'll be impossible to get out of your head.  Parasite Blues isn't just the best song on the album, it's one of the best songs Soilwork has ever written.<br /><br />Best Songs: Long Live the Misanthrope, Drowning with Silence, Rise Above the Sentiment, Parasite Blues<br /><br />As great as Bjorn Strid is on The Living Infinite, so are David Andersson and Sylvian Coudret, who share guitar duties.  Few solos stick out, but the musicianship is masterful, and everything fits perfectly into each song structure.  I thought the band would be weakened by the loss (again) of Peter Wichers, but they haven't lost a step.  Likewise, Dirk Verbeuren has to be one of the top drummers in all of rock today.  He absolutely kills it on The Living Infinite and has become the backbone of the band.<br /><br />The Living Infinite isn't perfect - Memories Confined, Antidotes in Passing, and Owls Predict, Oracles Stand Guard are slight letdowns from everything else on display.  But unlike the weak songs on The Panic Broadcast and Sworn to a Great Divide, each of these songs have moments which encourage not skipping over them.  As a complete package, I can't imagine Soilwork putting together a more worthwhile, fun 80+ minutes of music.  The Living Infinite is as good as anything Soilwork has released before, if not better.  It's truly an album that should be appreciated by not only melodic death metal fans, but all rock fans as well.  Buy it, love it.
B001AG52AG|4.0|Not what you would expect, there were many different scenes and everyone seemed to know each other... kind of weird and very open ended. I would be interested in seeing the continuation of this movie. Kept our family interested. Easy to follow with a twist.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|My granddaughter was happy with this and now we are starting to get the east of the Friends Lego sets.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|First of all let me say that this not the original series; they made a LOT of changes to the show that some fans may find irksome. I actually prefer Lorne Green over Edward James Olmos as Adama. Suprisingly the character I seem to like the most in this series is President Roslin. The fact that they changed Starbuck into a girl still bothers me, but I am getting used to it. I will not even atempt to explain the character change to Boomer and Athena. This reimagining of the series has a vibe of its own, and it is GREAT! The stories are incredibly well written. This is not telivised brain candy; this is a show geared towards those who crave epic story arcs, and many multiple sub-plots. The sense of storyline continuity, and emersive sets makes you feel like you are stranded in space on the Battlestar Galactica along with the other characters. All the charachters are well rounded and developed. Like I said this is an extremely well written show. I just purchased this set, and I must say that it is turning into one of the best T.V series I have ever watched since Babylon 5. Ever since I have gotten hooked on B.G I am no longer a Trek or SW fan.  Yes, this series IS THAT GOOD!
0375850864|5.0|This is a very good book. It is about a middle school girl that keeps getting notes from a mystery person.<br />When she gets her last note, she thinks se is too late to save her best friends life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down.  It is amazing how the author developed all the details that were woven together so perfectly.  Although I couldn't wait to see how it ended, I would have liked it to continue a little longer.  Great and interesting book.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|La película es excelente! Muy buena definición, menú increíble. El grano está bien, no molesta. El menú del blu ray es muy bueno.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The product is good but it doesn't seem user friendly.  Of course like with all new apps once you learn the language it works great.  Some things you just want to use and not spending hours dreading instruction manuals.
B005LAII80|5.0|La película es excelente! Muy buena definición, menú increíble. El 3D es muy bueno, no molesta. El menú del blu ray también es muy bueno.
B00466H3DG|5.0|le DVD Blu Ray et remarquable en langue  anglaise  et en français  la qualité de la vidéo et impeccable et surtout le film et magnifique
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Buena calidad. Buen formato. El menú de los blu ray es pobre. El grano de la película en algunos momentos es excesivo.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Watched seasons 1 through 3 in the network but missed last 2 seasons.  Decided to start the series from the beginning in preparation for its end.  Just as good as the first reviewing.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|La película es excelente! Muy buena definición, menú increíble. El grano está bien, no molesta. El menú del blu ray es muy bueno.
B001L5VYFI|5.0|I remember when this album came out. Man! What memories! Acoustic and then Electric. Excellent album! I am very pleased with this purchase!
B009JZSC9S|4.0|I had to purchase this particular episode because I was missing the last 7 minutes on my DVR...courtesy of sunday football.  Regardless, I was glad I did because those final minutes made all the difference to the whole episode.
B00001QEE2|5.0|I purchased this older DVD for my grand-daughte,r who is eight.  She has it memorized! The quality of the DVD was great...like new.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although this wasn't exactly the best written book in the world, I still gave it five stars because it wasn't you're typical kind of love story. It was a mixture of flowery romance and erotic romance. It was entertaining and it kept me wanting more. This book is definitely meant for adults so teens should not read this.
B008KE3960|1.0|its nothing like tower defense and you have to control the plane yourself.its sooooooooooo dumb.don't let the word &quot;FREE&quot; fool you.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Loved it, play it all ther tkime my grandson, lives kit and we have tio tell him to stop.  His hands get tired,
0316223239|5.0|The writing is exceptional.  It is interesting to hear this story from the point of view of a five year old child.  It is a facinating story.
B002KGKH5A|5.0|this is a great doc if you are a fan<br />the WS are such a versatile band , unconventional and Jack and Meg are so talented
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, but my wife hates it. This is a great way for me to enjoy the show when its convenient for me. Very violent and graphic but I knew that before starting to watch it.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Requires too many coins to do things or purchase items, takes too long to advance to next level. I think I would enjoy it better if I could advance quicker and cost was reduced.
B007N85POS|5.0|The graphics, color, and sound are great. Its an easy game to play but still challenging. My grandsons think it is awesome.
B000BNTM96|4.0|Great live cd if you enjoy QOTSA! Hard to find a DVD of the band and this one rocks hard
B001OSIV62|3.0|This was an interesting documentary. It was neat to see someone's long term goal that's so crazy accomplished. Past that its nice to see the older foootage of the construction of the towers.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Hard to find CDs in stores anymore and harder to find any queens of stone age. As always, great cd, as they all are
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am totally in love with this game. My children and I battle each other on our kindles, & of course I never win but it's a great bonding experience! :-)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have never enjoyed reading a series as much as I'm loving reading this one.  I love how each chapter is dedicated to one character.  Reading it on my Kindle is just a joy since I mostly read in bed and if I was reading the book it would be so cumbersome!
1439130833|5.0|This book was sent to me by God! I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF AND READ IT EVERY SINGLE DAY...
B001N4RORE|5.0|I have watched this movie many times now!  It's fast become one of my \\"go to\\" movies when I'm needing something fun, lighthearted, and entertaining.  And while I grew up enjoying the original ABBA music, my daughter's didn't but they stop what they're doing and watch it right along with me- even singing along!  Teenagers- whoda thunk, lol!?
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I would read ALL of the 4HR books. My son gave this to me and it is three inches thick and packed with fantastic information. The best cooking book I own.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Everybody should try this game it's so cool and if you want real fun get Leps world one too!!!!!! IT IS SO AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is one of my favourite games and I would recommend this to any one thank you to the people who invented this THANK YOU !!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Really like the ease of joining family calendars together and the different views. I highly recommend this calendar to anyone especially those who want to merge with family members.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great game and gives the player a fun goal to work towards. It's a great way to have a good time and I would recommend to anyone who likes a game that teaches the player to have patience and not expect to win every award in the first day. Also I've heard that it's much better than the original temple run. Of course I am only 13 and a half so I am not sure how much adults and older teens would like it. I do know though that it's a great game and I give it a 5 star rating.
B00BEU6JVY|5.0|Being a fan of the Moody Blues since their beginnings--i was definitely curious since none of the group has put out anything new(that I was aware of) for many years.I am very pleased ! I listened to the whole thing first time with headphones and was swept away(as I was many years ago with their original LP's).Even though it is just Justin---It still has that 'sound' that I love.I highly recommend this to anyone that is the least bit of a fan of the Moody Blues.You won't be sorry.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Lovely!! Great pace, unbelievable but believable. Jack Reacher enjoys action in USA and UK and with his kind heart leads himself in ... and out of trouble.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season really picks up the action. Yes, it's still more human drama than zombie fighting, but guess that - that's what it's supposed to be about! It's about people surviving - or not - after the outbreak. The successes, fights, and deaths don't mean anything if you don't get to know the characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I didn't even like Temple Run..but the second is one of my favorite games! If you liked temple run, you'll absolutely love it!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This would be a great summer's read as the book is in sections, and you can put it down, but you won't want to for long.  Lots of information you may not have known, and much that was clarified.  I never realized how much Roosevelt demonized Hoover, and how Truman ressurected Hoover's reputation.  Huge surprises about Nixon and Carter-most of the surprises about Carter occurring AFTER his presidency.  The writing is magazine style, yet the scholarship is excellent, and the footnotes &#34;hook up&#34; even in the Kindle version.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great great read. I just love this book, and love scenes are erotic and explicit. Five thumbs up. A must have!
1455523550|5.0|My fiance suggested I read this, he could not have been more accurate on how much i would love it.  I would def recommend anyone to read it before they watch the movie.  I haven't seen movie yet but the book was incredible!!  :-)
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is set in a nonexistent place where everyone has what they call &#34;sameness&#34;. The main character Jonas has reached the age where he will no longer be considered a child and have to start his training for his assigned job. The town all gathers for a two day ceremony where each age group is moved to the next age group and phase of their development of growing up in &#34;sameness&#34;. When it comes time for Jonas to become a 12 and receive his new career he is expectantly skipped during his assignment but at the end given the honor of being chosen to become the next Receiver of the community. Jonas has always known that he was somewhat different then his friends so when he finally starts his training he comes to realize that he was put into the right assignment. Jonas learns that &#34;sameness&#34; is not what is best for the community and along with The Giver plans to make everyone see what they have been missing.<br />The Giver is one of my all time favorites and is more for the age group of pre-teens or older. The older the reader is the more the reader will be able to understand and analyse it. This is definitely a book that can be read more than once in my opinion and the story line never gets old because it does not give any specific time frame. A MUST READ..several times!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved the 3rd season! was by far the best one yet. Was trying to get my girlfriend all caught up on it and the first few episodes weren't on demand. That's where Amazon comes in, had to buy them so she could catch up. Its that good! Highly recommend it
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The War of Art is an easy to read collection of powerful insights into the mind and struggles of anyone who is trying to achieve something in life. If you need motivation or help getting rid of whats holding you back, you should read this book today!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing.  I can't wait for the fourth book this fall.  I could not stop reading this book just like all the other books by Rick Riordan.  I also really like how this series carries on from the Percy Jackson series.  Once again i could not stop reading this book and thought it was amazing.  This is why i rated this book five stars.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I never thought a show with zombies could be so good. It's a great story about survival. And it's survival of the fittest.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the characters in the book,, and Sparks made the subject of spousal abuse come alive.  i admit the book had a slow start, but after about 7 chapters it became interesting.  This book is much different than the other books by the same author. Since my husband and I used to vacation in the Myrtle Beach area, I am familiar with the small southern towns that Sparks brings to life in his books.  The locals  all know one another and seem to care deeply about each other . In most large northern towns, people are harried and unconcerned about each other.  Most times one does not even know his/her next door neighbor.<br /><br />While the he main character, Katie/Erin, was portrayed to be extremely courageous , she also was  highly deceptive and secretive due to her circumstances.  I would have had a difficult time with all of the the secrets she was forced to keep . If i were in her position, I would have been in a constant state of paranoia and anxiety.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is a must for any true Led Zeppelin fan. They are older but we are too. They still have the heart and soul ,deeply honed a lifetime.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I enjoyed it, and i think others will too.  It should be a must read. Will keep you interested for chapters, can't wait to read book two!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting, great story told thru 2 perspectives.  View of the wealthy upper class towards life and the folks who make their life easier.  View from the working class that work for the upper class.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first saw it, I just got it because everyone was saying it was good, but when I started to actually play it, it got really addicted really fast and now I cant stop playing the game. Usually when a game is this entertaining and smooth, there's a catch, but I have yet to find one. I recommend this to anyone who likes temple run or Anthony with quick decision making or just want something to keep them occupied. Very much appreciated creaters, very much appreciated. ;p
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Got this for our grand children who are enjoying it along with two other Angry Bird selections. Feel it helps hand/eye movement.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I feel like my copy is missing the last few chapters or something. I love this trilogy and this is another great book but the ending is basically non-existent and I am extremely disappointed. Horrible series finale. #frustration
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Got this for our grand children who are enjoying it along with two other Angry Bird selections. Feel it helps hand/eye movement.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book was so awesome it was hilarious I can't believe that they made another book it is going to be awesome.
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|I was encouraged to read this book for work.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  It was a quick read and had great stories that show that simple is better.  In a world where everything has been made so complicated, the concept of simple is better is so refreshing.  I highly recommend it.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I loved the movie & I LOVE the soundtrack!!!!! Catherine Zeta knocks All That Jazz outta the park! She was AWESOME!
B004WKI204|4.0|Not too in depth but very honest, self deprecating and relatable. Her struggle to balance it all and believe in her own ability or obvious success is refreshing - albeit hard to read from an empathetic perspective.<br />Loved her depiction of The Don- her dad. Her writing is so descriptive without being obvious or lazy.<br />All in all, great read, I'd recommend it to anyone who has a penchant for autobiographies. Whether you're a fan of Tina Fey or you just love a good giggle.
0385040253|4.0|If you are nuts about knots you must have this book.  There is simply nothing to compare.  There is no other book that is nearly so comprehensive or contains as much history and information.  Even though it's expensive, it is well worth the price.  You will get a lifetime of enjoyment from this book.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />This is definitely not for beginners.  The amount of information is absolutely overwhelming and there is no guidance for selecting a small repertoire of useful knots to memorize.<br /><br />The drawings are very basic and the tying instructions are succints and often not easy to follow unless you are an experienced knot tyer.  Many of the knots are difficult to tie well even if you do have some skill.<br /><br />For all but the simplest knots,  just knowing how to weave the rope is not enough,  one must know how to properly dress the knot and this takes practice and experience.  Dressing a complex knot is often far more difficult than weaving it.  Ashley gives very little guidance on this.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Out of all the seasons so far, this one is lacking...  thought season 2 was the best so far.. Just my opinion
0783230079|5.0|A fun love story that goes deeper than the creative premise - spirits of people killed in a bus accident find themselves attached to a baby who is born the instant of the crash. All sorts of life lessons are woven into the plot. Humorous and fun to watch.
1939416019|3.0|Again...Tolkien?  Martin?  Who is Allegra Skye?  I will never read her.  These books read like a comic book compared to Tolkien & Martin.  I bought the series (naively) based on that thoroughly misguiding review.  I should have read some of the customer reviews here first.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a somewhat engaging, quick, easy read (like a comic book)...if you can overlook all the obvious errors (which are legion), and the superficiality of almost every detail, you might even enjoy it.  If you can't overlook those things, I promise you pain.<br /><br />Heck, I like comic books.  I read all three...or am I just a glutton for punishment?  I might even buy the fourth.<br /><br />If you are looking for an epic comparable to Tolkien, Martin, Donaldson, or even Brooks...avoid at all cost.  You will be hughly disappointed.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Nobody can deny Wreck It Ralph is a great quirky movie, Character scripts are decent & Vanellope adds a great flair to the overall atmosphere. The Chibi-esque Animation style for the sugar rush characters is just too cute and the Movie really is great for any age (I would say 6+) There are some semi violent scenes were Ralph breaks vanellopes racing kart and she starts crying and its really sad that the young ones might freak out about but its nothing crazy and short.<br /><br />Now onto the Packaging (The 3D/BLURAY/DVD/DIGITAL Combo)<br /><br />As-Usual the Bluray, Digital, and DVD discs are plain single-color prints. The 3D Versions disc has artwork on it but its ruined by a huge \\"Only will work in 3D players\\" ... no duh einstein, its a 3D Bluray so people should know that to begin with!<br /><br />Onto the digital version, people make it out to be a nightmare but it really is not. Behind the 3D Bluray disc (or to the left of the case behind the paper if you didnt get the 3D package) you will find a disc, you put it into your computer and then run the program on the disc, enter the code... and then select itunes or windows media player to rip the movie.<br /><br />HD & SD are the SAME thing just a smaller resolution. This option is really meant for mobile devices and tablets, the resolution is 853X356 which is qHD (480P)it will look perfectly fine on your ipad, android device, ipod or iphone, etc. It is 1.44GB, if they had provided an HD Copy if would be up to 4 times larger (3~5GB) in size, so think logically before complaining because most people do not want 3GB+ used on their device from a single movie, 1.44GB is already pushing it. the Digital version also still supports DD5.1 in its encode.<br /><br />The packaging itself is quite interesting, they glued a hologram stock card onto the sleeve of the 3D Version which looks like it could eventually come off with time.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game is entertaining and while FREE it will take money to really play along. That is not my reason for only giving it only. 4 stars,  problem is that while you are playing the save function is not always working.  You may wind up playing and log off to find out later that everything you did was lost, it's happen too many times. This is a major flaw in the game.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I don't know how much you can say about a USB cable uther than it does it's job so I'll say it's great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Incredible amazing addictive in resume all of good things about a game and good promotions and good updates and good work about making this game and the best thing is about the game is free
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|By the time I arrived around half of the book, I was beginning to wonder how the book would end. It was totally unexpected, from something lighthearted (basically boy-obsessed-with-girl and vice versa turned to be something deeper). There may have been a a lull which made some parts boring, but overall, I enjoyed the book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am not sure what the hype is over this book.  I finally read it because it was on the best seller list for so long.  I wanted to see what I was missing.  After reading it I have concluded that I was not missing much.  Very slow.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nice twists and turns.  Would recommend for a fun read.  It's been a long time since I couldn't put a book down.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|I've watched this movie several times in other versions, but today watched it for the first time in Blu Ray.  What a tremendous difference!  If you treasure this classic, then the only way to view it is in its Blu Ray version.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Really enjoyed it. It was a good movie. Me and my husband just bought it. Waiting to see the next one that's coming out soon!! :)
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I didn't think I'd like this book, thought it would be predictable. I was pleasantly surprised and found myself sitting up reading at 4 am.<br />It's funny, sad and thought provoking. Not many books centre around a main character who's a quadriplegic, but Ms Moyes has done a good job with this one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After completing the final book in this series, I can say it was the best, and not for the obvious reasons.  I knew how it would end, but the way she got there was surprising .  There were some unexpected twists, and while you figured out how it would end, there were plot lines that made me want to keep reading.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|They physics are crap, when you place a coin it barely does anything, and you go bankrupt after about 30 sec because you cant get any coins becausd they all fall over the edge, its a really crappy game, dont buy it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was great i liked that it was not so much sex but more of the love side. I did get l lost at some parts but other than that it was a really good read. The best of the series looking forward to the 4th book hopefully :) <3
B00991TCOG|5.0|Over Christmas, I created a Transiberian Orchestra station on Pandora and she popped up in the queue.  I'd heard of her before, but didn't realize she had an album out.  After a few weeks, I realized I had liked every song on the album that popped up on Pandora, so I used some of my Christmas money to buy the album.  I haven't been disappointed.  My five year old daughter loves to listen to it and dance and it's really great driving music.  I'd describe it as classical violin mixed with elctronica, a little dubstep, and some really awesome beats.  Great debut album; can't wait to hear what else she comes up with!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I thought the book was pretty good I liked the first one a little more but it was all in all a good book a little disappointing if I had to wait for the next but fortunately I don't I hope the final book will give me closure ... I love this series so far peeta is my favorite character
B003QSEKTU|5.0|I usually don't watch these type of movies but thsi was pretty decent, I loved the songs, the cast is talented and I loved the part with Matt Prokop and Tinsdall :)
B003WMA7BU|4.0|Quite different from the movie. This book paints a deeper picture of driver. I'm looking forward to reading the next book, driven.
B003SJ4NRG|5.0|Brendan Fraiser is funny and the movie is pretty interesting and some parts are sad if you love animals and comedy, watch it
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. Was pleasantly surprised at how well the case was made, even if it is cardboard. We also like the way the disks are stored. Will definitely keep little hands from pulling them out and scratching them.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|What a fabulous read!  The words come to life as you picture the events in your mind and laugh.  I recommend this to anyone!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Simply a fun game. Easy and complex at the same time. Not a time consuming game, just fun at whatever amount of time you want to spend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|creative in every way. new temple. more than one charecter. power ups. this game is the best game I have ever played.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|it is the worst game I ever played ever ever in the world and the badest ever and the most boring. game ever I mean ever
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I chose to give this a 5 star because it kept me pulled in at every turn in the book! Loved the characters in this book and how easy it was to relate to them!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I bought the Blu-ray version later, and there is no comparison.  Must see in blu-ray or 4K.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good movie about teenagers who have to go to war for their district. It has Jennifer Lawrence and sheis a good actress.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I really enjoyed this Christmas Album, and I should have ordered it earlier.  Whitney voice is the greatest, and the arrangemnts were fabulous.  The music was recorded somewhat odly, but the overall ablum is fantastic.  I will treasure it for years to come.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The story was interesting right from the beginning. Can't wait to see the movie. I read this in 2 1/2 days
B0000AI45P|5.0|I have owned this album on vinyl since '77.  It is by far my favorite of this era, and I think, holds up very well. Give it a chance to sink into your soul, and you will be playing air guitar until your arms are tired.  The interplay between Verlaine/Lloyd is timeless, and to my knowledge has not been replicated.  No way such an album could be made in the homogenized, sanitized world of today.<br /><br />Funny how things work out.  This album remains relatively obscure, while minions pay homage to the tuneless blathering of such groups as the Sex Pistols.  Just shows how unfair and bizarre life can be.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Another good read. I'd never heard of the author before but look forward to reading more of her books. I've always had an appreciate for flowers having worked for a florist, but now my interest in the meanings has surfaced.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I thought it was interesting....<br />Being in the medical field myself-I have seen some things that are beyond explanation.<br />I think the author could have improved the book by giving more detail of his actual experience.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|We really enjoy all things Monster High and this latest DVD is no exception. As a parent what I like about the show & books is how it teaches my daughter that different is OKAY, that you don't have to look like everyone else to do well in life. I would definitely recommend this to other parents that are trying to teach their children the same message.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Perfect collection. Very little to add to what has been already said. Pick it up when it is on sale and you won't be disappointed.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love TED, great way to get up to date information.  I love the download options for viewing videos on the go.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My favorite books are ones loaded with suspense.  I've read many, many James Patterson and for my<br />book club, we had to read this book by Lee Child.  Now I am hooked on his writing's as well.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The first season was good.  It was dark with an interesting story.  The second season is even darker and more twisted than the first.  If you like horror then you have to watch this series.  I love it!
B001CDZZI6|1.0|I purchased the kindle version and two weeks later never received the strengths finder code which you're supposed to use to gain access to the assessment on the creators website.  Needless to say, most of the book is pointless without that assessment so there is no point in having the book.  I contacted the support for kindle and they couldn't do anything about it so they issued a refund. What a waste of time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, so much action and drama what more could you ask for in a tv series. Recomend to everyone
B00BHMF578|3.0|The film is not hugely flawed or a waste of money.  It's solid and well made, interesting to watch.  But I usually expect an Oscar-winner to dazzle me.  This one didn't.<br /><br />Usually, it takes action sequences, big important monologues, courageous heroes, amazing CGI special effects, stellar performances, etc., to get today's audiences interested in a movie.  But this one attracted lots of positive attention from viewers and critics, despite not having those things.  To Ben Affleck's credit, it's much more difficult to craft an interesting movie when the subject matter is a handful of ordinary people trying to get out of a tight spot.<br /><br />The best parts of the film for me were the carefully-choreographed crowd scenes that vividly captured the fervor and near-insanity of the Iranian revolution.  I remember those times and they made me anxious.  Affleck's re-creation of the time was as I remember it.<br /><br />However, for my money, there are four films this year that I would place ahead of Argo.  Films that (IMHO) DID dazzle me:  In order-- Life of Pi, Silver Linings Playbook, Django, and Lincoln.
0062014536|3.0|Hana and Lena childhood friends, now live in two very different worlds. Hana has taken the cure against the disease \\"love\\" and lives in the rigidly controlled world, while set to marry the Mayor. Lena has thrown off her chains and lives in the Wilds, free to choose how to feel and act, and has learned firsthand the bitter sting of heartbreak. But both sides are in turmoil as the rebellion brews. The regulators have stopped ignoring those in the Wilds and are now actively seeking out Invalids like Lena. And those Invalids are more determined than ever to fight back. The world will never be the same.<br /><br />REQUIEM is told in point of view rotations between Lena and Hana. I'm honestly not sure how I felt about this as I don't really think Hana's perspective was necessary. Did I mind those sections? No, but I also do not feel like they did much to further the plot as the information gleamed just couldn't stand up in importance to what was going on with Lena. In all honesty I think everything of importance with Hana could have been condensed into a chapter near the end when their stories met. Hana simply could have told her side to Lena, and it would have taken up a whole lot less space. Space that could have been spent focusing on the things that drew me to this series in the first place, the elements of love. Regardless of what \\"team\\" readers may be on, I think at the core there needed to be more love in this book. I realize that love as a disease was just used as a way to control the people, but I still wanted to see more of that catalyst in motion. There was just something so magical and captivating in watching Lena learning to love in Delirium, that I felt incredibly bereft at it's loss of focus in REQUIEM. Don't get me wrong, there still is talks of love, especially as Lena struggles to understand the two different directions she's being pulled in. But it seemed to almost stay in the abstract sense, and I just didn't feel consumed by it like I would have wanted.<br /><br />When I finished REQUIEM, I knew I would have to wait a few days before writing this review. That ending really took the wind out of my sales, and I was hoping some time and space would help me be able to review it more objectively. However, here I am a week later, and I can honestly say that my disappointment and frustration has not lessened one bit. There have been times in the past where the ending of series has left me feeling less than satisfied, but I think REQUIEM may very well just take the cake. I remember reading somewhere that Lauren Oliver was really excited about the unconventional decisions she made. Perhaps those decisions will work for others, but I need at least some semblance of closure to satisfy me. I do not want some overall \\"message\\" as an ending, and I certainly don't want the ending book to be a huge tonal departure from the first installment. I want to know what happens to the characters, and what kind of life is coming next for them, and REQUIEM did not provide any of that. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect everything to end up pretty and happily ever after for the characters, but I did expect to be given more than just a message  of tearing down the walls at the end. I'm not one for \\"cause\\" books, I read to be entertained. So when you end a series that I've grown to love with only that message about tearing down walls in our lives, I was rather frustrated. In all honestly, it's soured the series for me, which is really a shame as prior to reading REQUIEM, it had been one of my favorite Dystopians.<br /><br />As I look over the other reviews out there for REQUIEM, I realize that my sense of disappointment seems to have put me in the minority. So, I would take my thoughts with a grain of salt, and if you have enjoyed the previous books, chances are this one will work well for you as well. That being said, do I still believe Lauren Oliver is a very talented author? Absolutely. Will I be reading more books from her in the future? You betcha. But as far as REQUIEM goes, I'm just going to chalk this one up to a difference in stylistic preference and move on.? You betcha. But as far as REQUIEM goes, I'm just going to chalk this one up to a difference in stylistic preference and move on.

This would be an excellent book for someone who has never carved stamps in their life, but it's not for those with more experience under their belt.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|For years the only Rolling Stones concert videos available were the ones from the Ron Wood era of the 80's and 90's. This 1972 concert film offers Stones fans a long awaited look at the band rocking the stage in their mighty prime when both Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor were still in the group. Filmed during the Exile on Main Street tour in Texas in 1972, this movie shows the band at the peak of their performing powers with a great set list that covers most of the classic Stones hits of the late 60's and early 70's. The only real problem with this movie, as others have mentioned, is the poor lighting and camera angles that somewhat kills the mood and atmosphere of the band's performance. Gimme Shelter and Midnight Rambler in particular are filmed almost completely in the dark. This is a film that would look better in a movie theater than a TV screen in your living room.<br /><br />The movie begins with a nice, suspenseful opening sequence. The screen is black as we hear people behind the scenes getting ready for the Stones to take the stage while the flickering of stage lights begin to appear as the moment draws near. The band is introduced by the announcer as they take the stage and launch into Brown Sugar. Jagger, Richards, and Charlie Watts are all in fighting form here, but Wyman and Taylor look bored to death the entire performance with zero stage presence. As others have said, Taylor is a fine blues-rock guitarist who delivers plenty of red hot solos throughout, but he is so stiff and motionless on stage that he doesn't appear to be enjoying himself at all. The same can be said for Wyman. It's not hard to see how both men eventually left the band after seeing the total lack of enthusiasm displayed here.<br /><br />The highlight of the film for me is the final four tunes starting with Chuck Berry's Bye Bye Johnny. The stage lights finally come on during the closing tunes and the camera finally gets a few shots of the audience while the Stones deliver a final blastof high-energy rock n' roll to close out the concert. If the entire concert had been filmed with the better lighting shown at the end, this would have been a great concert film. Despite the bad early 70's lighting and camera work, the sound is good and this is likely the only concert footage of the Mick Taylor era that will ever be issued. If you love the Stones or classic rock, this is a worthy DVD for your collection, but don't be expecting the top-notch video and sound quality of today's standards.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Very fun gane high addictive qualities.  Also I spent more money on this game than any Play Station Game.  You can't get real far without in app purchases.  I can't play on Facebook and GAMELOFT needs to explain their site better. Calling this a free game is a joke.  3 stars for cost and confusion.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|One of the best shows out there and such as good product. Has nice special features, organized much better than the first season and has very interesting features and commentary. Picture and sound quality are excellent, looks stunning on our flat screen. DEFINITELY worth the money so if you are contemplating, I strongly encourage you to purchase this, you will not regret it.

B001DDBCUA|5.0|Just like the show, I loved this movie. It continued on with the story from the show and was funny, sexy, and a little sad at times. Really kept you interested and had surprising turns and outcomes throughout. I am such a fan of the series, the ladies, the story, and the relationships so if you are as well you will enjoy this movie!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Once you get a hang of how to play and adjust to how the pieces are displayed, it becomes very difficult to put down.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|This DVD was not as good as the first sex and the city but how can you not enjoy watching the four lovely ladies. I wanted the story to continue from the first movie and it did but not as much as I would have liked. It was very funny at times, a little upsetting and sad at other times. If you are interested in buying this DVD, I would suggest just renting it or borrowing it unless you're like me and need to own the DVDs. Do watch though if you are a Sex and the City fan and want to see what happens after the first movie.
0316056871|5.0|I picked this up for my lady as she had previously mentioned how many copies she had purchased only to turn around and give them as gifts without actually reading it. It made her happy, so it makes me happy. Plus, Tina Fey is aces in my book, so I'm sure it's a great read.
B00421IR5I|5.0|This is a cracking little French comedy made in 2009. It stars Maxim Godart as the little Nicolas and he is a talent to watch out for and has already made another two films. In this he leads what he knows is a charmed life, loving his parents, his home and his school mates – well all except the Teacher’s pet ‘cockroach’ grass one with glasses.<br /><br />Then one of their class mates has a new arrival – a baby brother and he relays that  life is now the pits for him, worse still he stops coming to school and no one knows why. Then Nicolas overhears his parents talking of a visit and they say he must be gotten out of the way. He now knows that not only will he be getting a baby brother but that they are going to dump him; possibly in the woods as the urban myths have it.<br /><br />So he sets out on a charm offensive and all his school chums are going to help – badly that is. As his demise gets closer their plans become ever more urgent and funny.<br /><br />This is set in the sixties and just oozes style and charm in equal dollops. The clothes the cars the primary colours and lack of office technology and casual sexism are all just brilliant, well maybe not the sexism. The acting is superb with a cast of kids that are all brilliant, entertaining and funny in all the right places. This is laugh out loud at times too and had me wanting more. Sandrine Kiberlain as their teacher deserves special mention as she is really good and well rounded as always. She is also in the ruddy excellent ‘The Women on the sixth floor’.<br /><br />This is also one for the whole family as kids will definitely get it too. This tells the story and the reasons they do things all from a child’s perspective and the collective naivety that can come from kid group decicions, which is just great. So for a refreshing warm, family comedy in France based sixties, you need look no further - really warmly recommended.
B004P68T30|5.0|Great little app for kids.  My 2 & 5 year old both love fox in socks, and this way we have it wherever my kindle is.  Great for when we make little stops & some of us need to stay in the car.  I can read it to them, my 5 year old can try by himself, or the app reads it to them.  I love the fact that they can &#34;turn the pages&#34; themselves or set it to auto play.  We have 3 of these Dr. Seuss apps, and all 3 have great narration that I don't mind hearing repeatedly.  And it's a way to let them use my kindle that's much more educational than angry birds!

1419705849|1.0|Oh, dear!  Another \\"Wimpy Kid\\" book.  Will they ever end, or will we follow Greg Heffley all the way to the nursing home?  I actually asked the publisher not to send me any more of these books because I really don't like them, but I am a book reviewer, so they send them anyway.  I realize that they are immensely popular with many children and that some critics have praised them to the highest heavens as being truly in tune with the problems and angst of the modern middle school student.  This may be part of the reason why they simply don't appeal to me whatever.  I was in \\"middle school\\" (we called it upper elementary and junior high then) back in the 1960s, so the events and feelings of Greg are very far removed from my own experiences.  Furthermore, the things described in the book are exactly the kinds of negative public-school related experiences from which Christian parents who homeschool wish to shelter their children.<br /><br />  In The Third Wheel, Greg, who I believe is just in either seventh or eighth grade now, is really concerned about not having a girlfriend, especially with the upcoming Valentine's Day Dance.  This may seem strange to a lot of folks, but at one time nearly all religious people opposed mixed dancing, and there are still a few of us around today.  These kids are but twelve or thirteen, yet there is a lot of talk about getting a date and how to go about it.  This is only middle school, yet Greg says, \\"It's hard to keep track of who has gone out with who in my school,\\" one boy boasts \\"that he's kissed a bunch of different girls in my grade,\\" and one couple has \\"been going out...since the fifth grade.\\"  Whatever happened to protecting the innocence and purity of children rather than pushing them into sexualized situations at earlier and earlier ages?  I guess that this is what disturbs me most about these Wimpy Kid books, especially since they're marketed to children as young as eight.<br /><br />  In addition to the dancing and the dating, there are references to other such wonderfully educational experiences in school that leave such pleasant memories as kids having toilet paper fights, people making obnoxious noises at a fellow named Bryan Buttsey, and guys getting \\"pantsed.\\"  Also, Greg's Uncle Gary has been married four times, spends what money he has on scratch lottery tickets at the convenience store, and is addicted to a virtual-world computer game--a really great role model!  Thankfully, the language is not too bad, with only a couple of common euphemisms (heck, dang it), although Greg does use the expression, \\"God knows what else.\\"  There may actually be some real humor somewhere in the story, but it's completely lost on me.  Admittedly, young people could be reading worse, but they could certainly read a lot better.  So far as I can tell, there is simply nothing in the Wimpy Kid  books that would be of any interest to godly people., there are references to other such wonderfully educational experiences in school that leave such pleasant memories as kids having toilet paper fights, people making obnoxious noises at a fellow named Bryan Buttsey, and guys getting \\"pantsed.\\"  Also, Greg's Uncle Gary has been married four times, spends what money he has on scratch lottery tickets at the convenience store, and is addicted to a virtual-world computer game--a really great role model!

0345803485|2.0|I had fun with the first half of the first &#34;Fifty&#34; book because it was something different.  But after that, the same scenes got boring to me.  I could not even make it through the first half of the second book.

Noticeable also are many MMA stars complete with time-tested cliches and sweaty tanktops! Forget the plots, ignore the grunts, groans and sneering--these guys are all business and bad guys watch out!  The special effects and stunts are incredible as the high tech weaponry and gadgets help level the playing field in the face of insurmountable odds defying the boys..........Just let go of preconcieved expectations, fasten your seat belt, hold on to your favorite beverage, snack and blast off!  There are more thrills packed into these flicks than watching 24 hours of NASCAR's favorite car crashes........But wait, here's a little treat for the ladies: Expendables 1 features the strong, silent-type Jason Stratham defending the honor of his girlfriend against her abusive Ex and his chorts playing hoops in the park; in fact, Mr Stratham literally strikes a blow AGAINST domestic violence proving NICE GUYS DO FINISH LAST! I cannot get enough of action films and these guys have clawed, kicked and punched their way back on top!!!  I anxiously await Expendables 3 (well, I can hope can't I?)

B003YFIUW8|4.0|I didn't know much about this book prior to purchasing. I had actually purchased it because I try to read the national bestsellers since oftentimes they are quite exceptional reads. The lettering on the cover page is kind of chilling and the short synopsis on the back cover got me intrigued since it didn't really explain much of what the book was about so I was eager to figure that out by reading it. Let me say that I was quite confused as to where the story was going in the beginning. I hadn't read a story where the protagonist was a 5 year old boy. It can be quite challenging to understand him at times but as the story progressed things took a turn for the weird. It's kind of scary because something like this could actually happen at any time. The story was split into two halves basically. My favorite being the first half. I don't want to spoil anything so lets just say I definitely did not see the story turning out the way it did. But it happened in a good way. I think overall this was a good, interesting read & I would recommend it.

B00BHMETKC|2.0|As soon as my viewing of the movie was over, I went straight into fact-checking mode after some events raised a red flag in my mind.  As a British citizen, I was taken aback by the mention that the British had apparently refused refuge for the American Diplomats.  Of course, upon checking the real events, this was in fact further from the truth--in reality, the British embassy in Iran was actually the first place to host the Americans.  It was decided, because of safety to then move them on to the Canadian ambassador's house and the Swedish embassy.  Ben Affleck admits that he changed this to make the movie more dramatic: \\"I struggled with this long and hard, because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair. But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone.\\"  One of the diplomats, Bob Anders, has said of the British that hosted him and the other five diplomats: \\"They put their lives on the line for us. We were all at risk. I hope no one in Britain will be offended by what's said in the film. The British were good to us and we're forever grateful.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, when giving a movie review, I have a huge problem with pushing historical inaccuracies like this aside and rating it for it's other aspects.  The acting was fantastic, the sense of realism was amazing (apart from the airplane chase, which I found ridiculous) and I think the script (aside from the inaccuracies) was good.  However, two-stars off from the four I would have given if they had not played with history.  Plus, this was better than Lincoln?  I don't think so.

Performances from the cast are great all around, it is wonderful to see Bruce Willis play a character that is 'sloppy' and a bit 'meek.' Dark and twisted (literally) humor is funny even after seeing it many, many times over again - Hilarious!
B007M45PMU|3.0|I bought this album for one song. Unlike other album purchases I have struggled to find another track I enjoy. This album is very folksy and rooted in &#34;down home&#34; music. While I appreciate the talent of the band, I feel it is just out of place with my overall tastes, and makes me feel very...old fashioned.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it best game ever get it awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
B006BXT4TI|5.0|This was my first Black Keys album and I have to say I am impressed. The music is dynamic, clean, and simple, yet complex and deep. I love that the tracks aren't long and overrun, but end quickly and naturally when the song's message is finished. I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|Now King Kong was not disappointed becouse it a old King Kong . Which I use to to have VHS of the same movie so I like.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I enjoyed this album. It was good, but not great. Previous albums had a great variety of music styles and messages, but this album seems lost in a dreary existence where hope is fleeting. The music quality itself is fantastic, but the lyrics have much to be desired, and the over all tone of the album could have used some lightening. That being said I did enjoy the album, I just didn't love it.
1616550414|4.0|Hi all!<br /><br />I really liked this book and enjoyed each page. I only think that it should came with a CD/DVD with images, videos, enterviews and so on...<br /><br />See ya!
B00498YZH8|5.0|This was a fantastic movie that really &#34;stayed with me&#34; for days afterwards. It was refreshing to see a great drama that didn't have the distraction of lots of explicit sex scenes.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Some TV series take some time to gain their &#34;legs&#34;.  But &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; starts strong right out of the gate. I actively avoided this show when it first came out because I thought it would poke fun at geeky stereotypes in a way we've seen so many times before (&#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34;).  But in this case, we sympathize with the characters, feel bad for them, and laugh with them.  As a Caltech grad myself, I can attest to the realism of these situations (though they are exaggerated for entertainment value of course).  I really enjoy this series and look forward to watching the entire run.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the books my only complaint is that I wish there were more of them!!! Wish it was longer!!!
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|The case this movie comes in is a rather flimsy recycled case, which isn't really my top pic for cases, but worst of all, it states that there's a 20 page booklet that comes with this purchase on the cardboard slip, which frankly isn't there. If you're going to swap out the high quality case for a garbage eco-friendly case, at least photoshop out the claim for the 20-page book.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love all the songs in his CD!!! All the songs are very catchy and I can relate to them.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This is a film masterpiece, and deserves to be enjoyed in high definition. Normal definition does not do the vibrant colors and electrifying visuals of this piece of the four-part Evangelion redo any form of justice. Get this movie, sit down, strap in, and hold on.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great read! Was written very well and is an intense thriller. Can't wait for Dark Tide. Hope it is as good as this one.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|LOVE IT! IT IS STABLE ENOUGH!!!!!! The color is awesome. Strong material and easy to assemble. It comes with all the pieces to assemble it and connect the monitor!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|A good game overall and should be more games like it. The full version should be free. The idea of the game is fantastic and it works well.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|The storylines stay interesting and if you hold on to the end of the season, you finally get some closure in several of the storylines.  It's a fantastic show and I love that it is clean and has some virtues throughout it (even if some of the characters will probably never have an ounce of virtue!)!  Definitely recommend to anyone!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very captivating. It touched my heart and soul and I recommend this book to anyone looking for an awesome novel that reaches deep within your soul.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I got bored reading it. It drags on and is very thin in terms of plot -- at least so far. I doubt I'll finish the series since I couldn't get all the way through the first book.<br /><br />I closed this book and started reading Elseerian (The Chronicles of Lumineia #1) by Ben Hale. It was fantastic. In fact, before I'd finished this book, I bought the other two in the series and all three were a delight to read -- real edge-of-your-seat, can't put the books down stuff.<br /><br />REVISED REVIEW:<br />After running out of other things to read, I decided to give this purchase another chance and I'm glad that I did. To date I've read and enjoyed books 1 - 5 and wait, not so patiently, on the sixth. The story got so much better as the series progressed and the characters and environment took on much more depth and realism. The plot seemed to become more focused and less predictable. The series has keep me up late many nights wanting to know what happens in the next chapter, and the next, and the next. Kudos to the author for imagination and vivid storytelling -- in short exceptional talent.<br /><br />The editing still sucks. The prose is full of misspellings, misused words, conjugation errors, broken sentences and duplications, however, the storytelling is worth overlooking the \\"English 101\\" errors, after all, none of us are perfect. Still it would be nice for modern authors to learn and employ proper language and writing skills such as the correct usage of words like: then, than, further, farther, there, their and they're for example. Historically, people have learned vocabulary, punctuation and structure from reading the written word.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Serenity was a fabulous television series with complete and full characterizations and usually interesting plots. This movie was created by the force of fandom, and while it may not stand up to the best episode of the one-year series, it allows fans to revisit their favorite characters (although it would have been nice to have spent more time with &#34;Preacher&#34;). It fulfills some incomplete story lines that were cut short by the show's cancellation and also has some surprises -- happy and sad. Fans will love it, and those who have not seen the series need not be knowledgeable to enjoy the movie.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved how the characters are growing and changing! Makes me wonder what's happening next. I purchased the audible book s9 really getting the picture.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|For some reason, my 20+ word review was denied, despite being accurate, succinct and not snarky.  I even went for extra credit and provided almost 25 words - from a touchscreen keyboard.  The Amazon review panel suggested that I might want to consider writing between 75 and 500 words to flush out my review.  And so it has come to this.  Despite seeing 3,562 5 star reviews, at the time of this endeavor, I cannot, in good conscious, agree with the other reviewers.  After multiple downloads and re-installs, the game crashes at a green crystalline \\"i\\" inlaid in a stone carved and patterned to look like an \\"8\\".  I can only presume that is the logo for the publishers.  For while I have an empty tab to the right of the one I'm writing in, I find that I am no longer interested in \\"googling\\" the publisher's site to see if that is correct.  The nerd press was a-twitter during the game's launch and 3,562 fellow amazon customers can't be wrong... sadly, I cannot partake in that joy.  I can only hope that two hundred (I didn't forget to include the title) words passes muster. One star.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Intense....even more amazing that is is based on a real story.  Ben Affleck carried the movie....made me love the CIA!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I always enjoy a Clancy book. His characters become people that you feel you know and care about. And, just when you think you know where the story is headed there is a great twist that makes your heart skip a beat.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game. Horses and competition s  dressing your horses and riders different backgrounds and other options for horses including unicorns and zebra if u save up
B005K01VZS|5.0|I love the stories that Mitch Albom weaves. It is like you are sitting down together and sharing things that are close to the heart.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game. My grandchildren like to<br />play it every time they come over to my house and I keep it going for them
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I really didn't like this movie as much as I thought!  It has to much of a gleeish copy!  It was okay and I stayed awake to watch it but not my type of movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I cant stop playing it. it is so much fun that who ever does not have this game is very crazey and needs to get it as soon as possible that is how fun it is.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|When I don't want a lot of pressure but need something relaxing to do... this is it! I really enjoy the beautiful boxes.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|More mellow than white stripes but a few bangers, good record all around, nice to jam around house on the weekend
B0058VW36U|1.0|This game was not fun to me and it bored me to death~ I got it for free and still deleted it.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|Anything you need to know about the 5-2 diet can be found by a quick Google search. The book describes how it works but it really is so simple that there's no need. The recipes are almost non-existent. I am looking forward to trying the diet (I start on Thurs) but I kind of wish I'd saved my money!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|A real tough one.  Certainly a big jump from Original.  Not quite a appealing to look at as the others.  Still trying to make it through.
B008XG1X18|5.0|before I got this app I didn't use pintrest often. now I use it a lot. wonderful app to have.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|All my favorites in one...it doesn't get much better than this! And I also took advantage of a Kindle coupon of $3 off so it made the music even sweeter to my ears!
0345803485|4.0|little hard to get into but sticking with it to see if I get the same effects as all the reviews of this book.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|My wife and I love NCIS. I guess we are in need of our &#34;Gibbs fix&#34;.<br />We had previously purchased the DVD sets for each season. This year we decided to try the instant video through the internet.<br />We gave viewed only 3 episodes so far and each one has been very good. As usual, the cast is great and the stories are well written.<br /> I would recommend NCIS and I would suggest to anyone who has not tried the instant version to give it a shot. We do not do the HD version. The standard download gives good video quality, not excellent. One caveat-- there are no captions if you need assistance in that area.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I downloaded this app on my daughters kindle fire. It's an adorable app but... it allowed her to purchase gems minus inputting my card information or verifying. It simply charged my card immediately. I got an email from amazon thanking me for my purchase before she was able to walk to my room to notify me. She's only 5! She assumed that the money they spoke of was part of the game. I have deleted this application and will NEVER AGAIN redownload!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is easy to play but so addictive, even if you're not a horsey person!!!I love it, and everyone I know who has it is now hooked too!!
B000W9399S|5.0|Discworld began here - and it has been worth re-reading (actually several times). Delighted to get it on kindle - always available should I need to be transported back (with luggage) to wizards and Ankh Morp. Sir Terry Pratchett is absolutely amazing, for children, for young adults, for adults, for scifi or fantasy fans. Period.
B004TLDZ3U|5.0|If you like Opeth and the music they play and write, you will like this album.Some great tracks, great musicians.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|I love buying music through Amazon. It goes directly to the app on my phone and can be added to your itunes. They often have better prices too. I got this album for only $5. You can't beat that. Overall, I enjoy it. I am not a huge fan but I think it's ok.
B00628BOMM|5.0|A friend of mine turned me onto this band, and recommended this album first. This is a great band and great album from start to finish.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|I rent movies through Amazon so I can watch them on my Kindle while traveling.  Works out perfect for a trip on a plane.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever for my children. The first time I tried it they were having so much fun! But they will get addicted to it
B0000029DD|5.0|I enjoyed every song on this quality CD. I got it especially for his version of Hallelulia, just as good as Leonard Cohen's.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! I hate to have to end it but it's so great! It's so worth it to get it.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|I love this movie, and I always want to show it to new friends but can never find it in a video store.  The price was right, so I bought it and can watch it whenever I want now.  Joy!
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Got it very fast through the mail and it was in good condition. Well packaged as well as grouped with my separately ordered accessories! If you are a fan of active gaming, Wii, PS3, etc. then this is the product for you.
1452110581|5.0|So funny and right on target. Dogs have owners, Cats have staff. I bought a second copy for a cat loving friend for her birthday. I bought one for myself after I saw it with an English Lit instructor. She is using it for her poetry segmenty of her class. Gotta love it!
B003Z49N10|4.0|This story is incredible depressing, and I found myself pleading with Tess to just off herself at times. A story of how truly twisted the psychology of men and the social norms of the times. Tess is incredible resilient, and the embodiment of the sinister notion that when life gives you lemons, they are always rotten. Overall a beautiful story of how harsh life maybe.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|I'm still the cool grandmother. I have to admit, I didn't know who the and was, but my grandson really wanted just the poster. I bought the poster and then saw this CD, and knew tht he would love it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game we're you build anything you want except it would be cool if herobrine was in it but so far I have it on my kindle &amp; Xbox version best game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and crazy what these seals go through, defenitely recomend this book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love the extra buttons! It allows me to customize the buttons to most of my games, and it isn't overkill. I really have no need for a 20-30 button mouse, this gives me just enough.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|I added this app to my Kindle Fire - I travel a lot. It caused my machine to get stuck. The only way to un-stick it was to turn it off. I've removed it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I did not enjoy the ending.  All the diverse elements of the plot did not come together in a believable way.
B000F3T7X8|5.0|It's hard to recommend this album to the uninitiated.  It truly requires a bit of time to wrap your ears and brain around the arrangements effortlessly exectued on this, Japan's masterpiece; Gentleman Take Polaroids.  David Sylvian and company had radically altered course on Quiet Life, released in 1979, and had pointed in several directions their future output might go in.  The fact that it wound up being a hybrid of New Wave and Free Form Jazz suprised even long time fans.  No band at the time or in the future ever sounded like them in the truest sense, however, many bands (Duran Duran, Tears For Fears, The Teardrop Explodes) would use them as the template from which they would build their own sound.  They never liked being lumped in the New Romantic or New Wave scene, however, they wound up defining both genre's perfectly. Japan also challenged their fans with complicated music rarely found during this period of music.  Gentleman Take Polaroids is a release that simultaeously defines and transcends its genre.<br /><br />Some of their best songs are to be found on this release.  Swing being the first track that grabbed my ear and helped me get used to the rhythms and time signatures they were deploying.  Methods Of Dance is another standout among gems.  This song simply reaches epic proportions unlike anything else on Gentleman.  Their relatively playful cover of Ain't That Peculiar works much better than their previous take on I Second That Emotion.  Some final shout-outs go to Nightporter and included b-side The Width Of A Room.  No previous album can prepare you for Gentleman Take Polaroids and their next record, Tin Drum would see them depart into another direction almost completely.
B003MAOTP2|4.0|This is an awesome historical event to capture in a major movie, but oh, how Orlando Bloom doesn't belong.  There are countless other actors that would have made this movie top notch.  And the rest of the cast is brilliant.  Great effects as well.  A little bit of glorifying Islam while painting Christians as savages, when in reality, both were quite savage at the time.  But, no more than you would expect out of Hollywood.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|We rented it, and watched 12 min. before giving up. It's a very &#34;artistic&#34; movie, meaning that it's not even normal. It is difficult to follow and not at all what we expected.
B005NB5RWM|5.0|As close as we can get to the events of this turning point battle in the US Civil War. I teach high school US History and use sections of the film in my classes. Overall, battlefield scenes and troop movements are reasonably accurate and give the viewer a realistic overview depiction of the three day battle. Too bad, however, that the fake beards and mustaches did not receive greater attention in the make-up department though.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Well written. Stories included to maximize the information. Easy to digest and in some ways incorporate into your life. Recommended!
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Needed a braided cable as it had to snake around a bunch of others in my TV setup.  Did the job well and arrived quickly. No Complaints
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Entertaining. Worth watching. Good pace. Effective. Tells a part of history that we all need to know. Intriguing and effective.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is quick and fun. You have a choice of different ways to play. I have another game that you can't continue unless you solve the puzzle where you are. Hence I give up and turn it off. Solitaire lets me play whenever I want to.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Love reading all the Wimpy Kid books with my Boys!  They make us laugh out loud while we are reading!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is awesome and everyone should get it you'll love it.It is grosome which is a mixture of great and awesome; so that is how much you will like it.And it's freeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Love reading all the Wimpy Kid books with my Boys!  They make us laugh out loud while we are reading!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Absolutely great game. I had so much fun going through it the first time I had to do it on all the levels. Definitely worth the effort.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact was an excellent story.  It was hard to put down right from the beginning.  I enjoyed learning about the main characters and couldn't wait to find out how the story ended.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Let's start on the basics. The Novel is amazing. It's written very well, and has a great story. The script was fun to read. The second Disc was awesome, and the first disc was even better.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've used ESFE for a number of years now and I keep going back to it on every new device.  You will not be disappointed.
0517220784|5.0|Dude, it's all the Sherlock Holmes stories ever written by Doyle.  What more do I have to say?  Who am I to comment on the masterworks of arguably the greatest character ever created in any genre?  To have this book on my shelf is my honor.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My boys and I love this app! They love taking care of the animals and feeding them, and I love Safari chase.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I have read a lot of roller coaster romances over the past couple weeks and this one wasn't as stressful as some.  I didn't love all of the fighting but I was satisfied with the way the fights were reconciled.  I didn't like how Abby's friend Mare was sort of all over the place...one minute don't go near Travis and the next we all need to double date.  Just sent the wrong message to Abby.<br /><br />Yes I can see why all the girls love Travis...he shows his love better than he was able to put it into words at times and I can appreciate that having a guy like that myself.  Sometimes that is even more awesome.<br /><br />My only complaint SPOILER is regarding the fire.  People died and no one came to question the guys that put on the fight?  And no consequences?  That just seemed a bit wrong for me.<br /><br />But would I recommend this book to someone else...yeah.  Again, I liked the story...just some tidy endings that shouldn't have been so tidy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cannot wait to start book 3 Mocking Jay<br />dont know how I missed the original craze but now I am addicted
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|I love, love, LOVE Desperate Housewives!!!!!!! I watch them religiously and now own all of the seasons. If you love jokes, drama, action, and everything else in between, then this is the show for you. I was not a fan of this show until it was about on its fifth or sixth season and it caught my attention and now I cannot get enough of it. I am going back and re-watching it because I just canNOT get enough!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is captivating - it's addicting - The writers of this show are so creative.  I watched 4 season (40 to 50) in 6 weeks, that's pretty bad, I couldn't stop watching, it's highly addicting -
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved this book alongn with past ones. n Kep writing Michael Connelly  I have never been disappointedn in Michael Connellyis books and interested right from the beginning andnbook ends too soon.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I am on the 5th season of this show.  It's addicting.  I am so entralled by the show that on more than 1 of the seasons, I starting watching the show and viewed the entire season (10 - 14 episodes per season) in 1 to 2 days.  I couldn't turn off the DVD player.  There arent too many shows that REALLY captivate me.  The Soprano's, 6 ft under and Lost, now Breading Bad.  Whoever writes this show is brillant - I highly recommend for adults, certainly not children with the content.  BRILLIANT!!!!!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|As usual Michael Connelly keeps you in suspense till the bitter end. And then some!!!!!  His Lincoln lawyer series is great reading.
B00866JL96|5.0|What a great story, it makes you want to route for love.  All the struggles just to get there are worth it and you get to watch it all come together.

0062014536|5.0|Requiem is the third installment in the wonderful Delirium trilogy by Lauren Oliver.<br />Much like Pandemonium, the chapters in Requiem are split. This time, we get chapters alternating between Lena, and her best friend Hana.<br /><br />Lena's story starts right where Pandemonium ended. Alex has returned and has joined with the group in the wild. He is completely ignoring Lena, except for the one outburst where he proclaims that he never loved her. Lena is distraught because she finds that she hasn't completely moved on, and that she still cares for him. But now she also has feelings for Julian, and a typical love triangle results. While Lena is having this internal struggle, the Invalids are having struggles of their own. The wilds are no longer safe, now that the government is eradicating all resisters by bombing the wilds and sending in troops to kill the survivors. They must find somewhere safe, as well as help the resisters to fix the government if they want to survive.<br /><br />Hana's story starts a little while after she was cured. She is having a hard time adjusting to the new lifestyle. She is unsure whether her cure is working or if her mixed feelings are normal, but doesn't dare ask. She can't help thinking about Lena and what happened when she tried to escape with Alex. She also feels guilty for the secret that she's kept to herself about Lena and Alex, and the disaster that happened at the end of Delirium. In a few weeks she will be married to the new Mayor, Fred. Her life and wedding have become public icons as proof of the happiness and stability that come with the cure. But as her wedding draws nearer, she finds that Fred is not what she thought he was, and that he may be keeping a dark secret about his former relationship.<br /><br />Towards the end of Requiem, Lena and Hana's stories converge to a thrilling and suspenseful ending. The ending is definitely not what I expected, because you don't get all the answers that you want. Not only is it open for interpretation, but it leaves you feeling uplifted and amazed at the power a few words can have. But I still keep hoping that Lauren Oliver will write another short story to tie up the ending better.<br /><br />Lena has changed so much throughout the trilogy. In Delirium, she was the weak, innocent character, and the last person who would run to get away from the cure. In Pandemonium, she became someone who could stand on her own and make her own choices. But she also became hard and angry as she kept pushing away her past. Requiem is where a balance is found. We finally see Lena's full potential as a well-rounded and truly strong character as she learns to accept and learn from the past.<br /><br />I finished this book only hours after it came out. Requiem definitely held up to my high expectations despite the unexpected ending, and gave a thrilling, well-paced conclusion to the trilogy.en for interpretation, but it leaves you feeling uplifted and amazed at the power a few words can have.

B004W1GCQO|4.0|A short first season but long enough  to hook you. can't wait until season two is available on instant prime.
0345541588|3.0|Child is one of my favorite mystery writers and Jack Reacher is one of my favorite good guys.  There is just no bull from this ex-MP.  This is #14 in the series and it is no slacker.  True, there are some Reacher novels that I have liked better, however, I may be getting confused.  Please allow me to explain.<br />Of course, the movie version just recently aired starring Tom Cruise as Reacher.  This is like Billy Crystal playing John Wayne.  It just don’t work.  Jack Reacher is 6’4” and can defeat and disarm many bad guys in a variety of ways.  He is also very resourceful, and only carries what he needs – which would be a toothbrush, basically.  There is no overkill on weapons or ammo.  He buys cheap clothes at K-Mart and such places.  He wears them a few days and throws them away – just like Tom Cruise would not.<br />This book begins with a potential subway bombing in NYC and escalates from this point.  It is a very good book.  It is not my favorite of the series, but it is very good.  It has all of the elements that we have come to expect from our Jack Reacher novels and this one does spin into a good tale.  I hate to give too much away and this is one of those that one should just read.  I would recommend this book to any Lee Child fan, fully aware that they would not be disappointed.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|it help a lot to download videos and it is a very friendly user any body can work with it...
B001V5CIFS|4.0|My daughter (5) really enjoys this and I am glad to get to watch it with her so we can talk about it. The art direction is pretty sublime-- beautiful colors and textures, costumes, etc. And of course the cast is first rate. The story and direction is not super exciting or new in any way. But it is entertaining and an interesting film to compare to Mary Poppins, and other magical nanny stories.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|Love this game but after a couple of days I lost all of my progress as well as all of the new restaraunts that I purchased.
B004EK91LQ|5.0|This was a very good movie for my Daughter and I to watch together and we both really enjoyed it.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|This music is so deep and great. The record is a little bit uneven (maybe a couple of throwaway tracks, but even those sound good, they're just not as superb as what comes before and after), maybe because of Daniel's motorcycle accident right about when the record was getting done. 'Dub' implies bass, and these tracks have it, layers of it rendered in surgical detail.<br /><br />Lanois can really bring the sonics. I've never heard anything more thrilling on my car stereo. Sounds like it was mixed right on the dashboard of my Accord. Rupert Neve smiles.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Another one of my all time favorite groups.  I really enjoyed this CD. I wish ther could have put a couple of other slow songs on this CD.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this well-written book.  While there are a number of books on the subject of near death experience (NDE), this one has more credibility, being from a physician and scientist in the field of brain science.  He explores many hypotheses that could explain away his experience, and systematically rejects each.  However, I am still left wondering, since he rejects most of these because his cerebral cortex was not functioning while in the coma when he had the NDE -- however, his cortex was obviously not damaged (and could have been functioning) since he fully recovered when he came out of the coma.

B000ID37RM|5.0|A great reminder how our morals can get lost as adults when we chose not to think about our actions, and take responsibility for what we say and do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool.very cool. My niece and I love this game. It gives us a way to interact between the rare times we get to see each other.
B006IYG5HE|2.0|first book i have read by him; it was very confusing at times as he moved from the 1940'2 to 1990's  & from character to character very quickly; i have downloaded snowman & will try that one; a friend, who recommended this one, says snowman was better; he compared these books to the girl with dragon tattoo series, no way, not even close in my opinion
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great game for my kids....they seem yo play it everyday like it's an actually horse...I guess it's the closest they'll ever f2f to their own horse
0805047905|5.0|I work with ESOL children than come from all over the world and with different English levels so I am always looking for books that will be helpful to learn new vocabulary. This book makes a fantastic job in that by giving the reader clues of what is going to happen in the next page and also by using repetitive text. This definitely has encouraged my students to repeat the words and make guesses of what is going to happen next, this is something really hard to do with not native speakers. I think this book is appropriate for age 3 and up since it is a book you can start reading it to children and with time they will be able to read it by them selves.
072325804X|4.0|Love the stories. More for myself. But it gave me lots of ideas to write children's play and perform for my baby. He loved it! The book itself is too heavy for carrying along. But with a good book stand, you can manage reading to and holding your baby at the same time.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|The plot, as may be indicated by the title, is slightly twisted, and requires the willful suspension of disbelief.  This is, I am afraid a requirement for most, if not all &#34;time travel&#34; movies.  I still have problems reconciling the role of the dog, which is shared by both protagonists, who live in different time zones.  If you can handle a convoluted plot line, then this may be the film for you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an awesome sequal to the Hunger Games with a lot of twists. It gets you wanting to turn the page
B004SIP98S|4.0|This one is thoughtful, and well-acted.  The scope was narrowly focused, which may be a requirement in a moveie fo this sort.  Nonetheless, it provides great insight into the events concerned and is a must see for any fan of the Monarchy.
1439190275|4.0|More tips in this book than the old one. Would recommend to anyone on atkins diet. Jump in and lose weight.
0062082353|3.0|This is a good, but not great read.  The portion on Kyle's training was excellent, but I found the actual sniping section to be lacking in detail.  This having been said, I sadly note that the author Mr. Kyle has been shot and killed when he was supposedly &#34;safe&#34; and back in the USA.  It was certainly a dark day for America. Go with God, Chris Kyle, and thank you for your service.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This one is better than the first one because it's a lot more fun, it's a little more challenging and there's a lot more cooler obstacles
B004EPYZUS|4.0|TC has been at the helm of the Mission Impossible series of films for quite a while now, and while he tries hard to keep the intensity going, it appears at times that he is literally going through the motions on (sorry!) cruise control.  It may be time for this franchise to find a new leading man.<br /><br />This is likely not his fault, but our own, as audiences now seem to demand violent action in movies, rather than the tension and drama of the IMF pulling off a mission through stealthy cunning and turning the bad guys behavior (greed, for example) against himself.  This, if done right would be much more riveting to watch.  Let's skip the enhanced bombs and guns scenes, and get back to acting!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Great fun breeding rare dragons. My brother and I can actually talk about this without fighting. Great fun!y personal favorite dragon is the sonic dragon! Its so cute!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Ever since my first spin of The Chainheart Machine back in 2000, I've been a die-hard Soilwork fan.  While they've never quite matched up to said disc (as it is still my all-time favorite metal album), they have come close a few times.  After a string of albums that I did enjoy but felt there was 'something' missing (Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama, and Sworn to a Great Divide), I felt that The Panic Broadcast was the beginning of a second coming for Soilwork.  While the direction of The Chainheart Machine was undoubtably left in the dust, TPB seemed like they were truly meshing their sound to fans of their older material as well as their newer ones.  Then it was announced that Peter Wichers was AGAIN leaving the band.  Low and behold, their next announcement was that they would be recording a new disc, make that a new double-disc.  It was a bit of a bold statement, since there certainly aren't many bands that would release 2 discs worth of material at once and even far fewer that were truly successful with it.  The metal format really feeds off adrenaline, and while I know there are a number of exceptions, most bands just aren't as successful with a album time past 45-50 minutes.  Turns out, Soilwork knew they were capable of not only pulling this off, but really releasing something special, as The Living Infinite is by far their most accomplished release in over a decade.<br /><br />Soilwork are successful here not only at producing two exceptionally well written discs, but even as one long 85 minute album that holds up extraordinarily well digesting in one listen.  The biggest strength of this release is the sheer variety that Soilwork has offered up.  If you are an older fan like myself, you'll undoubtably be drawn to some of the faster material that is spread throughout (\\"Spectrum of Eternity\\", \\"Tongue\\", \\"Let the First Wave Rise\\", \\"Leech\\") because some of it, to be quite frank, is the most spectacular the band has penned.  \\"Spectrum of Eternity\\" is easily their most epic song and they were wise to release this one first to the public to generate interest for the album.  I feel \\"Leech\\" earns some points in this front too as it truly feels as if the band decided to write a song that pulled back all that relentless aggression from The Chainheart Machine (that blastbeat-laden bridge is spine-tingling good) and combines it with some of the beauty of their later releases to impressive results.  But we all know that you can't have an 85 minute blast fest and keep things interesting.  \\"This Momentary Bliss\\" is the most cheery and dance-inducing Soilwork song since A Predator's Portrait's \\"Needlefeast\\".  The first single \\"Rise Above the Sentiment\\" is just an instant classic Soilwork song with one of the strongest choruses on the double-disc.  Closer \\"Owls Predict, Oracles Stand Guard\\" brings a certain heaviness to it that Soilwork hasn't explored before, while \\"Antidotes in Passing\\"  experiments in the opposite direction, focusing on a lighter atmosphere with clean vocals and sounding like something non unlike Opeth or Katatonia's more recent output.<br /><br />Despite losing Peter Wichers once more, the current line-up of Soilwork feels their strongest and most cohesive in years.  Sylvain Coudret (ex-Scarve) proved an invaluable addition to the band after the release of The Panic Broadcast and the new addition of on-again, off-again touring guitarist David Andersson (The Night Flight Orchestra) seemed a logical choice to solidify the guitar line-up.  I know it's hard and a bit difficult to say, but Andersson and Coudret will honestly make you say \\"Peter who?\\" by the end of the disc.  Their harmonies are inspired and feel as if they were feeding off of eachother's energy while recording.  Plus, there is the main riff of the aptly-named \\"This Momentary Bliss\\", which is simply heavenly.  One of the most interesting things about the guitarwork on this release is the amount of layering and subtle complexity.  I frequently findmyself saying \\"I didn't hear that last time\\", particularly in the choruses, which are traditionally the weak spot guitar-wise in the later Soilwork albums.  Listen closely to \\"Realm of the Wasted\\" and \\"Whispers and Lights\\" and you'll see what I'm getting at.  And while there are not a ton of really shredding solos, they are quite tastefully done and for the most part, leagues above the soloing on the past few discs (\\"Long Live the Misanthrope\\" for example).  Drummer Dirk Verbeuren has become more of an asset with each release, finally coming into his own on The Panic Broadcast and goes even further here.  The man is simply a beast behind the kit, going from relentless blast beats to some background fills, and everything in-between.  Keyboardist Sven Karlsson sees a bit more time in the spotlight on this release as well, with some more weight added to his presence in songs like \\"Antidotes in Passing\\" and the two \\"Living Infinite\\" songs.  Bassist Ola Flink is still a big piece of the heart of the band but it's really Speed's chance to carry the torch this time around.  He shows he is more willing to experiment with his vocals, like the afore-mentioned \\"Antidotes in Passing\\"  and \\"Whispers and Lights\\" but also with some of the heavier, growling parts as well (the growled chorus of \\"The Living Infinite I\\" rules!).  His growls and cleans feel hungry again and full of passion, as if he was out to prove his name belongs on the top of the metal vocalists list.<br /><br />Despite lofty expectations, Soilwork have managed to exceed them and put out a double-disc of tunes that should drown out the naysayers that thought the band dead after Wichers second departure.  They feel fresh and rejuvenated, with the hunger of a much younger band, and have once again proven why they are the kings of the melodic death metal genre.  I feel confident in saying that this is honestly their best piece of work since The Chainheart Machine and as a fan, I have a real sense of pride with what the band has done here with the double-disc format.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!! U know u should make a subway serfers 2 with all new characters and opsicle courses!!! And if u did do my idea I would play this game every day!!!!!
B00871C09S|5.0|If you have voyeur or exhibitionist tendencies, this film is exciting. I remember staying in hotels in Manhattan before taking a ship or a plane to Europe. From my hotel window I could see naked people in other hotels or apartments. Some of them were probably exhibitionists, but others were living in rooms that had no air conditioning and were just trying to avoid the heat.<br />This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies: James Stewart and Grace Kelley were terrific.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper may have been marketed as a fun pop-corn flick but it's far from it. This movie is far deeper than the marketing would have you believe and frankly it should have been nominated for a best picture. Time travel is the &#34;branding&#34; of the movie but it's not important to the story. In fact the characters go as far as to tell you not to think about it and you take heed of their warning. The less you know about the plot the better, just watch and let the movie happen. Looper is mythology in it's true form and executed with outstanding performances and cinematography. I give it five stars because to me it is one of the most impactful movies I have ever seen but it is far from a movie that everyone can watch. This film is violent in a very real and human way, not a mindless action movie way. The violence isn't glorified or gratuitous, it is merely necessary for the story. And what a brilliant story it is.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|I watched North by Northwest years ago and remembered it as an action movie with Cary Grant being shot at by a crop duster and climbing Washington, Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt on Mount Rushmore. What I had forgotten was the witty dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie (she is no) Saint. This is a fine movie,with something interesting for everybody, man or woman, one of Hitch's best.
0131480057|5.0|Great book for someone like me who used Linux several years ago and is diving back in. The book is well laid out and makes it easy to go in-depth on a topic or just quickly find a needed fact.
B00BESCJII|5.0|It's so good to see a high quality movie for a change, instead of the usual deluge of Hollywood blockbusters. Great writing and a terrific cast. Loved it!
B00B2QA9TI|5.0|The brilliant use of choreography, setting, and cinematography in this telling of Tolstoy's gripping tale of love, hope, desperation, and loss is both a beautiful and haunting presentation of the deeply personal and gut-wrenching human condition juxtaposed with the superficial facade of any society.  Those who connect with the former will be moved.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I don't think I have seen it in a few years. Glad I found it on amazon prime to watch.

0307454894|5.0|A calm, cerebral meditation of the heart, guilt, love, and atonement. German guilt over WWII interlaced with teenage love and regret. Though brief and succinct, the writing is deeply evocative and asks the reader to often savor the sharp emotion of a life's defining moments. There are symbols, and half truths, and a narrator whose own voice is uncertain and vague, but such obfuscation only heightens the gray horizon of morality with no clear break between the morally praiseworthy and reprehensible.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading and comparing books to their movie/TV adaptations, then this is a double treat, for it was made into a remarkable film that captures much of the character and pain of the novel.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Whenever I need a good laugh at Christmas I watch this movie.<br />\It is truly one of the best comic holiday movies of all time.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I don't understand why this is best picture, it is just ok. I was expecting fabulous considering the award, but it was just predictable and ordinary, IMHO
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a fun game, though not especially difficult or challenging. The pop-ups are annoying, and the game is a bit repetitive...and it could get very expensive. Beware if you have kids playing this game!

B001LYD2JU|5.0|This is the first release by Michael Schenker's group called MSG, or the Michael Schenker group, for those who arent aware of who michael Schenker is, he was hired to play guitar in U.F.O before they were really well known he was playing guitar in the Scorpions with his older brother Rudolph Schenker, this disc is a look into the amazing guitar prowess of the one and only Michael Schenker also known as the Blonde Bomber! there is really nothing to dislike about this disc so I wont waste your's or my time going into it, the golden pipes of one Gary Barden are also on display here, this is just the beginning of the MSG phenomenom and the catalog of MSG which in 2011 celebrated their 30th anniversary, this is just the 1st chapter in the long career span of Michael Schenker!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I’m a Jimmy Hendrix fan from way back, allow me to tell you. Sure, to be perfectly intellectually honest, he’s hardly as talented and flexible as his niece, Jennie Hendrix, but he’s always been a really great studio musician. For that, I have oodles and oodles of respect for this brotha. Uh! I’m really somewhat excited that Jimmy came out of retirement for this CD, seeing as his last foray into music was in the late 1990s when he wrote the theme song for Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Voodoo Child, when he was still wrestling in WCW (World Chumpionship Wrassling).<br /><br />The best part about Jimmy has always been his guitar-virtuoso style, which is why it’s been really fun and radical to play some of his songs on Guitar Hero. I just love button-pressing (read: mashing) until my fingers bleed, pressing X, Y and, yes, sometimes even P as I’m playing along to Hey, Jo. Allow me to tell you: I seriously doubt that there’s ever been a better studio guitarist in the last 25 odd years, except for maybe Demi Lovato’s highly talented studio musician guitarist!<br /><br />In the press, there’s been a lot of coverage recently about whether this is the right time for Jimmy to actually come out of retirement and all, what with the Obama economy being very bad and with Social Security and Medicare both going insolvent under Obama. Well, allow me to tell you that I think the time is NOW for Jimmy to come out of retirement. He sure as h-e double hockey sticks still has the guitar-twanging ability to pluck his way with the best of them like Tiny Tim, the lead guitarist from Saliva and even local transients who perform for nickels in subway stations!<br /><br />Get Jimmy’s comeback CD, folks. I promise that you won’t regret it as much as you will Obamacare’s unconstitutional mandate.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Once again he 's distracted me from doing my daily chores. Hard to put the book down Just love Theodore!
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux is a national French treasure who should be treated like the greatest jazz singer in history that she is. Since her famous immigration into the U.S. some several years ago, this frog leg-eating songstress has time and time again proven that she is the real deal in terms of jazz music. In fact, she single-handedly invented the whole genre of jazz, and any singers who came before her are just posers, baby. The Blue Room will educate all of us as to why!<br /><br />It’s clear that this middle-aged songstress deserves all of our respects because she’s greater than Billie Holiday, greater than Ellen Fitzgerald and most certainly greater than Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway and Bing Crosby put together! We should all be so lucky to hear this demi-goddess of jazz awesomeness serenading us with her warble-like voice, for just $5.99 on Amazon! Whoppee!<br /><br />Maddy has long been credited with innovating the jazz genre with her inventive voice that uses a lot of unique-sounding treble, bass and falsetto ranges. For instance, check out what this princess does on Buh Bye Love: She actually warbles like she’s underwater, which creates an insanely cool-sounding vocal delivery. Amazing! I bet Billie Holiday is turning over in her grave right now, jealous at her failure to come up with that vocal style! Or how about Maddy’s awesome vocal stylings on Born To Lose: She actually begins to ululate like they do in various Arab countries, which creates a really fanatical-sounding song experience. I like it!!<br /><br />Sure, Maddy’s nowhere near as great as Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Hillary Duff or Ashley Simpson (the best of all), but she’s still full of trying her hardest, which I really appreciate as someone who looks to the inside of people. Please, I urge you with urgency to go out and buy this CD from Amazon right now, even if you have to pawn some of your Obama food stamps to do this in this recession economy of Democrat mismanagement.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The characters are a amazing. The graphics are amazing. The best super hero movie to date.  The only way you will be disappointed is if don't like action and laughing.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz Scaggs is what we in the music business love to call a soldier. He’s been around for almost forever, had a couple of hits with the Glenn Miller Band in the 60s, and then finally branched out in the 70s with a semi-successful solo career. In short, he’s the epitome of what it means to have a very long music career. As such, I can only say that he’s almost, but not quite, on the same level as the really talented musician who wrote the theme song for Sheamus.<br /><br />On Memphis, it’s obvious to see, even to the most obtuse person, that Scaggs is returning to his roots, the roots of being a highly successful one-hit wonder who serves as a footnote in the history of folk rock music. Just listen to almighty tracks such as Sunny Gone and Dry Spell. It’s like Scaggs is literally…literally hooking up with the studio musicians from Toto all over again and reinventing the wheel, the musical wheel that is. He seems to also be channeling the ghost of Elvis Presley on songs like Gone Baby Gone and So Good To Be Here. Darn it! Is there really anything that Scaggs can’t do? I think not!!<br /><br />Folks, please go out and buy this CD from Amazon right now. I know that it seems like the music world is being overrun by no-talent and overly hyped flash-in-the-pan artists like Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, but if you just have faith, Scaggs will help to save music. So hang on to your Obama money (I know I will), and buy this CD now!
B0094K1QR8|3.0|Probably not the best flick I have seen. A bit pridictable and I figures out the ending before the flick ended. Definitely not one of Kutcher's best but what has he done that has been any good. He is really not that funny just watch  Two & 1/2 men.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|When I began this book, I had my doubts about Ready Player One. It seemed like the author was biting off more than he could chew. But page after page, I was won over until the disappointment that I had reached the final page.<br /><br />Great story, completely satisfying and perfect ending. Not only does this book take a good long look at geek culture, but the underlying, never quite spoken, but always obviously present political message fit perfectly into the story. It was never forced.<br /><br />Highly recommended. 5 stars!
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Daniel Craig has to be the worst Bond in the series of James Bond. How do the ads get away with proclaiming this is the best Bond movie? Honestly it was a bit boring yeah there was some action and typical Bond gadgits but this flick was a snoozer. Bring back Bronson he could act.

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Why shock and insult moviegoers with disgusting vulgar sex, nudity, profanity and senseless gore and violence? Don't understand why Denzel Washington, who claims to be a Christian, would agree to star in this type of movie!  Read the synopsis and if that doesn't shock you nothing will. Moviegoers who can endure this type of movie have been desensitized to the point of not being shocked by anything. It is shocking to me that Hollywood has gone this far.  John Wayne and some of the other great actors did not need this sort of performance to bring in viewers!
