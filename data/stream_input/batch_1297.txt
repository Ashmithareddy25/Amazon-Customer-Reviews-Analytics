B0044XV3QY|5.0|I just watched the extended edition for the first time, and highly recommend it to folks who want a little bit more plot for this film (vesus the theatrical release).    I won't add much on the details, as they have been very well covered by other reviewers.  Rather, let me say that this film is in the top tier of my favorites. Why?  Well, it sure isn't for the dialogue (as others have noted).  I typically like Woody Allen films and the like, film adaptations of Shakespeare, and other films with intricate plots and well-crafted dialogue, such as finely crafted adaptations of historical novels, BBC dramas, or made-for-film historical dramas.  In other words, I usually like well-written films.    But, I also like well-done science fiction and fantasy.  And, I am a forest ecologist, and was a \\"combat biologist\\" in the logging wars of coastal Alaska from the late 1980's to around 2000.  So, this film appeals to me in two different ways.  First, it is a wonderful imagining of an ecosystem on an alien world.  It has been done in literature a number of times, perhaps most exquisitely in the Dune series, but rarely in film.  Second, it shows hope for the survival of the natural world against the money-driven forces that are working their will on our very own planet.  I get the same feeling from watching Erin Brokovich and other great envionmentally-themed films.  This one just happens to take place on the \\"Earth First! We'll Log the Other Planets Later\\" (a sticker that was on the door of one of Alaska's more Neanderthal legislators a while back) location.  Two thumbs up!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm so happy,finally there is someone who can sing.And write pretty songs to!Recently we have mostly garbage,I don't even know how to call today's music-is it music at all? In all that there is one girl who can write and perform.Very professional  DM
B00275EHJG|4.0|The movie was different from previous Toy Story movies but it was still very good. I did not like Alonzo the bear. He was very dark but he got what he deserved in the end. Overall, recommend! Barbie and Ken were one of my favorite characters from a comedy aspect.
B005HSL626|5.0|Wow! I never thought that I would get an app like this one. Basically thevpoint is to, well, cut fruit. There is really no particular way that you have to cut the fruit, so it's pretty easy: Cut the fruit, avoid the bombs. So fun! And free, too!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I do not want to expand on what the rest of the viewers have aptly described this film as, which is awesome.<br /><br />I had to bite my lip to stop myself from crying in the last scene, but i cried anyways and i tend to tease my wife when she cries at the movies. I just had to call up my brother after that and talk to him. I still choke up when i think about that scene.<br /><br />This is going to be a keeper in my collection. Brilliant performances all around, especially by Nick and Tom.
B005KDWUFA|3.0|I purchased every CD recorded by Il Divo thus far, and have been more than satisfied each time.  However, the repertoire on their most recent CD, \\"Wicked Games\\" lacks some originality and/or variety.  These vocally-talented men have indeed honed a trademark that's identifiably theirs; but, \\"Wicked Games\\" does not adequately showcase that unique sound that has given \\"Il Divo\\" their panache.
B001HN6922|5.0|Pixar never fails their audience! This is a great movie and just as funny as the first. Highly recommended! The characters are very funny.
B000KIPT30|3.0|I've been using this for many months now, it works great, it amplifies without noticable distortion, it's well built and I will buy another one without hesitation.
0440224764|5.0|Wow - I happened to pick up this book one day from the 'Leave One-Take One' bookshelf at work.  In only 5 short pages, I was hooked.  This was a masterpiece.  So detail-oriented.  Vivid characters.  No way to know what is going to happen next - you think you know, but you read and learn you were no where close.<br /><br />Great read - til the last page.  I was not at all pleased with the ending.  I would have to opt for the alternate ending if this book were to ever be made into a movie.<br /><br />Try it, you will definitely like it!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I bought this after I got the xbox 360  4G with Kinect...It was obvious that we didn't have the required space needed, to play with only a 3' by 5' area. I'm 5'2\\" & my fiance is 6'2\\" so we put this on top of our 71\\" Mitsubishi, and with the zoom we are both seen to the floor and can play everything we have that is Kinect so far. Be careful when you put this on, or you will scratch the inside of the lens.(we saw a friend do that with it, so my fiance finessed it on gently, and no scratches.... If you have limited room to play, this is a must have. I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about, but if I find anything, I'll report back with a follow up. Enjoy. I must state this is way different then the PS3 move controller, and  my fiance loves the gun (sharpshooter) games with that, however this is a freak fun experience. I had the neighbors kids over to play Disneyland, they couldn't get enough...
B001UV4XFG|4.0|The third movie in the Twilight series is a must have for any Twilight fan. It is not as good as the book of course, but it is still very good!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love the show.. So thought i would buy it for a friend as a Christmas present.. They LOVED it.. They recieved all four seasons.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoyed playing this. Oddly, it seems that game engine deals more difficult hands on Aneroid than I encountered on the ipad.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Still missing indented and collapsible tasks. Can't drag and drop tasks to reorder them either. Adding those would make this a true tasks app!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I am very inpressed with my purches of x41 headphones, they are realy inpressive and live up to there expectation.  The exceptional sound they bring to your ears is fantastic so real, it realy bring great gamming to live.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good but some things can get costly an it takes too much time to earn money so I'm stuck playing the same games a billion times.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this game for my son for Christmas. He loves building various levels for the angry birds to destroy. He enjoys it very much!
0547424779|5.0|First and foremost Lois Lowry's the Giver is a great book filled with such fantastic fantasy that slowly begins to be unveiled.  A little tid bit is released for the reader to knaw on at great length, and before you know it you can really start to reflect on the whole picture and spend a great deal of time just doing that.  i think it is the perfect book for kids to reflect on their own ideas of a utopian society, which also asks children to critically think way beyond the comprehension of Lowry's text.  I can't say enough about the richness of the text.  As an artist and one who appreciates all facets of the Humanities, I couldn't stop thinking about Lowry's created world.  With regards to the Illustrations, I was reluctant to pick up this book because the pictures in my mind were so very clearly illustrated and I didn't want them compromised by some other depiction.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not overly illustrate.  The illustrations were fantastic.  One of my favorite fellow teachers suggested I read this book, and I thought it's a kids book how good could it possibly be.  This book floored me and started my quest to read more Newbery Award Winning Books, and I have to say that I love a good 70% of the recognized Newbery Award and Honor Books.  After reading a hundred or so of these types of books, The Giver always remains in the top 5 of all time for me.  That's including BIG BOY books as well.
0446547603|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks. Yes, the stories are cheesy and unrealistic, but... well, there is no real but, I just love them - the romance, the heartbreak, everything. Every once in a while, I need to read a cheesy love story, and Nicholas Sparks' books are perfect for that. And Safe Haven is no exception.   The characters in Safe Haven are great. Characters in adult books are generally harder for me to relate to than YA characters, just because YA is a lot closer to my own life. But even though Katie and Alex are twice as old as me, I had no trouble connecting to them. Alex is such a good guy, and I felt his grief. The way he takes care of his kids is so sweet, and the family's loss made me cry several times. Katie's a great character, too - I don't want to say too much about her in order not to spoil her secret, but she's been through a lot. Her fears are understandable, and you can't help but feel for her.   I don't know what to say about the relationship between Katie and Alex. Technically, it's too insta-love-y (there should be an actual word for that, by the way) - the attraction in the beginning is too obvious and unrealistic, and they develop too extreme emotions too quickly. But really, I didn't care - they're so cute together! It's like that in almost all of Nicholas Sparks' novels - the MCs develop unrealistically deep emotions for one another in too short a time - but I never seem to mind. The relationships are cheesy, but really, that's just the way his books are. You always know you're in for a good but cheesy romance when you open a Nicholas Sparks book.   One thing I always love about Nicholas Sparks' books is the small-town life. The books almost always take place in some small town on the coast of North Carolina, and the atmospheres are always so peaceful. His books always make me want to move to a small town near the beach.   The suspense in Safe Haven is really well-done. I don't want to say too much about Katie's \\"secret that still haunts and terrifies her\\" in order not to spoil it for anyone, but it really is terrifying at times. The suspense and danger of that storyline keep you flipping the pages, and the romance and suspense blend together really well. Still, I would have liked a stronger message concerning Katie's issue - I think, because of Alex's background, he could have easily given the reader some more information on how to handle something like that.   Safe Haven is a classic Nicholas Sparks book - a good but clichéd love story with some suspense thrown in there. No, they're not the most intellectually challenging books out there, but what girl doesn't want to read a cheesy love story every once in a while? Safe Haven isn't my favorite Nicholas Sparks book, but it's an enjoyable read.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I recemend it highly you should get. best app for kindle fire I mean atleast its a dollar and not five like it was a while ago
B00457WZEI|4.0|I read this on a Kindle Book. It was amazing!!! I loved it. After I read it, I saw the movie. I want to note that the story isn't really fast pasted, you just have to get through a small portion of it. Its slow but eventually picks up.
B00015YVDG|1.0|I never received this from importcds.  It was ordered in November and it is now January.  After 3 emails to import cds, and after getting no response, I recommend you do NOT use this seller.
0061765236|2.0|I believe I read Jodi Piccoult's best book first and that was My Sister's Keeper.  The Pact was very disappointing.  The book tells us that the girl was depressed and possibly abused.  The mother finds and burns the girl's diary yet they never reveal to the reader what was in the diary or what was tormenting the girl.  I was very disappointed that more was not revealed about the reason why the girl was so depressed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good selection of games for a free app. plenty of variety too keep me busy when bored on the go.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|We love the Fast Five series and glad we could complete our collection thanks to Amazon.com!!  The quality is great!
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|I agree with the other reviewers who say this film is primarily a feel-good white liberal take on racial segregation, the worn-out formula of painting all whites with traditional values as slave-owning racists who deserve whatever they get, long-suffering blacks who can do no wrong, and the one \\"good\\" white person who saves the blacks from the other, evil whites.  Hollywood has been making variations of the same tired movie for half a century now.  It's the classical neo-liberal trade-off -- you want to simultaneously vilify whites as a race and get whites to buy tickets, so you show one of them championing the Hollywood version of the black cause.  It's both insulting to whites, the vast majority of whom have nothing to answer for, and insulting to blacks, because it paints them as being unable to succeed without liberal whites to save them.    As with most made-for-Oscars liberal agit-prop pieces, the acting is quite good and the fit-and-finish are above reproach.  Hollywood's alien elite typically pulls out all the stops for these template movies, and this is no exception.  Leukophobes and self-styled liberal saviors of black America will love it.  Proud blacks will resent it, and proud whites should call it out for being the white-bashing, vapid trash that it is.
B004EPYZSU|2.0|Rented it from a Red-Box. Paid way too much, when we saw the trailer in the theater our response was \\"Red Box\\" This wasn't even worthy of a Red-Box rental.  They story was very weak, the effects marginal, and the ending all too predictable.  Don't waste your time.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I got this for my sister for Christmas and she loved it. Fast shipping, great condition, and great price! Defenatly recommend this product.
B004ZJADOU|4.0|I hadn't owned any of these recordings, so this set came as a pleasant surprise, and a good bargain as well. The Beethoven concertos are played in a \\"classical\\" style somewhat similar to Perahia's recordings. Beautiful, but if you want a higher intensity \\"romantic\\" interpretation, look elsewhere, Pletnev or Kempf, for example. I enjoyed the Grieg and Schumann, the quintets and the Mozart. I felt that the Brahms was rather ordinary; there are plenty of more exciting recordings of that one. The sound quality, even on the analog recordings, is excellent.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|This cover is fine , but not exactly what I expected. But will do the job, could wish it was a better prop
B000V7J82S|5.0|The product arrived on time. The packaging was flawless. The vinyl was brand new. Happy with the product. I will definitely order more vinyls from amazon.com.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell reflect is a calm puzzle with beautiful music. It's a great way to get your mind off stressful things for a little while.
B005DOL0R0|2.0|My Fire dropped right out of the sleeve when I unzipped it. Luckily,it fell a short distance onto a thick carpet so no damage happened. But I can easily see how a Fire can drop onto a hard surface and break if you use this sleeve. I recommend purchasing a Marware case that has clips to keep the Fire from falling out. I retured this zip sleeve and purchased the Marware case. The Marware case is worlds better for not too much more money.
1613821395|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it could have been about 200-300 pages shorter and still told a captivating story.  I was tempted to give up when I saw how slowly the plot was unfolding, but I'm glad I kept going because it really is an interesting book with many finely interwoven plot lines.  The characters were detailed so well that I felt I actually knew them.  As other reviewers have mentioned, Laura is a bit weak.  It's a little hard to reconcile how agonizingly hard Marian and Walter work on Laura's behalf when most of the time Laura seems to be sobbing, near-fainting, clutching Marian's hands, etc...  To be fair, there are key instances in the plot when Laura does show some backbone.  But I suppose such is the nature of love.  Marian and Walter truly love Laura and will do anything to help her.  The plot keeps you guessing until the very end, so hang in there!  It will take awhile but definitely a worth-while read.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its a great game. perfect app. i love having it on my tablet. i play chess all the time now
0307949486|3.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was an adequate read that does have some finely crafted characters and a plot interesting enough to satisfy most readers. The characters were finely crafted and seemed realistic enough for a crime drama of this type. I have a gut feeling that many of the nuances of the Swedish language were lost in the translation and caused the writing to be overly cliched. With that noted it would have been wonderful to have and appendix to explain some of the cultural aspects that foreign readers may have missed. (Defining \\"gaol, and a greater description of proper places).<br /> A serious issue with the book is how the intimate scenes between the characters seem to peter-out at the last moment. Many times in the books chapters seem to end with \\"and then they had sex\\" which made the entire sexual situation seem unrealistic and forced.  It would have improved the book immensely if he had chosen to go in one direction or another instead of the watered down promiscuity hinted at the novel. That said it is adequate for a luxury read it will not be adding any literary value to anyone's book shelf but should provide several hours of entertainment.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is always an extremely fun game. It works great on the fire and if you don't want ads, turn off wi-fi. Perfect.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|1) Plug AV adapter into iPhone 4s<br />2) Plug HDMI cable into adapter and HD LCD television<br />3) See the iPhone screen perfectly mirrored on the television for all screens and applications, what you see on your phone is what you see on the screen. No jailbreaking or anything else is needed. View your photos and videos as you would normally, no need to use slideshow mode unless you want to.<br />4) Rent or purchase HD movies from itunes and watch beautifully rendered HD movies on your television.<br /><br />It really is that simple. The video quality is outstanding. Having access to an enormous library of content from iTunes for immediate rental is very convenient.  The adapter also has a USB port to plug in the recharging cable while you're using it to keep your battery recharged.  I used mine without recharging while viewing a movie and it ran the battery down about 15%/hour.  Great item and worth every penny.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a great app I do admit. it has pros and cons. the pros are that its an addictive. game,  the cons are that you have you buy new games
B001HN690O|4.0|Movie is good. My son, three years old, enjoys it. Good for adults too. Heartfelt, moral story which leads opening for third movie. Worth your time and money.
B00005JKC3|5.0|FAR FAR SUPERIOR TO THE 2008 INCREDIBLE HULK VERSION WHICH WAS STUPID TO MAKE AFTER THIS EXCELLENT MOVIE. sign HULK FAN
B006FTCH2E|3.0|A young woman inadvertently causes two deaths and an injury, ends up in jail, gets out and tries to pick up the pieces of her life.  At the same time, researchers discover a duplicate of Earth and offer a trip to the one who writes the best essay.  The young woman wins...but will she go?  Does she?  Things become ambiguous later in this introspective film, which is not science fiction but more philosophical and existential.
B00026WUBE|5.0|\\"Planet Waves\\" was Dylan's first (and, as it turned out, only) album on Asylum Records, and more significantly his first collaboration with The Band since \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" Though not quite as groundbreaking as that 1966 masterpiece, \\"Planet Waves\\" shows that the eight year layoff between the two artists' collaborations did not result in any lost magic between them, as \\"Planet Waves\\" is a solid, cohesive record with several excellent songs.<br /><br />\\"Planet Waves\\" is also significant for another, more personal reason: it's the first record to hint at the growing turmoil in Dylan's marriage to Sara Lowndes. It's certainly not as bleak as \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" but it's not as rosy as \\"New Morning,\\" either. Songs like the sensual \\"Hazel,\\" the nostalgic \\"Something There Is About You,\\" and the buoyant \\"You Angel You\\" carry a romantic air on the surface, but a deeper listen reveals a more dramatic edge. He sings these type of songs with less assurance than he did three years ago. There's a desperation to his vocals, as  if he's trying to convince her (and perhaps himself) that things are still good between them. This edge becomes more apparent on the last two tracks, \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Wedding Song,\\" where he is practically pleading for her not to leave him.<br /><br />The album has some darker songs as well that bring the underlying pain a bit more to the surface, such as \\"Going Going Gone,\\" a sort of suicide note for the relationship itself, and the stark, piercing \\"Dirge.\\" The latter is a precursor to the blunt, unlfinching anger Dylan would later unleash a year later on \\"Idiot Wind.\\"<br /><br />Other tracks include the toe tapping opener \\"On a Night Like This,\\" the punch in the gut rocker \\"Tough Mama,\\" (one of Dylan's wildest and most fun recordings), and the classic \\"Forever Young,\\" a beautiful tribute to the joys of remaining young at heart. Having two versions on the same record, however, is a bit overkill, as the second version is pretty awful and lacks the sincerity of the slower, more famous version.<br /><br />\\"Planet Waves\\" marks a transitional phase in Dylan's career, setting the stage for the so called 'divorce albums' and the Rolling Thunder Revue. Both Dylan and The Band are at the top of their game and in charge of their craft, and the lovely remaster presents the album with the power with which it's meant to be heard.the sincerity of the slower, more famous version.<br /><br />\\"Planet Waves\\" marks a transitional phase in Dylan's career, setting the stage for the so called 'divorce albums' and the Rolling Thunder Revue.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|This app was really lame. Its the ONLY app I've ever downloaded that didn't run smoothly on my phone and the games were like they were made by a 3rd grader. When I sent an error report bc it kept messing up n mentioned I wouldnt rate the app well until issues were better, the app somehow disappeared from my phone later that day. Idk how they could do that but it happened and was Extremely odd n seemingly very shady...
B001DHXT20|1.0|Why try to improve what already was excellent? The 2003 Bana Hulk was EXCELLENT, this (Norton Hulk)version was like a discredit of that movie. I hope it doesn't prevent an Hulk 2 of the 2003 Hulk! that one ended with a possible sequel(hopefully). This Norton Hulk trash may cause pause.
B005WFWVL4|4.0|This movie does a good job of showing how easily horrible diseases can be transmitted and go global in a matter of a few weeks.  There is a good cast and a decent story that moves along smoothly and quickly.  It is not the greatest disaster movie but entertaining enough.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app. it is super fun but a little cheesy. I am glad I got it anyway. works well on the fire.
1439183392|5.0|I've now read Dawn Patrol, Frankie Machine, Bobby Z, Power of the Dog, and Gentleman's Hour. This one might be the best. I love the dry wit and humor. Not only great characters and an engrossing plot, but also intriguing questions of the human condition and friendships and the loss of innocence. Sometimes you just can't hide from the painful storm of reality. It was a bit of a relief after the intense Power of the Dog. I rushed through it and was sad when it was over.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|A must have! Just downloaded this on to my kindle fire and I'm already addicted!!! I was looking for something similar to instagram and this will suffice :)

B00632HWOG|2.0|There are two issues that need to be fixed for this to be a decent mail app:<br /><br />1. Delete multiple emails at once from the Inbox<br />  There is no way to check off multiple emails from the Inbox view and delete them. The closest you can get is to press and hold on an individual email, then delete it from the menu that shows up. This makes deleting multiple emails an unnecessarily slow process.<br /><br />2. Auto-refresh Inbox after deleting emails<br />  I don't mind only seeing 10 emails at once in the Inbox, but what is annoying is when I delete messages they leave empty spaces behind in the Inbox. To get older emails to take the spot of the newly deleted emails you have to refresh your Inbox. This should happen automatically after deleting emails.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading RAFA.  I have been watching him play matches for the past few years and have always been impressed with his mental fighter attitude on the court.  One thing  that was perplexing was how he could be so aggressive on court but so humble and almost shy off the court.  This book reveals the missing details behind his overall personality.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is extreamly verbose and the functionality has been greatly enhanced with the last update. I use it in various ways and it has been a truly enriching tool for my studies.  The multiple translations and languages add great value.  I would highly recommend this app for people of all levels - from those who would use it for devotionals, quick referencing, deep study or as an audio reader!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|good game but freezes my viewsonic tablet  after a couple of games the free version did not do this so don't get it
B00012QM8G|5.0|When I saw this in a theater I was so mesmerized that I felt that I no sooner sat down when it was over. I ordered the DVD when it first came out and have watched it a number of times. I feel everyone should see this true story.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|The app is a bit sluggish compared to gtask. The settings are very limited. however the biggest problem is the notes bug. if you have a note on one task, it will randomly show up on the correct task, or not, or multiple tasks in the summary screen. very annoying.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|I was really pleased that my copy of the album arrived a few days earlier than estimated. Thank you!<br /><br />Some of the songs on this album are a bit different, but not overtly so. It starts out with lighter songs, and then gets a lot darker and deeper. There isn't a song I don't like on this album, and honestly I'm having a hard time choosing a favorite song. I will say, I personally don't think it's as good as their last album, but I did just start listening to it today, so I may come to love it more in the coming weeks.<br /><br />Overall I think it would be a lovely addition to anyone's collection of Arctic Monkeys albums, whether large or small.

B00432QAKK|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30S20AQJ21PHR]]Hello, I just wanted to show people who saw Joseph Siegler's video review of the 2011 box set, what the difference between that one and this, the 2010 box set, was. The biggest one, obviously, is the disc spindles on the new one, whereas in the 2010 edition it comes in plastic trays. The old edition is more bulky and slightly heavier, but the discs don't come one on top of the other. And the 2010 box set doesn't come with an episode sheet like the new one. The discs have the exact same content. So it's up to you to decide which one you get. Amazon.com sells this box set at a higher price, while Amazon Canada sells both sets at roughly the same price.  Thanks for watching!
B005QBKXOQ|4.0|I like this music more with every listen.  I have always been a sucker for melody and this disc comes through.  This may be Daughtry's best work to-date.  Only time can judge that for sure, but it certainly rivals his first release and is much better than his sophomore effort.  The mystery remains how this artist did not win his American Idol season!

B00433FQKO|5.0|I saw this band totally by accident on TV. As soon as Glenn Hughes began to sing, my jaw literally dropped.  Wow!  I immediately ordered both of their CDs, both of which are outstanding, IMO.  Each member of the band is an amazing talent, & the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The music is heavy in a '70s sort of way -- driving, but not thrash -- & I can't say enough about the vocals.  Not only *would* I recommend these -- I already have!
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Very nice interface for google tasks.  Seems to support much of the same functions as gtasks, but in a very nicely-done interface.   The one thing I'm missing is some sort of color coding for my different lists.  But I didn't miss that at first because I was so impressed with the rest of the interface.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this &quot;right in the palm of your hands tool-till it is all written on the &quot;tablet of our heart&quot;-I'm grateful. for this tablet!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Works just as great as the desktop version, great refresh rate, and is perfect for your remote desktop needs. If you want a free, quality remote desktop app for android, look no further.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire.  Ads are very small in top right corner and do not affect game play.  I'm new to Angry Birds and totally addicted.  No level limit in sight. I've experienced NO freezes or hang ups after 4 days of almost non-stop play.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this on my phone and Kindle Fire.  It's ease of use and variety of versions is great.  The plans are helpful, too.  It would be nice to have the NRSV, however.
B000A0K2JO|1.0|When my original PS/2 keyboard died I replaced it with an USB keyboard. I had hoped to free up one of my limited USB ports with this adapter but it obviously is not intended for that purpose. I hate to rate it so low as it may be my ignorance of it's proper use but how else can I rate it. I would suggest you check with the supplier to make certain it will meet your needs before ordering.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've had some pretty annoying alarm clocks in my life, but this one is a winner!!! I started using it when my stock alarm stopped working. Stock works again, but ACX is much better, with many more features!!! Great useful app, thanx:-)   Dear amazon, it would be better if you kept up with the updates for this app!!!
030788743X|5.0|If there's any nerd in you then you'll love this book. It's the ultimate nerd fantasy where your ability to quote Monty Python or play PacMan determines the fate of the world.  And it's the perfect read for the Kindle Fire because you're going to be looking up YouTube clips of \\"Supaidaman\\" or \\"Joust\\" and Wikipedia articles on \\"Zork\\".  The most fun I've had with a novel in a long time!
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Programing obviously off &amp; put extra leap year day in Jan, not Feb. Checked  2013 - 2016 &amp; same behavior in 2016. All other months look ok, so at least for now, error is consistent &amp; can be fixed &quot;in time&quot;. Will change rating &quot;if&quot; this gets fixed.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I hate giving the author only one star but I want to warn others they will probably be better off skipping the third book. I wish I did.   Such a shame because the first two were so good.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Nice little alarm app. lets you use music (select specific songs,  random by artist, etc), ringtones, and more. Several snooze &amp; dismissal options. Just a great app overall.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app!!! very good graphics and easy to use. being able to play solitaire without having to tote around a deck of cards is convenient and fun.
0312641893|5.0|So funny story while I was reading this book.  I tried to describe it to my husband and his response was \\"that sounds really bad.\\"  Well clearly the moral of that story is that I don't know how to talk up a book, because this book is incredible.    What I liked about this book:  Pretty much everything.  I adored the nods to Cinderella without being a traditional retelling.  As a matter of fact sometimes you had to look hard to find the Cinderella references.  I love relationship between Cinder and the Prince, the anticipation of their relationship was built perfectly.  I fell right into the world that Meyer created, I sometimes became so immersed that when real life intruded it took me a second to refocus my brain.  Each character was so well thought out and described that I feel that almost any of them could carry a book on their own.  I don't know if I would want to read a book where the step/adoptive mother, the mean stepsister, or the EVIL queen was the main character just because all three were so unlikable, but they were so well written that they could.  I want an android like Iko.  Finally there was Cinder.  She is such a strong character.  She was dealt a pretty harsh hand and yet she remains completely likable, never felt sorry for herself, and always has a positive outlook on how she can change her future.  What I didn't like:  After I was finished reading Cinder I tried to think about what I didn't like about it, and I finally figured it out.  There was nothing that I didn't like about this one.  I was a fantastic read.  It was almost impossible to put down and kept me wide awake way past my bedtime two nights in a row. I was pretty useless at work with my Cinder hangover.    Bottom line:  If this is what we have to look forward to for YA in 2012 it's going to be a great year.  Other than Cinder being YA, everything else about it is out of my reading comfort zone.  If you look at the description and think to yourself \\"this is not for me\\", think again.  Amazing storytelling makes this one well worth your time.  I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good I should say. I played in a row straight for one hour. A good time killer. lots of games to choose from. you unlock more games as you progress achieving targets in existing games. In a nutshell, worth it. I gave it a try and so could you. well you won't regret.
0756686970|4.0|Got this book for a 7 year old. He enjoys it very much. Delivery time was exellant. He has another one of this type he enjoys.
B00338QENI|5.0|I selected this book for a book club and no one was disappointed!  It was a great blend of science and the history of many medicines we use today as well as an emotional story of a family who suffered so much pain and loss.  I wanted to know more about Henrietta Lacks and her family when the book ended.  I thought Rebecca Skloot did an amazing job painting the picture of a time not so long ago when medical terminology was a foreign language for most and HIPAA Practices didn't exist.  The book left me feeling equally sympathetic to the medical community and the Lacks Family.  Great job Skloot!
1400079276|4.0|So, if you've never read Murakami, you may enjoy this this more thoroughly than I did. I liked this one, don't get me wrong, but it just uses the same old tricks. Here's your handy-dandy Murakami checklist:   1. Multiple story lines, seemingly unrelated at first. Here you have three, one of which--the army reports--resolves itself quickly; then you have the cat talker; finally, the runaway kid. For bonus points, we also have the WWII setting for one of the timelines, something HM loves, so, our first check for Kafka on the Shore!  2. Fantastical elements. This is the whole magic realism aspect essential to all Murakami.  In this case we have a group of school kids blacking out, the cat finder/talker, and an apparently reincarnated love interest. Check number two.  3. Age-related taboo love story. Young teen and aging librarian--another check in HM style. More bonus points here for the gay/transsexual/asexual secondary character, although it serves little purpose here (seemingly sensational).   4. Completely unrealistic pseudo-philosophical dialogue that somehow still holds your interest (most of the time). KotS doesn't have quite the normal fill of the philosophy here, but, as always, we have plenty of dialogue that makes no attempt to mimic real life. Check.  5. Unnecessary attention paid to music, perhaps suggesting power of music as magical.  You'll find it here in  a song the librarian recorded as a romantic teen. Check five!  6. Russian literature cited on a regular basis?  Well, only occasionally in this one, Chekov's maxim about a gun in a story means the gun has to be shot. Iffy check here.  7. Emphasis on the power of solitude and isolation.  Yep, in this story we have a cabin completely cut off from civilization. Another tally.   8. Any discussion of Japanese campus protests of the 60s?  Not central to the story, but Murakami got it in there with a sadly slain boyfriend's backstory, so check.  9. Protagonists who don't fit in, despite being seemingly revered by everyone in the narrative. Big check here--the boy is some sort of wallflower but still gets the ladies. The old man says he's not very smart, but he ends up with a religious-like disciple. Check.  10. Money, power, and fame all held in low regard. Yep, the librarian gave it all up at an early age, the boy drops out of school, the old man is taken care of by family and cat owners. Check!  11. Is the literary world involved?  Yes, but not a writer this time, just people who live in a library and the completely illiterate foil cat talker.  12. Is perception of reality (or the question of objective reality(ies)) a central question? You bet, the unreliable narrator turns out to be reliable--at least in the case of the boy--but, no ultimate answer is attempted. Check.  13. Are the female characters especially poorly wrought and seem to only serve as romantic objects?  God yes. Quite a bit of ink is spilled on the librarian's lost love (and, of course, this has destroyed her life and she waits to die subsequently) and despite that time devoted, I never found her in the least bit believable.  ...and then there's the odd groping 20 year old girl who seems to have no purpose whatsoever... Double check.  Anyway, I could on, but I think I've either made my point or haven't by now.  Murakami isn't a one trick pony, but he's also unlikely to shock you after you're read a couple of his.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed reading KotS, but it is formulaic.  So, don't read it if it's the only Murakami you'll ever touch (Wind Up Bird, is his best for my money), but I don't see any reason to withhold a recommendation. Murakami is on the cusp of Nobel Laureate status for good reason; KotS is representative of a solid performance on his part.
B0056DHCYS|4.0|It is hard to believe that this 2009 recording made in Frankfurt is only the third version of Die Tote Stadt in the catalogue. Erich Wolfgang Korngold wrote the opera when he was 19, constructing the libretto with help from his father Julius, a noted Vienna music critic. The composer's most famous work before his Hollywood exile, it is chiefly remembered for \\"Gluck das mir Verblieb.\\" This sentimental tune shows up in many Hollywood movies, most recently in The Big Lebowski.<br /><br />Die Tote Stadt is set in Doctor Evil's home-town, the \\"dead city\\" of Bruges, Belgium. The town's gothic atmosphere permeates the score, which is written in a lush orchestral style. Korngold stands with Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler as the last heirs to the Romantic tradition in music. But history (specifically the rise of the Nazis and the Anschluss) intervened, and the Jewish Korngold fled to Hollywood. There, he became one of the fathers of film music, which brought personal success but derision from the world of \\"serious\\" musicians.<br /><br />Conductor Sebastian Weigle takes the famous \\"Gluck das mir Verblieb\\" as slowly as possible, allowing soprano Tatiana Pavlovskaya to linger over the phrases. The effect is one of Wagnerian longing in this famous tune, drawing out the characters' nostalgia and inner anguish, expressed through this inspired melody. Elsewhere, the giant orchestra is adeptly led in the dance music for Marietta and the phantasmagoric carnival scene in Act II.<br /><br />Heldentenor Klaus Florian Vogt is captured here in marvelous voice. He sounds relieved to be free of the strange opera productions of Katherina Wagner's Bayreuth. This is the right voice for Paul, the hapless composer haunted by the memory of his dead wife. He sings the role with great tenderness and understanding, but is also  credible when portraying Paul's rage and confusion when confronted with Marietta. He brings frightening power and pathos to the scene where Paul strangles the phantom of his wife.<br /><br />The engineers from Oehms Records are to be commended for bringing out the complexity Korngold's high-calorie orchestrations. A smooth fabric of strings wraps around the listener, ably supporting the vocal line. Brass and timpani are fully captured, including the complex writing for celesta and triangle. Although this is labelled as a live recording, the mic-ing is well forward of the house. An occasional cough or stage noise is audible, but it's not enough to distract from one's enjoyment of the music.Oehms Records are to be commended for bringing out the complexity Korngold's high-calorie orchestrations.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game, or should I say games! They're not as easy as I thought they'd be, which was a pleasant surprise, and I especially liked the air hockey one!
B0063IH60K|4.0|its solitaire right how bad can it be. challenging and you can even replay your deal so you can repeat the same dumb move you made previously.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. I got hooked on it when I first played it on my fire. I would recommend it to anyone who likes variety in games.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|The app is very good. I use it all of the time. Great for quick notes, and more. I wish there was a option to lock important information.
B005HP2JAM|3.0|First of all, the cultural and artistic significance of this discovery is astounding, and the visuals are great.  Yet, the stereoscopic advantage of viewing these graphics is of questionable value, and after a while his nearly monotone narration began to irritate me.  I guess I would buy it again for the price. It is somewhat of a relief to have stereoscopic video about a subject of cultural interest as apposed to pure visual eye-candy.
B005F96URI|4.0|It was fun to watch. The story's not that deep, no, but so what. Most movies nowadays are unoriginal. Bad guy/warlord comes to power and needs to be taken down. What's original is how they get there and the style at which it's done. Bunraku is like a Japanese manga come to life. Unlike the live action movies and series made from manga and their subsequent animes, Bunraku doesn't attempt to place the characters in the context of normal life in regular surroundings. Instead it draws you into it's world using animation, creative yet sparse sets, paralleled bright and drab colors, good lighting, and great camera angles. Oh and the occasional pop-up book character adds to the feel as well. For some reason I see Josh Hartnet's name and think 'oh this is gonna be awful' and almost always have to eat my words. I don't know what I have against him, but I need to get over it. He was good and a little sexy. As was Gackt as Yoshi, the samurai who only wanted to retrieve a medallion. Gackt was so good I forgot he was Gackt and if you know anything about him, you know he's a character unto himself. Thus, seeing Yoshi and not Gackt is no small fete. Woody Harrelson was good, but the scene stealing Kevin McKidd was better. I kept expecting McKidd's Killer #2 to have a dance scene a la Kung Fu Hustle. Killer #2 has style and rhythm to spare. I can't say enough good things. Good cast. Good production. Good movie. 4.5 stars
B0059XTUVI|1.0|This is a bad film. Its an attempt at covering a life in scattered flashbacks from the pespective of old age. It ends up being rootless and impressionistic. Somewhat like a short TV clip show biography shown when someone has died. All the right notes are struck but nothing of the slightest importance is communicated. The script is superficial, empty and ultimately meaningless.   Its difficult to comment on the acting of Meryl Streep given that the role and the script give her nothing of any particular greatness to do. Rather than acting, what seemed to be required in the part was the skills of a mimic and for an older woman (she IS 62) to play an older woman. To be fair, thats what most people want in this sort of thing. They are far less interested in acting than in simply re-creating. I guess I can praise her for giving the masses what they wanted.  She is doing what became somewhat of a staple for older male actors on broadway for a while. A famous person is mimiced over a superficial coverage of their life and everyone wallows in a fit of nostalgia for both the person and the actor playing the person.  The two most dramatically interesting parts of her life are her improbable rise & transformation into(or creation of) the \\"Iron Lady\\" between 1974 and 1979. And her fall from office. But the film is so committed to the \\"official\\" story of her life that it misses all of the dramatic promise of both events.   Its going to give Meryl Streep another award for the mantle. But if she had any respect for herself or her profession, she would turn it down. She did nothing here worthy of note.   In the end, the film is kind of like going to see Disney's animatronic Abe Lincoln. Technically amusing but not interesting and ultimately an empty experience.

B005NGKMOU|3.0|I'm tempted to give this thing a better review than it deserves because it has a good actor in the lead and there are very few westerns made these days. But I think the best this film rises to is \\"ok\\". Its not good or bad. Its just ok.  Sam Shepard plays a Butch Cassidy who survives in south america into old age. There are flashbacks along the way covering how things went in Bolivia. The film quickly turns into an outlaws on the run western. And as that, its not bad. Everything seems to have been done on a tight budget but they did good with what they had.  What the film is missing is any sort of big action scene. Its all little stuff. Its a movie about outlaws where there are no robberies on screen. There is a detective character in the film who has been chasing Cassidy for years. But his character is underdeveloped.  The flashback covering what happened to the Sundance Kid is pointlessly disturbing. Its not what most people want to see in a western.  And the films attempt to create a moral (really political) distinction between \\"good\\" crime and \\"bad\\" crime falls really flat.   The films greatest flaw is the lack of an ending. Its as if they ran out of money and just stopped everything one day. The film just stops dead and the credits start. Anything would have been better than what they did.  It is a nice looking film. The got the look, feel and ground features of Bolivia sort-of right. It didn't end up looking like a generic nowhere western location. Sam Shepard's performance was good but limited by the script and the acting ability of those he was working with. Shepard needed someone else to play off in the film. He ended up carrying most of it by himself.  Not great or good. But Ok.

0553805460|1.0|I was hearing a lot about this book on the TV, Net and Youtube and curiosity got the better of me.   I expected a story of a man who built up a company, explaining his processes and goals and how he made them work achieve great wealth.  Unfortunately, by the time i finished this book, i lost all respect for Belfort. His writing style was disgusting and did not keep me interested. Rude and crude language was present throughout the book and i now could give you a great description of his wife's loins.  The book was quite boring as it constantly rambled on about drug abuse, psychedelic trips and how much Belfort could tolerate without dying. He made himself seem invincible in his \\"recollections\\". There was also constant reference to how much everything cost, which gave me sense of bragging the whole way through.  This book is about greed, drugs and neglect of the people closest to you.   One star is all this book deserves. Personally, there is no real meaning behind this book. Just shows how a man ruined many people's lives, and his own.
0062082353|5.0|Heard Kyle's interview on Opie and Anthony this morning and can't wait to get this book to read.  The stories that this man has are riviting and I can't wait to sink my teeth into this book.  If the book is like the interview, it'll be well worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun games :D and all of them are different levels and difficulties. over all I give this game a five star rating.

B0034G4OUO|5.0|If you are looking for a movie thats action getting straight to the point this is it!!!  The rock was a quiet young man who loved his big brother.  After tricking death and going to prison he comes out with very little to say.  Not wanting to do harm to no one but those that harmed him. I didn't get a chance to see this movie on the big screen did not know anything about it. But if I had I would have went to see it without a doubt twice!!!  If you have not seen check it out.  U won't be sorry.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Once I started this book that takes place in the Old South, I couldn't put my kindle down. It's told from the point of view of Belle, a slave and Lavinia an indentured Irish slave. The author uses dialect that defines her carefully created characters. It reminds me a little of Gone With the Wind but it's told through the minds of the two slaves. I hope there is a sequel. Book includes discussion questions and interview with the author.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is very addictive. To be truthful I spent 3 nonstop hours playing Angry Birds seasons, it never grows tired. There are always new updates so there is always something too work on. And the episode names are pretty great puns. Angry Birds is awesome, period.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|Of course Beyonce ALWAYS gives a great show because she is great! A living legend, her talent is much BEYond any other artist out now. She's the only artist out that can actually both SING AND DANCE as well as she does so why wouldn't you want this DVD??? You have other Beyonce DVDs why this one? For one this is the only time you'll probably see \\"4\\" (which is honestly vocally and it's in entirety her best album)performed in FULL (@ least for awhile) and this is also probably the only time you'll see Beyonce in such an intimate setting. Another reason is you get to see ALOT OF NEVER BEFORE SEEN PERSONAL FOOTAGE. Vocally \\"I care\\" is the best performance and editing wise \\"Countdown\\" is pretty cool! So go ahead and add this one to your collection you will not be disappointed =)

Greg always has a plan to do just enough to get by, but when he makes Rowley take one of the team, he loses his best friend.

Kinney's writing is crisp and easy to read. The characters are likable and believable. The ending brings the story full circle with one last story about the \\"cheese\\" that will make the reader chuckle.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" makes young and old smile as they follow Greg through his middle school adventures.

In the far the far east, Daenerys leads her Khalhaser through barren land before finding hope in the city of Quarth.  Martin's story is told from several perspectives, giving the novel its epic fantasy feel. The writing is sharp and never lingers, moving from event to event at a crisp pace.  Martin's characters give the story its heart. For Daenerys, her character continues to grow in inner strength and resolve. Theon's deception is heartbreaking, while Tyrion's honest approach as the King's Hand had me rooting for him despite the darkness behind the Lannister's bright colors.  \\"A Clash of Kings\\" stirs a passion within the soul, making the reader feel as if they're a knight in Westros. The only drawback, while minor for me, were the open plot points at the end of the novel. While several ends were tied up, new ones developed. There's no feeling of satisfaction at the end just a restless anxiety that promises to continue with \\"A Storm of Swords.\\" Martin, though, has me hooked, so I'll read to find out what happens next. Some, however, may find the unresolved ending frustrating.  Who will be the king of the 7 kingdoms? Joffery? Renly? Stannis? Balon Greyjoy? Robb Stark? \\"A Clash of Kings\\" promises surprises, fast-paced action, and will leave the reader anxious to read the next book in the series. Overall, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" will leave you breathless and wanting to know what happens next.

0525478183|5.0|I love John Green! Ok, now that I've declared my love for John, I'd also like to say that I love Margo Roth Spiegelman. Yes, she's selfish and attention seeking, but she is also just a girl (a paper girl according to herself) trying to discover herself and that I can relate to. Quentin, like most of Green's protagonists, is an intellectual type. He's smart and somewhat socially awkward. (think of Leonard from BIG BANG THEORY) He fits in nicely with his circle of friends, and Margo is the hot, untouchable girl across the hall(read: his neighbor). (for those of you who watch BIG BANG THEORY like me, this is Penny)<br />The story revolves around Quentin's absorption into all things Margo. As kids, the pair were pretty good friends. After they find a suicide victim in the local park (at age 9 (I think) might I add)their friendship kind of fades away. Margo becomes a popular girl known for her running away on adventures. Quentin becomes the typical intellectual kid that hangs out with the band kids, but he's always fascinated by Margo, or the person he thinks she is.<br />The novel begins with Margo taking Quentin on one fantastic adventure. It's basically a night of revenge, pranks, breaking and entering. (not breaking-and-entering, there,s some breaking and there's some entering. This distinction is important!) Anyway, after this fabulously exciting night in Quentin's life, Margo disappears. The events that follow are: interesting, heartrending, scary, exhilarating, a little crazy. Quentin learns numerous things about Margo, his friends, and most of all himself. Not everything is as it seems.<br />It's a story of self-revelation and discovery,adventure and risk, but most importantly it's a story of life.

B0067DBB4S|4.0|Since bursting onto the scene after his shocking American Idol Season 5 elimination, Chris Daughtry and his eponymous band of pop-rockers have solidified into rock-hard mainstays. Daughtry, the band, puts a firm foot forward on its third LP, Break The Spell; while Daughtry, the man, showcases previously unheard brassy nuances to his let-`er-rip vocals. On first listen, this set of tough-guy-with-a-soft-side tracks might feel like the kind of fare suburban moms secretly jam to in their immaculately vacuumed and Windexed SUVs (hey, y'all, you best believe white girls got angst, too), or worse, it might sound unsettlingly like a Nickelback album.   Fear not, Daughtry fans; although the songwriting leaves a lot to be desired (just take one look at the titles, and you'll think of several other bands that recorded slightly different tracks by the same name: \\"Renegade,\\" \\"Crawling Back to You,\\" \\"Outta My Head,\\" among others), this batch of vanilla tunes aren't as lifeless as they seem. Daughtry does not disappoint, providing the sound musicianship they've come to be known for. New drummer, Robin Diaz, pounds new life into the band's signature power-choruses. There's no denying the climactic hooks featured on first single \\"Crawling Back to You\\"--which has turned into something of a mild success in spite of limited publicity--or on the title track, which will leave any fan of mainstream music yearning for the golden age of pop-rock (circa 2005-2007...before the dark times, before the electro-dance-pop empire).   Daughtry continues walking a fine line between elements of Americana country (\\"Gone Too Soon,\\" \\"Louder Than Ever\\") and not-so-heavy metal (\\"Crazy\\"), which they established as their genre of choice on their sophomore effort, Leave This Town. They balance a gruff swagger with polished charisma, a smart blend for the band, commercially, because of its appeal to Middle America--who might be the only people left buying CDs. Love it or hate it, the pro-life message on \\"GoneToo Soon\\" will have the religious Right as the kind of built-in audience that is sure to move units.   Overall, Daughtry delivers a lukewarm effort, but that doesn't discount that the flavors here are delicious. It's familiar and feel-good, a white-bread collection that pleases the ears and might fuel a great mid-tempo workout (\\"Losing My Mind\\")--maybe even slip into a wedding slideshow or two (\\"Start of Something Good\\")--but you'll forget about it altogether by next year (unless, of course, they're still overplaying one residual single on Adult Contemporary radio). Buy this one at half-price during one of Amazon's dirt-cheap blowout sales. It's well worth the money, but it's not a must-hear that you can't wait a few months to check out.   EnterDetainment Verdict: We're going to go ahead and incarcerate Chris, just to tell him how pretty he is, and then give him suggestions on how he can do better next time (something like: \\"for a Renegade, you sure do play it safe, you ridiculously attractive, alopecia-afflicted man\\").

B004RKXNDU|1.0|I saw the movie trailer, it looked so good I had to buy the e-book for my kindle. I'm not even half way through and I still have no idea what is going on except that the charaters are tring to find a mole in the upper level of British intel. I have  never written a review, this is my first, but I felt I had to let someone knew how disappointing this book has been for me. I see no point in seeing the movie either.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|With everyone involved in this baby, I expected an awesome mind bending movie. Instead I got a fun, entertaining one. The extras are fun and shows how much love and fun went into the movie.  The entended version adds more to the movie but still, I wanted a little bit more....
0618918248|5.0|I must confess I was a bit weary of Richard Dawkins writing a non biology book. I enjoyed his \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\" but worried that he might get insufferable when it came to his pet peeve religious dogma. I need not have been concerned. He tackled the subject with a good deal of humor and humanity. I loved it when he built a case against the need for a morality cop only to cast doubts by quoting Steve Pinker on his experience of the Montreal riots of 1969. Simply wonderful. I could almost see the grin on his face.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|This was a gift for our. son. He has not watched all the episodes but, he is very pleased with the ones he has watched. So all in all this is a very good purchase.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|Breaking Dawn is o.k. but not a book I would read again, have on my shelf, or recomend to a friend. I like how Rosalie and Leah overcome thier dislike of Bella and help her during her pregnancy. I thought Jacob and Renesmae becoming soul mates was pretty lame. There isn't much of a plot, the story did not keep me interested or make me wonder what would happen next. Leah was the character who most deserved to have a happy ending. It would have been nice if she left the reservation, realized Sam is not worth crying over and pursued her own ambitions. I recomend renting Breaking Dawn before buying. There are better things to read such as Airborn, Warriors, Silverwing, Winter girls, or a Wrinkle in time. After reading the book I have decieded not to see the movie. I am done with the series.

B004I744AS|5.0|This is a very useful dictionary, and I love the 'word of the day' on the first page when starting the app. In offline mode it needs ~110mb of storage space, not unreasonable for the sheer amount of information.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love amazon and this bag gives me that much more reason to love them.

It's comfortable, and its durability looks promising. I will make an update after i have had a chance to further field test it.

Excellent action scenes the camaraderie of characters an one of the best visual effect of an alien beast. Very powerful and I love the orphan and his haircut!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This kindle cover is very light but at the same time durable.  I do not find it to be cheap at all.  The cover fits the Kindle Fire perfectly.  There is absolutely no extra space that would cause shifting.  This cover was customized perfectly to securely fit the dimensions of the Kindle Fire.  I wanted a kindle Fire cover that would still be good when reading the kindle as a book.  Most covers are very bulky and focus on the features that allow the kindle to stand on a tabletop to play video.  That is great and all, but the problem with those types of covers is that the front flap cannot be folded neatly against the back when reading the device in your hand.  This cover, however, allows this perfectly.  The front flap allows you to fold it back and easily read your kindle as a book.    I could not be happier with this cover.  5/5
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far this product helps me keep notes on multiple devices. This is the first time I am using Evermore, and so far I am impressed.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I was hesitant to try this on my Kindle fire due to some bad reviews, but since it was the FAotD, and I really was hoping to sync my Tootle tasks, I gave it a shot. Wow! I am glad I did. I do expect an update to fix the already mentioned date issues, but for Tasks this is already great. I was able to create and sync multiple lists with one Tootle Acct. I created tasks with due dates and tasks withhout. I tapped the menu button at the bottom of the screen to get lotsof options including making a new list, so now I have my list plus a business and home list.  I can view each separately or view &quot;all tasks&quot;. I synced manually, then checked my mail tasks on my laptop. It showed the new lists and now when I create tasks from email messages, I can sync that to the Kindle. GREAT! I am happy.

B000001FZK|5.0|As everyone knows,1991 was a time of a very extreme change in pop music. The alternative phenomenon took off full stride at the end of that year and refused to leave a lot of room for much else. Taken literally you'd think a genre called \\"alternative\\" would be an ideal place for someone with the creative vision of Mark Hollis and his band. But the fact was that most alt rock radio and such was shorthand for stations that played primarily grunge rock. Where genuine alternative music formats on radio and elsewhere was few and far between. One gets the impression listening to this album that Mark,already pretty removed from pop music culture by the late 80's was moving into that purely creative sense of vision as opposed commercial cliche's. True it had the makeup of something that could've been very pretentious (a very overused critics device if I may so) but somehow this was made to work extremely well.<br /><br />  The key to describing this music is minimalism. It's a direction that Talk Talk had been edging toward onward from [[ASIN:B0000074BS Colour of Spring]] but pieces such as \\"Myrrhman\\",\\"After The Flood\\" and \\"Taphead\\" bought it to new levels,even past where Brian Eno and Pink Floyd had taken ambience. The still present mumbled vocals of Hollis are almost completely buried by the textural and quit harmoniums,organs and cymbals. On more rhythm tracks such as \\"Ascension Day\\" and \\"New Grass\\" the guitars became a more significant element,again mainly in the rhythmic sense of the word. Again on the final number \\"Runeii\\" the music tapers off into near atonality at times. It's definitely a musical journey. And outside it's relm I don't know if I'd even call it pop music exactly. Unless we're talking about it on it's most cutting edge.<br /><br />  I once heard Roger McQuinn of The Byrds describe psychedelic music as sounds that \\"sort of bleed together\\",in that case due to the distortion of mental perception created by the drug. I would refer to this music perhaps as in the psychedelic vein mainly in that the participants involved allow the music to bleed into itself. It doesn't sound to me as if any chemical influence is involved here but more a spiritual revelry. Mark Hollis has gone to the point where vocally he's almost chanting in tongues here. And those vocals are barely present on this predominantly instrumental type music. It's sprightly but moody. It's minimal but definitely not soft. In short the music presents a lot of contradictions coming together into something very lovable and coherent. And if this has to be the final album by this very innovative band,can't think of a better way to go out.lic vein mainly in that the participants involved allow the music to bleed into itself.

B0000074BS|5.0|As long as I've been an adult the mid 1980's,on both sides of the world has been received as something of a punchline. It's not a concept that sat very well on my end because it didn't seem right to pick apart a whole decade of creativity. Sure the decade had it's flaws for sure. But there's always a pro and anti group. Besides there were always groups such as this anyway. Mark Hollis started this band in the early part of the decade as basically one of the many new wave bands coming out of the UK at the time. As with them all Talk Talk had their own unique flavor. All the same I only really heard about them myself in the last few years but didn't know exactly where a good starting point would be. After understanding this might be an important album for them I decided to go with this album. And what I heard more than surprised me.<br /><br />  For one thing,this album has very little if anything to do with new wave. In fact it's closer in many ways to a Steve Winwood type Northern Soul album for the 80's. All the same Mark Hollis keeps the sound unique. True one of their defining qualities is Hollis's near incomprehensible lyrics and singing style. Sort of like Steely Dan (though more philosophical than implicit) in their cryptic quality but his mumbling tone forces the listener to acknowledge the music more. From the somewhat more soulfully upbeat \\"Happiness Is Easy\\" to \\"I Don't Believe In You\\",\\"April 5'th\\" and \\"Living In Another World\\" that are more slowly explorative with the heavy gospel/soul organ textures and dragging bass lines the music is one of many moods,often on the same offbeat spiritual quests as Van Morrison,Kate Bush and Joni Mitchell. \\"Life Is What You Make It\\" and \\"Give It Up\\" both embrace something close to new wave only on the much funkier end of the spectrum,with this solid hybrid soul/rock/funk grooves and a very obviously exsitentialist lyrical message that's...very appropriate for funk which musically does embrace the concept of what I call the spiritually realistic.<br /><br />  \\"Chameleon Day\\" is an atonal number that borders on the more neo psychedelic direction that they'd gradually embrace with their music as time went on where \\"Time It's Time\\" is a minimalist,gospel type ballad and a good way to end an album like this. True nothing done on this album is anything 100% original to them. On the other hand the way in which Mark Hollis and company combine their musical and production concepts is totally unique. Everything is done in a manner that's very much unexpected. And with music that drips with soul as much as this does,it's very surprising Mark allows his lyrics and vocal style to be so anonymous. It's almost as if it's presented in some type of good. In the end it became apparent,at least on my end that this was done very likely to draw attention to the music's dynamic combination psychedelia,pop,soul,funk and even some jazz. Even on the uptempo numbers,it's also a very clean production too. It's not exactly mellow. But it chooses to get your attention with these sense of.....well sound coming slow upon you from behind as opposed to being in your face. An unconventional artifact that many an artist can still learn from.he spiritually realistic.<br /><br />  \\"Chameleon Day\\" is an atonal number that borders on the more neo psychedelic direction that they'd gradually embrace with their music as time went on where \\"Time It's Time\\" is a minimalist,gospel type ballad and a good way to end an album like this.

0525423281|5.0|Fashion means something entirely different to Lola Nolan than it does to most other girls. That's because Lola does not stop at fashion and instead reaches for a higher art form: costume. Those that know her aren't ever surprised to see her wearing her more outrageous, elaborate, and extravagant conceptions because they know that's just who she is. But despite her more wild outfits, Lola is really a good kid and loving daughter. So maybe her dads don't really approve of her sexy rock star boyfriend, but at least Lola knows she's keeping her eye on the prize: a fashion-filled future. That is, she was until next door neighbors move back in. And now that twins Calliope and Cricket Bell are back, Lola can't concentrate on anything, not even her most ambitious costume yet. No matter how much she tells herself that she has everything she wants, she can't ignore her lingering feelings for Cricket, her childhood friend and first love.  Lola and the Boy Next Door is just as sweet and charming a book as its companion Anna and the French Kiss. Perkins delivers another wholeheartedly satisfying romance that is sure to make its way into all readers' hearts. The neat balance of strictly romance and the more complicated side of life that I came to appreciate in Anna and the French Kiss functions nicely in Lola and the Boy Next Door as well. In addition to struggling with her conflicted feelings for both her boyfriend Max and her neighbor Cricket, Lola has to deal with an unexpected houseguest, her screw-up of a biological mother. I loved Perkins's flamboyant yet realistic characters and the sometimes ridiculous yet still believable situations they find themselves in. If there's anything to complain about, though, it's that the solution to Lola's relationship with Max is a little hasty, but even with that, Lola and the Boy Next Door is a smooth and fantastic read. In all, Perkins has given readers another winner of a YA romance.  Fans of Anna and the French Kiss will not want to miss its companion, Lola and the Boy Next Door, nor will readers who also enjoyed Breakfast at Bloomingdale's by Kristen Kemp.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Caricatures brought to life and life caricaturized brilliantly as Woody Allen can do so well.<br />The Americans are so American, the portrait of the young artist is such a great portrait, Zelda, Hemingway, Dali, Toulouse Lautrec are so much who we believe them to be that one feels that one is in a Comedia Del Arte play without the costumes. And one loves it, loves it enough to watch the film multiple times. For the cinema, for the director, for the acting, for the script, for the subject and for the overall joy and experience.<br /><br />Owen Wilson was so very perfect in the role of the observer who has difficulty in really relating that I was reminded of the opening chapter of Anthony Burgess's \\"Inside Mr. Enderby\\" when Enderby the poet is visited by a group of time-traveling children with their tutor while he is sleeping. This time the people visited are not sleeping, but the traveler, Gil, is. Sleeping and dreaming or day-dreaming. The third time you watch the film, you start noticing the dream characteristics of locations, people, conversations, movements, props and possibly even the Cole Porter Songs. Maybe?<br /><br />This is not Fantasy. Nor is it time travel. I am not too old to have forgotten the dreams of my childhood and youth. Thank you Woody allen for reminding me of them again, and telling me that they were as real as Michel Zevaco, Jules Verne and Jean de la Hire novels and Alice and the Walrus and the Cheshire Cat.

B006KSAPV0|5.0|I am lucky to have seen this film after a visit to a Dali exhibition where I surveyed his Divina Commedia and the Dinner with Gala paintings.<br /><br />Almodovar's brush strokes are clean and directly applied to the screen. His depiction of the characters are the same way. The sane and the insane occupy the same frames, acting their parts beautifully, with no exaggeration or understatement. But the undertones, the queezy feeling you get and the occasional desire you have to divert your eyes from the screen, hold your partners hand and to reassure her and yourself that her world is nothing like the one you are watching worms its way under your skin after the first few seconds and does not let go.<br /><br />When you look at Dali paintings you have distorted images and perfectly drawn people and you try to figure out the meanings of the distorted images. Here, in the film, you have perfectly drawn images, scenes, sets but you are on the lookout for the distortion that you know is hidden there. The distortion is internal to the people and to the script and to the sets and even the music (just try to dance to that music with that song) or the few instances of humor which we enjoyed much.<br /><br />Almodovar is definitely one of those who bears that torch of Spanish visual and written art, and carries on the tradition of the mixture of the natural and the not so natural occupying the same bodies.<br /><br />We did not fall in love with this film but watched it with awe, felt a great deal of stress afterwards and did not wish to speak about it. Now, I think it was because Almodovar said it all, and said it so well that the viewer has nothing else to add to that. I just wish I can find a Garcia Lorca play to watch soon to complete this trilogy.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Works great on both Motorola razr and my Hubby's Droid x. We sync both calendars easily. I like that I can set colors for different members of the family, and I can do things like save an event to repeat every other Monday and Wednesday.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|Apollo 18 is a budget version of \\"Alien\\" done in a \\"found footage\\" style.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi horror movies featuring creepy crawlers in space, you'll find this a tense and entertaining, if not thrilling, ninety minutes, although there is not much new here either.<br /><br />Other reviewers have raised the question of how this footage of the space mission could have been found if none of the three astronauts returned to earth.  The answer, if I understood one of the alternate endings, is that the astronaut in the command module did manage to return, although the theatrical ending makes this anything but clear.<br /><br />Finally I must commend the makers of the DVD for including a full complement of bonus features, including deleted scenes, alternate endings, and director's commentary.<br /><br />So if you like \\"Bugs in Space\\" movies, you may enjoy this minor effort, which is certainly worth a rental if not perhaps a purchase.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Not only are the Bee Gees incredible songwriters, musicians and singers, but their ability to accurately reproduce their music in a live venue is a real treat to watch, and hear.  It would have been great to be at this show in Las Vegas but this DVD is as close as one could possibly get! The video was very well directed and the audio was clean and well mixed. The Bee Gees vocals were typical Bee Gees but the music and the production quality make this a solid \\"10\\".  I've watched this DVD about eight times and I always find it to be a great way to spend a little over an hour being thoroughly entertained.  I would not hesitate to buy this DVD again.  When you look at the song list it's rather impressive how many great songs the Bee Gees actually recorded over the years.  There are so many that some of them didn't even make it into the show.   You wont be sorry you bought this DVD!
B000J10ERO|3.0|First of all, I think that this is in itself a good film. I applaud Brian Singer for the serious, respectful tone. (RE: X-Men 1 & 2) Really, this is the most serious Superman film to date. The thing, I think, and the reason that this was not a totally huge hit, and that WB is rebooting the franchise, is that this did not capture the hopeful, uplifting rush that we generally expect from Superman. The story and the visual look are both kind of muted and thoughtful, which is not a bad thing taken alone, but it is a little short on the \\"primary colors\\" that put stars in your eyes and a smile on your face.<br /><br />I would like to have seen more from Brandon Routh, certainly more dialogue. I don't have a problem with him. However, both he and Kate Bosworth seem young for the roles when you consider this film as a \\"sequel\\" to the first two Christopher Reeve films. Kevin Spacey is a good actor, yes, but I just don't see him as Lex Luthor. Also, the plot is very similar to Superman I.<br /><br />I think that Superman Returns coulda/shoulda taken a cue from Smallville, which for its occasional silliness *really* captures the essence of what makes Superman great, in addition to updating the cultural aesthetic to present day. Superman Returns seems to be paying homage, visually, to early incarnations (architecture, costumes, etc.) which, again, is classy but the nostalgia can be unnecessarily limiting. Summary: this is a good film, totally worth checking out, but not as great as it could have been. I have not yet gone through the special features, which look to be good.
0307702103|1.0|We bought this audio book for our long drives.  This one is one of the worst we have listened to in years.  The story..the many in this book..never seems to be completed before jumping to a different character. We were hoping that somehow the stores would tie together..so far they have not.  And the author should not be doing the reading..he does a really bad job in comparision to other readers we have followed.   Save your money---with this one we have no problem switching to the radio.

0385534639|1.0|Plain and simple this story was very disappointing. I bought this book with very high hopes because of the great hype and 5 Star reviews surrounding it, but I am now having buyer's remorse. It felt as if the author just made things up as she went along and just wrote each chapter to go along with the chapter before. Almost how a child would write a book without an actual plan or outline in place before writing the actual book. The storyline was too \\"cookie cutter\\", never seemed to have an actual plot and had too many open-ended questions. Countless times I put this book down mid-chapter because it could not hold my interest or pull me into the story line.  If nothing else I hope my 1-star review will at least deter one or two interested readers from buying this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is awesome for the kindle fire I love the increasing volume part it works great! I also like that there is no boring ring you can choose your own music!! love this app!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|The app looks ok, but they are forcing some horrible shadowed font that is difficult to read at best. App needs to honor system font settings.

B006NXIO0Q|5.0|This movie was just the ticket.  It was, first and foremost: entertaining,next the plot was very intriguing, watching a clever little girl turn into a very clever & capable, reaper. Having her world brutally torn away from her at such a tender age, in such a cold blooded manner, causes her to be obsessed with a sense of revenge.  And she carries out that revenge, with a cold-blooded-calculated, precision that grips you as you enter the fray with \\"Catalaya.\\"   Here is a strong character played by a strong young actress, \\"Zoe Saldana\\"  with the skills to make you believe you're right there; when she has her throw down death match, with the personal bodyguard of the well protected, man who ordered the killing of her mother and father, you're right there, struggling with her, hoping you don't run out of breathe before you can kill this maggot.  We start Catalaya's adult life with her, when she totally destroys a Vintage-Red-Ford Mustang, by running into the side of police car.  All that, just to go to jail and dispatch a target she's picked up, as a contract Hit.  Its a thrill ride, full of adrenaline-pumping...pulse-pounding-moments, where you'll forget to breath. This is excitement to good to miss.  From the beginning to the very end, you will be drawn into this movie.  Zoe is Hottt, and the action is sexyyy, you'll get more than your money's worth.  And that's what its all about escapism getting away from the every day with a good entertainment vehicle, and this is one...enjoy  [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This psychological thriller is almost a horror film as we see a talented young woman totally fall apart under pressure. The film is brilliant and was able to have me feeling extreme sympathy for an unprepared young woman one minute and then to be jumping out of my seat at her dark hallucinations and then feeling mystified as to how much of what we are seeing is reality and how much is in the mind of our poor deranged young ballerina. Any film that keeps me bouncing back and forth between reality and hallucination for two hours without becoming trite is certainly well made and strategized.   Darren Aronofsky does an exceptional job with this psychological thriller that reminded me of the breakdown experienced by the surgeon played by Jeremy Irons in Dead Ringers. Natalie Portman is beyond exceptional as she plays Nina, a ballerina who has exceptional skills but who has been infantilized for so long by her overbearing mother, played by Barbara Hersey, that she has no survival skills. This is actually a key to understanding the film for a young woman who lives in a completely controlled world of stuffed animals and princess bedspreads is not prepared for the pressures of competition or for stretching herself artistically to achieve expressive goals. It is the ability to play both the White and Black swans that the artistic director, played by Vincent Cassel, is challenging Nina to achieve. Competition, especially from an attractive unorthodox dancer Lily, played by Mila Kunis, is too much for Nina to navigate. As Nina decompensates and becomes increasingly obsessive and compulsive, she has considerable struggles to control the darker side of her nature that she is allowing to emerge to portray the Black Swan. Portman is brilliant as she sways from reality to hallucination and from one dark influence to another.   There is a final reason I was highly impressed with this film. Darren Aronofsky decided to use much of the music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake as background music throughout non-ballet scenes. The music is full of suspense and tension and it was brilliant to use so much of the original ballet score throughout the film. Overall , this film gets an A+.
B0042IDMPG|5.0|Today's music is horrible. This has been the only CD not band that has caught my attention now days. Their second album is not so great, but its alright. The sound in this album is very capturing, great for a change in today's music. If your tired of listening to garbage these days I recommend you listen to some real music for a change.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This DVD came quickly and was just as described. Factory raped and it looks and plays like it is the genuine thing. Verry satisfied with this. Would recommend it.
B000Q76K24|4.0|I am surprised at the variation in reviews. I thought this a terrific movie, and Matt Damon as a very human and conflicted character.  Angelina Jolie was totally miscast, and this made the movie frustrating every time she came on screen.  Naomi Watts would have been a better choice.  But for suspense, this is a good movie.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game is ok, it is not to challenging but is good mindless fun and entertainment. I would recommend it for when you have nothing else to do

B0026IUXO2|2.0|Movie lost me about half way in. Not because it was confusing it just wasn't a film that grabbed and kept your attention. The costumes and scenery were nice but the film just failed at keeping your attention. Also from what I read it had a fair share of historical inaccuracies.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|well put together and gives you enough for advanced play. the Cpu has some random moves from middle to lower levels.
0307959856|1.0|The most intriguing moment in reading this book is when I read the title.  I was intrigued by the title and hoped for more of Elizabeth and Darcy's story.  I was sorely disappointed!  I would be interested to know what percentage of this book is taken from the pages of Pride and Prejudice.  There are so many wonderful characters in P and P.  Lydia, for instance, is drugged and disappears from the story after her dramatic entrance.  Tiny bits of clues are dropped but it isn't until the end that the murder mystery goes anywhere.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone who loves P and P.
0003303187|1.0|I loved this book as a child so I purchased it for my son. However, he can not read it since the print is tiny. It must be a 5font or close to that. I would get a headache trying to read it and he looked scared that I was going to make him read this book with the tiny print.   The stories are fantastic but I would not purchase this printing of the book again.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Where's the update?  The newest version has wake on LAN capabilities.  Besides that it is a great app but should have brought from market.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|use on multiple devices, great on all. notes and highlights sync across all. reading plans are great and easy to use. streams good quality audio Bible. nothing to complain about.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This case is great for my Kindle Touch.  It's big enough to slip the Kindle in and out easily but not so big as to take up excessive space.  There's about 3/4\\" extra the long way and 1/4\\" the short way (for the Touch).  I would guess that a Keyboard or Fire would just fit.  It has a nice soft lining, and the hook velcro closures (three) are located such that the Kindle slides over the pile, not the hook pieces.  The outside is attractive and looks likely to hold up for a long time.  My one wish would be for a place for some ID, like a business card slot, maybe on the inside so as not to detract from its good looks.
0439023513|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews I almost decided not to read this final book, but I'm glad I did.  If you've read the other two you must read this one for closure.  It's no more depressive than the other two.  Pat yourself on the back if you're depressed reading this series, that means you have some sense of humanity about you.  Katniss and Peeta are survivors. They do not end up in a vegetative state like some reviews indicate. This book is well written,ties in all the characters in a believable fashion, and works out the relationships between Katness, Peeta, and Gale in a way that makes sense. It is not disjointed, hurried, confusing or overtly depressing.  It is a fitting conclusion to the series. Hopefully all of us come away more discerning of our government leaders, less gullible concerning societies morays, and willing to be involved, charitable, compassionate, and loving with our fellowmen.
0900652985|5.0|David Sear Must be Roman, This Old Ancient Roman Coin Book is Good if you Have the Time and Intrest. A CLASSIC BOOK OF INFORMATION!!!
1587613379|4.0|The main premise of the book is that being sexually promiscuous (being a \\"slut\\") is not a \\"bad thing.\\" It actually is a positive experience to live as a slut: to have the freedom and ability to express one's sexuality and to act on (consensual) sexual desires. The authors attempt to reclaim the word slut as a label that positively describes someone's ability and desire to have a variety of positive sexual encounters, experiences, and partners.  While there were a few things I did like about this book, there were also some things I was not as fond of. The writing feels disconnected from my generation. The authors seem to place an emphasis on \\"free love\\" which feels out of touch with the way our society is structured and with how most people live right now. This isn't to say that I don't think \\"free love\\" is a humbling and sort of noble idea; I would actually prefer it, I think, if people had the humility and security to love many people and have sex with many people without it causing anxiety, fear of loss, jealousy, and anger. Overall, though, it doesn't feel like a practical guide to expanding relationships and sexual experiences. The authors actually admit to having their roots in 1960s San Francisco, and most of the book feels couched in a small, small slice of the American experience and not applicable to mainstream America.  I really did like, however, their discussion about how the taboo nature of sex has led to distorted views about the sexual experience and misinformation. If no one can openly talk about sex and ask questions when there is confusion about the real mechanics of sex, then I think people go off of the messages they receive from mass media and porn. Sex is always passionate, right? The woman always squirts, right? The man is always bigger than the woman, right? There is always a lot of grunting and screaming, right? I think if we all talked to all of our friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers, we would find out that the sexual experience is as diverse as people are in general. Because social constraints keep us from talking openly about sex with everyone we might want to, we have no way of knowing that not every man grunts, not every woman orgasms the same way, that sometimes sex is just sex and not some mind-blowing, earth-shattering event. One of their suggestions for breaking yourself out of your own \\"sex is taboo\\" box is to write down all sex-related words that you can think of, and then choose the ones you like. Say them out loud five times in a row so that you actually feel comfortable saying them. It makes it easier to communicate to yourself and others what you want, what you like, and what you want to do.  The chapter on jealousy was also solid, and had some great tips about how to manage and face jealousy. A lot of their suggestions had to do with relaxation techniques, being honest with yourself and your partner, appropriate ways to respond to jealousy, and how to problem solve and manage conflicts peacefully and constructively. The chapters on health and raising children were also informative and helpful. Lastly, I really liked the authors' ability to talk about the \\"real-world\\" constraints of having an open relationship: time, money, and one's ability to have sex many times a day are all limited! It does take honest negotiation and communication to make an open relationship work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was seriously amazed at how this book was able to capture my attention. I thought since I was in my 20's and this book is aimed at young adults that I wouldn't be blown away. I was sincerely wrong.
B001DEXDNI|1.0|I had to send the first CD back b/c of the poor quality .....skipping, scratchy sounding on many of the tracks. The second (replacement) wasn't much better. Some of the tracks skip.

B005DOL0R0|5.0|PROS:  This product does exactly as it says it does, it holds your Kindle Fire.  The band on the front has little purpose. It can be used to grab onto, or to hold some small papers. (I've held mail with it before).   CONS:  It would be great if it had a pocket sleeve inside, or on the back.  I knew it didn't have this when I bought it, so it's not really worth marking off a star for, but it would be nice if it had something to store small papers.    Also, it is a bit of a tight squeeze.  You literally can only fit your Kindle in this.  I was able to hang a Stylus pen inside, but that is about all the room you have!
B005G4TJI4|1.0|The weakest link of the Transformer trilogy; The first two were decent films, how did this one end up so bad? I barely made it through the theatrical viewing, I couldnt imagine buying it and watching it again.

031617615X|4.0|Big fuzzy spoilers to follow!     I was fairly surprised at the number of terrible reviews this book got so I thought it might be nice to have a review somewhere in between \\"it should be burned\\" and \\"best book ever\\". I thought it was decent, if I was able to give half stars it would probably end up around 3 and a half. It was a fairly satisfying conclusion to the series.      So let's get to it:  1)Imprinting - This seems to be the biggest complaint. The author goes through almost painful extremes to explain it's nothing inherently sexual, through several books as a matter of fact. It's an odd concept and probably nothing that anyone can make a fair comparison with which is why everyone seems to be so uncomfortable. I think if you try and think of it as just an unselfish, unending love you'll have less of a problem. Jacob loves her for being her and not for anything is might become. I don't think at any point it over steps its bounds and becomes anything creepy.  2)Bella - I'm surprised by how unhappy people are with Bella being the exception to the newborn vampire rule. It becomes obvious very quickly that this surprises everyone, even Bella. They try several theories and explanations. Let's be fair though, it would have killed the rest of the book if Bella had been an out of control monster and no longer Bella. So they skipped over that part, didn't bother me I didn't miss the resulting violence.   3)Renessme - Ok yeah, worst name ever. I split it up to Rene Esme while reading. Can't even figure out how it was supposed to be pronounced. I liked Carlie though, very cute.   4)Bow Chicka-wow-wow - The lack of a full sex scene seems to have set everyone off. Again eh. I figure even fictional characters are entitled to some privacy. Granted when I got to the first night of the honeymoon I figured I must have skipped a page and spent a few minutes looking for it. The build up to this moment lasts through three books so the fact that it's skipped is a bit disconcerting.Still their extremely active extra curricular activities are in no way absent just slightly glossed over. To be fair the book is pretty much meant for teenagers I don't know how appropriate it would have been to be explicit. Also it would never have lived up to expectations, if your imagination can't fill in the blanks you've never had a pillow tearing moment.   5)Pregnancy - Having never been pregnant with a vampire hybrid I can't talk about personal experience here. I didn't have the problems with Bella's pregnancy though. Having had two kids I can tell you though it wasn't comfortable, though others love it. True my kids didn't try and suck me dry but it sure felt like that. I did really appreciate the instant love and connection though. I get that, you'll live and die for them no matter what it's doing to you.   6)Happy ending - A truly incredible amount of books and movies feel the need to have loss and tragedy as a way to define life. It's part of life, live long enough and you'll see it. Which is why I do love a happy ending. It's fiction, it should be a bit biased. The good guy should win and the bad guy should lose and there should be a happy, fuzzy ending. Real life is real enough for me, I like my entertainment to be better then reality. Just personal preference that.    So yeah, I didn't have any huge problems with this book. I think everything was pretty well explained. So why only 3 1/2 stars? I did feel a few things were missing though. Right after I started reading Twilight I found out about Midnight Sun. For those that don't know it was the companion book to Twilight told from Edward's point of view instead of Bella's. It was never finished, apparently the first 12 chapters were leaked and posted in the internet. So the author gave up and released what was written on the internet for all to read. For those who like the series and haven't read this go find it, it's fascinating to have the same information from a different perspective. So I read the 2at the same time as far as Midnight Sun went anyway. Unfortunately, getting that little taste of that perspective kind of made it feel like something was missing for the rest of the series. Still even without that aspect Edwards character was sadly diminished in this book, actually in all but Twilight. I know it's supposed to be Bella's story but when you start to show her as half of a whole, half really isn't enough anymore. Jacob's perspective was interesting but I'd rather have had Edward's. The only other problem I really had was the lack of real action. There's an huge build up that fizzles out. It'll be interesting to see what they do with that in the movie, somehow I don't think they'll let it go like that. Not that I was looking for a huge bloody battle but there certainly should have been something. It was starting to feel like X-men there at the end.   So read a form your own conclusions. I'll miss the series though. Friends you'd probably rather meet during the day:)

B005OCFGTO|3.0|I was disappointed with the quality of the set, Especially the 8th film. I had to return and get a replacement set because of the poor quality of the 8th and final movie. The rest of the collection was ok, but I noticed that some scenes were deleted on the movies. I love the Harry Potter movies as much as the books, but the company definitely did not care about the qualityof the product they are putting out, knowing that people will still buy them. I also bought the bluray set, but have not had the chance to view it. I hope it is much better than the dvd set.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much its the best!!!!! When you play this game you will fall in love with it.

My only issue  The mouse pad is rolled up with the image facing in when it was packaged.  This causes the pad to roll up on the edges when you put it on your desk.  I have put it under heavy books, wrapped it with rubber bands, and even taped the corners to my desk and it still wants to roll up.  Currently i have it wrapped up with rubber bands in a drawer of my desk.  I am gonna let it sit for a month or two and see if this helps.  This would be an easy fix if the mouse pad was rolled up with the image facing out when packaged.  Yes, with the image out it could be damaged but it comes in a box and the only thing loose in the box is the toe, and I dont think the toe would cause any damage to the image on the mouse pad.  With that said it is still an awesome gift for any achiever and for under $12 the price cant be beat.  F*** it.  Let's go bowling.
B005H8DEMG|5.0|This is one of my favorite plays & I have seen several versions. This is by far my favorite. Perhaps closest to \\"Prospero's Books \\" with the amazing John Gielgud, this film presents Shakespeare in a fine mix of magic & romance. Ms Mirren is wonderful as a transposed Prospero & Felicity Jones as a beautiful Miranda. I expected a lot from this film after \\"Titus\\" & I was not disappointed, other than I simply wish it had been longer with more of the play's dialogue. This was the same with \\"Prospero's Books\\", but to have this version is wonderful. I thought the scene of Ariel turning Prospera's heart to compassion was especially well done. Thank you Ms Taymor for another brilliant adaptation & I hope more to come!<br />BTW, this was not Shakespeare's last play as is so often said, since it sounds great for it to have been his swan song. He was still to write Henry VIII & The Two Noble Kinsman.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Really good for writing notes or ideas so u don't forget, beats using a regular notebook anyday of the week.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I work with those with varying disabilities. This movie is one of the most inspirational things I've seen since I've been watching movies. I now use it as training for all of my staff and as a motivator for those with disabilities that my agency serves. Whether you have a disability or not, work in this field or not, everyone should watch this movie at least one time in their lives. I've far surpassed that number myself.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|Now, I will never understand the need for a \\"digital copy\\" disc, and I don't really care. Picture and sound are great, as is to be expected of an HD-era produced movie made by people who care (enough) about \\"Trek\\" to do those elements right. The commentary is fine, sometimes, fun, occasionally informative, par for course. Disc 2 has bunches and bunches of extras...a decent enough selection.... people complain about how they are all listed out and not very organized, but I've never bought into the old \\"too many buttons/notes\\" complaint.<br /><br />Of the 11 Trek movies to date (2011), I rank this newest one somewhere in the middle of them, better than some and not even close to the quality of the classically good movies.<br />Good actors and characters? Check. Visual and sound effects? Off the charts, sometimes hyper-kinetic and obsessed w/flaring. The \\"new\\" Enterprise? Errr, interesting exterior design, a bit wobbly/chunky, and a sweet bridge. Music score? Nice enough. Humor and inside jokes? Plentiful.<br /><br />The plot? oh dear, the *plot*. Let's see: villain from the future of \\"our\\" timeline (the one that applies to most of the rest of the stories) goes back to change it. And he does -- all over the place, big-time, seemingly permanently. In other words, it seems that \\"Trek\\" will be living in and taking place in \\"this\\" timeline from now on. Wow. Usually, time-travel stories in Trek are cop-outs where our heroes fix everything to \\"how it's supposed to go.\\" Not so here. In some ways, this is good; the character Spock prime (\\"our\\"/original Spock, Leonard Nimoy) has to stay \\"here\\" in this altered TL and live/deal w/t consequences of same. Refreshing. Of course, Nero's actions/strategies are questionable, and it would be too easy to just blame his (the writers'?) sloppiness on insanity, obsession, or revenge-mania.<br /><br />And so, we're now living in a super-hyper, over-the-top version of \\"Trek.\\" Wow -- this could go either way: calming down and settling into even better \\"Trek\\" stories in this brave new galaxy; or zanily zapping itself in the foot so fast and furiously that there's quickly nothing of quality left. Whatever the case, at the rate Abrams & Co are getting to the next movie (not due til 2013 now), they'll be lucky to give this version of the crew two or three more movies.brave new galaxy; or zanily zapping itself in the foot so fast and furiously that there's quickly nothing of quality left.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I actually ordered this DVD for a friend's Christmas gift and was delighted to have received it in plenty of time.  My friend really wanted this and was thrilled.  I must borrow it since I have not seen it!  The price was very good & I do thank Amazon once again.
B00000E2VE|4.0|Make no mistake: this album features playing from outstanding musicians.  Gilels and the Amadeus Quartet play with vision and the utmost of clarity.  There's something wonderful about hearing musicians interact on an intimate level, and what chamber music is as delightful as Schubert's \\"Trout\\" Quintet\\"?  Certainly Gilels and the Amadeus Quartet understand each other, both having a pleasing richness in tone.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I acquired this disc after becoming familiar with Emanuel Ax and Yo-Yo Ma's recording of it with several of their friends.  (From now on, I'll refer to the two different interpretations as Gilels and Ax, respectively).  I was strongly pleased with that version, but thought that the Gilels deserved a listen as well.  And it certainly does.  Both interpretations are markedly different, Gilels favoring a more laid back approach.  Gilels is slower than Ax, taking 39 minutes to Ax's 37, but Gilels feels even slower than the comparative timings suggest.  Gilels seems to take a resigned approach, one that strikes me as being more suited to Brahms than Schubert.  Ax rides on the clouds, glorious and without a care in the world.  You have to smile listening to Ax, but Gilels can border on sounding ponderous.  Sound quality doesn't determine everything of course, but Sony's sonics on the Ax are out of this world; naturally Gilels' 70's analog isn't on the same level.<br /><br />In closing, this is a fine disc.  Personally I prefer Ax's sunnier lyricism to Gilels' resigned approach, but both are sure to please the listener.
006056251X|5.0|I re-read this story at least twice a year. I love the little \\"tangle-tongue\\" and the silver tongue's romance. It's something just so effervescent with this story. Go read it if your curious. I doubt it will be a disappointment.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am glad I bought this particular cover for my Kindle Fire.  I love my Kindle Fire and want to protect it as much as possible, and this cover was more economical.  I may upgrade to a more expensive model in the future; but for now, I am very pleased with this cover.  It is a nice cover for the price and serves the purpose well.
0545265355|4.0|I read these books on my sister's kindle and really liked them. The story is very entertaining and it was hard to put them down. I decided to buy them, but now I kind of wish that I had bought them in paperback. Its a great story but not a classic, and this particular set is quite large.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This set of DVD's was just the thing to make my son's Christmas.  The set has plastic swinging holders for each movie.  The case it self is very compact, so compact I couldn't believe all the movies were there! Video and Audio Quality are 10/10.  Wonderful gift for the Harry Potter fan or a way to introduce a new generation to its wonders.  Just make sure you have enough popcorn because it will be a marathon weekend!
B0063IH60K|5.0|You have to think ahead to play this game well. I am so happy it has a &quot;Redo&quot; button. I can rethink each move if I have to.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great game that never gets old.  you'll never want to put your kindle down when your playing this game.  this is a must have game
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome app love it!!!!!! This app helped me understand how the game was played. very addictive game and sure there are a few ads, but it really isn't that bad. I  recommend this app to everyone who has a kindle fire. cards are not too small they are just the right size.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the simplicity of this app, not a bunch of stuff going on. Information is timely and accurate. I can't think of any improvements I'd recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. Would recommend this to anyone who likes card games. If you like solitaire you will love this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. fun and challenging all at the same time. great for kids and adults of all ages. super fun!
0062073478|5.0|AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is Agatha Christie at her plot twisting best. In terms of public awareness of her work, it is right up there with MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. Over the years I've read this story a number of times & I'm still satisfied at the ending.<br /><br />A group of people, unknown to one another, have been gathered together by a mysterious host to his isolated island mansion. There is a man servant & his wife--and even they're not sure who hired them. Just as the motley assortment of guests get a few drinks in them, a weird, disembodied voice speaks. The voice tells the group (including the servant couple) he has proof positive that each one has gotton away with murder in the past. From there the mystery (and murders) begin.<br /><br />A plot device involves a collection of indian stauettes, each one representing a line in a nursey story. The guests begin to get knocked off in ways described in the rhyme--and after each murder is discovered, one of the figurines strangely disappears. All the guests start suspecting each other, and that's when the fun really begins.<br /><br />Can you guess who's the murderer?<br /><br />Let me tell you, it's...just kidding!<br /><br />NOTE: The comedy CLUE was obviously based on this story. It even includes a Miss Marple character who's slightly incontinent. The disembodied voice? TRUMAN CAPOTE! Who else?
0307959856|1.0|Both my spouse and I read this novel and we agreed (!) that the characters, including, or especially, Elizabeth and Darcy are lifeless and lacking in personality, and entirely too self satisfied with their prosperity and insulation from other people's problems, and possibly both more in love with Pemberley than with each other. Other people's lives are just a bit too messy for them, outside their perfect world.  We also agreed that the mystery is overcomplicated when it is finally explained, but still unconvincing and finally irrelevant. The sentences are long, shapeless, often sagging in the middle, and the wit is forced and artificial. We went through the motions of reading it; it would seem as if that was how it was written.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|To read some of the negative reviews here blows my mind.  What do you expect?  Envelopes full of cash?  As with all previous releases from Pink Floyd this set is first class all the way.  As a fan of the set Oh By The Way, to have this much to do with a single album release is awesome.  I truly hope this is done with every album in their catalog.  And I sincerely hope all the negative crap around this release doesn't keep that from happening.  Yes my release did come with a loose disc #4, and yes it was marred on the back but it plays fine.  The other three discs were hard as heck to get out so how EMI could predict that this was going to happen as some have accused is beyond me.  I feel that this set has such a feel of quality (heavy box, memoribilia enclosed in black envelopes, marbles shipped in bubble wrap, etc.) that people were surprised to find their discs loose in the bottom of the box.  I can just hope that was the case.  I won't go through a boring review of each disc, but I will say, if you are a fan you will be happy with this release and memorabilia.  If you are looking for gold marbles and a expensive thick wool scarf which alone would be a hundred bucks then you won't be.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of solitaire is smooth and complete. What's even better is that the adds are unobtrusive and do not get in the way of the game.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loved it.  Played through the whole game at least three times.  Lots of fun trying different strategies and getting the different achievements.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|For all the paranoid nutcases out there, and for all the ones that aren't so paranoid, you might want to take a step or two in that direction. This may be one of them cases of when, and not if this sort of thing could happen. Just think about how many people you come into contact with on a daily bases, and how many people they come into contact with.<br /><br />If you're looking for it be full of technical detail, it is not. I don't think you can get that into a two hour movie, and get anyone to watch it, other than a doctor, or somebody that actually understood all of the technical stuff. I've seen other reveiws nocking it for that reason, and I don't think that's what they were going for.<br /><br />It's more of the what if factor then anything. If this ever did happen, I don't think that anyone would really care how the CDC did its job, just that they do before whatever possible contagion wipes us all out.<br /><br />Take it for what it is. WHAT IF<br />It's interesting, and not to bad to watch, if you don't try to disect every little peice of it. If you have to do that, you may not like it.<br /><br />-Is it a go to movie? NO<br /><br />-Would I watch it again? yes<br /><br />-It's worth a rental. Which I did.<br /><br />-Would I buy it? Maybe when the price drops. Like I said, it's not a go to movie, so I can wait for the price to drop.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent little time waster.  not as responsive on some games but overall a decent app. you can look at all the instructions before you play each game, instructions are clear and concise.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Well this game is pretty entertaining, but some of the games are a little boring, a.d it would be nice to see a little description of the game you're buying before you buy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this a lot. the kids love it play it all the time. likebthe different games that are available.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Best purchase I made lately.  It's good to not have commercials and this show is fabulous.  Can't wait til season 5 is available.  Amazon is so easy to deal with. No problems at all.
B004ECDNJU|1.0|I honestly think this is a horrible game and u have to buy it but lucky I got it on game of the day but its so bad it shouldn't even be free you should probably get money back for this
0345479092|4.0|How can I give the title 4 starts, but also state it was \\"poorly done\\"? In style and substance, this book is fairly thin. Purely repetative anecdotes that begin to bore halfway through the book. The overall message of the book could have been easily fit into a ten-page pamphlet. One reviewer stated that the author doesn't say anything you can't learn from your Aunt Martha, and I agree. However, I give this book to all new mothers at baby showers. Why?<br /><br />The ten-page pamphlet message of the book changed everything about how I worked with my new daughter 10 years ago. Many of us don't have Aunt Martha's, mothers, or sisters nearby. Many of our friends have chosen to not have children. We never cared for a large family of siblings. We come into motherhood possibly more ignorant than any generation before us.<br /><br />The most important part of the book that worked for me was to study my baby's personal schedule and work with it. When she ate, when she was tired, how long she could stay awake before fussing. That was worth the price of admission. That one action clarified what she wanted and when she wanted it. There are one or two other significant points, but that's the one that changed everything for the positive with my new baby. With this book and a book on baby signing, my daughter's babyhood became infinitely easier.<br /><br />As for the breast-feeding controversy, I took it that she'd leave people to make their own choices and it would all work out in the end. Hardly the most significant part of the book IMO.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this on my kindle, blackberry, computers, and laptops. it syncs them all together which makes it easy to access from anywhere! It organizes the notes into notebooks so intonation is easy to navigate. I have notebooks for school, hobbies, journals, even a scrapbook of funny pics, audio clips, and text messages.THE best part is that I know its never going to get lost becase its wireless storage. all I have to do to access it is download evernote and log in. this is the most essential app on the market.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was ready to buy this book for my Kindle, when I read many of the reviews.  I was disappointed to see how many people recommended this as a hardback over the Kindle version.  I was just ready to order a hardback version when I decided to view the sample on my Kindle Fire.  The photographs look wonderful on this device--crisp and clear!  So, if you are lucky enough to own a Kindle Fire, consider getting this as an ebook rather than hardback.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

0061353248|1.0|Bought with great hopes to find out more about psychology in purchasing patterns, as well as decisions more generally speaking, and felt robbed.  The chapter titles all sound very profound and promise clear explanations with great depths, yet merely provide more than series of lengthy tests, over and over again, always carried out in the author's beloved MIT classroom.   The author painfully repeats himself in structure, and most readers would get tired of his \\"that was only the beginnig of our findings....\\". Besides, there are many, many, way too many repetitions, to the point that in some chapters I felt like I had gone to previous pages by accident.   After NOT really finding anything I was looking for, I also really disliked the pedagogic approach with a mix of the author's personal life in every test/sample. Mr. Author, please, be kind, provide us with a revised version that goes more straight to the point, ie cut 50% of your word count.  In a word: stick to research and publish articles, but please leave books to writers and novels to novelists...  Ironically, this book may teach you something: why you bought it...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it's the newest trend and i usually don't go for trends but this one is really cute and i cannot let it pass! really nice
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice way to pass time. easy to understand instructions. all in all a fun game. I would recommend this game to anyone
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston (self-titled debut):  This is a hit filled classic and it belongs in every decent rock collection (or you can just turn on the radio).  Five Stars.
0756686970|5.0|I had to purchase this book for my 7yr old because we borrowed one from the library and he has been carrying it around and reading it to no end for the past two weeks!  It is chock-full of so much information about every Lego Star Wars Minifigure, and the unique Han Solo Mini is a plus.  A welcome addition to our ever-growing Lego Star Wars library.
B000ASTEC2|5.0|John Lennon / Working Class Hero / The Definitive Lennon (2 CD Set):  John Lennon's output was spotty after the Beatles.  He has the Classic \\"Imagine\\" album, but even that album had tracks we could have done without.  This 2 CD set gives us Lennon's best Album cuts as well as the best non-album singles.  Even those who own a few of Lennon's best albums will be able to appreciate this set.  This is a superior 2 CD compilation, expertly organized, and it serves as a fine remembrance of his best music.  This one earns Five Stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games I couldn't wait to read this.  I read it in 2 days.  Couldn't put it down.  I cant wait to read the 3rd book in this trilogy.
B000001EL3|3.0|Kiss / Destroyer:  This is just an ok album but it's fun to listen to this silliness once in a while.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this down! My daughter is also reading this and loves it as well!  Great book for teen girl or her mother.
B00005JA2B|4.0|Kansas / Leftoverture:  This one has their breakthrough hit \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", and the rest of the album is good, enjoyable, and a solid Four Star effort.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Excellent. Thought provoking. Very good graphics. Quick response to manual input. Addictive and lots of fun. Good alternative version of solitaire.
B000002J27|5.0|Genesis / A Trick of the Tail (1994 - Definitive Edition Remaster CD):  Despite the departure of Peter Gabriel, Genesis continues their Progressive Rock artistry with this wonderful album (although the elements are already evident for their transition into a Pop hits group).  This album is a delight.  Five Stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great deal!!!! has lots of games and they are all pretty fun. really love earning more points to unlock more games
B0000009SM|4.0|Frank Zappa / The Mothers of Invention / One Size Fits All:  This is a good album from FZ and crew and it has the classic \\"San Ber'dino\\" track.  Four Stars
B000YABIQ6|4.0|I sat down to watch ONE episode of this much discussed series. I ended up watching the whole first season (not recommended). It is relentlessly compelling, it is slavish as to period detail (and I would know, I was about 6 at the time that this series is set in), it is very well made, atmospheric in extreme and so attentively constructed that I should have loved every minute of it.<br /><br />For those who are familiar with the term \\"film noir\\" then this is TV noir, and noir it is. One can be pulled into the very complex lives of each character yet not care about them in the least, save perhaps the secretary Peggy and I guess Don Draper and his Grace-Kelly-lite wife. (Both are so well played that to call it acting is a disservice to their efforts, they ARE these people, it is quite astonishing).<br /><br />Much as Miami Vice was once a standout production (sound, costume, location, intriguing protagonists, some unexpected ones like Edward James Olmos, who MADE that whole show even have credibility) I suspect Mad Men is a similar quantity for today's overwhelmed viewer. I came from the advertising community, though not circa 1960!, and I can vouch for the attitudes and manner of Draper and coworkers, but it takes their careers and intermeshes into their personal character to such an extent as to be problematic. One of Draper's finest observations, and I won't give away any of the narrative plotlines, is when he muses how the younger generation has no one to look up to, just \\"us\\" meaning Draper and his incredibly flawed business partners, clients and neighbors.<br /><br />You want to care about them but it is darn near impossible. I did really take to the department store side line, Menckens, both father and daughter, but to say more is to give it away.<br /><br />Worth watching for the delightful care and nurturing of this project, the people behind the writing and production are superb!
B000001FN3|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project / Tales of Mystery and Imagination, Edgar Allan Poe (The 1987 CD with added elements):  This Progressive Rock gem was made even better when Parsons added Orson Wells voice to it as well as some added synthesizer elements to the original recordings.  Alan Parsons wrote \\"... I am convinced that `Tales' has become a better album...\\".  It's not only better, but hugely improved.  The 1987 version is the one to own (if you can find it).  Five Stars
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I bought this for my son and his new Blu-Ray and 55 inch TV. I got to watch episodes IV and V before we returned to Fla. The detail was great. Episodes IV, was the 1st Star Wars we saw in London England when it first came out. I felt almost like I was again in the big screen movie house in the days of old.
B000056VJ7|4.0|Meatloaf / Bat out of Hell:  Who said Rock N Roll had to be serious?  Certainly not Meatloaf: a guy who can make schlock-Rock a fun experience.  This ain't great stuff, it's just fun stuff and it's just good enough to earn Four Stars.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|nice app and concept but alot of bugs. 32 days in jan? after initial sync succeeded once now it fails every time to sync. needs an update to fix bugs
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones (self-titled - 8 bonus tracks): The Ramones played um fast, like a Punk Rocker should, and we have a lot of fun listening to them.  If you don't like Punk Rock, don't buy the album, if you do like Punk Rock, this one is indispensible (There are at least a dozen reviewers on this page that were too stupid to figure that one out)!  Five Feakin' Stars!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm not the type to leave lenghty reviews but I'll do my best to describe my opinions thoroughly. I've read many books in my lifetime but none quite like this. I've never read an entire trilogy that I couldn't put down during each and every book. It was so entertaining and alluring! It read really fast and played out like a movie in my head without any glitches. Put it to ya this way, I read all 3 books in less than 6 days!! I was actually quite sad when it was all over. It's very easy to get lost in. For those of you who read the \\"details\\" about the book before you buy, even if it sounds like something you wouldn't be interested in...read it anyways!! Trust me, you won't regret it! Oh, and don't let the trailor for the upcoming movie shy you away either, even though to me it looks like it's going to be a great flick, the book will guide you into the story rather smoothly. Also, don't waste your time buying each book seperatly because once you read the first, you will immediatly want the 2nd and 3rd at your fingertips! Enjoy! (Please pardon my spelling errors, if any).
B00005NMVP|4.0|Al Stewart / Year of the Cat: The Title track is Al's biggest hit and it is indeed a great song.  The rest of the album however is good (if disjointed), but nowhere near the quality of his previous three albums.  Four Stars
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So easy to use! I love it! It is easy to download offline versions. I just wish you could use plans offline
B002OT730K|5.0|The Rolling Stones / Love You Live:  This is an excellent document on the Rolling Stones Live in the mid 1970's.  This is a Rocker.  This one is fun.  Is it the `best concert ever', well NO.  It is the best release of the Stones of that period, well gee, yes it is!  There is still more than enough great stuff on this set to earn it Five Stars.  I do have to wonder about these self proclaimed `ultimate Stones fans' who are determined to convince you that The Stones can't play live!  Ignore those idiots and have a great time with this double album.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|2nd day &amp; won't sync. Says it has, but it clearly has not. Won't indent for sub tasks like google tasks. I'll stick with gtask, thanks.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith / Horses (bonus track):  \\"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine\\", with those attention-grabbing words Patti Smith introduces herself and her band as the tortured poetic souls of the Punk era.  Beat poet meats Garage Band in the 1970's.  The Patti Smith Group sounded more profound than they really were, but the sound was great, and the words were evocative.  This is a Masterpiece.  Five Stars.
030788743X|5.0|...yep, I really dislike video games. Mostly because I'm terrible at them, and I blame this lack of skill on the fact that my parents gave me a pile of books for Christmas the year I asked for a Super Nintendo. And, while I was born in the 80s, I was a little kid and didn't consume the various media Cline references throughout the book.<br /><br />All of this is to say that you absolutely don't need to be a video game enthusiast to love this book. You also needn't have lived through - and remembered - every pop-cultural phenomenon that happened in the 80s.<br /><br />I'll admit that the description of the book made me reluctant to pick it up - but it got such rave reviews on Amazon that I had to see what the fuss was about.<br /><br />Cline manages to write about two topics that are pretty vague to me - video games and 80s pop culture - in a way that makes me appreciate his insight. The majority of the story takes place in a virtual world known as the OASIS, and I was worried Cline would bog me down with unending technical descriptions of how things worked (that's usually one of my pet peeves with science fiction or futuristic writing). Instead, he wove information about how the games worked into the narrative, never providing too much or too little detail.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a great page-turner. It's a somewhat typical hero's journey at its core, but imagined in a way that makes the story fresh and exciting. You'll want to stay up all night reading.<br /><br />Some of the more critical reviews seem to complain that Cline spends too much time explaining his references, so if you're an 80s pop-culture buff or video game expert, you might feel differently about the book. But if you're an unenlightened plebe like me, give it a shot - I predict you'll feel a somewhat embarrassing urge to try out Dungeons & Dragons after you finish.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac / Greatest Hits (1988 release):  The Best of Fleetwood Mac can only be found in the Peter Green blues based Fleetwood Mac band (none of which can be found in this CD).  This CD contains the post Peter Green Pop group hits.  However, to give this pop group its due, this is a fantastic collection of songs.  This hits CD is all I want, and all I will ever need, from this era of Fleetwood Mac, but it is a Five Star collection.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Excellent movie with lots of high packed action and creative fighting scenes. This is one of those movies that didn't make it to the big screen but should have. There's a few comedy skits depending on your sense of humor. Christian Bale is very handsome. I thought Taye Diggs role was smug, but his overall performance was good.
B000002JSN|4.0|Led Zeppelin / Physical Graffiti:  This double LP (CD) is good.  With a little restraint, this could have been a great single album.  There are some absolutely classic songs on this release, and there is some not-so-hot stuff on it as well.  However, the album is enjoyable, it's just that we were expecting more from a LZ double album and what we got was an album with a lot of outtakes included.<br /> Four Stars.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a fun game. Hate the ads. I can't complain to much because it was free. I spend a lot of time playing.
B000002GVO|5.0|Eagles / Hotel California:  This is Eagles most popular album and it deserves to be so, as it is their best album.  It's not a Masterpiece, but it is good enough to rate Five Stars.
B001DMJAN2|5.0|This is my favorite box set from Rod Stewart.  Well packaged...convienent. Fits beautifully on a bookshelf...well protected 4 discs.  Has all the songs I wanted.  Sound crispy clear.  I have purchased a few of this box set for gifts.  The song People Get Ready  with Jeff Beck is here as well as Passion, I Was Only Joking, Downtown Train, Hot Legs and Maggie May  ect.  I have not been disappointed.  But most of these songs are Rod's basic radio charmers.  db
B0063IH60K|4.0|if you are a computer gamer. this solitare directly represents that. its a relaxing game for all ages. for some it may be addicting so be careful. haha. (:
B00632HWOG|5.0|works great if you cant see all your emails flip your kindle upright or sideways what ever works for you.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|This film has aspects for everyone as well as an extreme neon color palette painting a unique fantasy authentic world where 'speed racing' really exists in all it's cartoony styled glory.   This film is infused by great acting, kung-fuing & swash buckling speed races, humour, intrigue, heart, satire as well as plain tongue in cheek fun.   The Wachowski Directors surely are some of the best at creating anime type action fantasy adventures in live action films, if not the best or only ones, doing it at this type of level.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Whether on my iphone or my kindle fire, the Teamviewer app is amazingly useful. Why the hell is there a minimum word count for reviews? It only causes people to load them with filler; much like this. TEAMVIEWER, great work!
B0063IH60K|5.0|one of the absolute funniest games. so addicting :] everyone I know loves this game! it keeps me entertained for hours and hours
B004JK61K0|5.0|Yes what i needed exactly!! Hands down top dog. lots of confiig options. multiple email accounts easily manageable. is compatible with all major email services.  For me this worked where the built-in app failed to connect!  hope this review helps someone.  I do hate the icon.
B004YKB52O|5.0|Got this for my husband for one of his Christmas presents and he just absolutely loves it. He has been listening to it over and over and over for the past 2 weeks now. I must say that I really like this cd myself. :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a nice reliable app.On the Kindle Fire it stays active all the time so you always have an accurate forecast. Also, keeps you updated on severe weather warnings.
B0051MKMNC|2.0|Great Movie - BUUUUUUUT I would not buy this crappy Blu Ray Disc!  Ususally when you watch a movie you can SKIP the previews - Not in this one!  They force you to watch the 10-20min of previews everytime u put it in before you get to the menu!  No skipping them whatsoever!  What if I want to watch this 5, 10 years down the road?  Id have to watch these old ass previews??  HATE THAT!!  Also, every time I watch this and it gets to the part where he is cleaning his apartment after taking NZT for the first time THE SOUND SHUTS OFF!!!  WTF??  If I rewind it back then the sound comes back on.  This happens every time I watch it!  HEY - YOU DONT WANT PEOPLE TO PIRATE MOVIES??  Quit selling CRAP!
B005SJIP2S|5.0|Highly reccomend this cd. The band sounds tight and it has a good song selection. No overdubs were used on the cd so it sounds as if your at the show. To all who don't like it...move on. This is now YES. Get over it.
B005ZUR724|4.0|It works, I'm in a guild and its fun. docked a star for slow support but hey enjoy the 99c deal while u can.
0062082353|5.0|First things first:<br /><br />Thank you for your AND your wife's sacrifice that y'all made for this country....and for my (our) freedom.<br /><br />The book is a fascinating and personal look at the type lives that many of our service men and women live.<br /><br />I found it to be a very inspirational book. It exposes human hearts as they go through the sacrifice that is war and life. The love that binds a man and a woman. The reality of war, the bravery of our service men and women. The ability to overcome opposition.<br /><br />We owe you a debt that we can never truly repay.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is just like what you find on your computer, but with a few fun extras.  Very addictive and entertaining. Can't beat it for the price!
B004LWZW4W|3.0|The movie overall was OK.  It was very slow and uneventful for the majority until the very end.  The last 10 minutes was the only good part of the entire movie.  I would never spend 24 bucks for the blu ray and digital copy.  Totally not worth it.  Maybe 10 bucks at best..
0689835604|5.0|Baby is only 4 months and already loves this book. Her eyes light up with every flap and she has started trying to lift the flaps herself. The graphics and bold colors keep her attention, and her smiles and giggles force me to read it again and again and again.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This movie is exactly as I remembered it. A pure classic that always creates a smile for me. The music and storyline stay with me long after the credits ended. The casting is super, although I was not fond of seeing Steve Martin castes as the dentist. All in all  it's a genuine pleasure to watch again and again!
0375812024|5.0|I read Scarry's few books when I was little but didn't understand what all about each of those books and I am deaf.  I liked some of those Scarry books.  I ordered that book for my grandnephew as his Christmas present from me.  He haven't read it yet cuz he's 3 and left it on the couch in our living room.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This is not only one of the best sports movies ever, it's one of the best movies that I've watched in a long time. I'm astounded Warrior didn't make a ton of money. In a word, it's fantastic. And you don't need to be an MMA fan to enjoy it either. That's just a bonus, IMO. Tom and Joel were simply fabulous. And Nolte was heartbreakingly good. As a child of an alcoholic, it was easy to relate to the boys and made it all more real. The time flew by and we didn't want it to end. There's something for everyone in Warrior...Highly recommended.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Spoiler Alert!  Spoiler Alert!    I love Sherlock Holmes, the original Doyle stories, the many pastiches, and the many movies and TV versions.  But this one was hard to love because there was so much in the way of the actual Sherlock Holmes story.  I never saw Holmes or Watson, only these famous movie stars about whom I know far too much personal stuff.  I watched them acting, not the characters.  Irene Adler was misplayed as a cute ingenue rather than as somebody very serious.  How about Sharon Stone or Cate Blanchett?  Watson's Mary Morston had the too-smooth face of a Barbie doll, and supposedly Holmes hadn't met her before, when she actually had met them both on a case.  At least she wasn't perky like their Irene Adler.  The secondary cast seemed like the usual suspects from various Masterpiece Theaters.  The too-many fight scenes went on and on and on.  Holmes definitely preferred to outwit his actual opponents, not beat up the same minor thugs repeatedly.  If we were going to watch fights with the giant repeatedly, couldn't we have given him a real role and character?  The special effects were definitely snazzy, and called so much attention to themselves that they distracted from the story and the characters.  The shipyard scene was almost funny, as was the scene on the bridge.  The magic mumbo jumbo and the science mumbo jumbo were similarly tedious and overstressed, and the usual evil-taking-over-the-world plot is so hackneyed.  If you want to make Sherlock Holmes a superhero, fine, but remember that his superpower is *deduction* of some complicated and subtle murder.    The extras were pretty humdrum -- the usual self-congratulatory chat with the director (oooh, Madonna's former husband!), production people, and the major stars.  So why did I give it three stars?  Downey and Law are lovely to look at, their London is beautiful and gritty, even though much of it looks fake, and I just adore even the suggestion of Sherlock Holmes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this app its a lot of fun and fills my time the games are new and exciting and these are games i have never played be for
B006J8990Y|4.0|CONTAGION is an important film for the general public to see. It addresses the etiology of contagious diseases, how they begin, how they are introduced in to the world population, how they can be viewed as instances of germ warfare, how they are examined by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, how they are disseminated, the processes required for creating a vaccine, how the treatments are managed, how individuals are affected both directly and indirectly, who decides the priorities of treating large number of people around the globe, and how in the face of a world crisis certain evil people can take advantage of the fear and make millions off unsuspecting terrified people. Yes, this information is in articles readily available for public consumption, but nothing surpasses a well-written film for getting the message across in a memorable way. Writer Scott Z. Burns produced the script and Steven Soderbergh mold this story with great skill. The cast is filled with major actors but in a film of this size few of them are given much screen time.<br /><br />Interestingly the film begins with the marker 'Day 2' and the significance of that move is held until the film's satisfying end. Beth Emhoff (Gweneth Paltrow) is returning home form a business trip in Hong Kong, has a layover in Chicago where she calls her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) informing him of the delay. She arrives home ill and son is dead form a seizure disorder brought on by encephalitis - and infection of unknown type that has spread to her brain. Soon after her death her son dies leaving Mitch terrified by the unknown disease. The US Center for Disease control is headed by Dr. Cheever (Lawrence Fishbine) who engages Dr Mears (Kate Winslet) and Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) and Dr. Sussman (Elliott Gould) to investigate the disease. The World Heath Organization represented by Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) becomes involved as the point of origin of the disease seems to be Hong Kong: her attempt to help the Chinese is at first assisted by young Sun Feng (Chin Han) until the Chinese forces decide to hold her hostage until the vaccine can be sent to save a province in China. As the contagious disease is studied, identified, and a vaccine becomes available some smarmy people such as 'journalist' Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) goes on the internet blogging the use of forsythia as the cure, bilking millions of dollars around the world for his fake cure. The story is both catastrophic and immediate as Soderbergh intentionally develops personal stories to demonstrate how a severe contagious disease can impact both throngs of peoples and individuals as well.<br /><br />The supporting cast is filled with fine actors and the momentum of the story is almost intolerable fast. Steven Soderbergh provides his own cinematography and the electrifying musical score is by Cliff Martinez. This is a fine cinematic accomplishment and one that should be seen by every citizen in the world - for many reasons.

B0058VW36U|5.0|No problems on kindle fire and great graphics.It's a great puzzel game for all ages and I highly recommend this to people.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|had lots of different games and was just awesome.over all. get it for fun hours on end. you wont b dissapointed
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun to play but there are better games out there. hit the question mark to figure out how you play each one first though
B004SBQGHS|5.0|i love this game sooooooooooo much and i think its great that they made it without adds. it is soooooooooo much fun and i really love it and the people who created it!!!!
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|The picture is what I ordered and I didn't receive that, they sent me something totally differant,not happy at all...
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I've created an SSB for Google Calendars on my MacBook Pro.  Any to-dos I create there, or with this wonderful app, AUTOMATICALLY sync together.  ...currently I'm using a Droid X and a XOOM.  There are a few bugs, nothing that has prevented me from being able to use the app (just oddities with the number of days in a given month, things like that - nothing that can't be fixed).<br /><br />I can't seem to scroll through my to-dos on the widget with my Droid X (even though the Droid X supports scrolling widgets).  Hopefully an update will fix this, otherwise I'm very very very pleased.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I tried to download the wifi connector but it never loaded.  Very ambiguous to say the least.  I wish I could totally use this app.  It would be great if it really worked on the Kindle Fire.  But all I use this for is   to see signal strengths.  I want to connect to them not just see them.  ,
1439102813|4.0|Overall the author really draws the reader into this book. She does a very thorough job of addressing the multiple aspects involved with this diagnosis. I found the manner in which she changes her writing to reflect the progression of the disease to be very effective. I do, however, feel that the book needs a stronger epilogue. The ending drifts into the epilogue as if it was just another chapter. I suspect the unfinished feeling was intended to mimic the experience of the person affected by this condition. Nonetheless, from an entertainment standpoint, I did not appreciate it.   With the ending caveat, I would recommende this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I could sit and play this for hours on my kindle fire....great time waster and this app is as explained.  you have to play to earn points and have to beat a high score on some to unlock more games.  I see this as a challenge and I dont get bored playing the same game over and over.  I thoroughly enjoy this app and there are plenty of ways to gain bonus points!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Runs great on my kindle fire! love the graphics and variety of seasonal backgrounds.  Fun &amp; addicting:) Ads are not a problem and do not restrict game play....and it's free!!
B00004RFCM|5.0|This item I had gotten used, and I opened it and loved it! I checked the case and DVD and nothing wrong......  There is 2 disc's. Aprox. 240 min of Pure Sex and the city! It is a amazing story from beggining to end.
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|I swim 5 days a week for about an hour doing just laps. After about 6 months of swimming 5 days a week I have to stop every lap and spit the water out that has been leaking in through where the mouth piece and snorkel meet. Not a big problem but its kind of annoying. I would definitely not use this if I was training for a triathlon since there is a HUGE difference between swimming with a snorkel and without one and your form will be dramatically different. There is another snorkel that is made by Finis that filters the water that is accumulated in the mouth piece out through the bottom of the mouth piece which would alleviate having to stop and spit the water out, this is the snorkel that will be replacing my current one when this one is no longer serviceable.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|I found Plex when I was searching for ways to stream media from my home server to my Kindle Fire, and I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon it. Prior to this I had been using a pretty clumsy, technically-intensive system for streaming my content to my laptop when I was away from home, so Plex was a welcome upgrade from that. I had a little trouble connecting to my sever at first (not resolving my dyndns URL properly for some reason) but was able to connect pretty easily once I set up a Plex account. The android app works very well on my Fire and Droid Pro, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Plex also has a Roku channel (making my Roku purchase from just a few days earlier that much better!) There are still some bugs here and there, but this is light years beyond anything else I've tried. For anyone looking into a solution for streaming media from a home server - Plex is the way to go!
B005M2V2K8|4.0|Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for a stuffed animal. However, I just wanted to note that the pink on the cat's ears, nose, eyes and tail appears very bright as pictured here - and I checked it on my phone and another computer as well to make sure it wasn't just the color settings on my monitor - but in reality the pink is more soft and pale. Not a big deal, really - just that my 6 year old was slightly disappointed and kept asking if we could send it back and get the \\"right\\" one.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|As advertised, good product with good customer care. Easy to set up and. use. Not an ipod but still very happy with product.
B004W4N55C|5.0|similar to other online formats. easy to change keys and great quicklinks to show chord shapes.  Got it for free but would pay for it.
B000V86OKG|2.0|Maybe I'm just over Dexter at this point, but I found this season to be dreadfully boring. Not only that, but the anxiety I felt episode after episode, awaiting Dexter's capture (or not) was neither fun or healthy. Goodbye sweet Dexter, I will miss you.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is not bad, i liked a lot of the games but some of the games are a little cheezy.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|After two weeks od using it, the plastic looses painting. I didn't use so much the Kindle Fire but the protector has laready loose some of the painting in the edges. On the other hand, it is strong and protects the Kindle.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game, quick response on the kindle fire. I've had no issues or bugs thus far. multiple deal options available.
0545265355|5.0|COULDNT FIND THE BOX SET ANYWHERE, AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE AND CAME REALLY FAST. BOOK ONE IS SO GOOD FINISHED IN 8 HOURS. BOOK 2 WAS REALLY GOOD TOO AND BOOK THREE I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE END BUT OVER ALL A GREAT READ. CANT WAIT UNTIL AMRCH 23 FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

B005HSL626|5.0|this app.is awesome I love it it would be way better if I didnt have to hide it from my parents.
B003L77GH4|5.0|SO I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS SERIES I WATCHED THE PILOT WHEN IT FIRST AIRED AND NEVER WATCHED IT AGAIN. THEN MY BEST FRIEND SAID SHE LOVES IT 2 YEARS LATER I BOUGHT SEASON 1 ON BLACK FRIDAY, SLOW IN THE FIRST EPISODES SEEMS REPETITIVE BUT YOU SHOULD DEF, GIVE IT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND FINISH SEASON 1. I WATCHED IT ALL IN 2 DAYS WAS OFFICIALLY HOOKED ORDERED SEASON 2 THROUGH AMAZON IT CAME SUPER FAST. HAD MY DAD HIDE IT UNTIL FINALS WERE OVER THEN WATCHED IT ALL IN 48 HOURS. WATCH IT~! ITS BETTER THEN TWILIGHT. AND THE EFFECTS ARE PRETTY GOOD. LOVE THE ACTORS, MICHAEL TREVINO IS HOT, AND ELENA IS NOT AS ANNOYING AS BELLA.
1594202842|2.0|I enjoyed reading the first part of the book. I  realized the author  wanted the best for her children.   By the time I got 60% through the book I started to think-this is too much for anyone.   I grew up in an immigrant family.  I was told to work (study) hard and I did in school not just for myself but to please my parents. I also was not allowed sleepovers and fooling around in malls.   But I made it through as did my brother both of us becoming  successful  in medicine and dentistry.   but I doubt I could have studied academics in childhood and as an adolescent  and  take on simultaneously  the grind of learning an instrument to perfection   We both loved music and practiced our instruments -but it was for fun -to make us well rounded.   Our parents did not demand academic excellence and musical virtuosity in equal measure. If they had we would have \\"flipped out\\".   I admire the tenacity and bravery of the author's children and I wish them well. I know deep down they love their mother.
B003L77G06|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES AND THERE IS A JOKE FOR EVERYONE. AMAZON HAD A REALLY GOOD PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING. GAVE THIS AS A X-MAS PRESENT AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO WED NIGHTS BECAUSE MODERN FAMILY IS ON.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This video was bought for my FIL, it arrived within two days purchased with Prime! He loved the gift and has enjoyed watching the video over!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|great seller, fast shipping, good price. very pleased with transacation. will do business again. super dvd pack, my daughter is in heaven. thanks
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Enjoyable game, wouldn't spend money to buy but is def a time passer.  I like the variety and most of the games are addictive. overall glad only so many games unlock as realistically who could play that many games at once. gives it a challenge
B0054JZC6E|4.0|do far do good the response time on the kindle is good and the games are fun I'm glad I bought this game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|loved Quell and this is a great followup with new features adding just the right twist.  well done, Fallen Tree!
B003HOXLE8|3.0|I needed the lesson files for a class as well. Luckily, I found them.  So, the instructions for finding the lesson files are wrong: start at the cover, turn to page two, and you'll find the Peachpit URL for the lesson files. It doesn't work all that well searching \\"Where are the Lesson Files?\\" or scrolling to the end (as the URL is about 6000 locations in the opposite direction).  I'm giving this product 3 stars because while I finally got what I was looking for, it took me forever to actually do it (given the poor instructions).
B0042J6VUS|2.0|My Sprint HTC Evo (4g I think) BARELY fit into the part where the phone goes. One could easily break it trying to shove an Evo in there which leaves me to believe that this is not made for an Evo so the description is slightly misleading. Also, this thing cannot hold up a phone vertically as shown in the picture without tipping over. I was able to get it to stand up perfectly only when the phone was in the tripod horizontally as in parallel to the surface the tripod was standing on. I also assumed that I could extend the height, but that's my fault for assuming. Not too bad for what I paid, but I wish I would've spent a little more on something else.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I love this Mahjong game.  The only issue is that after I play the games for about 20 minutes, the game I am playing closes on its own.  Sometimes when I try to open to play the game it wants me to turn on the internet connection.  I turn it off and back on and I get the game.  Not sure why this is happening.  I too would rate a 5 star if it would stop doing these things.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|There just isn't enough to this app. I've seen better ones on my android phone, but I haven't seen any good ones for my Fire yet. It's really not worth purchasing.
B00003CX8U|5.0|This movie has haunted me since I first saw it many years ago when it first hit theaters. Heady, hectic, wry, dramatic, funny and touching, it is a truly unique musical.
1419701533|5.0|Great gift idea for elementary age kids. Got this set for Christmas and it was a hit! I highly recommend.
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope is a fun game. it starts off easy but after a little while the game gets more challenging and fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|U will never have to purchase a Bible again! Every translation u need is here in one app for free.
0765322889|3.0|I bought this book for my girlfriend and it turns out the copy was missing 35 pages in the middle of the book...Kind of a big deal.
0385737955|2.0|Well I read it and I thought it was ok for a read when you're bored. Honestly I saw this book several times in the store and passed it because it sounded boring summary wise. I loved the summary for the third book, it sounded fast paced and made me want to read the series but as it turns out the majority of the book is just Thomas running around being very perfect.    He is dropped into a strange environment and doesn't panic. The entire plot of the book is carried by a comatose girl who, when awake, doesn't bother to tell anyone but Thomas what she remembers. The concept of the maze was intriguing but the character development killed that. According to the Thomas, everyone in the glade are named after intelligent people of the past and you're telling me none of the people who run the maze could have figured out the code.    Overall the entire book was an ok read. If your expectations are low you would not be disappointed but if you expect a fast pasted well written science fiction novel put this book back. It might get better in the sequels but I wouldn't count on it.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is so much fun, and entertaining!! you also have other options of games and you hear puss talk :) its really cute!..and extra lives!!:D
0920668372|1.0|We received this book as a hand me down, I read it once and hid it (until I can donate it somewhere) so it never get read again to my children. I completely agree with creepy. There is nothing else I can say that the other one star reviews have not covered.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|I really like Coldplay, but this album, just doesn't speak to me, it feels like an album to produce sales, but not something that i will likely be playing next year, will be replaced, hopefully they come out with something better next time
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I biught this as audio book.  Enjoy Tina Fay's voice reading it to me, makes it funnier.  All around good time.  My husvlband liked it as well.
1419702238|5.0|My daughter jumped right into this book the second she opened the gift.  Shipped fast and in great condition.  Great deal too.  Thanks Amazon.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app. it tells me so much and I can plan my whole week. it may not be the official weather channel app like on my phone but it is still really handy. I like that you can change you color scheme too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Quick and fun! Hard to put down. Should have a quick tutorial before each game, not just the &quot;?&quot; option. But still very very fun.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Great product.  My one year old went for rides with me all summer in this seat.  I have a crusing bike that this atached to with no problem.  It won't attach to my husbands road bike, but I knew that before I purchased it.  It was easy for me to install with a few basic tools and doesn't get in my way while riding.  You do have to ride with your knees slightly out, but not much.    I love that I can watch my son while I am riding.  He asks to go for bike rides all the time.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|got it for my dad for xmas and he really enjoys it, if you like nickelback get it , its a great cd
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ive made it far and enjoy it. offers games that are just hard snug to take time but.not too difficult. I think they are all really fun
0375850864|5.0|Although I've loved most of my experiences with Newbery novels, reading too many of them close together can make them all start to blend together. Because so many of them are a coming of age story, focusing on a young or boy learning to deal with whatever hardships life has dealt them, some of the details begin to merge together creating a giant Newbery read instead of the individual books.<br /><br />Although some stories have a tendencies to run together, there are some which are a such a w original idea, completely unique unto themselves that they demand that you remember them individually. When You Reach Me by Re Stead is one such story.<br /><br />This book is brilliant. I might repeat that again, because I can't think of a better word to describe the story (unless I'm just going to stick with basically amazing.) I can't imagine the flow charts, timelines and diagrams Stead must have used to create this book. Everything within the story is connected, but nothing feels contrived. Too many times in stories where plot lines overlap and characters connect in unexpected ways, the coincidences become too much and too unrealistic for the necessary suspension of disbelief, and it lessens the enjoyment of the story, because I can't believe any of that would actually happen. When You Reach Me offers no such feeling. It is simply an 11 year old  girl trying to come to terms with a life changing experience.<br /><br />Miranda (Mira) is our main character and her voice is strong. Throughout the book, Mira is struggling to determine her place in a world that is suddenly different from what she had always known her world to be. Her best (and only) friend no longer wants anything to do with her, there is a 'crazy-shaped person' living on their corner who sleeps with his head under the mailbox, and (the most disconcerting and unsettling of all) she begins finding letters within her things, asking for assistance from an unknown, unnamed source who seems to know things before they happen. Mira's mind is practical and she finds it very difficult to accept many of these new changes. I love that we are able to watch and listen as Miranda's mind broadens as she learns to accept the changes within her life.<br /><br />One of the complaints I had with this book the first time I read it was the desire to know more about some of the periphery characters. While that is still true to a degree, after the second read through I decided Stead's way was better, especially with Marcus. I believe Marcus is one of my new favorite literary characters. He is just so individual and he lives by such a different set of rules without ever really acknowledging that his way is any different, any more right or wrong, than anyone else's. Although I would love to know more about Marcus and the other great characters in Stead's novel, it is a selfish desire to know everything about everything, not something her novel is actually missing.<br /><br />I refuse to go into too many details here, because this is one book that it would be a shame to spoil. Knowing too much about this book the first time you read it ruins some of its magic. There is so much depth to this story, so much wonder and it is definitely one you must discover on your own. I believe that the brilliance of this story comes from its simple comp ties. Those are what make it such a magnificent first time read, but allows you to enjoy the story more each time you read it. The story is simple enough to appeal to the younger audience it was written for while also being complex enough to not only appeal to s and the older children, but also complex enough to withstand multiple readings. I re-read this book just the other day, about two months after my first read through, and I found myself noticing much that I missed the first time through, and enjoying it just that much more.<br /><br />This book was nothing short of fantastic and managed to hit upon the perfect degree of interest. It left me wanting more of the story and more of the characters, but what I was given filled all the empty places. It was everything it needed to be.lled all the empty places. It was everything it needed to be.
0312641893|4.0|A beautifully reimagined fairytale, Cinder proves to us how certain core fictional elements never fail to engross and enchant while also intriguing us with the intricacies of a completely new world ripe with new technologies and new problems. Much like she does with our cyborg protagonist, Ms. Meyer takes certain familiar aspects of the Cinderella tale and adds pieces and parts to it to create a fascinating hybrid, a blending of recognizable and foreign plot elements that keeps us glued to the pages despite our basic knowledge of how things will play out. There are so many additional layers to the rags-to-riches storyline of the original fairytale-the tension between Prince Kai and Cinder so much more palpable, the threat of discovery and the subsequent repercussions so much greater, and Cinder's past so much darker and murkier--that our memories of everything we loved about the version that came before this are overshadowed by a potent desire to see where this new version will take us.  Though Cinder has had a rough past and exists as a servant in a home where she should be an equal, she never elicits a sympathetic response from us, instead earning our outright respect for the way she handles herself against those who seek to tear her down. She never whines over her predicament nor does she meekly accept her circumstances as law, always dealing with what fate hands her in a way that makes us sit up a little straighter and hold our chins up in her honor, infinitely proud and envious of her strength. The formation of a bond with Cinder is smooth and easy, our emotional attachment to her growing with each page even as the weight of all the secrets she's keeping both from Prince Kai and her family sits heavier and heavier on our chests, dread for the moment when all her perceived undesirable differences are made public wrapping around our hearts with ice cold fingers as we find ourselves pulled fully into her story.  The relationship between Cinder and Kai is refreshingly sweet and slow-moving, sparks crackling back and forth between them on more than just a romantic level as secrets from Cinder's previously muddled past are revealed, ratcheting up the forbidden nature of merely a royal/commoner pairing and turning it into something else--something darker and more intense--entirely. Though some of the discoveries regarding Cinder's identity and her history before being adopted at age eleven are easily predictable, it doesn't diminish our enjoyment in the least, instead our early deduction only gives us more time to think of what it means for her in general as well as for her and Kai specifically, thus adding a whole new level of tension that would have been noticeably absent had the big reveal toward the end been more startling.  Overall, Cinder is a strong start to the Lunar Chronicles series, Ms. Meyer creating a very memorable version of Cinderella with her own unique stamp evident on each and every page. The only minor nitpick would be it starts just a touch slow, the introduction of New Beijing, the plague crippling it, and Cinder's relationship to her difficult family taking a while to unfold to the point where we can settle in, pull the parameters of this new world around us and let ourselves experience Cinder's increasingly complicated life. The ending is neither cliffhanger nor neatly-wrapped package, instead leaving us with a lot to think about and anticipate without driving us to the brink of madness, and we close the back cover with a smile and a reminder to locate the release date of the next book at our earliest opportunity.  Rating: 4/5
B000JQUKKU|5.0|(In my blog review of this (visible at basicallyamazingashley.com) I have some really awesome pictures from a stage performance.)<br /><br />We all know that there are myriads of great (and not so great) books that have been turned into movies, plays, animated cartoons, TV shows and etc. etc. etc. I always roll my eyes at people who respond to the question- How did you like that book? With some variation of, \\"Oh ya, I loved it! The movie was so great!\\" Gag. Really?! You just said that?! You just smeared the name of literature by telling me a book was great because you liked the movie?! (Ahem...) Well, the other day I shamefacedly realized that I was guilty of this myself. (Insert horrified gasp here) One of my fondest memories of Christmas, most beloved childhood memories and in my top 3 favorite Christmas stories was missing something...<br /><br />A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is one of the most recognized, well known, and cherished Christmas stories in existence. There are numerous versions and adaptations for both children and adults, in animation, live action or produced live on stage. You can find it serious or slightly comical or even as a musical. Some follow the original script closely while others use only a loose interpretation of the story. Whatever versions you've seen, most people are very familiar with the plight of the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim, the cold, miserly heart of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the eerie spirits who visit him during the night of Christmas Eve.<br /><br />However familiar we are with the story, how many of us have actually read the book? I imagine not very many. It's included on BBC's The Big Read and I wonder how many people include it because of the story rather than the book itself. So, to avoid this horrible reader faux pas, I decided to pick up this favored story and read it for myself. It's a short book, more of a novella than a novel, and I already knew that I loved the story.<br /><br />I did really enjoy reading this book and I'm glad I can now say that I've actually read it. However, I must admit that I am a tiny bit more in love with the idea of this book than its reality. It's a wonderful story, with a wonderful message and wonderful characters, but I didn't have the same emotional connection to the written story that I do to the various productions I've seen. I know that this is more due to past experiences and the relationship it has to my childhood than anything negative about the book. I loved the book and will definitely reread it in the future, but it's just not the same as watching Scrooge, the Musical or The Muppets.<br /><br />The book places more emphasis on the characters and the realizations they make than just the story of Scrooge. Most movie or live productions emphasize Scrooge's discovery of the Christmas Spirit, and becoming a more generous person. I love that, and it is a very important part of the story. However, I love that reading the book offers more insight into why Scrooge became the way he did and the relationships he had with those around him.<br /><br />It is a great story to invite the Christmas spirit and remember the true meaning of Christmas, but it is also a cautionary tale. Be careful the emphasis you place on money and things. It is usually more important to focus on the people in your lives than the things in your life and this story, no matter how you experience it is a great reminder of that.ve actually read it.

B005DF2QMC|3.0|I received this as a Christmas present.  My wife heard me talking about converting my old cassette tapes to digital files and thought this would be perfect.  I hooked up the device while trying to follow the tiny print and limited instructions.  The software that is included is Audacity, and there is limited explanation, but not too difficult to figure out.   The tape speed was slow and distorted.  I sent an email to dbtech and received a response the same day.  The representative was very helpful and said they would replace the device, no problem.    The new device arrived within a few days.  This unit does work much better, though there is some difference in the tape speed from the original recording.  This is not a really high quality tape player- that is evident from the start.  However, for the price, it does work.  If you desire to transfer spoken-word tapes or books on tape, it is probably fine.  If you want really high quality recordings, you will most likely be dissatisfied.  I have a program for transferring vinyl to digital by Acoustica called Spin it Again.  This software is much easier to use than Audacity and it worked fine with the db device.  I'll probably look for a tape deck at a garage sale!  So overall, this is an okay product, not up to the standards I would like, but it works.  Customer service gets five stars though!
B00005LOUP|5.0|Great movie, great price.  Packaging was not enough though.  Case arrived broken, but CD ok.  Other than that, great job again Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good version of solitaire. responsive controls. clean visuals. helpful tips in case you get stuck. just a good time waster. (like solitaire is).
0375703764|5.0|The first 40 pages threw me for a loop since I didn't know what to expect but the book picks up and you slowly begin to become addicted.  There's one chapter I ended up only skimming through (it's about echos) and later realized how it played into the book and was blown away by how well written this book was.  The author will be writing in a whimsical pure poetic style then toss it out the window and write some of the grittiest things I've read.  Thankfully I was warned that the ending isn't some magnificent conclusion so I when I finished the book I wasn't disappointed like others.  This book shouldn't have had a big conclusion, it creeps into existence and slowly wraps itself around you and starts to sink in and leaves in the same manner.  It slowly loosens its grip on you, shows you the exit, and politely walks you out and as you still wonder what all it is you have just read the door closes you find yourself on the doorstep wanting to go back in and explore more.  Truly a great piece of work, highly recommended.
0439316944|5.0|I purchased this book for my 2 year old son after seeing Michael Rosen's bear hunt video on you tube.  It is a hit here at our house.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've read hundreds, maybe thousands, of books in my lifetime and this is by far my favorite. I've stayed pretty far away from anything by Stephen King because I thought it would be scary, but I was wrong. If you don't love this book, there's something wrong with you. I couldn't put it down.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Just when it appeared the FD franchise had run out of steam and should retire, FD5 comes along and says \\"We ain't dead yet!\\".  And by God, they're right.  FD5 is the best entry since the first and in some ways, it's the best of them all.  There's a darker undertone and not as much humor in this one.  The opening disaster on the suspension bridge is extremely well done--it's nervewracking, jawdropping and even though it's just under five minutes, it seems endless and really horrifying.  Eschewing the usual vapid teen characters, we get young business professionals as our doomed survivors.  The cast does a good job in bringing a little more diversity than usual and the chain of events leading to the gruesome deaths is inventive and suspenseful.  As for the ending, I did not see that coming!!  Not to mention the new \\"rule\\" Tony Todd slyly interjects that adds a sinister twist.<br />I really enjoyed FD5 and if they can keep the franchise going at this level, I'll be right there.<br />P.S.  Fans of TV's Bold and the Beautiful who really hate the character of Steffi (played by the foxy Jacqueline McInnes Wood) will find a ghoulish satisfaction in her grim demise!  (I'm bad).
B005TUAKOM|2.0|This album is almost ruined by productions.Why on earth is the double bass is so put on a front ?It is so overwhelming you can not hear anything else but that.The vocals are way back in the mix and the stupid double bass is in your face all the time. It is absolutely idiotic to record music like this. This would be a good album if not the recording.This way it is on annoying experience to trying to listen.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Sometimes it worked great... sometimes it wouldn't.  Often additions or changes to lists or notes would take many days before they were updated in either my PC or my tablet.  Occasionally, entire notes, lists or all notes suddenly disappeared without explanation.  Navigating on the Kindle Fire tablet was difficult and occasionally locked up.  Because it hurt more than helped, I uninstalled it.  Even free, it was not worth it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun and the way it is set up makes you want to play more to get more points to get more games. I think I'll get sick of it soon though, because the games cost more and more points as you go.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far so good although the upgrade erases everything which sucks but it has instructions to the games and u have fun trying to unlock them I like the game(:
B003VS0CX8|5.0|One of the best musicals ever produced.  Each song is memorable and the cast is superb.  It is a movie that can be seen over and over again.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this game for my 6 yr old son for Xmas becasue he likes the game on my phone so much. When he got the game he was so excited and wanted to play with it vs open his other presents. It was a little hard getting the grasp of the game at first but once we understood it it was so much fun. I think it helps to teach kids how to follow dirrections and build. All in all its a good game and worth the money especially since its a great hands on game.
B0018RVJWM|5.0|This is one of the great books of our time. It was a sort of cult fashion to read it in 2003, but the book deserves to be read by generations, not just one birth group.<br /><br />The story is presented as three alternate versions, but each has its own special significance in the examination of the human condition.<br /><br />Life is absurd, this must be agreed before continuing.<br /><br />In an absurd life, bounded by a finite, but borderless, universe, all which occurs may be considered both important and pointless. This story is no exception.<br /><br />Read this book and you will probably never look at the sea or tigers in the same way again. I happened to read it first while sailing across the Atlantic in a forty foot sloop, Sea Fever V out of Australia. That worked! I found myself looking up from reading on deck and almost expecting to see Richard Parker watching me from under our zodiak.<br /><br />But even if you don't have the opportunity to read it on the high seas you will find that the book strikes as firm a blow in a suburban environ.<br /><br />Read it! Perhaps it will remaiin a part of your life, as it does with me.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Keeps crashing towards the end of each level on Pandigital tablet.  Nice gaphics.  Very nice mood music.  Easy touch game play.  Just wish it wouldn't crash.  Really enjoyed playing what I could.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Wow. 32 days in january plus this is a leap year so february should have a 29th day the app would be great if it were updated to fix the calendar issues.
B005LB1MY6|1.0|Wow, these guys really fell off hard. 4 years between albums and this is all they could come up with? So mediocre it's almost pathetic. This album is just proof that these guys are mostly HYPE/IMAGE and very little musical talent. Perhaps these 2 fancy French boys should have spent less time partying & getting wasted on god knows what and spent more time in the studio working on their craft. Maybe they wouldn't have put out such a s@*t album. No memorable hits on this one aside from Civilization, completely forgettable. But I'm sure most of the brainless sheep will love it and talk about how its the \\"greatest thing\\" they've ever heard. Well, at least it's still better than garbage producers like DeadMau5, Skrillex, and the god awful Swedish House Mafia.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|The short, troubled life of the great Dinah Washington produced some of the the finest blues-inflected jazz singing ever recorded. Possessed of a gritty tone, a sassy attitude, and crystal-clear enunciation, she started performing as a teen in the 1940s. From 1948 to 1955 she had 27 top ten R&B hits, and between 1959 and 1961 she scored several top ten pop hits. Her 1963 death from a combination of diet pills and alcohol occurred during her eighth marriage.<br /><br />Dinah released only about two dozen LPs in her career with Mercury Records, her primary label. This box set contains the music from eight of them in chronological order:<br /><br />Dinah Jams (1954)<br />For Those in Love (1955)<br />In the Land of Hi-Fi (1956)<br />The Swinging Miss D (1956)<br />What a Difference a Day Makes (1959)<br />The Two of Us (with Brook Benton) (1960)<br />I Concentrate on You (1960)<br />September in the Rain (1961)<br /><br />As with all of the low-priced imports from Real Gone Jazz, this four-CD, 87-song compilation includes no liner notes, just the well-mastered recordings.
0316056863|5.0|I got this on audible.com as an audiobook - I signed up just so I could get this book for free. I loved this book. The audiobook is better because Tina actually reads it herself which makes it very entertaining and so real to life. I was especially interested in the stories behind SNL & the startup of 30 Rock. My husband listened to the last few chapters of the book and asked me to start it over from the beginning because he loved it so much. Definitely check it out!

B006MHWXMS|3.0|I was expecting more from this app priced at 5 dollars. It has all the basic ToDo features you would want and looks good on my 7-inch tablet. But there are a lot of similar apps that offer just as much for less money. The recurring scheduling options are very limited (only daily, weekly, monthly?) and overall it just feels very bare-bones for a \\"Pro\\" app. Also, the widget (which says it's for Honeycomb) caused a very bad crash of my launcher which prevented me from using my tablet at all. Luckily I also had ADW Launcher installed so I was able to launch the Settings app with that, delete the data for this app, and then my tablet was back to normal. If I didn't have that other launcher available I think I would have been in trouble. I'm afraid to use the widgets now.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|wont even let me get but it looks like its really cool and I really want it what should I do tho.

As soon as I started listening to it, I LOVED IT! I don't know what it is, but for some reason, this album really gets me going. It's powerful, thoughtful, well organized, and loads of fun overall. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who is picky about their rock music like me. If you like Flyleaf, Fireflight, The Letter Black, Thousand Foot Krutch, Pillar, etc., you will love Icon for Hire.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|Look, this film should absolutely polarise people and in an era of soon forgotten blockbusters and endless sequels, surely that is not a bad thing. As someone who watches movies that could be classified as indie/arthouse and enjoyed Malick's The Thin Red Line, I went into this film with an open mind, looking for and expecting something different and it certainly delivered on that. It is basically a film about the dysfunctional relationship between a father and his eldest son in the 1950's Mid-West, dealing with the death of a sibling and also tackles all the big issues such as faith, loss, the meaning of life, our place in the universe etc....in a very abstract way and is shown mostly in flashback. There is very little dialogue to speak of (no pun intended), especially in the first hour (which I needed the patience of Job to get through) and throughout the film you are shown a lot of beautifully shot, wistful, mostly imaginary sequences which you are left to ponder. The acting is well done, as they are mainly asked to convey emotion rather than deliver words, with Hunter McCracken who plays the young Jack particularly impressive. There is a rather long sequence on the creation of the Universe/Earth (a tribute to 2001?) complete with dinosaurs(!!!)which is nicely done but after half an hour had me checking my fingernails and I'm sure the literati will argue for hours over a chilled Pinot as to what it all means. Apparently, there is a semi-autobiographical tone to this film which may explain Malick's self-indulgence but that doesn't mean I have to embrace its long-windedness.<br />For me personally, I prefer much much more of a talk fest than this, so it was never going to work for me and the almost 2.5 hours I had to sit through this film I found a total bore and except for possibly the last third when people actually began to speak, quite excruciating,however I willed myself to watch it all as a matter of honour.<br />Weirdo David Lynch's Blue Velvet is one of my favourite films of all time but it is like an action blockbuster compared to this dreary and oh-so slow moving flick. You may have heard the expression \\"a musicians album\\" when dealing with new music releases, which basically means that even though the skill of the people involved is not in question, only people in the industry will get it and I would put this film in that sort of category, where no doubt fellow directors and film students would enjoy this work as it is very artistic and well made but the majority will not. Think of the longest 70's prog/art rock album (Tubular Bells anyone?)put out as an interpretive music video by an accomplished but eccentric director, without a script and you will get the idea.<br />Mainstream blockbuster lovers should stay well away and those who don't mind something a little left of centre should think very carefully and proceed with caution. This film is ambitious, poetic and challenging but it is also pretentious,over-long and deliberately obscure. If you have endless patience and prefer dreamy images that could be interpreted in many varied ways, nary a scriptwriter in sight and barely audible eerie background whispers then this is the one for you, but definitely not me.e films of all time but it is like an action blockbuster compared to this dreary and oh-so slow moving flick.

B005KELS6Q|4.0|I like this cover just fine for my purse - I find that it fits my old, first generation Kindle Fire fine and has just the right amount of padding. It doesn't add a lot of bulk to the size of the Kindle so it slips right into my purse.<br /><br />The color I got was true to what I see - I got the Paparazzi pink color.  It's pink with a white, rubbery-like graphic design that helps with gripping the case.<br /><br />My one complaint was I wish the zipper fit the other way so I could leave it in the case, unzip it, and charge it. Unfortunately the case fits with it on it's size and the plug in is on the bottom so that doesn't work. It would have helped if the zipper was changed to go the other way for us lazy folks that like to grab them and go.<br /><br />The case feels nice and you can wash it. It does have a good grip to it.  I prefer a cover that just flips open since I read a lot.  I don't always like having to pull my kindle in and out of this case.  A big plus is that it can be washed though- it has a removable pad in it, and then I've put the outer shell in the washer and let it air dry when it got dirty - it was as good as new.<br />I've had it for 2-3 years now.  I don't use it that much anymore, but I keep it for when I travel. It is a bit more protective than my flip open covers.

1933308087|5.0|I was impressed with earlier reviews on this book; I was even more impressed after I got the book.  This is a remarkable book that you can sift through, learn from, and just plain indulge yourself in poring over designs, patterns, history, etc.  Yes, it would have been nice perhaps to have a few directions on making these blocks (although the little grid patterns on each page help you figure it out) but this is already a pretty hefty tome and more pages would have turned it into downright intimidating just to lift!  At any rate, the book is an inspiration and a wealth of information, just as it is.  I recommend it to every quilter and quilter-to-be out there.  You won't regret the purchase, and the price was not bad at all - I've known less impressive textbooks to cost a great deal more.
0316010669|3.0|Gladwell has done what the rest of us did not think of doing - thats his 'tipping point' - he states the obvious. Everything in this book is basically stating the obvious.

With this strip mounted via the glue strip to the base of the hutch on my computer desk, it provides a sufficient amount of light so that I can see what I am doing. It's bright enough so that I can see the key caps on my keyboard for when I have to type a special symbol or something. But, it's not so bright that it's blinding. It's probably just enough light to read by.  I've been using it for several months now. It has not fallen off. It's a little bit of a hassle to plug it into a USB port when I need it, but it can also be plugged into an AC 120v to 5v DC USB adapter. This adapter can be plugged into a surge suppressor with a switch making it so these white LED lights can be easily turned on or off. Very nice.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if I need it. My wife has expressed an interest in putting one on her laptop.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't believe this amazing app is free. So many versions, reading plans, it'll even read to you in this \\"Charlton-Heston-like voice! Love this app! Thank you for allowing anyone to have this. Such a ministry!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Perhaps it has all been said, yet I would like to add my voice to others in praise of this excellant trilogy. I was originally drawn to \\"The Hunger Games\\" for my son as he and I greatly enjoyed listening to the \\"Gregor the Overlander\\" series. We listened to the audiobook together(for those who have not yet discovered Audible, there are not enough stars in the sky to adequately praise that service!) We ended up sitting together on the couch, delaying bed time for far too long as we listened because we were hooked from page one. The second book in the series is just as good, the third, a bit more difficullt as Ms. Collins wraps it up. Yet the story stays true and even if it is not a happy ending, it is a good one. I highly recommend any work of Suzanne Collins. Her depth of character development is outstanding and her books hold the interest of young and adult readers alike.
B005EXA8XC|5.0|This is a review for the DVD like on the description. NOT the Blue Ray like some people are reviewing here. Anyway. the DVD is awesome. It just amazes me that this was not shown before. The picture quality is incredible and the sound is amazing. I was blown away when I watched this. This is great for any Nirvana fan. A must have.
0446547654|4.0|I have read all of N. Sparks books and enjoyed them tho they always end up sadly.  This was different from others and enjoyable too.
0307455351|5.0|Please keep in mind that I had seen all 3 movies (original Swedish ones) before reading the book, so I knew the plot.<br /><br />The book starts off a bit slow, but after 50-100 pages it begins to set the foundation for the plot. The biggest issue that people have problems with is keeping all of the characters in check, Larsson switches between using first and last names continuously, and you may find yourself confused at points. And then there is the sheer size of the Vanger family. Keeping the family members straight is a difficult task, most of them have been married, have kids, etc, and knowing who each member is is actually quite important as the book goes on. Thankfully, the book provides you with a nice family tree in the beginning which can be used for easy reference.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great novel, the story is very intriguing, and you will find the turn of events at the end to be entertaining and enjoyable to read, even though the truth is horrible, it makes one more reason why this book is so hard to put down.
B001OQCV6K|2.0|Ads for the new release lured me to watch the original via Amazon.  What a disappointment.  First I think it was well casted and generally moved along at a quick pace, but the story line jumped all over the place, the dependence on so-so special effects wore thin real fast and worst of all, the soundtrack was awful - even though we viewed the Blu-Ray version with a good home theater setup.  I will NOT be going to see the sequel.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The ending of the film saga of Harry Potter and Friends is acceptable as far as movies go; however, if one is looking for the flim to be like the book it is a let down.  Remember, a person's own imagination is much better for some things than Hollywood's wonders.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Just finished watching this for the 3rd time, and it just doesn't get any better than this !  Swanson was perfect, and equally as good was the editing, camera work, customing, and double hats off to the make-up.  Old style Hollywood at it's best (which generally better than what is being made today).  By the way, the extras included in this 2-disc set are really worth viewing.

I couldn't put it down I read all five books in four days!  This last book really sucked me in I love how she always has you guessing right up til the end but this last book really tidys MOST things up nicely.  Now I am re-reading the series to see what I might have missed in my haste to finish the story the first time.

B001GF8WPI|5.0|If you could choose to die a magnificent death, saving someone's life, and being remembered forever, would you do it?<br /><br />If you liked Punch Drunk Love, you'll love Stranger Than Fiction. It's the best movie since Shawshank Redemption, hands down. Visually compelling and brilliantly acted by Will Farrell, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman, STF takes a quirky, \\"insider\\" look at the connection between fate and free will. While sometimes a bit too \\"on the nose\\", the subtext and interweaving story lines are enough to keep impatient viewers thinking and emotionally invested in the characters from start to finish. Contrary to the marketing behind the film, this is not a typical Will Farrell comedy. As a matter of fact, it's hardly a comedy at all, although there are many funny moments. The studio tried to market this film as Will Farrell's follow up to Old School, which it was absolutely not. This left Farrell fans confused and disappointed rather than excited at the prospect that Will Farrell can actually excel in the lead role of a dramatic film. I've read critical reviews of the movie who complained that the movie wasn't funny, and didn't know whether or not it was a comedy or a drama. I think those critics missed the point completely. It's a great movie that addresses a very serious subject matter in a creative, light-hearted manner, while remaining thought-provoking and intellectually resolute in its \\"quest\\" to demonstrate that sometimes fate can be greater than free will.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|I am not what you would call a diehard fan of this movie; in fact, prior to my purchase of this blu-ray release the last time I saw this film was many years ago on laserdisc.  Now we get 5 discs containing every version that any fan regardless of preference e.g. voice over or not etc can be happy with.  I left the final cut version the last to view and I spaced my viewings of each version starting with the workprint over a period of days so as let each version sink in and for me at least the Final Cut is indeed the best version although I thought the voice over version also has its good points.<br /><br />I only wish more blu-ray releases could be like this.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved especially where the final cut is concerned and I like the way they managed to package all 5 discs in a very nice and compact manner taking up less space on my shelf which I truly appreciate.  The bonus feature documentaries are also very good and so is the nifty colour booklet.  As a big fan of the old noir films like [[ASIN:B0020MMRC0 The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray]]] I couldn't help but like this sci-fi noir which has been imitated e.g. [[ASIN:B0012GVKVY I, Robot [Blu-ray]]] but never really improved upon although kudos should go to the film that helped inspire the setting i.e. [[ASIN:B0040QYROK The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray]]] (check out the buildings and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br />This is certainly among the best blu-ray releases that I have in my video library; great content, great picture and sound quality and excellent compact packaging makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

B005RYF5JA|3.0|Watched this on PBS and was distressed by several issues.  First, there were only three \\"Celtic Women\\" singers and the preparation for the tour seemed at a significantly lower level than all prior tours.  I missed the crystal clarity of the missing voices of Maev, Hayley, Alex, and Lynn from prior tours. Second, most of the pieces were either solos or unison arrangements and the overall impression comes across as musically anemic and unpolished compared with the rich harmonies and tight timing synch of the prior tours.  I was looking forward to seeing this next tour in person, but will most likely pass on this year's version as it is not up to the standard I have come to expect in Celtic Woman performances.  It is not BAD, it just is clearly a \\"rebuilding year\\" and it shows too much.
B004OR1X6A|2.0|Lets be frank about what this album  is all about. It's a money spinner aimed at Rory fans. Nothing more, nothing less. Let's also be frank about the material on the studio disk. Never released songs - alway nice to hear new material but Rory dumped them after all. Likewise he axed the versions of songs later appearing on Photo Finish in 78' and with good reason. The material shows Rory was looking for a change in his sound but it's just not happening - hence his dissatisfaction. Cheezy overdubs, too much keyboard, too many poppy special effects, some lack lustre vocals and guitar solos, drums just not right. Rory was always at his best with a simple, raw, edgy, blues based sound. Thats how Photo Finish came out. Compare Mississippi Shieks from PF with the version on this release. There is no comparison. As for sound quality; all good but even material made in the seventies should be presentable in a digital format today. This is a given not a bonus.   The live album is hit and miss. Some tracks smoke whilst others have Rory singing out of tune, playing lack lustre solos and sounding like he was not really enjoying himself. A quick splash of youtube clips will demonstrate how Rory shines when in the groove. Check out the clips from Belfast 84 - watch his version of Muddy W's, I Wonder who. Simply superb and he looks in fine spirits. All the unique characteristics of his playing style come out when he is relaxed and revelling in the occasion. If Rory thought the tracks on this album were mostly crap we should take note. And yes, it's OK to say Rory played poorly sometimes. He was human after all.The only shining light on \\"Notes\\" is Wheels within Wheels - a gorgeous piece by Rory. His song-writing talents are too often overlooked. I'm surprised Wheels didn't make it straight onto PF in 78 assuming it was recorded around that tiem.  Its always nice to hear more Rory stuff but Donal G is running out of material to flog and we don't ever get these products for free so please take note Donal. Adulating fans may want \\"Collections\\" of stuff including Rory music in shiny boxes with pretty pictures and quirky notes; this is all well and good and can be trotted out to impress friends, but personally I prefer listening to music not watching it sit in a collection.   At the end of the day how much time will \\"Notes\\" spend on the shelf in the bedroom gathering dust or on the Cd player in the lounge room getting worn out?

B004EPZ06Q|2.0|The idea of a sequel to the 2009 film The Hangover was a welcome one after having caught audiences off-guard with its hilarious situations in Las Vegas while raking in the cash to become the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all-time. The characters were likable on their own and had great chemistry together so the thought of following them further absolutely made sense.<br /><br />In the lead-up to The Hangover: Part II however there was concern regarding the appearance that the plot would be a carbon copy of the original. Unfortunately that was largely realized, and despite a number of big laughs the movie feels uninspired and all too familiar.<br /><br />The setting has changed to Thailand but the scenarios are largely the same. A bachelor party spins out of control and the guys wake up not remembering a thing about the night and realizing someone is missing. From there it is a race around the city as they try to put the pieces together. Substitute monkey for baby for easy reactionary laughs and so on.<br /><br />The majority of the developments parallel what took place in the first film to a frustrating degree. Being unable to overlook that it made each and every reveal feel forced. Surprises really didn't feel as though they were surprises and ultimately they all led to predictable conclusions. Even the new locale didn't really add much to the story but to provide the backdrop as they raced around without largely inhibiting their efforts.<br /><br />If just one unexpected thing took place it's that I came away having really enjoyed Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow despite not having cared for the character in the first movie. All the other actors were playing their roles identical to the first except for Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who was quite mean-spirited early on and that felt somewhat out of place and distracting.<br /><br />As much as its familiarity hampered its potential The Hangover II was still full of laughs and I can't overlook that entirely. The main problem is that these characters just can't shock me anymore regardless of what they get themselves into. In fact by the end I started to dread the prospect of them in a third film attempting to top the first two. The photos during the credits sequence though were genuinely funny yet again and almost made the whole thing worthwhile on their own. When the credit sequence is the highlight that isn't a sign of a good film however.<br /><br />You pretty much know what you're going to get with The Hangover II, an enjoyable but unoriginal follow-up, and for such a popular comedy that may be just enough to entice audiences and satisfy the masses who don't necessarily care for anything more.regardless of what they get themselves into.

0439023521|5.0|A Book Review of Hunger Games  By Harry, Grade 7, Yangon International School    Once every year, 24 individuals are selected and forced to participate in the Hunger Games, a brutal battle royal to death in a harsh, artificial environment for the entertainment of the Capitol. While victory leads to great rewards, no one thinks of the prize, as survival is their only goal. A story so outstanding that award winning author Rick Riordan has stated, \\"As close to a perfect adventure novel as I've ever read.\\" Written with great action and suspense by Suzanne Collins, author of the Hunger Games trilogy, in 2008, Hunger Games is a book any fan of action and fantasy will not regret reading.     Katniss, the protagonist, lives in District 12, where she is part of the many poverty stricken families of the district. Katniss, her mother, and her sister, Prim rely on Katniss to hunt for food, but still barely manage, so every year; Katniss and Prim must apply for tesserae, a meager year's worth of grain and oil. While there is no monetary fee, for each time they apply, their names will be entered one more time into the reaping, a lottery to choose the boy and girl who will represent their district by entering the Hunger Games.  The possibility of being chosen never enters Katniss's mind, until Prim's name is drawn. Katniss immediately volunteers to replace Prim in the games. After Katniss accepts her role as the female tribute, the baker's son, Peeta, is chosen as the male tribute. Before the actual games begin, a lot of suspense is created. The plot is well structured and the story has a flow to it. Events in the story are well planned out and placed, and the change of life from poverty stricken to luxurious for the time before the games is well portrayed. The training scenes, the pampering, traveling, the characters' thoughts, all add depth to the story. As Katniss and Peeta enter the games, they face unimaginable threats and sorrow and difficult life or death situations. Ms. Collins' writing skillfully develops the action, as well as the behind the scenes mechanics, such as rules and training, costumes, and travel. When reading the book, a reader can feel like he/she understands the Hunger Games and the rules as if it were real life game.    Even though I felt that the book had too much death and gruesome topics, Ms. Collins provided detailed descriptions without being too graphic. Through her detailed scenes and portrayal of the characters' strategic thinking that Ms. Collins has developed an exciting balance between action and survival. The rising action is very well built and consistent, as it keeps the reader intrigued throughout the book. A lot of thought has been given to the actual battles which it draws the reader in, even if it's subconsciously. Katniss is a subtle, stealthy participant, and was not involved in big battles. Although I think that the book is excellent, I would have enjoyed a battle scene, rather than always the subtle methods used to survive. The theme of the book is survival of the fittest as the 24 participants have to fight to death. Another theme of the novel, government power and control, is more apparent in the series as a whole, but is also in Hunger Games, as it is implied that people despise the Capitol's ways and wants to stop them. The Hunger Games definitely has the feel of war. There are many strategies involved in the plot as well. The strategy of teaming up is shown throughout the plot as well as sneaking behind the battle and sabotaging, using signals, being resourceful. Katniss and Peeta pretended that they were star-crossed lovers in order to gain popularity from the crowd and the Capital, but I felt that the romance should stay outside of the action. I did not like the fact that Peeta, another tribute from District 12, is in love with Katniss.     I think that guys will enjoy this book more than girls, and that all ages older than 10 would enjoy this book. If one is looking for that exciting adventure novel to keep him/her on the edge of the seat, Hunger Games is the book for you. On a scale of one (low) and five (high), I give this book a five because although I would have preferred some things changed, the fact remains that this is an excellent read, and I enjoyed every minute spent reading it.  Perspective #2  A Book Review of The Hunger Games  By Amy, Grade 7, Yangon International School    Twenty four teens forced to play a game with only one rule; murder. Win and take all or be defeated and lose life itself. Discover an unforgettable adventure of a young girl's determination to survive in The Hunger Games, the first book of Suzanne Collin's trilogy. Collin's amazing work appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list for more than sixty weeks in a row, and she was named one of Time Magazine's most influential people in 2010.     Every year in Panem, a post-disaster version of United States, the Capitol would pick two adolescents from each of the 12 districts to participate in a cruel game called the Hunger Games. The rules were simple; kill everyone in order to win. This year, Katniss Everdeen takes her younger sister's place as one of the tributes with Peeta, a childhood friend. Together with 23 others, Katniss is thrown into a man-made arena without any preparations. Not only must she strive to remain alive from the unnatural wilderness of the arena, but also survive being murdered by the other tributes.     Just as Stephen King commented, \\". . . I couldn't stop reading\\". The twists and turns of the story line made the tale unbelievably addictive and thought provoking. Collin's development of characters was so well-built that it lets the reader feel fond of them. The realism and differences of the personalities such as Katniss's and Peeta's cause the book to be believable. The suspense and thrill of the plot drew me more and more into the novel. Problems such as societal issues, survival matters, and betrayals occur in the book. By adding complications to these conflicts, the story compels the audience to read more. Collins managed to tone down the violence to the perfect level which added further excitement. Her writing also leaves hints and foreshadows of what to come which lets the reader feel enthusiastic for more. This story will haunt the audiences' minds.     The Hunger Games was aimed for young adults, but older readers would definitely enjoy it too. On a scale of one to five, I would give this book a four point five because I thought it was such an innovative and brilliant novel.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|Moneyball is based on the true story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and the revolutionary way he began to make personnel decisions in 2002. Adapted from the novel written by Michael Lewis, who also penned the highest grossing sports-themed movie of all time with The Blind Side, it has all the elements of a big hit except it is less reliant on making a powerful emotional attachment. Instead it trades that for a general theme of touting the underdogs and a reliance on statistics and analysis. That makes Moneyball an interesting film but one that will be more limited in its appeal.<br /><br />Brad Pitt stars as Beane and does a fantastic job of portraying the day-to-day struggles of a man who is under pressure to put together a winner but doesn't have the funding that large market teams receive. His performance is subtle but very effective, as is Jonah Hill who plays understated well - an improvement on the hyper-active roles with which he has started to wear thin. Hill plays Peter Brand, a Yale economics graduate who helps implement the new system and way of thinking as Beane's assistant GM.<br /><br />Taking on the idea of imperfect players and rounding them into a successful team works well in the sense that the audience roots for them. Beane also comes across as charismatic and being in the underdog role it is fun to watch him strive for success and painful to see the low moments that are experienced along the way.<br /><br />One doesn't have to be a baseball fan or even a sports fan to appreciate and enjoy the film. While the baseball scenes are well shot - and interspersed with real life footage - the focus is instead on what is happening behind the scenes. For someone like myself that is fascinated by all of that it was really interesting to see. Everything from the analyzing of statistics and watching tape, to discussing player moves with scouts, notifying players of being cut or traded, attempting trades with other GMs, or talking about the state of the team with the owner - all were handled really well and allowed to play out without being rushed.<br /><br />There is also the inclusion of flashbacks to Beane's past as a highly-touted prospect who busted in the majors. That gives good perspective into his current thinking and creates some conflict with the traditional scouting system - providing perspective on why he would be more likely to buck that system and try something new.<br /><br />The 2002 A's are remembered for their impressive regular season run after a slow start - including a record-breaking win streak. Unfortunately they didn't advance out of the divisional round of the playoffs and to many that dampens the importance of the message and whether \\"moneyball\\" actually made the impact that some claim it has. Elements of it however have become the norm in evaluating players league wide so it has at least influenced the sport and that makes the drive to prove it successful in the film worthwhile to watch evolve.<br /><br />For everything I appreciated in how Moneyball was made (script, acting, pacing, score) nothing really pushed it beyond just being a film with a number of elements that I admired. I really liked liked it but ultimately didn't love it. It's hard to pinpoint why that is exactly - maybe it was the more thin angle having to do with Beane's family or how the events of a lengthy baseball season are difficult to compress into a short period of time without making certain reactions seem more dramatic than they would be otherwise. Regardless I walked away from the movie thinking something was missing but that could just be because it doesn't take the traditional crowd-pleasing turn and instead has a few moments of more subdued success to rally around.<br /><br />Moneyball is a great display of how to translate a story that wouldn't have been thought suitable to become a film and make it a compelling watch. The characters and events are interesting even if it doesn't take the typical arc - though in a sense that makes it all the more fascinating to see develop. It's a film appreciated for what it attempts and what it ultimately accomplishes though it may not fully connect on an emotional level..

B00664AM5C|4.0|An alarming portrayal of a viral outbreak and its fallout Contagion is essentially a real life horror story - one that very well could prompt concern of a scenario that is unfortunately not far fetched. A fast spreading disease appears out of no where making its way through the population and the movie follows a handful of characters and their different perspectives and circumstances.<br /><br />Expertly orchestrated by director Steven Soderbergh Contagion feels a lot like like an independent film - from the tone to its pacing, imagery, and score. It has those qualities but is littered by a number of recognizable and respected stars in the cast. Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Lawrence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, and Bryan Cranston share the primary screen time. Their characters are all tied together through the world event but are fractured into their own angles.<br /><br />One man has lost loved ones and hangs on to only person he has left (his daughter), the CDC is working on tracking down the origin of the virus and finding a solution, an investigative blogger is seeking out a scoop and championing a conspiracy theory, and a doctor is sent to Hong Kong to try and locate the original source of the virus. This is all happening as the public reacts and the situation escalates. While the factions don't completely merge framing them in this manner establishes the necessary scope of the ordeal.<br /><br />The audience at the packed screening seemed to struggle with processing what was taking place. At times there were audible gasps and on several occasions nervous laughter. As the credits rolled there was a smattering of applause and also heavy chatter. It's a movie that challenges the viewer and is striking in its effectiveness. There is also some very graphic imagery and some disturbing happenings that take place which are unexpected in how they are presented - some of it even caught me off guard to an extent. You'd be hard pressed to find a single up-beat moment in the entire movie.<br /><br />That is likely to result in mixed viewer response. The immediate feeling I have is there will be those who think the movie is excellent and others who find it boring due to a lack of action and its calculated though consistent pace. It is suspenseful in its overwhelming sense of dread and that won't be considered enjoyable for everyone.<br /><br />The conclusion to the film is where it lost me somewhat as it felt rushed and a bit convenient - which was out of place considering everything that had taken place before it. I kept expecting something else to happen right at the end (trying to be unspecific here) to leave the audience with a particular feeling on the way out but it didn't come. Instead it took the opportunity to answer a lingering question which didn't feel as though it was ultimately necessary.<br /><br />Contagion is a very good movie but also a bleak and difficult watch. It's not easily recommendable despite the qualities it possesses and how effective it is in making the scenario feel frightening and potentially real.

B00632HWOG|1.0|this app sucks for the kindle fire. It would be better if you can see more than 10 emails. It needs a lot of improvement!!!!!
B005D0RDIE|1.0|Purchased this brand new DVD.  It came in on time.  Video quality was superb, but there was no audio.  If this is a quality control escapee, then I'd have less of a problem than if they had no quality control at all, which I suspect is the case.
B00005JO9J|5.0|loved it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok but its also slightly dumb and stupid and who ever made this game is the stupidest person out there!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|limited functions with the kindle fire i hope they fix that on the next update. not worth the $5 for a kindle fire user at this time.
034552554X|4.0|The Language of Flowers-I really enjoyed this. Read it in just a few days. A troubled orphan makes her way through foster care and at the onset of adulthood, discovers herself, love, and the meaning of family through her talent for arranging flowers. By using Victorian definitions of flower meanings, she touches the lives of everyone around.  Very interesting, non-judgemental view of the life choices of a young woman with a very non-traditional upbringing.

0316098329|5.0|Room is one of the best books I have read in years.  Like young Jack, I was transported into a world that was uncertain. Room is home for Jack, but is a hellish prison for Ma. All that Ma and Jack had in Room was time, yet time almost stood still for them while they were held captive. Despite Ma's remarkable mothering while in Room, it becomes clear that she is still very much a teenager on the Outside. You'll read Room in one sitting and think about it for days.
B005V1WZ10|2.0|Korn create albums that lean more toward their traditional sound such as Self-titled, Follow The Leader, and Take A Look In The Mirror.  They also put out albums that show experimentation like See You On The Other Side and Untitled.  This album falls along with their experimental albums and each experimental album they come out with is even more so than the last.  When I first heard \\"Get Up!\\" I was not surprised by them going from stripped down music of their last effort to an unusual sound for their newest.  It took me awhile to get used to but I soon learned to enjoy it.  The crazy beats and bridge are extremely catchy.  Later on \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" was released.  This is the song that made my anticipation really grow and eagerly look forward for what Korn had in store with The Path Of Totality.  The beginning comes in with a soft organ then swings in with some jaggering, pulsating beats, industrial guitars, memorable verses, and a melodic chorus that displays a very creative approach to Korn's music.  However, this number is the one of the only ones that stands out.  I have given this album a few listens and I can't help but feel that this body of work could have had a lot more potential.  This isn't bad at all even compared to their disappointing Untitled album.  However, I was expecting a little more variety to be honest.  \\"Get Up!\\" and \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" both sound like completely different songs and showed diversity.  But many of the tracks on this album sound too similar and run into each other.  Why must almost every song on this album have the same tempo or mid-tempo pace?  This causes some songs to feel repetitive and somewhat boring.  Also, some of the songs on this album lack any umph Korn showed in the past.  The best tracks that I listen to the most are \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\", \\"Chaos Lives Everything\\", \\"Kill Mercy Within\\", \\"Get Up!\\", and \\"Illuminati\\".  The others are ok but nothing special.  Don't get me wrong, I give Korn credit for takingrisks.  I didn't give this album a one star review and say it sucks.  It's just that while this album has a different sound for Korn to dabble around with, it just doesn't come out as strong as I thought it would.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this ap, although you can purchase ad free for only $.99, the ads are small in the upper right corner, they don't interfere with the game at all.  I use this on my Kindle Fire and I haven't had any trouble with delays or the download as other reviewers commented on.
B005HSL626|1.0|ads froze game, and were a constant distraction. reminded me of the Internet before ad blocking. the game is not worth the money to get rid of ads, so pretty worthless.

B006MHWXMS|4.0|yeah when I first got it I was bothered that January had 32 days and February only had 28 this year, but as you scroll thrum the months, they start on the correct day- even if it doesn't match up to the previous month.  this is a good app and I like the lists.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Fits and works as described. The cover is easy to install and also incorporates a feature that allows the Kindle Fire to stand up so you can watch movies without having to hold it the whole time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this app daily.  Easy to use, pleasant graphics, and a fun classic diversion.  The ads are a fine price to pay for a great free game.
B0036JU6CY|1.0|When I saw this movie I was not too happy with it. It just didn't make sense to me how one man could take down an entire clan of ninjas. That's like an ant winning against a human, its just not possible. Even the grandmaster who has spent his whole life studying martial arts and the art of being a ninja was bested by his own student. Sure it is possible, but against 100 other well trained ninjas? Just too fictinal for me.

032147404X|5.0|I learned more from this book than all the other photography books I have read.  Mr. Kelby does an excellent job covering the fundamentals in a concise and entertaining way.  After an hour of reading this book, I was taking much better pictures.  Each page covers a specific topic, so you can pick up this book and pick a topic and in five minutes learn something new or refresh your memory.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|What can I say? This book is hands-down the best thing since Harry Potter. It hooked me from page one and didn't let go until the very last. I felt every cut, bruise and burn as Katniss did as the writing is simply top-notch. Suzanne Collins is a master story-teller. It took me two nights to read and both nights I dreamed I was in the Hunger Games - it captures you that well. I'm absolutely dying to dive into Catching Fire and find out what is going to happen!

082300659X|5.0|All of Aristedes' books are fabulous.  There are a lot of books out there on how to draw.  But, this one shows examples of drawing in the style that I favor.  Many art books teach technique, but contain examples of inferior art.  A big selling point is the DVD that comes with the book.  I cannot recommend her books more strongly
B0052UZIFA|3.0|As much as Amazon Marketplace states that it is compatible with the Galaxy Nexus at the moment it does not. Browsing the Android Marketplace from your phone for it, it does not show. However when browsing the Android Marketplace on the web, it shows up and states that it is not compatible.  In short this game will not run your Galaxy Nexus. Here are the two scenarios I ran into.  1. Upon loading the game usually right before the developer screen and at the hour glass the application freezes up. You can only exit out by hitting the soft key home button. However the application isn't truly closed. To officially close it we either have to tap the shortcut soft key button and swipe the shortcut away which kills the process or we have to go into settings and tap \\"Force stop\\".  2. When it does load, the game will play with no issues for a few minutes. Usually just for the first round. Then when the second round comes about (after collecting a card at the end of the first one) the game freezes. Again hitting the home soft key button is the only way to exit out. However on the home screen it is not truly closed and you can hear the music/sound effects playing in the background. To officially close it we either have to tap the shortcut soft key button and swipe the shortcut away which kills the process or we have to go into settings and tap \\"Force stop\\".  If you own a Nexus, for the time being save your money and wait till it is updated so it truly supports Android 4.0.
1863514201|5.0|Take a look at the title and cover pictures.  When you combine the two, you may ask yourself, \\"Can a beginner really create embroidery like that?\\"  With the expertise of Trish's teaching, you too, can embroider birds and flowers which look alive.<br /><br />We open the book and see materials and preparation.  Mrs. Burr not only explains what materials are needed but, also expounds on which is best for the job.  A good example is the section of needles.  We are told crewel 9 is for two strands of thread and number 10 is for one strand.  The lesson does not stop there.  She lets us know Hemmings, Colonial or John James is best.  Thread, hoops and frames, magnifying lamp and fabric is also given.<br /><br />The photographs on page 16 were awe inspiring.  Her \\"The Malachite Kingfisher\\" and \\"The Portrait of Elise\\" are truly a work of art!<br /><br />Now we get to the lessons.  Trish teaches us techniques such as guidelines, starting and ending thread and stitches.  Each portion has beautiful, sharp pictures to help us understand what she is saying.  I enjoy the section, Practice Motifs, where we are given motifs to learn how to shade.  Again, we are given the materials for each technique.  Each project uses common DMC and Anchor embroidery floss.<br /><br />The projects will appear over whelming at first but, Trish holds our hand and takes us step by step through each project.  Level one is for beginners, level two is moving on from beginner and level three is some experience required.  Level one is flowers such as Cerise Anemone.  Mrs. Burr explains materials, preparation and method.  The lesson doesn't stop there.  She goes into detail teaching us the outlines, leaves, petals, and flower center.  Each process has detailed instructions and close-up photos.<br /><br />Step two is more advanced flowers.  As we enter level three, Trish really shows her teaching talent when she introduces the needle painting projects, Apricot Dahlia, Red Poppy, Little Bee-eater and Racquet-tailed Roller.  For beginners, birds are too advanced to attempt.  Trish takes us through the usual steps.  This is not where she ends.  Tail feathers, branch, back feathers, breast feathers, neck feathers, eye, beak, head feathers, toes and claws all have detailed instructions on how to paint with needle and thread.<br /><br />The last page in the book is a list of suppliers.  Trish gives information on where you can purchase all the materials you will need for the projects in her book.  Again, don't look at the cover and feel this is too advanced for you.  The book has been designed for the beginner and after a few hours of practice, I am sure you will enjoy the book as much as I have.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I did my research online in the forums and on YouTube. It's compact and powerful. Also has -10 to +20 db settings which is awesome when combined with my Canon T3i. I crank down the audio on my T3i and run the sound from the Videomic Pro through my Juicedlink DS214 and back into the camera. I get to monitor my audio and get great sound without having to use complicated recording devices in post. Only grip is the short mini jack cable.

1451627289|5.0|I, like many folks who have been fascinated by the JFK assasination, was anxious to read how Mr. King would create a tale based on time travel.  About one third of the way through, I foound myself much more interested in the relationship of our hero Jake and his new found love, Sadie.  It really didn't seem to matter whether Oswald was thwarted or not, only whether Jake and Sadie would stay together and live happily ever after.  The end was truly agonizing for those of us routing for true  love to win out in the end.  Poor Jake reminded me soo much of the Gunslinger, so close yet so far from his deepest desire. Mr. King get better with age, a worthy follow up to The Dome.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I found this to be an absolutely wonderful coverage of John and Abigail Adam's lives and the creation of our nation.  It covered the pre-Revolutionary, Revolutionary and some of the post-Revolutionary times.  It was very in-depth and clarified the struggle our Founding Fathers had, and especially John Adams, trying to create our Country.  It was also fascinating from the standpoint of the lack of media at the time.  As President, John Adams walked the streets like any other citizen in his neighborhood.  Most people wouldn't know he was President.  There was no photography or media at the time as we have today.  And those kinds of little things I observed were fascinating to me.  Mostly, I feel that the creation of our nation is an absolutely awesome story, and we watched the mini-series over several days.  And could hardly wait to sit down at night time and see the next hour.  We were sorry when it was over as we were enjoying it so very much.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I wish I could find more games like this one.  You have to think about solving it not just tap on random areas.  It is a little short, I Wish it was longer, but enjoyed playing it!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Nov. 2011 Article: \\"Of the more than 400 reviews for the Blu-ray version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 on Amazon, more than half are 1-star reviews, and most of those are focused on the poor user experience for Ultra Violet. That's bad news for Warner Bros., which was hoping that a major franchise like Harry Potter could help introduce even more new users to the UltraViolet digital format.  It's such bad news, in fact, that Flixster has sought to appease unhappy users by offering them the ability to download the movie for free from Apple's iTunes instead.\\"  I returned my Blu-ray combo set. I do not care if it goes on sale or what kind of deal is made. I contacted customer service and tried dealing with them multiple times in multiple ways. I took different advice from people online. I never received any iTunes code. I'm done with Ultra Violet and Flixster. It should not be that much work to own a film and obtain a true digital copy. If I purchase another item with Ultra Violet and Flixster then I'm telling movie makers that this is what I want and that this is how I want to be treated. Well, this is not what I want at all and this is not how we should be treated as consumers.  These iTunes codes are a last minute panic effort on the part of Ultra Violet and Flixster. This Harry Potter film is the biggest and most important film they are a part of and they know they botched things up royally. In order to get the Amazon ratings above a one to two star rating, Ultra Violet and Flixster had to do something as soon as possible. So a desperate company apparently started giving away a few codes to some customers. Too bad not all the customers were so lucky. Apparently what Amazon reviewers have to say matters. Well, at least the ratings matter to them. If we give Ultra Violet and Flixster products good reviews then they will continue to add Flixster and Ultra Violet onto our favorite and most beloved movies. And we will no longer have real digital copiesas we were once used to. This one time appeasement of an iTunes code will most likely never happen again.  I'm not sure how long the Ultra Violet/Flixster streaming copy (digital copy) version is supposed to last on one's computer. Someone mentioned it said somewhere in small print (on an insert) it was only supposed to last a few years and then the purchaser would no longer have ownership of the film unless they wanted to re-purchase it. I'm not sure if this is true or not. Of course, this \\"one time\\" HP iTunes code should be safe if it is directly from Apple. But other movies with Ultra Violet and Flixster may have an issue in a few years if what people have mentioned is correct. You may want to check out the small print and ask Ultra Violet or Flixster about it if you decide to purchase one of their films. . This is based on my experience with this product and my experience with Ultra Violet & Flixster customer service. I spoke with others who had similar issues with this product. I hope this helps you make an informed decision. I'm reviewing the product. The film was good. Amazon customer service was good.

B0062A5RUA|5.0|This is a great collection of songs from Slash's career.  The sound quality is superb, and his live band is tight.  The album hits a lot of the high notes from Guns N' Roses, Snakepit, Velvet Revolver, and Slash's solo stuff.  Some lesser known stuff is also found here, which really gives the band a chance to dive into Slash's catalogue.  One of the greatest attributes to this album, is Myles Kennedy on vocals.  Kennedy's vocal range is so broad that he can sing ranges all the way from Axl's screeches to Weiland's furious choruses.  A must for any Slash fan.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|\\"Anonymous\\" is like a rich opera or stage drama where the narrative, events, ideas, source literature, emotions and word/music architecture yield up endless revelations, discoveries and aftershocks. Like Shake-speare's \\"Hamlet,\\" Tom Stoppard's \\"Arcadia\\" and \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,\\" Richard Wagner's \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen,\\"  Roland Emmerich's \\"Anonymous\\" bestows exponential rewards of poetry, politics, history, drama, music, metaphor, allegory, leitmotiv and narrative architecture.  \\"All art is political...Otherwise it would just be decoration.\\" So says Edward deVere, 17th Earl of Oxford, \\"our Shake-speare\\" in \\"Anonymous.\\" Poetry, drama and theater genius. The \\"stigma of print\\" for the nobility. Puritan hatred of theaters, plays, actors. \\"Words, words, words\\" vs. swords. The \\"policy of plays.\\" Authorial pseudonyms. Italy immersion, obsession. Greek and Latin sources. Tudor propaganda and chronicles. Spying, censorship, Tower, torture.  Succession intrigues and  politics. These topics, politics and events are skillfully distilled and woven by \\"Anonymous\\" screenwriter John Orloff and director Emmerich into intricate, provocative content.  Truly memorable scenes abound in \\"Anonymous.\\" Our first and last views of Vanessa Redgrave's aged, regal Elizabeth I are visually haunting. The \\"Henry V\\" public stage debut is magical, spellbinding - even more so as we see and hear it along with four mesmerized, dumb-struck Elizabethan authors and Oxford. Compelling too is the scene where Oxford tells his wife why he must write, why he cannot stop. Oxford is ... what he is. To his wife, he is possessed. To Sir Robert Cecil (a hunchback, Oxford's Machiavellian brother-in-law, chief counselor to Elizabeth I and the likely puppetmeister of the King James' succession), Oxford is a threat, a menace, an embarrassment. When Cecil vexes Oxford with his last secrets, tormenting Oxford about his career failures and what might have been, the great author's personal disappointment, decay and tragedy is molten. Oxford's earthly release from his obsession occurs at the emotional climax of the movie: de Vere's final words with Ben Jonson who is admonished not to betray Shake-speare's plays, notwithstanding BJ's small view  of Stratford actor Shaksper.  Finally, the concluding look on Cecil's face after the newly crowned King James lisps his love of theater is priceless, unforgettable.   When first seeing \\"Anonymous,\\" linear processors may struggle initially to keep pace with the tapestry of events, information and time shifts. By movie's end, however, the info matrix fills and key narrative dots connect about \\"our Shake-Speare\\" -- igniting our emotions and provoking our intellectual curiosity to learn more. Ever wonder why Elizabeth I would name as her successor the son of her dangerous Stuart cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, she who plotted unsuccessfully Eliza's assassination? Or why the actor Shaksper, putative playwright from Stratford, was not jailed, mutilated or hanged for his politically audacious and incendiary plays and poems? You will not be alone in so wondering. That which flew by oddly, curiously, incomplete from Tudor history books and academic Bard orthodoxy can be revisited, retested, reshaped, savored and supplemented with this DVD and a companion Pictorial Moviebook (bought also from Amazon and recommended highly).    Yes, this film will irk fact checkers and historians. Richard III was not a hunchback. But Elizabeth's final chief counselor was. Art becomes political, Elizabethan politics became art.
B0057GYO9K|5.0|I've grown up with parents that have heavily inspired my musical listening habits.  My father was a big 80's metal head, which of course rubbed off on me.  My mom was more into softer rock, but still had a number of good tunes she passed on to me throughout the years.  I also listened to music influenced by what was on the radio at the time I was growing up in the 90's and early 2000's.  But when I got in Junior High and High School I was an all out metal head.  It was 80's and 70's rock and metal all the way.  Bands like Van Halen, Def Leppard, Motely Crue, Ratt, they all ruled my life.  I despised grunge, and bands like Nirvana.  But as the years have passed I've gotten out of the whole 80's metal kick, and gotten back in tune with modern music.  I still love the 80's in my heart, but I've learned to expand my musical horizons.  I've never been a big fan of Nirvana or Kurt Cobain by any means,..but honestly.  This album is almost impossible not to like.  It's got real rock elements an old school rocker would love, rebellious lyrics that a young teenager can relate too, it's got it all.  I've learned to love Nirvana, and Nevermind is without a doubt one of the greatest rock albums of the 20th century,..hands down.  And this is coming from someone who no more than 5 years ago would laugh at the idea of me saying this.  And hey, in comparison to the music on the radio today, this album is 10x better than anything else out there right now.

B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I love The Phantom of the Opera. I love the book, I love the movie, more than that, I love the musical. I love Webber's works on the musical so much. I love the smooth, \\"softly, deftly\\" of the music. That's why I was upset with the electric guitar in the The Phantom of the Opera song. I don't know why Webber try to put rock into this opera. Can't understand.  As a major fan of POTO I proud to say that I  have listened to the original album more times than I can count.  I still love this version. The acting is good, the singing is good.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder lives and works as a mechanic in New Beijing, but as a second class citizen. As a cyborg, she is considered less than human and is used as slave labor for her legal guardian and her two daughters. When Cinder's young stepsister contracts a deadly plague, her guardian blames Cinder. Meanwhile, Cinder has a job to do for Prince Kai, the future Emperor, and uncovers an incredible secret that will affect relations between Earth and the Lunar colony as well as Kai's future.<br /><br />Cinder is an incredible new twist on the Cinderella story. Meyer's futuristic world of intelligent androids, cyborgs, and a mysterious race of humans on the moon create a dark and fascinating backdrop. Cinder dreams of freedom and escape. She's a tortured girl with a secret past, only knowing that she was in a terrible accident that took her hands and feet that had to be replaced with mechanical ones.<br /><br />Readers of all ages will enjoy this fairy tale merged with science fiction. This fast paced-adventure is full of suspense, danger, intrigue, and surprises. Events build up to a breath-taking, cliffhanger ending that will leave readers wanting more. First in a four-book series, this debut is fun, fresh, and completely engaging. Entirely fantastic, I loved every bit of this inspired story.

B003UESJHO|3.0|A very average film saved by Bale's engaging portrayal of Dicky Eklund.   We're served typically stale formulaic puréed baby-food style cinema.  Producers sometimes need to ask themselves do they need to tell the same story again and again and again and again.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|I purchased these socks for my 5mos old because she had a similar pair with flowers on them that fit her feet so snug that she couldn't wiggle them off. I can't keep socks or shoes on my little one - a feet fidgeter - so I thought and hoped these would fit like the others she has... However, they do not. While they do grab her attention, which is great, they are completely straight (no curve or allowance in material for the shape of the foot/heel area) and DO NOT stay on her feet. In fact, they slip off rather easily. Also, at 5mos old, they barely fit up her ankles/calves, which is part of the reason why they don't stay on well, and my baby (according to the charts) runs on the small side of average. So... all in all, these are cute, but... they just didn't work for us.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very nice app especially that it's free. No issues at all! The only thing I would add is the ability to record your best time, lowest number of moves, etc.

B004WKOCP8|3.0|On first listen I actually liked this album but that's part of the problem. When any of the songs on this album come up on my Ipod I skip it. I don't have a desire to hear any of these songs again. This album is completely forgettable. I understand they try to push boundaries and change on every album but I don't see anything wrong with an artist that plays to their strength and give the fans a little of the sound that made them famous. I've grown tired of their pompous attitude and their \\"We're too cool to sell records\\" angle. How long do they think they will get away with not selling any records and not making albums that fans want to buy anymore? My favorite Incubus albums have been Science, Make Yourself, and Morning View. I only like certain songs on their other albums.
0385535139|1.0|I am an avid reader and at one time thought John Grisham was among the top in writing captivating, legal thrillers.  I vividly remember how I could not put down books like \\"A Time to Kill\\", and \\"The Firm\\".  After struggling through many of his later novels and being disappointed, I decided to give his newest, \\"The Litigators\\" a try.  How utterly disappointing!  It is my philosophy to finish what I start, but I was sorely tempted to throw the book away before finishing it.  I finished it, however, hoping, against hope that the excitement would come.  It did not.  The book was slow, did not have a story line that developed into anything. If Mr. Grisham wants my business, he needs to get back to the quality of some of his earlier books.  Guess I'll just have to stay with Michael Connelly, Vince Flynn, David Baldacci and others.  Sorry, I just can't say anything good about the book!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This was purchased to protect my tablet.  I like it so far.  Will be traveling with it before I am convinced though.  If it holds up and protects my tablet through the rigors of flying airport to airport, I will be extremely satisfied.
0439023521|3.0|Heck, I'm one for a strong female protagonist, but this book does just about everything they could to make Katniss look like the ultimate hero. Let's try to write a review without spoiling anything.<br />The book is a fun and quick read, something you might think of as a palate cleanser.  At a little over 370 pages with extremely generous spacing and font size, the book can be read fairly quickly.  There's nothing wrong with this, sometimes that can be very refreshing after a more intense larger book (hence the pallet cleanser comment).<br />Let me say right now that I liked the book enough to pick up the sequel.  It has many problems, but it does just enough right to make me curious of what happens next.  The concept is cool, though some might find it unoriginal.  I won't go into the Battle Royale similarities, since I am sure many others have already done this.  The political setting is very intriguing.  The bravery of the main characters really shines as well.<br />Let's delve into the negatives of this story.  Nearly everything in this book seems a little convenient.  There are certain twists and turns that prevent the main character from having to make any real major decisions.  The other characters fall into two major groups as I titled the review.  Psychos who are so blood thirsty they can't think, or inepts who either don't have survival skills or can't fight (not both really).  It takes away from a lot of the danger Katniss faces each day of the games.  Also the frequency of romance would be vomit inducing if it was actually put on the screen, and have the exact opposite effect that it is supposed to have on the audience.<br />There are a lot of improvements to be made in Suzanne Collins' storytelling.  With that said, I can see some major potential in this series and will at least read the next book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Just saw this tonight.  It will make you cry, it will make you feel like you are right there with them.  It truly is the best movie you will probably ever see.  If you only see/buy one movie in the next 10 years, this would be the one to see.  I can't even describe it, so you will just need to go see it for yourself.  Wish more movies were like this.  Thank you to the producers.  I'm not Baptist, but ya done good !
1593157134|5.0|This is the first self help book I've read, but I am very impressed; it has produced dramatic improvements in my saving and time management habits. I would strongly recommend it.
0312370849|3.0|I was in love with this book and ready to give it a five-star review until I got to the half-way point of the novel and suddenly the story lost it's voice, it's power, and some of my interest.  The first part of this book alternates chapters from Julia's present day view (complete with failing marriage and almost teen daughter) and Sarah's 1942 voice of an 11-year-old being deported from France. While I didn't mind Julia's story, it was Sarah that I was most interested in. Halfway through the book the mystery of Sarah's brother (whom she locked in a secret cupboard when the police came with a promise to return and let him out in order to keep him safe) is solved and so is the mystery surrounding the apartment Julia is to move into. When I got to that point I honestly asked myself what else the author had to say. And why would it take 200 pages to say?  At the halfway point, mysteries solved, the author drops Sarah's voice and creates the 'What happened to Sarah' theme that carries the rest of the novel. We now tag along as Julia traces Sarah's life and deals with the problems in her own life (she and her husband are fighting because she becomes pregnant and he doesn't want the child; plus her quest disrupts the family dynamic). While this is interesting, it isn't as good as Sarah's story itself.  And the resolution left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Parts were horribly predictable (what happens in Julia's pregnancy and in her marriage as well as who she meets and how those people affect her) and other parts just upset me. BIG SPOILER: I allowed myself to become interested in Julia's quest to find Sarah because I thought the author could salvage the second half of the story if I was allowed to meet Sarah and hear about her post-war life. NOPE. SERIOUS SPOILER!: Sarah dies many years before Julia gets involved in the story and the 'what happened to Sarah' theme evolves into a story about Julia and Sarah's son.  END OF SPOILERS  Overall, there was some great historic aspects to this book, but the sudden shift in the middle of the book jarred me and the book never really recovered from this problem (instead the author created more issues). It would have been much more successful if the author had added more details to the first half of the story and wrapped Julia's story up at the same time Sarah's viewpoint drops out of the book (or at least much closer to this point). This book is worth reading, but it's not worth paying for. Borrow it or check it out from the library.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|A great movie. Moving drama. Funny at the right parts.  I recommend this movie to people who appreciate a plot rather than a movie with mere special effects to get an audience.  Plenty of swearing but seems to work for the type of people in the story.  No sex scenes.  The characters are good.  You will want to hate the baddies and feel tremendous empathy for the Help.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Arrived in plenty of time for Christmas - in good shape - thx for quick service - will order again easily
B005UKJX4E|1.0|After reading the reviews, I thought this might be an interesting movie about life.  I really wanted to gave this a chance.  At about 15 minutes into the story, I was waiting for the story to begin.  I gave it another 2 minutes, but decided to switch to another movie.  If you want to see a movie about father/son relationships watch something like October Sky for a real story.  I don't know what this style of movie might be called - interesting photography, images, lighting is very light, almost pastel - however, movies are still about stories, dialog and action which was seriously missing.

1400069181|5.0|What if you decided that 2012 would be the year that you made your deferred \\"someday\\" dream come true?  In Start Something That Matters, Blake Mycoskie, Founder and Chief Shoe Giver of TOMS Shoes, gives you that inspirational push you may need to take action.   It's hard to pinpoint any one of the six principles outlined as standing out, as they all seem equally critical to the giving-based business model. Blake makes the lofty seem accessible, mainly by his emphasis on starting small and keeping things simple.  My mind starts going in all sorts of directions when I think of the possibilities my little ideas can become, but that always quickly leads to panic that I will never be able to manage them and so I toss my complex web of ideas aside for a later date.  It had never crossed my mind that it would be OK, and completely logical, to start small and let things organically progress.  I was actually crying--in public--by page 45 of this book.  Not because of any sentimental content, but by how obtainable the possibilities began to feel the more I read. Something inside of my was churning and the poignancy of the Mark Twain quote set it off: \\"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.  So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor...Explore. Dream. Discover.\\"    You may not have a semi-dramatic emotional reaction to the book, but for those with an entrepreneurial spirit but little business background, this book will be an invaluable pep talk/therapy session where with each chapter Blake taps into your hesitant head and topples those doubts one by one until you are left with no excuses to look back on your life with regret.  Pointing out that there is never a good time (you know, the scary moments when you step out of your comfort zone to start a new, unknown phase of your life), he attempts to rationalize the fear and highlights why facing it completely outweighs the reasons to succumbto it.  The story is an integral part of my first venture, Austin2Angkor, and I am always thrilled to tell it at events or when an opportune moment arises in a conversation among acquaintances.  Start Something That Matters, however, reinforced the need to commit to telling the story at any opportunity. You really never know when you will meet someone who will change the course of your path and take your vision to another level--whether they become an evangelist for your cause/brand or a partner that can help bring your mission to a larger audience. In fact, within the past couple of weeks since reading this book, I have stepped up my storytelling and in doing so have already 1) met a fellow dreamer on a flight who has agreed to be my pusher, and 2) been introduced to someone who could make for a phenomenal mentor in my journey.  There are endless serendipitous connections waiting to be made out there, but they are passing you by the longer you keep quiet.  The marketing of this book in itself is a testament to the company's genius and genuine commitment to the story and giving. In addition to staying true to its core by giving a book to a child in need with every copy sold, One for One is taken to other levels: the Books for Bloggers program not only got me a copy of the book, but it has given me the opportunity to keep the momentum going by giving away another copy. One-One becomes a Win-Win for both TOMS (several bloggers like myself helping the book reach new audiences in our networks) and for the blogger (I'm pumped to be able to be a part of this movement!).  Reading this book, I was continually reminded of what Sopporn, a soft-spoken woman who volunteers at the Build Your Future Today Center in Cambodia, said to me.  \\"Everyone wants a way to give back, and when you find it, you know, and you just do it.\\"  Her words were the final push I needed to come home and start Austin2Angkor.  For those out there who also found it and just know, I urge you to learn fromBlake's experiences, and the many other \\"normal people\\" success stories he includes in the book to back it up.  Let Start Something That Matters plant that seed of motivation, then dare to ride that wave of positivity you will undoubtedly feel after putting it down, and take even just ONE step toward making that vision of change, well, visible.  So in this spirit of One for One and the forthcoming MLK Day of Service, I bring you the contest.  Here's how you can win yourself a copy of this book that has given my heart a swift kick in the gut.    Go out there and find 2 of something, keep one for yourself and give the other to someone who needs it.  Maybe buy a pair of socks to a homeless person, pick a flower for a co-worker who's having a stressful day--thoughtfulness is key. Then perhaps ask them to do the same.  See how far it goes.  If it feels so good that you want to do it again, do it! There is no one-limit-per-person in this here contest.  Send your story from anywhere in the world--photos or videos are a plus--to austin2angkor [at] gmail [dot] com and we will post it on our blog and get you entered to win a copy of Start Something That Matters.  The contest will end at the end on January 31 and the winner will be chosen shortly after. For more info on the contest visit austin2angkor.wordpress.com

B004EPZ06G|3.0|Try to imagine the original Hangover and blending it with 'Apocalypse Now'. Mix well and serve.<br /><br />Very roller coaster. The laughs were gut busters, but the lulls in between were interminable and often horrifyingly dull - like the first twenty minutes of the film. How can you spend wholly 1/5th of your movie in the set-up? That was the first sign that this wasn't going to be a repeat performance of their amazing first effort.<br /><br />Although the formula was the same, there's a dank undercurrent, a pitifulness that's built up as we watch these muckers go about one twisted situation after another.<br /><br />The script replaced hilarity with shock, humor with the bizarre. Lost from the first film was the genuine sense of discovery. Also lost - a great deal of emotional sincerity - as we no longer feel like one of the gang and more like detached observers to their antics.<br /><br />The hysterical comic lunacy of the first film is replaced by plain lunacy with comical asides. This gives \\"II\\" a grungy edge and less a comedic one. Certainly not a formula for repeat success.<br /><br />Again, the one element that had me scratching my head was the overall atmosphere of the film; many of the scenes seem gritty and unpolished. Not sure what Director Todd Phillips was attempting? I honestly expected a half-naked Martin Sheen to walk out of the hotel getting ready to face Colonel Kurtz in the jungle. And maybe that wouldn't have been such a bad idea, because the Mike Tyson cameo really lacked oomph this time around.<br /><br />And speaking of cameos and a Sheen - how did they miss getting Charlie to appear? C'mon! That should have been a gimme; a massive lost opportunity for this production, which needed every trick in the book to work. You can't tell me a free trip and fully funded Yum-Yum City excursion wouldn't have interested his Warlockness.<br /><br />Honestly? I get the sense this was an extended party for the production crew, staff and actors - and they just happened to do a movie on the side.<br /><br />Definitely suffers from the sophomore jinx. Rent it for the one-time laughs.e sophomore jinx. Rent it for the one-time laughs.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|The strengths of the film are in the writing and the acting. Both are pitch perfect. Matthew McConaughey plays a defense lawyer who cheerfully takes on guilty clients. In fact he relishes the guilty clients as he knows how to manipulate the system on their behalf and dreads ever having an innocent client as the weight of that responsibility would be unbearable.<br /><br />One day he is presented with a client accused of rape. The client is a typical spoiled rich kid, but McConaughey begins to suspect he is innocent and has his trusted investigator try and sort out exactly what happened. The journey to the truth is interesting and never over-wrought. Even the violence, when it comes feels organic and truthful. It is violence an actual person would commit in similar circumstances rather than heroic movie violence. The characters experience personal growth but no grand epiphanies with soaring music. Yet the movie is engaging throughout. Truly a balance between drama and realism.<br /><br />The acting is superb, even the smaller roles are well done and believable. To say more would spoil the plot, but Mcconaughey does have an innocent client; it just isn't the client he thinks it is. A gem and a surprise.

B004RJMUJO|2.0|Fruit Ninja. Simple, highly addictive, and tons of fun on my Kindle Fire. The music is nice, the graphics are pretty, and the touch screen responsiveness seems extremely high. Here's the thing: I've used both the pay version and the free version. They are exactly alike with one difference...the FREE VERSION has MORE STUFF to unlock. I'm serious. My favorite unlockable blades were in the FREE version but NOT the pay version. The Ads really aren't that bad (popping up after the game is over and before the Fruit Fact), and if you're not connected to wifi, you probably won't get them.<br /><br />So, spare your dollar for another game (may I suggest Quell?) and stick to the bigger free version.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very enjoyable.  Would love a refresh or restart option. We are looking forward to unlocking all the games.  Hoping skill level rises with each new tier.
B006BQM762|3.0|This is a better than average timewaster. The train wreck scene is very intense, nicely done.The kid acting was good, reminded me of the Little Rascal movies. Not a great movie, maybe worth the $4 SD or $5 HD viewing fee.
1589944607|5.0|Incredibly fun game. Played it several times with some family and friends over the Christmas holidays.<br /><br />Most IPs that are made into board games are down right terrible, but they did a great job on this one. Rules are a bit hefty, but after playing through it once you should get a good feel for the game and be able to start putting together strategy for it. The characters are well formed with the strengths and weaknesses from the show. Lots of accusations fly around during the whole game about who is or isn't a Cylon.<br /><br />It's definitely a strategy game. Really isn't any fun with people who can't work together or form strategy.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|I can't say much about this product since, after I got it all hooked up to my computer ready to start creating mp3s from vinyl, I found out there is no compatibility with a Mac computer! I even called Sony support, hoping that they had added some type of download where it could still work with a Mac. No luck.  In this day and age, I find it really hard to believe that a great electronics company like Sony (and I own many other Sony products) would create a turntable that can only be used with one platform. What a shame as I was really looking forward to using this item! Instead, it's on it's way back to Amazon. (By the way, I have checked out other turntables on Amazon - this was a gift sent by someone else - and they seem to be fine with Mac computers!)

It is sad to say good bye to some of the characters that I have come to love, but he makes the book fun and funny at the same time that it is sad.

B000002J6F|4.0|Update- the next day.  Alright, feeling uncomfortable giving Manassas a 3-star rating, this morning I went back and listened through the entire album again.  This time I paid closer attention to each and every song and my feelings are now that the album *is* actually pretty good, and that the most obvious problem is that there's a waiting period until the songs finally CLICK.  I can't explain why, but it's just the way Stephen Stills writes his music- sometimes he writes music that's fairly easy to comprehend- other times it's a struggle and requires patience.    Side 2 is the obvious weak point.  So, while I'll be polite and up the overall rating to 4 stars out of 5, the second side is basically nothing but one simplistic and ordinary country song after another, and I honestly believe Stephen Stills had a heck of a lot more potential than to limit himself to bland country songs.  BAD idea dominating these type of songs on any of Stephen's albums, but especially in this case- on side 2 *right* after the bluesy guitar style of side one.  But... the good news is that these songs are mighty short.  This complaint of mine does NOT include the wonderful \\"So Begins the Task\\" however.  That song stands out way beyond the other ones.    Side 1 mysteriously improved for me this morning.  I can't explain how, it just did.  Improved a LOT, might I add.  Yes these are simple-written songs just like the country songs on side two, but the vocals are much catchier and more appealing to me.    Side 3 is almost like Stephen Stills pop/rock side.  Some of this stuff works amazingly well such as \\"Move Around\\", and the rest of the material is just pleasant rock music.  Basically it reminds me of the band America... and America is basically a secondrate Crosby, Stills & Nash wannabe band which means, as far as side 3 is concerned, the material Stephen Stills laid down here is just above average at best.    I honestly think side 4 is the real meat and potatoes of the entire album.  I mentioned this in my old review (by \\"old\\" I mean the one I wrote just yesterday!) and I still stand by it.  Side 4 just takes the cake!  The guitar jam in \\"The Treasure (Take One)\\" HAS to be one of the most melodic guitar jams in existence.  \\"What To Do\\" is extremely catchy, and \\"Blues Man\\" has grown on me quite a bit.  Some of the guitar licks are sort of lacking and feel ordinary as a result, but Stephen Stills keeps the song interesting with his vocal work alone, so I like it anyway.  Overall, sides 1 and 4 are very good, side 3 is pretty good, but side 2 is average to me (besides \\"So Begins the Task\\").  I'd rather people check out the first two Stephen Stills albums instead, but this one is pretty good too.  I'll leave my old review up for anyone interested in reading it, but be warned- it's pretty negative.  I believe Manassas is a 4-star album after all.  Here's my old review-  I had a feeling judging by the song samples that Manassas would feature way too many country rock tunes... it turns out that's completely true.  The biggest problem is that the middle of the album in nothing but a constant flow of generic and unspectacular songs.  I truly don't understand why so many people are making a big deal over this album to be perfectly honest.  It's not nearly as good as Stephen Still's first album for example, or the first two Crosby, Stills & Nash albums, or a bunch of Neil Young albums I could name.  Heck, I probably enjoy Graham Nash's Songs for Beginners more than this.  \\"Song of Love\\" sets the tone for the generic country rock that follows.  It reminds me of early 70's studio Eric Clapton- harmless, inoffensive, but not particularly *great*.  A simple vocal melody and average guitar solo.  That's it.  The \\"Medley: Rock & Roll Crazies\\" and \\"Cuban Bluegrass\\" are basically the same thing.  As far as I can tell, the only thing that separates the two songs is when the tempo goes from mid to fast after the 2-minute mark.  I actually like this song because the chorus sounds glam rock-y to me.  \\"Jet Set (Sigh)\\" is a slow-paced, blues rock tune.  It's VERY basic and uninspiring and remarkably similar to late 60's Steve Miller Band.  The speeding up part at the end had potential, but it's too short.  \\"Anyway\\" is more barely melodic blues rock.  \\"Both of Us (Bound to Lose)\\" has a commercial vibe similar to the soft rockers, the Orleans.  You know, the band that did \\"Still the One\\" and \\"Dance With Me\\".  I like the heavy guitar solo at the end, however.  \\"Fallen Eagle\\" is an upbeat country rocker... it's boring though because it just SCREAMS pure filler to me.  Predictable to the max.  \\"Jesus Gave Love Away for Free\\" is a religious-tinged, slow-moving country/gospel song with simple lyrics.  Nothing particularly impressive.  \\"Colorado\\" actually has a fairly interesting verse melody.  I wish Stephen Stills and the rest of the musicians who collaborated with Stills for this outing had written more songs like this one.  \\"So Begins the Task\\" contains an intro that reminds me of the Moody Blues classic \\"For My Lady\\".  I LOVE the beautifully sung Crosby, Stills & Nash-like vocal melody.  It gives me goosebumps because it reminds me of my childhood and those many walks through the fields that are stored inside my memory bank.    \\"Hide It so Deep\\" is a sappy country ballad.  WAY too sappy for my tastes, in fact.  Not a fan of this song because it sounds so phony.  \\"Don't Look at my Shadow\\" has generic upbeat country vocals- nothing special.  You see THIS is where the album completely loses me.  How is this stuff supposed to be prime Stills?  Really?  I remember \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" from classic rock radio a long, long time ago.  The downbeat verse melody sets an appealingly depressing vibe.  \\"Johnny's Garden\\" is pleasantly uplifting with a simple singing style and honest lyrics.  \\"Bound to Fall\\" is some kind of forgettable folk-styled filler track with vocals that neither excite or irritate.  \\"How Far\\" is a country ballad.  How many times have I said THIS so far?... and this is supposed to be an example of Stephen Still's going diverse???   \\"Move Around\\" has haunting guitar work during the vocals.  I love it.  The chorus is good too.  The atmosphere is totally 70's too- a positive in my book.  \\"The Love Gangster\\" has funky vocals and not much else.  \\"What To Do\\" contains lyrics about making sure nobody tells you what to do- great, dramatic chorus, catchy verse melody, and the honky tonk piano at the end is nicely implemented.  \\"Right Now\\" has a speedy and memorable verse melody.  CLEARLY side four is the best side of the album, and the only reason I'm giving this album 3 stars out of 5.  \\"The Treasure (Take One)\\" is *flat out awesome* thanks to the greatest guitar jam in Stephen Still's career.  It even blows away most of the work Crazy Horse has done, which is incredibly hard to believe.  The sad vocal melody is misleading too- I did NOT see a smokin' guitar jam coming!  \\"Blues Man\\" is straight forward blues that reminds me of the Rolling Stones classic \\"Prodigal Son\\".  Unfortunately it's also indicative that most American artists can't hold a candle to the British ones, especially when it comes to the blues.  Exceptions are Hendrix, the Allman Brothers Band and Zappa however.    Overall Manassas in an overrated album for the most part.  All those country rockers in the middle are just too much for me to tolerate.

Watching this movie, I forgot I was watching a movie. This is one of those movies where you really get into it, and you think about it actually occurring in present times, Very well written!!!! What a cast in this film also!!! Can't complain there either, did a very great job picking the names I like to see in my movies!!!
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|After having seen the Met's HD version of Anna Bolena, I wondered what this DVD would be like & Netrebko didn't disappoint - her performance was just as strong & it's great to have it on DVD so I can watch it over & over again, which I certainly will!  All of the performances were strong & the staging of the end of the opera, with Anna in the Tower of London (I won't give it away) was truly moving.  Beautifully done by all.  This is a monumental role in Netrebko's career & will be remembered for a long time.  A must see for any opera fan, especially someone who likes Netrebko.

Page after page the story goes nowhere and you're forced to read 5 pages at a time about meaningless details about unimportant character's jobs, lives, dates etc. I actually for tired of reading and realizing I was only at 18% of the book. For the first time ever I just read a synopsis online just to find out how it ended. Reading over and over again how the main character just keeps on getting more and more enemies gets really tiring and a little ridiculous and how apparently 95% of men in Sweden are sexist, neanderthal-like pigs is even more annoying. I was so disappointed since I enjoyed the other two books so much (except for the rapes)and this one was also worth so much more than the other two.

B006G2NVCA|1.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was one of my favorite movies of the year, due to its breathtaking performances, stylish cinematography, and story, courtesy of the author of the book. Wrapping it all together was director David Fincher, who not only had to live up to the reputation of his past great films, including 2010 Best Picture nominee the Social Network, but also the Swedish adaptation of the same book. Where the film succeeds, its due to the creativity and personality infused into the movie from all the filmmakers involved that sets it apart from the Swedish adaptation. This is why the music is such a disappointment to me. After hearing the excellent cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\" in the trailer for the movie (which also opens the album, and the movie itself), I had hopes that Reznor and Ross would build on what they did for the Social Network (which I disliked for similar reasons). Unfortunately, I think what they wrote for \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" suffers from all the same problems as the Social Network. And at least the Social Network's soundtrack was a reasonable 66 minutes in length (which was still overlong given the minimal nature of the music). The album for \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" clocks in at 173 minutes, nearly 3 hours of monotonous electronic droning with the occasional interjection from a piano or electric guitar, which are almost always heavily electronically manipulated to sound anything but organic. I am a fan of Nine Inch Nails and an admirer of Reznor and Ross for their accomplishments, but their movie music fails to properly support the film.   For Dragon Tattoo, probably the single thing the music accomplishes is to establish a bleak, hypnotic tone for the movie. In that way, their music is probably a good fit for the performance of Rooney Mara as the title character. But establishing a bleak tone was probably the simplest task that the composers needed to accomplish, and beyond that, I think the music is nearly meritless when it comes to supporting the film. The sound effects they choose sometimes come the movie itself (making the score basically useless--why duplicate the sounds already in the movie?), but more often, the heavily-manipulated computer-generated noise is just senseless and fails to mirror the emotional and kinetic energy from the movie. The tracks are not timed to any of the events in the film; you could easily cut and paste any section from any of the tracks into the movie and nothing would change. There's also nothing in this music that establishes it as a score written specifically for the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. If there are any themes or melodies in this music, they are not developed enough to become anything meaningful (which I'm sure was Reznor and Ross's intention).   The atmosphere of cold, never-ending bleakness of the music created through its insistent wall of electronic, synthetic, droning minor chord progressions doesn't match the story at all. The characters experience a wide array of emotions in the film. The film presents a variety of visual landscapes and colors. The characters all have their own stories and agendas and personalities. And the music fails to recognize any of this. On and on and on it drones. At some point, the music stops becoming an artistic expression, and starts representing Reznor and Ross working on autopilot. It's one-dimensional. Imagine if the actors or writers took the same approach as Reznor and Ross: the whole movie would take place in a single room, and every once in a while the walls would go from steel-gray to having trickles of other bleak colors. The actors would never interact with each other and the characters would have one-faceted personalities. There would be no plot, no heart, no tension or release of tension. There are some contexts in which minimalist music works, but this movie is not one of them--the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was not a minimalist novel, so why should the score for the film adaptation be approached in thisway? Fincher seems to be happy with the music, as do most film critics and the AMPAS, but why? Apart from being different from standard film music, what are the merits of these synthesized sounds in making up the soundtracks to movies?  Whatever merits the score has in the movie disappear on the album, which is quite a terrible listening experience. The album clocks in at nearly 3 hours long, and the first hour is indistinguishable from the second hour is indistinguishable from the third hour. The music is repetitive, and the tracks are way overlong (usually I have to complain that the soundtrack album doesn't contain enough of the film's music, but here, it's the opposite). Frankly, it's boring. If you're a fan of this genre of music, you'll be better off consulting any Nine Inch Nails album, or even the Social Network soundtrack, which is a reasonable length and not perpetually bleak. I'm also bewildered by the track titles, which have nothing to do with the story and nothing to do with the music. You could scramble around all the track titles, applying them to different tracks. You could then scramble all the tracks, completely messing up their order. And the album would be indistinguishable from what it already is. That says a lot about how valuable of an experience it is to attempt to listen to this album straight through. You hear one track, you've heard them all. Interestingly, Reznor and Ross have created a \\"For Your Consideration\\" album for, I'm assuming, AMPAS members. On this album, the track titles actually do relate to what's happening in the movie. I wonder what the reason for this discrepancy is.   When it comes to electronic music, the scores for Dragon Tattoo is outclassed by scores from other film composers like Hans Zimmer and even Daft Punk (Tron Legacy). When it comes to minimalist music, you'd be better off listening to Philip Glass or John Cage than either of Reznor and Ross's film scores. Besides for being unconventional, these soundtracks lack merit when it comes to supporting the films they were written for. Religiously devoted fans of Reznor/Ross, enjoy. Fans of film scores, try to ignore the existence of scores like \\"Dragon Tattoo\\".

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Wrap a compelling murder mystery inside author Stieg Larsson's critique of the declining European welfare state and what we have is a dark horse for the Best Picture Oscar.   The acting is superb - Daniel Craig peels off his Bond and is very compelling as a journalist given a lucrative assignment after having made the biggest blunder of his career. Craig's Mikael Blomkvist is perplexed by the recruitment and he drops us deep into that. Is Mikael being set up since we learn that the killer is clever enough to be hiding in plain sight?   Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara) is a character of quite unusual force. Her quiet efficiency and rootlessness is a full-throated roar about the mixed impact of technology on Western societies. What she suffers at the hands of her social worker is a stark commentary on what government welfarism has degenerated into - a narcotic to the poor, a sop to a mass electorate too lazy to deal with the problems of poverty, a make-work scheme for middle-class bureaucrats. Lisbeth's revenge, tipping us to the libertarian anarchist sentiments that Larsson was increasingly drawn to, is a vision of what we'd like to do to corrupt statists in our heart of hearts.   Heart is probably too nice a word. There's not much heart in \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" - no happy ending for Mikael and Lisbeth. As a work of art, it's as cold as the snowy Swedish landscape. When the wealthy industrialist Henrik, played ably by Christopher Plummer, is the warmest character then we know we're in \\"Sin City.\\" Along these lines the best clue in finding the killer will be looking for people being helpful. It's this reversal of moral field that makes \\"Tattoo\\" icy hot.   Interesting that Lisbeth's last name is very close to the great Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, father of the mussar (ethics) movement. Doubly interesting that things Jewish grow in importance throughout the movie. Whether intended or not, Lisbeth strikes a pose as a Jewish heroine, cooperating with thegood goyim (non-Jews) and punishing the bad ones with all sorts of unusual weapons. Her orphan status is a moshul (parable) for the diaspora Jew. Despite all the hard knocks, Lisbeth keeps her royal demeanor. Mara plays this multi-layered ice princess to a Best Actress tee.
B002M2N9JI|2.0|I really like the song \\"In For the Kill\\".  I'm not sure if this was just a not-so-good recording or if I had heard a slower, sexier version of the song somewhere else, but the one on this disc was not what I expected.  The high pitch singing for me was like a dog being tortured by a continuous dog whistle.  I am a die-hard fan of the 80's and love the synth sound done well, but this album really did not cut it for me.  I had also heard \\"Bulletproof\\" somewhere else and it had sounded much better than on this recording.  The tracks get so repetetive that you can't really distinguish a favorite song.  I wanted badly to be a fan of La Roux but unfortunately I stopped playing this CD about 3/4 of the way through.  Not sure what happened.  Maybe La Roux is better live.

I was using the free GTasks app prior to downloading this one, but it didn't auto-sync (which was a pain).  I like how much nicer this one looks and the fact that it gives you the option to sync automatically, but it doesn't keep my order.  I have lots of tasks that don't have a due date, and instead of those showing up at the top where I need them to be, the ones with due dates are at the top.  Also, I feel like the text in the widget just takes up too much room.  Instead of having two lines (the second one being \\"Due X days from now\\", I'd rather it only take up one line with smaller text so that I could see more of the list.<br /><br />And like another reviewer said, I wish it had indents/bullet points for my subcategories in my lists.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|I've used DTG for years now starting with Windows Mobile. When I switched to Android I was excited to see this version at a cheaper price. However, it didn't have all the functionality that I was use to and it was a bit buggy. I like to keep spreadsheet to track maintenance on my cars, home, business expenses etc. So I need to be able to easily write formulas, copy and paste cells and formula, click an drag selection and create multiple tabs. Since the most recent update, most if not all the bugs seem to have been fixed. I can now easily copy formulas from multiple cells and paste them. Formulas will automatically update properly depending on where they are pasted.  Google Docs Integration  For the most part, integration works well. It's when you start to add charts or gadgets in the spreadsheet on Google docs that DTG can't handle and won't let you update. If you want integration, you need to keep your spreadsheets relatively simple (formulas only, no gadgets or charts).  I've only viewed PowerPoint and Word documents, no editing, and all worked very well as expected.  Although there isn't DropBox integration, I can still save files into my drop folder (like on a PC) and have them updated that way. This seems to work well for me to have access to spreadsheets from the PC.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Very realistic study into spirituality.  The acting by Matt Damon and Cécile De France is excellent.

B005Y1B3Q0|3.0|I was discussing the new Director's Cut of The Expendables with a friend, and found myself using the same word to describe it: interesting.  Not \\"better\\" or \\"improved,\\" just... interesting. To an even larger degree than he did with the \\"Rambo\\" director's cut, Stallone has not just added deleted footage into the movie. He has re-edited a great deal of the movie. It's eleven minutes longer, but that hardly describes the reworking The Expendables has received.   I really liked The Expendables theatrical cut and thought it was a fun blast of macho action. The Blu-ray release is loaded with tons of great stuff - including the fantastic feature-length documentary \\"Inferno\\" - that really deepened my appreciated for the huge effort that Stallone and company invented in this movie. I didn't think it was without flaws though. Possibly the main one was an overall lack of depth to the lead character, Stallone's Barney Ross. I chalked it up to the fact that Stallone was wearing a lot of hats on this one (actor, writer, director) and also working with a relatively low budget (as far as these types of movies go, anyway).  I also agreed that with the large number of supporting characters, many of them got somewhat short-changed - especially Jet Li, who is one of the main stars. The main story felt a little clumsily told as well. It seemed like a director's cut was a very good idea. And Stallone says in the introduction, \\"I liked the theatrical version, but I love this.\\" So naturally it only makes sense to compare to two versions.   For better or worse, I would say they are the same but different. The same in the sense that nothing has really changed about the way the story is told (and that the story itself isn't very imaginative or original). There's still a ton of characters, most of them receiving only very minor expansions if at all. This includes Jet Li, who still feels underused. It's kind of like if an author wrote a good book, then decided to go through and reword the majority of it without really altering the content of the story. The Director's Cut of \\"The Expendables\\" is an alternate way of looking at basically the same movie.  Some of the violence has actually been toned down, with little trims made here and there to the bloodier scenes. Certain lines of dialogue - such as Jason Statham receiving a text message during a siege on pirates near the beginning - have been cut entirely. Mickey Rourke's great monologue has been subtly trimmed - just enough to change the pacing, which was perfect to begin with. Lee's girlfriend Lacey (Charisma Carpenter) has a much lighter bruise on her face when Lee goes to visit her - which is a puzzling change, considering the injury prompts a very violent retaliation by Lee against her assaulter. During the climatic action sequence, Brian Tyler's effective score has been replaced by a rock song.  I'm not wild about any of these changes, but I don't think any of them would have changed my overall high level of enjoyment of the movie if this had been the version I first saw. That's what I mean by \\"same but different.\\" The movie remains very entertaining, and I think I would have been equally satisfied with this version had it been released in theaters. But I don't think it really improves upon the version that was released.  A few of the significant changes work really well.  The new opening credits sequence - complete with new music (a rock song, but this time it's a new sequence so we don't lose any of the score) - helps convey the weariness and isolation of the team of mercenaries. Much of the banter between Stallone's Barney Ross and Statham's Lee Christmas is expanded, which helps both characters. And some of the re-edited action scenes - especially the fight between Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li - are more visually dynamic and flow better.   Overall it's a mixed bag, at least for me. I don't know which version I will be more likely to rewatch - though I know I'm more used to the theatrical cut. I barely touched on the vast number of differences between the two versions - I'm sure I didn't even catch everything, as many are very subtle. Big fans of the movie - or of Stallone in general - should definitely pick it up.  There are a couple of very cool new features, including a twenty minute featurette with Stallone talking about each movie he has directed.
B0055DKSQ8|5.0|thanks to Amazon's sample chapter feature for the Kindle I finally downloaded it after seeing this book one to many times on best seller and 'recommended for me' lists. From the description I was near certain I wouldn't be interested in this and would simply remove it but something about the first few pages just hooked me. By the time I got to the end of the sample I was intrigued enough to purchase it and carry on. The story and it's staying power never let up and I'm so surprised at just how much I enjoyed this! I won't bother saying anything about the story as you can read that in many other reviews, however, if you're teetering like I was on whether to give this a try I'd highly suggest downloading the sample chapter and you can go from there.<br /><br />To me, a sign of a good book is one that you still think about long after you finished it and for me, Freedom is one of those. I seldom leave reviews but I wanted to in this case as I so enjoyed this book. I'm definitely going to check out the authors other work now too!

B0034G4OQS|4.0|This review is based on taking my family to see \\"Arthur Christmas\\" in the cinema. It is an entertaining animated comedy about how the \\"Santa Claus\\" operation might be working in 2011 if it is a family business which is trying to move with the times ...<br /><br />The story begins as Gwen, a little girl in Cornwall, is posting a letter to Santa at the North Pole, asking for a bike for Christmas, and adding that she is the only one among all her friends who believes in him, quoting some of the arguments they use. Then we hear the voice of a the person in Santa's correspondence department at the North Pole who is replying to Gwen's letter, as the camera pans through a huge underground complex, beginning with a series of family portraits from the first Santa Claus (St Nicholas) through his descendants who have held the office to the present day: until we reach the office where Arthur, the younger son of the present Santa and the hero of the story, is writing the reply.<br /><br />Santa now delivers presents on Christmas night through a vast high-tech operation run like a benevolent army from a sci-fi film - I don't want to say too much more than this in order to avoid giving away some of the humour when you first see how it works. We are soon introduced to the amazing \\"Claus\\" family, of which the nominal head is the current, 20th Santa Claus (Malcolm, voiced by Jim Broadbent), who is just completing his 70th Christmas in the job.<br /><br />Other characters include his father \\"Grandsanta\\" voiced by Bill Nighy, who is now aged 136, and had been the 19th Santa Claus and misses the old ways of doing things: Santa's wife, Mrs Margaret Claus (Immelda Staunton) who is the family's unsung heroine; and his sons, Steve and Arthur, who could not be more different.<br /><br />Steve, who is obviously the architect of the current high-tech Christmas and appears to have been the effective head of the Santa operation for years, dresses and acts like a US Army General, is highly competent and desperate to succeed his father, but seems to have forgotten what Christmas is really about. Arthur is an idealistic, clumsy dreamer who has a knack for causing disasters, but who as much as any other member of the family really cares.<br /><br />Other characters in the Santa operation include a host of elves, particularly Steve's ADC Peter, who is so desperately keen to please that he comes over as a comic parody of a brown-noser, and Bryony, a determined and brave elf from the present-wrapping department who has a strong Scots accent.<br /><br />With two hours to go before dawn, Operation Christmas appears to be complete, with two billion presents delivered, the family and elves back at the North Pole preparing for bed - and then a parcel is found at the North Pole which had fallen off the conveyor belt. It's Gwen's bike - and the one child in her village who believes in Father Christmas is in danger of being the only child in the world who doesn't get a present from Santa this year!<br /><br />But not if Arthur can help it!<br /><br />As always, the Aardman animation is brilliant. The big name voice cast give of their best, and there is a lot of excellent humour.<br /><br />I did feel that the storyline was a little predictable and would have worked better as the plot for a film of about an hour's duration. At times the middle part of the film appeared to have been padded to fill the story out to an hour-and-a-half for a cinematic release.<br /><br />Nevertheless I can recommend this as an entertaining addition to the canon of family Christmas movies, which entertained me and more to the point, my children.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked this game because when I was in my long car trip it was something to to instead of being bored to death watching scenery. But that's just my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun and has lots of games on it I would recommend for people to buy this game
B000BC8STM|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching Cher do her thing.  It said it was filmed at the Mirage in Vegas?  Such a small stage no room for her over the top numbers that I love so much.  She wore better costumes when she and Sony did their TV Show. There wasn't any  energy at all, it was as if she just walked through her numbers.  Not to mention her singing, it seemed off key.  Like I said I'm really disappointed with this DVD. Doubt I'll ever watch again.
B003OWVHVC|5.0|I received this cd 3 days after ordering and I must say it was better than expected. Its soulful feel good music. It was in great condition when got it, no scratches or broken cover. Thank you for making it a good experience, I look forward to orderign in the future from seller.

B00127RAJY|5.0|The 30 Day Shred is a HARD workout. I'm always skeptical of workout DVDs because they are rarely challenging enough. However, this workout is awesome, and all in 20 minutes! In one month (December 4- January 4... these days include LOTS of Christmas cookies and delicious goodies) I have so far lost 3 pounds, going from 135 pounds to 132 pounds. Considering how much muscle I've built, this equates to a significant fat loss in just 30 days. My jeans are fitting looser, and my body looks leaner, more muscular, and more fit. The day after my first Level One workout, I could barely walk. But I stuck with it and moved up to Level Two after one week at Level One. I spent 2 weeks at level two, then moved up to Level Three. I  now mix these workouts around, since each workout is great on its one and works slightly different muscle groups, and it is my favorite workout system!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|'i like this game because even though you dont pass a game you still get to earn points. try it now.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I've purchased two of these covers (one for my fiancee's Fire, one for mine).  The Fire snaps easily into these covers, and the speakers, ports, and power button are unobstructed.  When fully closed, the flap fits neatly and perfectly across the face of the Fire and is held in place with the elastic band.  When fully opened, it folds neatly back and fits perfectly behind the Fire.  If being used as a stand, the flap folds into the groove.  I haven't experienced any issues with using it as a stand - it's worked fine for me.<br /><br />I suspect that over time and with use, the elastic band that secures the flap shut will probably start to fray and will probably snap.  It just doesn't \\"feel\\" like it will last a lot of abuse.  The cover itself, though, is solid.  Other reviews have mentioned that they think the flap is flimsy and cheap.  It IS thin...but it's not flimsy.  If I didn't think it would do a good job of protecting my Fire from scratches and dings, I would return it.<br /><br />That being said, I haven't tested dropping the Fire in this case (and have no plans of intentionally doing so), but I get the feeling that if you dropped this, your Kindle would probably be damaged.  There does not appear to be any sort of shock-absorbing materials or joints or impact zones.<br /><br />So, if you're worried about scratching up your Fire because you're slinging it around in a bag that has loose change, pens and pencils, paper clips, and other books, this case will protect it just fine.  If you plan on dropping it or you know that you're a klutz and will drop it every other day...well, this probably isn't the cover for you.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble's rendition of the Christmas classics is the perfect medley of classic and modern. He spices up the old classics without going \\"over the line\\". My new favorite Christmas album. I bought 2 more copies to give as gifts.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app every day and absolutely love it! Another great resource from Life Church. It would be cool if you could save your spot or create your own reading plan.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|did not like how the story turned out and definitely would not watch it again. there wasn't even enough good stuff in it to make up for the awful way the story turned out
0307959856|1.0|I was cautiously optimistic.  P.D. James takes on a \\"sequel\\" of sorts to Pride & Prejudice.  I am very sorry to say that it was all I could do to finish it.  I found the plot contrived, the characters were like cardboard cut outs and the ending ridiculous.  I didn't expect P.D. James to be Jane Austen, but I certainly expected better than this.  My new resolution for 2012 is not to read any more sequels of great novels.  I should have  learned my lesson with Scarlett!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This product worked like it was intended to work.  I put it in the blu-ray player and it plays.  I was very satisfied with the time it took to ship the product and the packaging it arrived in.
B000003RCY|1.0|Laughable. To think that these guys would later come up with brilliant tracks like \\"Sonne\\", \\"Reise Reise\\" or \\"Mann gegen Mann\\" boggles the mind. Even their goofy last album is better.   There is nothing remotely interesting about Herzeleid, from the juvenile lyrics to the generic thrash riffs this album is so bad it's not even funny. Not even the single \\"Du riechst so gut\\" rises above mediocre.
0545265355|5.0|Loved these books!! About the purchase: arrived on time, packaged nicely, hardcover books, no complaints....just so Happy to have these at home!

006621131X|5.0|***This review refers to the audiobook, but applies to the physical as well***<br /><br />I heard an NPR interview with Smith in which she talked about this book and its topic--her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. I'm a Patti Smith fan, but have never been that interested in Mapplethorpe (although I very distinctly remember the hullabaloo when I was young and my hometown tried to ban a Mapplethorpe exhibit at the art museum, to the predictable effect of turning what would have been a non-event into a sensation). I would have passed on this book until my friend Sarah recommended it to me, saying that, more than a take on Patti and Robert's relationship, it was about what it means to be an artist.<br /><br />I have been waiting for this to be released as an audiobook, hoping that Smith would narrate it. She has one of the coolest female voices in the world, and while authors reading their own work can sometimes be treacherous, she's also a fantastic performer. She does not disappoint here.<br /><br />In 1967, Patti Smith moved to New York with little more than a few cents to rub together. She slept on doorsteps, floors, sofas, eventually in a bed with a guy she would meet named Robert Mapplethorpe. The couple scraped by, taking whatever jobs they could to make ends meet, fueled by their shared passion for their art. Patti worked in bookstores and restaurants. Robert went as far as to prostituting himself. It was the Bohemian lifestyle, and they developed a symbiotic artist/muse relationship, routinely swapping roles. They soon moved into a room at the Chelsea Hotel in the bustling East Village, where they rubbed elbows with the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and William Burroughs among others (my favorite cameo is Alan Ginsberg mistaking her for a young boy at the vending machine).<br /><br />Although this book is a portrait of a relationship, it's also an autobiography, a history of a changing America, a snapshot of the New York art scene and a manifesto on what it means to be an artist. Which all sounds like it could be pretentious, but Smith doesn't have a pretentious bone in her body. She oozes sincerity. Her voice (both speaking and writing) is wholly authentic, full of contradictions: coarse but poetic, dry but passionate, laced with street slang but dropping references to philosophers and poets and painters and musicians and filmmakers and every other kind of artist and thinker at every other turn. Her prose is simple but often extraordinary. And everything she does seems to come from a love of expressing herself. If she had never made it big, you get the impression that she would still be sleeping on a sofa in a dirty apartment, painting and writing, happy.rtist.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater, and loved it. I got the movie for my mom for a present and watched it again. It was so hart warming and sad at the same time. I grew up in the south, and it is hard to believe that this actually happened, but it did. Loved the work and reserch the actresses did for these rolls. Great Great Movie.
B00447G29S|5.0|Amazing Movie, 3D is so awesome, Felt like it was snowing in my living room, and the lost blowing ticket you could reach out and grab it. Tom Hanks is exceptional with his performance in this movie. 5 Stars for both movie plot and 3D environment. Must have movie to watch during the christmas season.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I purchased a Kindle Fire for my son, and I have to admit...its soo much fun playing Angry Birds on this device.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The music!  How in the world did you approve of this DVD Jillian?  You are Jillian Michaels!  Surely you can dig in your pockets and pay for a bit of Kanye or Black Eyed Peas...or something...Salt n Pepa would do!  Whatever in the world was that music in the background?  Makes this video painful to get through.  I'd love to work out to you, but the music needs  a remedy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its not so bad that you have to earn the others games....I enjoy that but the controls stink.  doesn't really follow your finger in some games...
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This has to be the definitive Roman film series. Superbly shot, written, acted the list goes on. From the first few minutes of the first episode, this series does not fail to grip your imagination and leave you wanting to see the next episode, immediately. Thankfully, the US version is not cut and is without doubt the one to buy. If you are interested in Rome and it's history, wait no longer!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|it is a cool game I like it one of the best games I have all my fronds like it to
0671027344|3.0|This book is DEFINITELY for a younger audience.  I do, however, enjoy a good young-adult book and this definitely fit that category.  But I think this is for VERY young adult; Like still in high school.  Kind of made seem as though High school is just a ton of drama, drama, drama.  It wasn't for me, so I couldn't necessarily relate to the book.  I did, however, get a few laughs from it.  I struggled to finish the book because it just didn't interest me.
B00062PN6I|4.0|I love its sound quality on the headphones and cheap price. It's comfy of wearing it for hours.  One star out because I don't like the BIG logo on it, I may use permanent black marker to blur it away later... that's only the personal perference, which may not borther others.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most of the games are easy but some of the mini games are more trivial. a very good challenge though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good game to relax to and finally be able to win now and then. Good times from an old game!
B0063IH60K|4.0|love to play when I need a break from it all. lots of fun and you control how many cards you get.
0811879542|5.0|The 3 year old boys like this book because it requires them to participate and listen to the instructions. Like press the yellow dot or shake the book gently. Great book! As a grandparent it is hard to find the right book but this one was a winner!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this at the suggestion of a co-worker and I was not dissapointed. This book takes me back to the days when I read 1984 for school. I have heard that some schools are having children read the Hunger Games instead of the older books like Animal Farm or 1984, and after reading this book I can understand why. This book brings to light the ideas protrayed in the earlier works, while also asking the fundamental question - How far are we as a society willing to go for entertainment? With all the reality TV happening now a days for entertainment when is the stopping point.<br /><br />I loved this book! Not only did it make me ask hard questions, but it kept me engrossed while having me laugh out loud and cry at times. If you like futuristic tales that make you wonder, then this is the book for you. Can't wait to read the next book in the triology. Happy Reading!!
B006IYG5HE|1.0|The book starts out well and then, bang, it's WW II. The book is a very difficult read and not what I expected at all.<br />3/4 of the way through - it can only get better.<br />Well, I was wrong. The book got worse. MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder) and incredible (i.e. beyond belief) actions.<br />Jo Nesbo is no Henning mankell!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book! Not only did it make me ask hard questions, but it kept me engrossed while having me laugh out loud and cry at times. Just when I thought the \\"hunger games\\" were over I get thrown back in. Wow!!!<br /><br />If you like futuristic tales that make you wonder, then this is the book for you. Can't wait to read the last book in the triology. Happy Reading!!
0857680986|5.0|I just received this book today and I am really happy with my purchase. There is an abundance of helpful information that I wish I had in one reference of this quality a while ago.  Loomis includes quite a bit of text as well as many example illustrations covering issues which commonly trip up the novice (yep, that's me) such as realtive proporation, changing  perspecitve, foreshortening etc.; it's a substantial volume and seems pretty complete in its treatment of the subject matter. Are there a bunch of statuesque, 50's- era ladies in nothing but high heels, as some reviewers have lamented? ... Why yes, but the techniques are valid regardless of the subject matter. The principles are not outdated. (Does anyone else think we need to cut back on the fast food after reading this book?) Final analysis - This is a great book for anyone wanting to improve their figure drawing skills. I now have Loomis's companion book on drawing the head and hands on its way.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the stuff was very confusing. The games were ok. There r better games out there. I would wait b4 downloading this
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Nothing special, has a lot of different games, but really nothing too interesting and you have to work your way up to play other games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just discovered this app, and I am amazed at what it offers for FREE.  Lots of daily reading plans in lots of different versions, and includes an audio version for many, too!  I haven't even used all its features yet, but I'm going to enjoy this app very much.  Very exciting!
0385736002|3.0|I found this book to be an easy, entertaining read. The plot is basic and a little predictable but it held my attention. Most of the story is obvious,the author followed classic archetypes for the genre and the dialogue is simple. The stand out of this novel is the research and mythology behind it. \\"The Alchemyst\\" follows the story of Nicholas Flamel as he fights to maintain the human race and prevent the Book of Abraham from falling into the hands of the evil Dr. John Dee. All of the characters of the story were real people, with the exception of the teenage twins who stumble into Flamel and Dee and their battle of magic. The places and mythology, too, are factual which gives the plot a little more depth. There is really nothing bad about this book, but compared to others in its genre, it doesn't stand out as exceptional. This novel is actually very similar to the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series, but doesn't impress me nearly as much as the Percy Jackson books did.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|So far all studies show gas and other stuff in tap waters to be naturally occurring...but, and anyone with a small amount of scientific intellectualism  knows,  GassLand is more hot air inflating a Greenie balloon than fact...kinda like an \\"Inconvenient Pile of Methane\\" generated from the producers being full of legumes. Much as the Ohio 4.0 earthquake is blamed on hydraulic pressure nearby the epicenter is rather like your kicking Mt. Everest with bare feet hoping to knock it over. Learn some physics and math and quit trying to become the next scientific charlatan after Al Gore. Even that dope of a movie by meddling lawyer Erin Brokovitch was proven statistically way off the beam regarding the norm and illnesses supposedly caused by that plant. But movies and Hollow-Wood-For-Heads just can't seem to B.S. the world enough to become the capitalists they hate and the intellectually lazy and dead of head  eat it up like chocolate chip cookies right from the oven. Too bad they don't know the chips are rabbit pellets.
B0063IH60K|5.0|loved playing as a kid and now its great to teach my kids to play! love the game and it is easy for kids to Learn!
0061339202|3.0|I read this book because it was mentioned in Dave Pink's \\"Drive\\".  In \\"Drive\\", Pink outlined three ingredients for the \\"flow\\" experience: challenge of the right level, immediate feedback and a skill that can be mastered.<br />After reading this book, I hardly got more than the above points.  I was looking for a \\"how to\\" book about creating the flow experience.  However, this book is really a life philosophy book, which uses \\"flow\\" as a paradigm to describe various aspects of life.  The general point is very good: we need to create order in mind.  And the way is to have a goal and an \\"autotelic mindset\\", manly, focus on the effort, not on external reward or punishment.  Such mindset can be applied to physical, mental and social activities.<br />Overall, the book does provide valuable insights.  But it is quite verbose and repeating.  If you just read the subtitles, you will get about 60%  of what is talked about.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|The info for this product is misleading. It seems like this is the only option for blu-ray, DVD and digital copy but digital copy for the brand new copy of this movie was expired before we even made our purchase. If you are looking for a digital copy this is not the way to go.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Uno is BYYY FARR one of my favorite games but with my kindle fire, the buttons don't work. I can barley type my name &amp; I can't choose a color. I was quite disappointed. My advice to you is to save your money and buy the deck of cards rather than spending it in this.  waste of money....what a shame.
0545091020|5.0|Me and my lady were so hooked that we sat in the car for an hour and ran the battery all the way down so that we could finish it. It also made a great recycled-gift for my sister on Christmas after I'd finished it. Katniss, Prim, Pita, Haymitch and the gang are a character cast that keeps you wanting more. Plus the movies are coming out soon and the trailer looks amazing! Can't wait.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I gotta say this movie was way too disturbing for me!!! It was well made, but I am having troubles getting it out of my head!!! Very heavy and not at all for weak people!
B0063IH60K|5.0|random play suits me fine. I haven't played the other deals. addictive and semi-mindless. just what I like about solitaire.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|this is such a great and well done series about world war two. I gave this box set as a gift for Christmas and the receiver loved it. this series is absolutely amazing and really captivating. I would recommend this box set to anyone who likes action and world war history.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Much brighter, longer battery life, push button SW, lost original end cap lanyard hole, lens assembly loose when focus to smaller beam and tightening down uses the original SW but OK because it can keep it from accidental turn ons.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good games. some are cheezie gives you something to do. not too bad think its better for kids. but still good
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was good .But it is the game you can't put down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this Solitaire game. It is definitely my &quot;go to&quot; game! I also love that cards and table can be customized.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|When I first received this cover at launch, I was disappointed and was planning on returning it.  (Amazon ended up issuing a $10 credit to everyone who pre-order this)  At that time I searched and all the covers appeared to be the same and getting terrible reviews so I decided to hold out until something better came along.  I did not want fake leather or a sleeve.  In that time, I have had a change of heart and like the cover.  It does a decent job as a hard cover.  I like the feel of the material and it seems sturdy without adding much weight to the Fire.  It is, however, useless as a stand as shown in the pictures.  The grove that the top cover folds into is just not deep enough to hold the device in the position.  I can make it do it, but any bump to the desk sends it flat. Once I realized I would never realistically use it like that, I just gave up.  The picture with the note above illustrates what I am referring to.  For the price I paid (after credit) I am happy with the case.  I look for new cases for it, but nothing jumps out as worth the price to upgrade.  For the price that it is listed now, this is one of the better cases for someone looking for a minimalist cover that offers good protection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the games, though games could be a  little easier to open, some games are very hard, would like a easy version to open, to try to open more games

0765356139|4.0|Let me cut right to the chase. I was about ready to give this book 2, maybe 3 stars. A vast majority of the book, maybe 2/3 of it was a complete drag for me. I struggled to make it through. At times, I considered not even finishing it.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILER. I WILL TRY TO KEEP IT EXTREMELY VAGUE THOUGH***<br />One of the things that annoyed me the most was how completely 'overpowered' Vin seems to be in some cases. I'm just not a fan of that. It's the classic story of great through birth, not through hard work and because of that, even when Vin does appear to be in danger, I was never worried. I knew she was going to somehow come up with something at the last minute to turn the tide in her favor. It happens multiple times in the first book and even more in this one.<br />***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />However, you may be asking why I decided to give this 4 stars then? well, although the book was most certainly boring to me for quite some time, I always got the feeling I was missing a piece of the puzzle...kind of like...Sanderson was building up to something. Something big.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />Once the book finally plays it's hand, everything starts to fall into perspective. The seemingly endless amount of buildup does indeed payoff and it pays off in a big way that makes it well worth every minute you spent reading.<br /><br />This would have easily gotten 5 stars, but like I said, the slow buildup and the godlike Vin just didn't work for me. This book, nay this series is an easy recommendation so far and is worth any asking price.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|A year ago I bought the Stereo boxset a loved it! And for the longest I read how the Mono is the AUTHENTIC, way to listen to The Beatles. So last Black Friday I purchased and I'm glad I did. Now ofcourse like everyone else I jammed out to the stereo version constantly and could tell you ever guitar lick, bass line, sound effect and chatter in the background, but with the mono things were different. Sometimes the voices were different, background noise could be heard clearer. Even on \\"Revolver\\" the solos for I'm Only Sleeping, and Tomorrow Never Knows, the solos effects were through the roof! More in your face, more eery, and a whole different experience! Thats what so much fun, it is a different experience for the listener, Like for Sgt. Peppers album, the mono mixing The Beatles were actually there, and picked and chose how it was suppose to be heard, compare to stereo which was done much later without the Fab 4 there. So it is how THEY wanted it to be heard. For a casual listener of The Beatles I would recommend Stereo, but if you want to take it to that other level Mono, is a very much enjoyable experience as well. Specially if you have listened so much to stereo and you noticed the changes! Hope this was helpful you cant go wrong either way.

1401923127|5.0|what a wonderfully written book. backed up by plenty of science and the exploration of how we really are Our own Creators. not slaves to our genetic blueprint. some fascinating studies shared regarding placebo and drug trials, the role of the subconscious and conscious mind in what you experience in your world and Dr Liptons upbeat take on life, cells and free will. It's taken me a while to finally purchase. Soooo pleased i have actioned reading this. A total keeper on my shelf and to share with loved ones.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a really great flash to just carry around. Unlike the sb-700 and others like it this flash is isn't too heavy and is great for carrying around and getting candid shots. The SB-400 provides ample lighting and allows the user to bounce the flash off walls to create better lighting effects. Despite it's abilities, there are a few cons to this flash. For example, this flash doesn't have any buttons on it for quick changes. Also, there isn't an AF assist lamp to help focus in low light. For the price this is a great flash and I'd recommend it to any new photographers looking for a really good, inexpensive flash.   P.S. This flash doesn't turn to the side but I found if I shoot in portrait mode (on the side) I can bounce the light off walls and create interesting lighting effects. Also, I'd recommend the SB-600 ([[ASIN:B0002EMY9Y Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]]) for those who don't have much money to spend but don't mind the weight. It's not too much more expensive but it allows you to change settings much easier and emits a brighter light. It's only downside is that it's pretty heavy (10.6oz) compared to the SB-400 (4.5oz).
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I am happy with this product; the movies look amazing.  I was impressed with how much they were able to \\"clean up\\" the older movies.  I have not watched them enough to speak to individual changes, nor do I honestly want to take the time to catalog them all - I was interested in the overall experience, and just having these on blu-ray.<br /><br />My real complaint with this product was the special features - particularly the menus.  The special features themselves were interesting and engaging (although I must add the disclaimer I have not watched all of them - only the first disk so far).  But...the menus were awful; you have to click on every interview and every prop piece etc. individually; a lot of the time you watch 5 or 10 minutes, then have to select something else to view.  Why didn't they just put everything in one file (for lack of a better word) by category, such as all interviews being together, so that you only have to click the menu buttons once and can watch a half hour or an hour rather than 5 minutes?  Or, all of the stuff on one planet together, if that is how they wanted to organize it.  I found myself very irritated having to sit up and hit the button on the remote every few minutes, especially since my (older) blu-ray has long pauses as it processes on these DVDs for whatever reason (it has never had a problem with any other DVDs).  If they had simply organized the special features in a more accessible, less hands on way I would have given this review a 4 or a 5.<br /><br />EDIT: Upon actually trying the \\"Play all\\" button (Yes, I probably should have done that first) it allows you to play all the special features on that disk from a specific category, such as interviews.  Therefore, I am upgrading this to a 4 star rating.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Great app works just as they say.  Makes the scan look better than a regular photo shot. Nice to have on my phone and it was free.
B001IF252M|4.0|I got this to be able to hook up my 21.5\\" HP monitor to my MacBook Pro.  When at my desk I like to 'dock' my laptop and use my external Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor.  The adapter plugs into the Mini DisplayPort on the MacBook Pro (right near the first USB port).  The adapter works perfectly I can use my external monitor at full 1080 by itself, extend the monitors across with native resolution for MacBook Pro display and external, or clone the screens which will make the external monitor only the MacBook Pro's resolution (which is normal for all computers when cloning).  The cord from the MacBook Pro to the adapter part where you plug in the VGA cable is only about 1 to 2 inches long which make it look weird on a desk since the adapter has to stay on the desk and not just a cable running off the desk.  Also, for plugging in a thumb drive you can not use the USB port close the the Mini DisplayPort since a Thumb Drive usually has a body which will make it not fit...  However, this is a problem of the MacBook not the adapter (I used a USB HUB to fix this problem).<br /><br />In the end this device works as I expected and I have not had any problems with it (other than it does not want to work if the MacBook is closed with no power (it turns off the External Monitor and Keyboard/Mouse, this is also a problem with the MacBook and not the adapter.  My only problem with the device is it is expensive and (in my opinion) should be included with the MacBook, a laptop that expensive should include the ability to plug in an external monitor, whether the adapter is included in the box or a VGA port is built in.  Although that is my opinion and does not reflect the Display Adapter, it works perfectly.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|After Reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much from this movie- but my expectations were exceeded!  Movie started out slow so characters could be built up (without wasting too much time as it is a action flick after all), but it also helped so the viewer wasn't desensitized to the violence/action.  Movie had a Black Hawk Down feeling to it but not as fast in the beginning so you could get into the movie first.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Delivery was excellent, in fact it was early. The DVD of Quo Vadis was exactly as described and excellent quality for a film made over 40 yrs ago. Always satisfied with amazon, their delivery, products and customer service are outstanding.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this this app it is easy to read and navigating through it is simple.  The listener's version helps a lot when I am driving, I also love that I can read in any version I chose.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game for Kindle Fire. Much easier to play than PC version. Haven't tried changing many settings yet, but ones I've used worked great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Anyone that expected a mushy love triangle must've not read the first two books. I'm not understanding the bad reviews AT ALL!!! This book was perfect,shocking, heartfelt, and surprisingly realistic. I'm glad these books were recommended to me and I definately vouch for all of them. I can't wait for the movie to come out this summer!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I am 40 something and absolutely loved Pretty Little Liars. Can't wait til end of 2nd season to come out because I watch nothing in \\"real time\\".
B00129H7VS|5.0|I will keep this short, I've owned this set for 2+ years and I watch the entire series every few months.<br />The story is amazing and beautifully portrayed and the Blu-ray version is nothing short of magical!<br /><br />I only wish the reviews from the clueless people who post bad reviews based on mishaps (missing discs, slow shipping, etc...) could be removed so that the only reviews are of the actual movie content.
0743243153|5.0|Next to C.S. Lewis' book, Mere Christianity, Scott  Peck's book, the Road Less Traveled hits the top of my favorite  2 books.  This book presents a fabulous understanding of people, their lives,  and the struggles we can all share.  The first line in the book is Life is Difficult.   It turns out this book is very encouraging for our life's journey.  A must read CLASSIC for all to read.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I was not privileged to grow up during the original run of this show but I would also take The Six Million Dollar Man any day.  I love TV shows that are honestly worth my time.  I get really ticked off when a good show does finally surface on TV and it is canned within a season.  We need GOOD, CLEAN shows like this that the WHOLE FAMILY can sit down and watch without having to worry whether or not they are going to see or hear something they don't want to.  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SHOWS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.  Now release the rest of them Universal!!!
B003QP4NPE|5.0|It's the first time I feel necessary to write a review.  This book (with the sequel) reached my very limited list of essential novels.  Can't stop telling people how great it is!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|game works flawlessly and the whole family enjoys it.  Especially the kids!!!  One of the best free games on the android market.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|You know how the full version says, and I quote, Ad-Free? Well, this isn't the full version. This is the free version. And consider how the app only has ads to deal with - it doesn't restrict you to a certain amount of levels. It's not, as I call it, a sampler. Somehow, you say that the ads annoy you? We're talking about a free app here, and considering the graphics are awesome and the ads didn't slow my kindle, I give this a five star review.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love this cover for my Kindle fire. Very durable and lightweight. Only wished it had the hand held strap like the leather one. But other than that the cover is an awesome buy.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|good for kids kinda boring for adults. controls are not great.  did not have to update yet but other users complained it erases progress.
B0055S348W|1.0|I bought this app for my Droid 1 phone many months ago and it works Great! Repurchased it (twice) for my Kindle Fire and it is really useless.  I am unable to print anything from Gmail or Google Docs. The app is unable to connect to Gmail to retrieve email/docs and therefore doesn't work.  Prints fine from the SD card on the Kindle Fire but that's it.  Cannot recommend it for the Kindle File.  Amazon should not be selling this app, or at least indicate prior to purchase that it does not work on the Kindle Fire.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Great from beginning to end.  Enough said...I would highly recommend.  Great acting, compelling story line, and terrific music.  Ryan Goseling has come a long way from the Notebook.
B004UID2LC|5.0|works as advertised. Everyone who is complaining has older phones or simply don't know how to follow the directions 4 dowloading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have a lot of fiddly energy. Solitaire is useful for when I want to expend that energy. This app is a good Solitaire app if you like playing Solitaire.
B002BWP49M|1.0|If you've read my review of eclipse, than you know how I rated this one. I thought that this series would've actually grown a brain and a half, and now I'm convinced as all hell that it won't happen.  Breaking Dawn Part 1 is another 2 hours of wasted time with virtually no storyline, and still continues to mock and humuliate the Underworld series in every way possible with sparkly vampires and werewolfs that are suppose to be hideous and not gentle. Basically this piece is about teen marriage, sex, and what happens afterwards. The birth scene that this movie shows hardly brings any real power, and (spoiler to those who haven't seen the whole movie) they make the movie fade to the end credits like they did with Avatar.  Again, I don't understand how most reviewer's are giving this 5 stars. I wonder what they took before watching this. As far as movies go going out 2011, this movie is not just the biggest embarassment of the year, but the biggest embarassment in the history of mankind. Another thing that had me going WTF is that this feature did a Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows and is split into 2 parts. Honestly, I think they're trying to cash in with this movie in the same way that Harry Potter 7 parts 1 and 2 were done. Despite what they're doing with Breaking Dawn, this movie along with part 2(and this is a guarantee) will still embarass themselves further, and will be no where near as great as Harry Potter 7 was. I can't wait till this series finally finishes itself, so then that way in 20 years from now someone will say team edward or team jacob, and I'll be saying team what.  Years from now, the people giving this 5 stars will soon realize how dumb this series is, and will eventually ultimately leave their books and their movies to collect dust.
B004LROUW2|4.0|This book is my first introduction to Murakami. I was a bit intimidated by the 900-plus pages, but immediately gripped by the ominous, eerie introduction. Throughout the book, you have a sense that something dangerous and unknown is lurking in the background of even the most ordinary events. The book tells the story of three isolated individuals who all have a mysterious connection. I enjoyed the straightforward thriller aspect of it - which reminded me of the Dragon Tattoo series - but it is combined with a mystical, otherworldly aspect. As I read I noticed themes of connection, separation, isolation, birth and death, fiction vs. reality. I'm sure one could really analyze this book, but I was too drawn in by the story to do so...I just wanted to keep going and enjoy the ride! It does get a bit slow at the end, but by that time, you are invested in the story and want to go on. I think the sheer heft, much like Joyce's Ulysses, helps create the sense of reality of the characters despite the sometimes silly fantasy elements (Little People). This book has made me curious about his other works and Japanese fiction in general.
B004T32SOK|1.0|So where is Amazon hiding Dropbox. Why do they show this lame pretender that doesn't do what Dropbox does. Fire is beginning to surprise with their lack of apps.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty good game that will keep you hooked for days. the only problem I have heard is that an update came out and people lost their progress. but otherwise seems pretty good.

B005K17RU0|1.0|Version 2.0.10 which is what is in Amazon store now (2012.01.05) does not work very well on Kindle Fire.  Location does not persist and display does not change to landscape mode.
0439023521|5.0|A terrifically fun read, Hunger Games offers a compelling and captivating plot (although perhaps not altogether unique) along with strong character development that can't help but capture our imaginations.  It's impossible not to recommend this book, just about any reader will find themselves enjoying every page even if this engaging piece of fiction isn't perhaps of the literary quality to end up in a highschool literature curriculum!
0307593312|5.0|I shake my head at the marvel that is this book.  It is truly astounding.  It has the same feel of scope of War and Peace.  After ever page, I stopped, paused, and noticed with interest how I was being affected by this amazing storyteller.  In my humble opinion, a classic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good time killing game. lots of games and slightly more challanging than I expected. a few games are a little slow
B00008WJBU|5.0|I received the DVD that I ordered in a timely manner.  It was the right DVD, and it was exactly as described.  Thanks!
0783240287|5.0|I love this movie! My mom loves this movie beacause of the religious story of Joseph and the betrayal of his brothers throwing him into the pit and his determination and faith in god,that causes him to survive.Also,the songs about his coat of many colors,and go go joseph,are great for her to sing and dance along to.You go Donny Osmond.And go go go for joseph,if you love musicals!

0875428940|3.0|This deck is alright. The images are well-done, and I like the pagan elements combined with the traditional Rider-Waite imagery. However, the ten of cups is a little bit sickeningly sweet. This deck also contains much more realistic nudity than the Waite decks, which could offend some people with more delicate sensibilities.   The stock this deck is printed on is thin and a little cheap-feeling. The slip and shuffle aren't anywhere near as good as the decks I own that were printed by US Games. The cards start to bend after a few uses, which isn't exactly desirable for me.  I also find that the readings I get with this deck are very fuzzy and vague.   Overall, this is a nice enough deck but not my favourite.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Received this CD quickly and in promised (new) condition.  Love it!  An absolute must have and a great addition to my Christmas CD collection!
B003E5XYLA|5.0|This deck is absolutely wonderful. Paulina Cassidy's artwork is incredibly intricate, and the harder I look the more little details I find. I find it easy to tell the meanings of the cards by examining the images in this deck.   I find that when I do readings with these cards the results are very clear. The meanings in the LWB for this deck are (of course) a bit different from those in other decks that I own but function VERY well with these cards. I like to use this deck when reading for friends.  Because these cards are printed by US Games, they are made of a heavy and very good quality cardstock. They're glossy and have a wonderful slip. As with other decks I've owned that have been printed by this company, they don't scratch or bend easily and still lay perfectly flat although they have been shuffled countless times.   I would give this deck six stars if I could. It's an excellent buy.
B006RUJST6|5.0|great book! I havent really read in many years--no time. This a quick read. Congratulations to the author on making such well rounded, resilant characters. I found myself wanting to know more and cheering for Lake. Kinda sad its over..
6305841861|5.0|I used to not be a big fan of the first movie the first time I saw it and loved part II. But looking back this movie is inferior to the first movie but still an amazing flick. Humorous at times but amazing nonetheless. Watch part 1 though, it is imperative before watching this one.

0312641893|5.0|When I saw the blurb for this book, I knew I had to read it. And I've got to say that it definitely didn't disappoint! This is an action-packed debut that's really different than most of the YA sci-fi books out there. I literally read it in one day; I just couldn't get enough.  First, let's talk about the genre. Technically, this is a sci-fi novel. It's not dystopian, even though this is a new world that has been formed after the destruction of a fourth world war. There's a much more positive outlook on government here; I mean, one of the main characters is the leader of an entire empire, so that definitely makes it not dystopian. There are also people that live on the moon, which pushes it more toward the sci-fi category.  All that being said, however, I've got to say that it has a steampunk feel to it, mostly because there are a lot of throwbacks to an older culture. Cinder lives in New Beijing, so there are lots of Chinese names and some mentions of Asian culture like chopsticks and pagodas. But I think what made it feel steampunk-ish was the robot and mechanical part of the story. Cinder is a cyborg, part human and part machine. There are lots of mentions of oil and the inner-workings of machines, and I think that's what reminded me of steampunk. Sure, it's not steam and clockwork, but it still has that vibe.  Although there definitely aren't many other YA books like this one, I've got to say that this book isn't totally original. I've got to say that I was CONSTANTLY reminded of \\"Star Wars\\" as I was reading. Here's a convenient little list of the similarities I noticed:  1. The androids (i.e. \\"droids\\") that do all the dirty work for people and have personalities and talk  2. The special [an]droid that holds a secret message  3. The lunars/jedi that can wield magic/the force to convince people to do things or influence the minds of weak people  4. The hovercrafts that are used instead of cars  5. The interplanetary relationships and politics  6. Cinder's personality's uncanny resemblance to that of Princess Leah's  Now, don't get me wrong. These similarities didn't really trip me up. I'm a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, so I just thought it was kind of interesting. By the time that I'd made it halfway through the book, it became a game - how many more connections could I find? It was kind of like when I read anything by Rick Riordan and try to figure out who the characters are from myth before he tells me.   Obviously, there were also similarities to Cinderella, as that's what the story is loosely based off of. It seemed a little weird to me at first that Meyer would set the story in China when Cinderella was European. However, I then learned that scholars believe the first version of the Cinderella story actually came from China, before it traveled to other parts of the world. Fascinating, right?  I actually REALLY liked the fact that the story took place in China. However, I've got to say that there wasn't really that much Chinese flavor to it. I mean, there were a few mentions here and there, but the Chinese characters didn't feel all that...Chinese. Granted, this is WAY in the future and globalization has been taking place, so maybe the country would have lost some of its flair. But not all. Pretty much all of the major characters are Chinese (with the exception of Cinder), including Prince Kai, yet they acted pretty much like a normal American would act...and that I didn't really like.  Speaking of Prince Kai, I liked him. But I didn't love him. We got some scenes from his POV, but I still feel like I don't know him. Of course, I never much liked the prince from the original Cinderella, so I guess that fits. I did like that he was nice, though. (Another point for the nice guys!) I also liked his flirtiness with Cinder. But I just didn't believe their romance. Why does he like her? We never really find out.  Now, all those negative comments aside, I REALLY liked this book. You're probably wondering why I gave this book such a high rating when all I've said are negative comments, but really, this story was really interesting! I was hooked on sheer concept alone. I was fascinated by this world of cyborgs and androids, of a new plague that's ravishing the world, of a queen from the moon that wants to become the new empress of the Eastern Commonwealth, and of the little cyborg girl who just wants to escape.  I figured the big twist about Cinder's identity on like page 30, but I didn't feel it detracted from my enjoyment. I thought the pacing of this novel was great - I was never bored! The worldbuilding was great, and I can't WAIT to read the sequel! Seriously, that ending was awesome.  The ending to this story isn't the happily ever after we're accustomed to with Cinderella. And while the next book is a continuation of Cinder's story, it's also based on Little Red Riding Hood. I'm curious to see how she  mixes the previous bits of Cinderella story with this new one. And I also can't wait to see more of the dynamic between Cinder and Kai. While I like her character a lot, I still want to learn more about Kai before I decide whether I'm truly invested in him or not.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Decent game play options. It is a good way to spend some time. It has Clean graphics and options. It is recommended for causal gaming.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game is fun but somewhat boring in the features and settings that are available. Often times the 'deal winning hand' doesn't work.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Listen to the album.  Then read all of the reviews here rated 3 stars or less.  Snobbery is most funny when it's obvious to everyone but the perpetrators.

B005HEQIGO|2.0|Like previous reviewers, I had a problem with the audio. However, the video was also unwatchable -- I refreshed and popped out the video multiple times, even tried different browsers, but most of the time, I'd either just get the Paramount splash (frozen), or a few moments of video before the splash returned. Not bad if I just want to *listen* (albeit badly) to the episode, but I can't actually watch it. A pity, because I remember this being a pretty good one. I have not had this issue with any previous episode using this browser (Chrome), so I'm assuming it's the video itself.

1451627289|5.0|Coming off 2009's UNDER THE DOME (a 1000+ page political rant), Stephen King returns to his chosen profession -- i.e., \\"storyteller\\" -- with 11/22/63 and demonstrates a superb command of plot, character, wit and narrative.    King, in fact, returns to a premise that originally was presented in THE DEAD ZONE: if you had the ability to alter the future for the better, would you do it?  That question was confronted by Johnny Smith when he shook the hand of legislative candidate Greg Stillson, and -- in a precognitive flash -- saw Stillson years later as President of the United States presiding over a nuclear exchange.  Smith decides that he must assassinate Stillson before he becomes President, in order to change the course of future events.  In 11/22/63, King reverses the perspective, but maintains the theme: Jack Epping is offered the opportunity to travel back in time to reverse the course of events leading up to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Put simply, he has the once-in-a-lifetime ability to take Lee Harvey Oswald out of the historical equation, thereby altering the timeline of humankind.    King, however, takes the premise one step further than he did in THE DEAD ZONE, and makes the hypothetical question more profound.  Would you sacrifice everything -- the Universe, in fact -- for love?  Not since Harlan Ellison wrote the Star Trek script \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\" has that question been handled so deftly.  Without giving away any spoilers, King gives his characters (Jake, Sadie, Deke, Al) depth, texture and nuance that was sorely missing in UNDER THE DOME.  You feel for these people; and, while there are a few instances of stilted dialogue, King rarely commits narrative intrusion.    Other reviews of 11/22/63 have taken King to task for injecting his personal political views into the story.  However, in contrast to UNDER THE DOME, I saw none of it here.  Are political issues discussed?  Certainly.  The time period in which the novel is placed was politically-charged.  But the issues are essential to the story, and the editorializing is kept to a minimum.  Again, King plays to his strengths here: storyline and character.  He does both very well, and while the novel is 800+ pages, it is nevertheless tightly written.  Buy it: you'll enjoy it thoroughly.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing an interview with Michael Buble on \\"60 Minutes\\" and it is worth the money! It's a great mix of contemporary and classic Christmas songs, but not a cookie cutter CD like so many are today. I recommend it!

0525423281|5.0|There may be other books which were more critically acclaimed in 2011, but for me, this was the most entertaining, thoroughly delightful book of the year.  Lola is a quirky, interesting character and her friend/love interest, Cricket, is an equally charming character. The chemistry between the two was magnetic but also sweet, and the story was original and captivating.  We see a return of Anna And Etienne from Anna and the French Kiss, which is a fun diversion, without taking from the magic of the two main characters.  If you're looking for a fun read that will capture your heart, this is it!
B00005LK94|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005LK94 Fly Away Home (Special Edition)]] I bought this video weeks ago and enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it to anyone. It's really a cute video and I hope some of you will buy it and watch it. I just loved it.

B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this for my nephew for Christmas this year.  I couldn't find it anywhere else and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.  I can't really speak to the durability of the toy, but it hasn't broken as of yet, so I figure it's pretty good!  The look on his face was priceless!  It was just what he wanted!
0060873027|1.0|Very funny, albeit for all the wrong reasons. It starts off terribly, and one can only be impressed by how much worse it gets. Example: a paragraph describing someone's lair, emphasising in no unsubtle terms the mystery surrounding this character, punctuated with the line: \\"He was a mysterious character.\\"     The science, the set-up and the unfolding plot are implausible to the extreme. Wasp larvae are fleshed out more convincingly than the protagonists. The prose is shocking - a compendium of clichés and turns of phrase so abysmal they'll make you wonder whether the English language was a good idea after all.  I love Crichton's work. Reading Jurassic Park at the age of 11, in anticipation of the film's release, made me realise how exciting books can be. But there's no way this flaming turkey was published for any reason other than to capitalise on Crichton's name. In which case, it's great business, but shameful literature. And whoever edited this book should be revoked their license to read, let alone edit.
0062112430|5.0|A couple months back I was researching new books to read. I had recently gotten through with raving about the Hunger Games series, and wanted something else to read, but with the same style. So I ordered the books delirium and divergent. I read this one first and loved it. Beware of the nearly five hundred pages-they fly by far faster than you might think. I finished this book in just a couple of days.  The story is absolutely beautiful. I love the idea of a society that is enraptured in attempting to make everything perfect, and then one person realizes that it isn't and changes everything.  Lena was a beautiful and brave character and Alex was so much fun. I highly recommend this book and divergent by veronic roth to everyone. You'll fall in love with both the characters and the story.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|I never really understood why some people consider a guilty pleasure, or something that's not a good mark on ones preferences. ABBA are one of the most important bands and good bands on pop music. Pop music is nothing you should hide on your preferences, and ABBA is imprescindible on every music lover. Every one loves them around me, and my 5th grade students enjoy them a lot, better then the Mamma Mia soundtrack.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Got this for my Pandigital Novel which does not support Adobe Flash needed for standard YouTube. Works like a charm! Plays live and downloads video. Works much better than Droid YouTube Downloader which was my first workaround. Got warning screen that says there are fakes for this app which are spy/malware. This one is the real deal.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Very few movies have touched me the way this one has.  Still thinking about this movie several days after watching.  Sean Penn did an incredible job telling an already captivating story.  Even if you have never wanted to adventure into the wild, you will still connect with this movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A nice way to unwind after a long day.  The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating. Low key graphics that are interesting, but not distracting.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|Absolutely delightful movie! Fun and interesting characters travel an enjoyably unpredictable road through ups and downs of life and love and lots in between.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are several games that are fun to play.  I liked that not all the games are available right away, it gave it that extra push which seperates it from the rest.

B004EPZ084|5.0|This film is quite an interesting documentary about three different industries in the United States and their respective working conditions. Meet Bateman, Sudoku and Day: three hopeful employees trapped in the mad world of Corporate America. They're just everyday people trying to get ahead and please their superiors. Not an easy task.<br /><br />Meet the bosses: One's a Dentist, one's a Coke dealer and the other works for DeDonde Inc. The film follows the struggles and disagreements between the bosses and the employees. After several murders and criminal attempts, the notorious M.F. Jones enters the scene. Reportedly from Dallas, Jones informs Sudoku, Bateman and Day that their bosses must be eliminated. He also mentioned MICHAELmATICIAN in a vague reference to film Piracy.<br /><br />This film documentary is recommended and shall be studied by all Right citizens.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Only half way through and even in its unfinished form, its already one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.  very deep and thought provoking.  While the glimpses of BDSM may not be for everyone, Ana's thoughts and insights into Grey are ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. Coming from any other author (with the exception of maybe JR Ward or Nalini Singh) the \\"inner goddess\\" thing would have bothered me.  In this BEST OF 2011 book, it was fabulous!  A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!!  6 STARS
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's moved out of the basement. It's on DVD, Blu-Ray and it's streaming. It's known as Project Mayhem, and the first rule is you don't ask questions. But before all of that, there's Jack and his insomnia. An unreliable narrator (Edward Norton) who can't sleep and works a meaningless job. Jack attends many support groups to find meaning in life, but to no avail.<br /><br />Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soapmaker who lives in a delapidated house in a toxic waste part of town. Things get very interesting when Jack is suddenly pulled away from his meaningless existence (thanks to a blown-up condo and a new support group: Fight Club). Jack and Tyler find freedom and salvation in violence and Fight Club spreads like wild fire. But, there are rules.<br /><br />The first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club. Sorry.

B001974DG0|4.0|I have never read a DK book. I love Stephen King books. Is this a good book to start with? I read the sample, it seemed interesting. Can someone recommend a good book by this author? From the reviews I read \\"Watchers\\" seemed very popular.
0312641893|5.0|I adored this book! I was drowning and got completely lost in this world that Marissa Meyer has created in Cinder.  Everything about it sucked me in...the writing, the characters, the cover, the genre. This clever twist of Cinderella left me breathless and yearning for more.  Who doesn't love the story of Cinderella, and the possibility of two different worlds finding love.  With every word that Meyer breathes onto the pages, I was falling more in love with the characters and falling deeper into this futuristic world of hope and loss. One of the reasons I love this book so much was that Meyer was able to touch on many differet emotions while reading Cinder.  It's not everyday that you read a book, never mind a debut novel,that is able to play with your emotions on different levels throughout the book.  Meyer does such an unbelievable job of capturing the hearts of the reader by developing such unforgettable characters that you can relate to. You can feel the desperation that Cinder has of getting away from her Stepmother, Adri, and her stepsister, Pearl.  You can feel the ache in her heart when you read about her loving relationship with her other stepsister, Peony.  I found myself crushing on Prince Kai early on in the book, and had officially declared him as my new book boyfriend halfway through. I could totally and completely envision every aspect of this book, especially the ball. I could picture the grandeur of it all...the gowns, the ballroom, the palace garden.  While reading Cinder, you can really see how much love Meyer has put into creating her characters.  Although I was able to predict what was going to happen, that still didn't stop me from continuing to read this beautiful story.  I still wanted to be enveloped in this world, regardless the outcome.  The story of Cinder is one that will remain in the hearts of anyone who reads it, and I for one cannot wait for the next installment in the Lunar Chronicles.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this book is. It captured my attention from the first page. I loved everything about it. The characters are all loveable and memorable.<br /> I had a really hard time putting this book down, my only complaint is that I didn't have enough time to finish it all in one go and that, I didn't want it to end! In fact, I found myself reading more slowly to prolong the rest of the book which is odd for me. I am so glad that this is going to be a series. I can't wait to see what happens to Diana and Matthew, their adventures, their love, their future and the past.<br />I give this book a solid 5 Star rating. If you haven't read this yet and have thought about it, don't wait. Harkness wraps you up in a world all her own.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it can be used offline and has NASB.  The reading plans are good for keeping Bible reading on track.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have been a devoted Kindle user for several years and loved using the Android app as well....until I installed the update.  Now it is pretty much worthless since it causes the screen to freeze and requires rebooting the tablet.  Hope this is fixed soon.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|This is a very clean version of Stargate - no noticeable debris from the film scan.  The image quality varies rather noticeably - there are multiple scenes with very  grainy image quality.  So grainy that it's very objectionable.  Tends to be the  lower light scenes obviously.  As mentioned elsewhere, the sub-titling of the alien language only shows up  if you turn on sub-titles.  This is stupid and we rewatched several scenes  once we realized the dialog HAD to have sub-titles and went looking.  If this is an extended cut, I couldn't tell the difference.  Audio is really clean.  Worth replacing your dvd copy.
0307456625|4.0|Mr Smith does a lovely job with this book. He sets the book up nicely giving you the background on Precious, so it's a good idea to read this series in order. Precious solves a number of cases in this book & whilst it must be admitted she got some very, very lucky breaks it doesn't stop this from being a really entertaining quick read. I also like how Mr Smith repeatedly pays respect to Agatha Christie in this book, who is still one of my favorite authors.
B00371QQ0M|3.0|We did not think the image quality was noticeably better (55\\" plasma, 12' viewing distance) than the dvd edition.  As others have noted, the same debris (dirt, hair,  etc) present on the DVD edition is present on the Blu Ray version so they can't  have rescanned the film.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I would definately recommend this game. It is very challenging and good fun for all CSI types of people. Enjoy.
B005VR9328|5.0|Wow, what do I feel like as I sit and listen to this album again?(now the fourth time in the loop.) Swept away,thought changing, and I'll say it now;groundbreaking. This isn't just a typical Roots album or any other for that matter. This flows like a story, a light breeze blowing through a cool fall day;this is emotion. Raw and melodic and beautiful.  At the same time I write this I feel partly that this isn't a Roots album,but of course it is. Yet in another way it's a collaboration with rappers who I've come to really like in previous Roots albums,(since 'Game Theory'), Dice Raw, Truck North, Greg Porn, these guys are way talented and feel like a true and essential part of the group as a whole. Black Thought is in the album of course and the rest of the entourage, yet still Thought sorda hides in the background and then will suddenly take over in knowledgeable and provoking lyrical thought. As a band, I think right now in their long years of breaking boundaries we see the roots at their most comfortable and at the top of the game,and each album strives further and further. They connected with each other on this record,they created something that will maybe,with passing time will be called a 'Masterpiece'.  This is somewhat of a compilation album, although the Roots went literally the opposite way. The album is about a fictional character and the trials and tribulations that he went through until his untimely death. But what is unique about this is that track 1 starts at the end of his life,(the sound of a flat-line)where upon the end of the album begins with his story.    The production of the album is excellent and it intensifies the sound of The Roots as a band as well, moreso to me than an any of their previous albums. Drums,bass,synthesizer,piano,guitar and the violin roll smoothly through the 39 minute album. Short, yes. But it isn't scattered,its a complete beginning to end album.   What makes me love this album more is the final four tracks. Instrumentals,piano and violin harmonizing so beautifully, taking your mind anywhere,then a explosion of sound,which reminds me of the finale of \\"The Beatles\\" song 'A Day In The Life' from \\"Sgt.Peppers\\". A tribute maybe?  The Roots have found their path in Hip-Hop and it's high in the mountains and above the clouds, beyond anything mainstream or otherwise. This isnt just an album, its a work of lyrical and musical art.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|Three and a half years after the hype, sycophantic reviews, and mass hysteria have died down I am now ready to review this film with a level-headed opinion. Is it good. Yes, quite. Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be? No, certainly not. The Dark Knight has faults, not the least of which is the unjustifiably bloated running time.<br /><br />With criminals in Gotham now looking over their shoulders (or should I say to the sky) for Batman, the crime-rate is gradually falling. But when anarchic, nihilistic Joker appears to stir things up between the cops and crooks the fight against crime is cranked up to the max. The Joker is out to create as much chaos as possible, not caring for himself or others. Meanwhile District Attorney Harvey Dent tackles the criminals as honestly as he can with Rachel Dawes glassy-eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections. This is spread out over 153 minutes, and in long stretches you'll begin to feel every second of it.<br /><br />Much of this film's running time could have been trimmed and many scenes jettisoned. I know I am not alone in admitting that a sequence midway through the film involving dead bodies in an apartment and the re-building of a shattered bullet just confuses me. The sequence seems to come out of nowhere. I know Batman is supposed to be a detective but this was just nonsense. Nolan could have come up with a better method of leading Bruce Wayne to the trap with the window and sunshade. Also, there is a moment near the end when Salvatore Marone tells Commissioner Gordon that he knows where the Joker's going to be. Nothing becomes of this.<br /><br />You'd have to be pretty stupid not to connect the dots when it comes to the corrupt cops who sell-out Gordon at every opportunity too. Real lazy writing there. I just couldn't get involved with Harvey Dent either. His story, struggle, and motivations did not interest me in the slightest and I found the character flat and boring. Gary Oldman as Gordon also bored me to tears. What exactly are we supposed to like about this character? With the exception of temporally faking his own death he never once proved himself to be competent. I longed for the Joker to show up and put them all out of my misery. Not much of the dialogue is memorable. It sounds as if the characters are talking out to the audience while none of the words actually gel and no eye-lines connect. Little of it feels like a realistic conversation. It's virtually all just perfectly rehearsed movie dialogue from over-written comic-book characters.<br /><br />I wish that Nolan would stop shying away from violence. When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything. The pencil trick happens fast (and off-screen), no blood effects follow gunfire, few of the punches are seen connecting. I understand the need to keep it a PG-13 but come on! Aside from a car and helicopter explosion there aren't many deaths seen occurring onscreen, most of the time leaving you wondering what happened (as with Gambol's death).<br /><br />There are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe.<br /><br />Like Batman Begins, it's all so straight and brick-faced. I really ought to ask Christopher Nolan \\"Why so serious?\\"<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a stunning 1080p picture, that alternates between 2.40:1 and 1:78:1 aspect ratios, and a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack with lots of extras.also bored me to tears.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I wish I could give two ratings.  The movie itself would be a 5 while the Ultraviolet would be a negative 5.  Ultraviolet is no fun. Must be able to stream to watch the movie. This means no keeping a copy on my laptop or ipod. No watching on a plane. (I don't have a dvd drive in my laptop and don't take my external dvd drive on trips). And if you are on a slow internet connection, good luck watching.  WB really needs to get off this UV trip and bring back digital downloads.
0240815807|5.0|Over the last, say 8 or 10 years I have purchased a plethora of books on how to mix and none of them really gave me what I was looking for.  This is the first time I write a review, because I believe this author has given me so much for so little that he deserves the time I'll spend to write this.    The brilliant thing about this book is that the author keeps things under the perspective of a home studio.  His basic assumption is that you do not have a perfect sounding room and you do not have high-end boutique gear and, despite your shortcomings, you can still produce commercial quality results.  The author keeps this perspective throughout the book and teaches you how to overcome the troubles that we all face in our real world situations.  It is important to keep in mind that the first chapters cover room acoustics and monitoring and they may seem lengthy but are key to your process.  His tips on monitoring on certain specific alternative (low-budget) speakers have been invaluable to me.  Do not skip on those chapters (only problem with them is that the frequent quotes are indeed lengthy).  Throughout the rest of the book he will give you detailed information on everything from organizing your tracks (so you are more productive) to how to use each piece of gear or plug-in to achieve consistent results.  In addition to explaining processors, this book will teach you processes and how you can be systematic about each step of your mixing journey to achieving consistent replicable results.  Although the author does not endorse any specific products or brands, he will tell you about free or inexpensive processing or metering plug-ins that will help you on your way.  Overal, the information on this book empowers you (the home studio mixing engineer) while demystifying a series of common dogmas that would otherwise make you believe you need other worldly equipment or that you're not quite good enough.  Best I've read on this subject.

0307594777|5.0|Now that trailers have started popping up for the American movie adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, those people who hadn't read the book are starting to have some awareness of it. There's a scary-looking girl, with dark hair and facial piercings. There's an old guy. There's James Bond, ahem, Daniel Craig. The sets appear furnished by Ikea.<br /><br />Not too far off, really.<br /><br />The scary-looking girl is Lisbeth Salander, who is as talented at computer hacking as she is lacking of social comportment.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a sort of sexpot journalist. The old guy (played in the movie by Christopher Plummer) turns out to have a mystery that he wants Blomkvist to investigate. Salander gets involved. Hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Oh, and the Ikea vibe? The thing is set in Sweden.<br /><br />The subsequent books, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest and The Girl Who Played With Fire, follow Salander and Blomkvist as they work with, against, and around each other, uncovering grotesque acts of violence against women.<br /><br />Because, rest assured, there is a lot of grotesque, a lot of violence, and a lot of women. I think the bleak Nordic setting really sets the mood here. You can understand how men (and women) could be driven to do horrible things. If an Ikea couch is slashed to pieces in the woods, does it make a sound? Though I could have done with fewer graphic rape scenes. I read that the author, Stieg Larsson, saw a woman get gang raped when he was young, and that started him on a crusade. A worthy cause, certainly, and one backed with shocking statistics. I'm proud to be an American, our lack of Ikeas aside.<br /><br />I had a little trouble following the characters, for they are many. And they make cultural references I don't always understand. And they have names with entirely more vowels than I am used to. Seriously, my last name as a \\"czk\\" in it, and I was completely befuddled by some of these surnames. Need to buy a vowel? ASK A SWEDE. Kidding aside, reading something that wasn't written in English, nor for Americans, was refreshing. It reminds me that the rest of the world has more to offer than Hello Kitty.<br /><br />Like many people, I found the books compelling and read them as quickly as I could. The mysteries themselves became less of a concern (not that I don't enjoy watching someone taking down a corrupt financier or solving a murder mystery, but I got Nancy Drew for that) as I found myself drawn to Lisbeth. Would she avenge those who'd wronged her? Would she reconcile with Mikael, or Mimmi, or Camilla? Lisbeth's existence seems impossible; she's such a contradiction of features, skills, and appearances. Yet there she is. I believed in her, I rooted for her, I wanted her to stop sunning herself in Gibraltar and GET ON WITH THE BUTT KICKING ALREADY.<br /><br />I'm not particularly interested in seeing the film(s), since I assume the grisly scenes with be even grislier in a dark theater full of strangers. But the books? Those I'll read again someday.ten in English, nor for Americans, was refreshing. It reminds me that the rest of the world has more to offer than Hello Kitty.

0062011847|4.0|Sam Vimes is off to the countryside for a much-resisted family holiday. Needless to say, his unerring nose for a crime ensures that he can crack a few heads, right a few wrongs, lean on a few upper class nobs and generally mix business with pleasure...<br /><br />This is Terry's 39th Discworld outing and they do just keep getting better. I have strong recollections of his earliest works and I think, if you lay Snuff alongside something like [[ASIN:0552124753 The Colour of Magic]] you really can see how his style has matured over the intervening 30 years (THIRTY YEARS! Gods!).<br /><br />Now, I know that there are plenty of fans who bemoan this progression and who yearn for the early days, but I used the word \\"matured\\" fairly carefully. So, Snuff is, like most of his more recent works, serious, dark, ironic and relevant, in comparison to the parodical, humorous and, yes, rather childish early novels. That's to be expected - he is really a far better author now than he was then; but let's be very clear, even the early Pratchett was a far better author than any of the current crop of popular fantasy authors (ahem - and authoresses, I shall name no names).<br /><br />In any case, despite now being a \\"grown-up\\" author, Pratchett easily manages to retain enough of his trademark humour that reading Snuff is still fun for readers of any age, despite the serious messages he is trying to convey. As evidence, I submit Sam's introduction to the game of Crockett...<br /><br />...\\"Vimes died. The sun dropped out of the sky, giant lizards took over the world, and the stars exploded and went out and all hope vanished and gurgled into the sinktrap of oblivion... And there, magically reincarnated, was Vimes, a little dizzy, standing on the village green looking into the smiling countenance of an enthusiast\\"<br /><br />However, it seems to me that Snuff is about the protection and emancipation of the downtrodden (by no means a new theme for Sir Terry) and who better to take the mantle of emancipator than Sam Vimes? liberator of golems, employer of zombies and trolls, protector of dragons and honorary blackboard monitor. Ironic really because, as head of the City Watch, Vimes is really Ankh Morpork's most powerful oppressor* and perhaps Terry has another message for us here. Who can say?<br /><br />All in all, this is typical, archetypal Pratchett.

0060899220|4.0|While the prefix \\"bad boy\\" has long been appended to the professions of rock star, movie star, and congressman, \\"bad boy chef\\" is a relatively new phenomenon. I mean, before Julia Child, cooking as a profession was considered a cop-out. The sort of thing you went to trade school for after realizing you weren't cut out for anything white collar. Actually, as Anthony Bourdain tells it in his memoir Kitchen Confidential, such was the case even in his days coming up as a chef.<br /><br />Bourdain learned young that his tastes for drugs and women wouldn't mesh well with the world of, say, investment banking. A few summers as dishwasher/errand boy at a New England seafood shack, though, made him realize that the motley crews and fraternity-like mindset of a restaurant kitchen was just the place.<br /><br />Unlike on the stage, screen, or Senate floor, in the kitchen, a man lives or dies by his skills. Bourdain attempted to ensure his survival by attending the Culinary Institute of America. Today? Renowned training institution. Back then? Trade school. But it gave him solid knowledge about food and its handling. Plus a fancy (and then, relatively rare) piece of paper to impress prospective employers.<br /><br />At this point, Bourdain began making his way in the restaurant world. The bulk of the book involves remembrances of the various joints and crews he worked for and with. The reader quickly learns that the foodservice world is a lot like the military. You have rank and order. If specs aren't followed, someone could get seriously hurt. Hey, you even have uniforms. The thing with a kitchen, though, is that the customer is sitting, oh, ha ha, twenty feet away and is HUNGRY. You either bang out the product or find yourself without a job. (If only the armed forces worked the same way.)<br /><br />Bourdain, of course, eventually becomes the top chef. The book was written before he REALLY struck it big, with Travel Channel programming (that's the basis of his second book, A Chef's Tour), public snarking about Rachael Ray, etc. By reading the book, though, you get a little insight into the man (flaws and all) behind the public figure. As said RR criticism shows, Bourdain is unabashed with criticism, whether it involves detailing his drug habits, admiration for a fellow chef, or utter loathing for vegetarians. Bourdain may be used to spinning plates, but you'll never find him spinning bs.ael Ray, etc. By reading the book, though, you get a little insight into the man (flaws and all) behind the public figure.

0316044938|4.0|\\"No one could have predicted how my loss would change small moments on Earth.\\"<br /><br />We all like to think that our lives matter. All men are created equal and whatnot. But let's be honest: if I suddenly disappeared, far fewer people would be affected than if the same happened to President Obama. Or even that \\"Can you hear me now?\\" guy from the Verizon commercials. Just the way the cookie crumbles.<br /><br />Examining just how one life influences and is influenced by others, though, often makes for a good read.<br /><br />\\"Horror on earth is real and it is every day. It is like a flower or like the sun; it cannot be contained.\\"<br /><br />In 1973, 14-year-old Susie Salmon is raped and killed by a creepy neighbor man. Through the magic of narrative devices, she hangs around some sort of tweeny heaven (it's between earth and the thereafter, so it's...tweeny...yeah, go with it) and watches over those she left behind. The parents. The siblings. The boyhood crush. The friends, both those she knew she had and those she didn't.<br /><br />Honestly, between this and The Virgin Suicides, I'm starting to wonder how young women make it to adulthood at all. I've probably been living on borrowed time for YEARS, eh?<br /><br />While things don't end happily for everyone (do they ever?), enough people (including Susie herself) find absolution that the reader is satisfied.<br /><br />I came away from The Lovely Bones most of all with a sense of melancholy. You know how bittersweet unrequited love is. This was the story of an unrequited LIFE. I mean, Susie did eventually realized that she could figuratively (and briefly, literally) live through others. But it's not quite the same, is it?<br /><br />\\"These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections--sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent--that happened after I was gone.... The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future.\\"
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I have had this case for about two weeks and it has been working well. It looks like an older book and is very soft, convincing enough to pass as authentic leather. The suede inside keeps the screen of my Kindle looking new. I have this in red and the design on the outside is subtle and very nice. The gold trim looks very good as well.   The main complaint people seem to be having is the elastics being too tight. It is relatively simple to put in the case and it stays secured. The bands have not caused me any problems and are staying strong. The kindle does not move at all in the case but can easily be removed and placed back in.   While some say the case doesn't lay flat, I have had no problems with this at all. If this is a problem, just flip it over for the night and by morning it will be fine. It settled flat within a day or so. In fact, the binding on mine has gotten somewhat soft which I was not expecting but seems like it will stay sturdy.  I would love if there was something to hold it closed however, but that would ruin the design. Also, since I have the red, the spine is still tan. I was not expecting that but after a little bit I got used to that and it isn't a big enough issue to actually complain about.   All in all this is really well made and the perfect choice for me. It is well made, shipped in two days and is keeping my kindle nice. I never take it out of the case since it is so easy to read while in the case and not at all bulky. I would definitely recommend this case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great and i really enjoy it. gives me lots of things to do when i am bored at home
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so far, I'm addicted to this app!!!! really fun games!!! I like that you can replay games to keep earning credits!
0439023521|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I don't generally like sci-fi, but the human side of the story line is a nice balance against the fantasy. The author has a nice style and keeps things moving along. So why not 5 star? Some elements are predictable and the general concept of the Hunger Games is a bit of a ripoff of Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was going to play for a few minutes but couldn't put the game down! for a free game this one rocks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. I can play anywhere! I take it everywhere I go. I highly recommend this game. You won't. be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun, addictive and sometimes very frustrating. I keep coming back. The game works well and I don't mind the Adds, it's free, so it's worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it!!! such a awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm always playing it!! I can never put down my kindle fire I love playing it!!!!
1848581777|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this package. Taking it out of the slip case, I discovered a complete facsimile of this classic, down to the cover. All of John Leech's illustrations are here. As for the novel itself, it is Dickens' best. A time honored Christmas classic for all-time. This is the edition to get!
B002GHHHH4|5.0|My son is a Sylvestor Stallone fan and it's rubbed off onto my grandson. This was just another addition to their collection. As far as the order is concerned, all went smoothly. I coudn't have expected any better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was fun until it asks you to update and then it makes you start over and re earn your games
0553278398|1.0|Don't waste your time reading this stuff.  In spite of his reputation, it's hard not to think that the author is an imbecile.  His characters are nitwits.    His other novel, \\"Foundation\\" is not so bad, but you might like to stay away from that too if you prefer hard SF.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game its just annoying that you need so many points to unlock a new game but other then that its good.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Hasta ahora es el mejor procesador que he tenido. Muy buenas prestaciones, altamente recomendado y muy buena experiencia de compra en Amazon.com!! Lo recomiendo 100%!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app because it gives you a challenge while you're having fun!!! It is also a great way to help you build your game skills.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game doesn't have any fancy lights, or techno music, but it does have an old time feel to it, but with modern puzzles. The levels get pretty challenging, well worth the dollar for a few hours of entertainment.
0618680004|4.0|I rented this book from the library previously and it was so interesting I had to buy a copy.  It's a very dense book - you really have to read it closely - I had to reread several sections, but it contains so many interesting points and I reference it constantly in day to day life.  For a long time, I kind of leaned towards atheism but felt afraid to admit it, this book has given me the confidence to admit it freely and it really made me think about my beliefs (or lack of them) and feel more comfortable with them.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00008G7UJ|1.0|I was unable  to review this DVD as being in Australia it will not work on my DVD player as we use a PAL system.  However when I originally saw this movie at the cinema I loved it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The perfect book to break in on my new Kindle!  So well written and plotted that it kept me turning pages well in to the wee hours of the morning.  I'm not going to restate the plot in this review.  Others have pretty well covered that.     Ever wonder what wonder where our seemingly insatiable need for reality TV and acceptance of the status quo might take us?  Suzanne shows us in a post apocalyptic world.  She takes the boy-meets-girl  us-versus-them  meets survivor theme and turns it on its head keeping both adults and kids interested.  I was reluctant to read what people told me was a kid's book.  But, rest-assured, the book has very adult themes (violence, brutality not sex).  In fact, there is some kissing, but not a lot and not in the usual way you would think a boy-meets-girl story might use kisses.        I too was reminded of Shirley Jackson's  short story The Lottery which I read in middle school.  But, what was implied in The Lottery is spelled out for the reader in Hunger Games.  Therefore, I would say that this book would be more in tune which a 12 year old or older rather than a 10 year old.  But, then again my 10 year old niece read R. L. Stein, so what do I know?  I can't wait for the movie..............or the sequel!!!!!!!!!!!
B0066W1AZK|1.0|this game is rigged. several times it has glitches and replaced my piece with its own. it also can check mate you without it being check mate. don't support this ap it needs an overhaul. watch your pieces it really does cheat, no joke.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|For any fan of Blade Runner, the five-disc bluray set is an absolute must!  All the different cuts of the film, tons of extras, and a transfer so amazing it makes everything new again after all these years!  The video quality is simply stunning.  I could not be happier with the final product.  This release is a celebration of a film worth celebrating.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|lots of neat features and very accurate.  my favorite part isit the hourly forecast whether you are looking for temperature or chance of rain
B006RUJST6|5.0|I am a big Avett Brothers fan and found out about this book on the message boards on their website. I normally don't read much but I thought with everyone talking about how good this book was maybe I'd better check it out! I'm glad I did! It was a great read! I read it in a day and for me that's really saying something! Of course I loved the little dose of Avett lyrics before each chapter. It was amazing how well they seemed to fit the situations in this book! But all Avett's aside I really enjoyed the story too. I laughed and cried several different times and I just don't do that with books so it must be good! Thank you Collen and good luck with your writing career!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pros: it keeps entertained and gives me something to do Cons: some games are a bit hard to accomplish. it lags in movement.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I was excited to see this app as today's FAoTD. As a father of a 2 1/2 year old I'm sure she's going to love playing it on our Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9. So far it seems to work great. I can't wait to show her tonight.  My only complaints are a) the cloud transitions, while cute, are too slow and b) I would prefer a back button in the game as she doesn't quite get the Honeycomb soft keys.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This is one of the best CDs Taylor has put out in a while. The DVD consists of about 17 song and when you watch it, you wish you had gone to one of them live !!!!!!   The only thing that is missing is that not all the song on the cd has a live performance on the DVD, and likewise not all the live performances is a song on the cd....... Otherwise than that I have nothing to complaine about!!   If you are a real Taylor Swift fan you should buy this cd/DVD concert!!! :)
B00049QQHI|5.0|The packaging was fine and it arrived quickly. Thank you veryuch for your excellent service. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
B003L77GGA|5.0|Ordered as Christmas gift.  This completed the series.  It arrived quickly and without damage.  Great to have the final one on Blueray.  It shows the progress of technology throughout the running of the series!
B000UR9T82|5.0|This movie was awesome!  The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
B005GVF95O|5.0|This is a good fun activity for the little ones. I find myself visiting the free app for the day just to read the fun witty comments from the resident writer, Superman75, and often skip the download all together. Although boring for older folks, I came are my kids enjoying this game. Thanks developer for making it and thanks Amazon for giving it out for free... as for Superman75, bravo,  keep up the fun!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to read and follow. Easily read a verse or go on to read a full chapter. Easily set up plans for studying too.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|It's stargate what more can i say other than Awesome shipped fast packaged well great addition to my blu ray collection reccomend to anyone looking for a great movie in blu ray format.
0385534639|4.0|I avoided this book due to the hype and because the description sounded eerily like The Illusionist (at the time the descriptions did not say the magicians would fall in love).  Well I needed a book I thought my wife would like for a road trip, and took a chance on the Night Circus.  I am glad I did.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Although the movement past and forth between the past and present was confusing at first.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Well, started with the initial standard release, then got the Sapphire two movie release with Gladiator and now the Sapphire Blu Ray.  Not interested in summarizing the plots and acting techniques, just the quality of the DVD itself.<br /><br />The video is quite stunning.  Beautiful transfer translates to beautiful, rich and deep colors and details even in the darkest of areas.  I have no complaints at all.  Just gorgeous.<br /><br />The audio is Dolby True HD 5.1 and sounds good.  Most of the film takes place in front of the camera and therefore most of the audio is placed in the front stage of your audio system.  The actual music score is evenly spread across the sound stage very nicely. While the rear channels are used primarily for ambience, not much discreet channeling takes place here.  I would think, that for the battle scenes, especially, the rears could have had more foley effects directed to them.  Not so.  The sub gets down pretty deep in parts but overall, while good, I would not use this DVD as an audio demo.  I might use the video as a demo, just not the audio.<br /><br />This is a two disc set and the first disc(with the film) has a very interesting historical timeline with much to read as well as accompanying short documentaries .  Since this movie is not reality 100% historically accurate, this timeline is quite beneficial and interesting for those who enjoy historical aspects as I do.  The second disc contains many other extras that I also welcomed tho I am not usually enamored with DVD extras.<br /><br />I give the movie as entertainment 5 stars.  The video 5 stars and the audio 3.5 stars.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I picked up the Hunger Games after a friend on FaceBook commented that she was sad the last book had ended.  I flew through these books on the Kindle Fire (no waiting by the mailbox) in just a few days.  I recommended the trilogy to my best friend, who finished them more quickly than I had!  I read in an article sometime later, that these books were written for younger readers, teens and young adults, but I am sooo much older and absolutely fell in love with them.  Katniss Everdeen is a kick butt hero who has her heart in the right place at all times... even when she doesn't realize it.  Folks of all ages will enjoy these books.
0545265355|5.0|I highly recommend this seller. I could not have found a better deal on an awesome book series! Plus, it made an awesome Christmas gift :)

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|We saw this one at least eight times on the big screen and now we have the DVD. Paris is lovely at anytime of day, but especially when the damp pavement is illuminated after dark. Oh... and the story is quite charming too. Meander narrow cobblestoned rues with a present-day screenwriter who finds himself hob nobbing with historic literary and arts figures who lived during the 1920s and Belle Epoque eras. Magnifique ! Beautiful cinematography. Woody's finest effort since Manhatten.

B00000G6H1|4.0|It was overshadowed by its irresistable title track, one of the top 10 biggest hits of the 1980s, but \\"Physical\\" is a surprisingly enduring LP which demonstrates Olivia Newton-John's effervescence and ability to entertain. Whether giving voice to soft, simpering ballads or upbeat, guilty pleasure pop, she is always in control and convincing.<br /><br />The album is anchored by many strong songs. \\"Love Make Me Strong\\" is a bold, catchy call to attention with a muscular arrangement, while the soft, slick, whisper-thin balladry of \\"Silvery Rain\\" becomes increasingly impossible to shake from memory with every spin. An ambitious piece of songwriting with a melody that upwells and then descends, it is at once proof that the technology of the '80s could encourage fine recording studio creativity.<br /><br />The same goes for the unfairly addictive \\"Stranger's Touch.\\" It should have been the third single instead of \\"Landslide,\\" which is a fine piece of pop craftsmanship but is faceless by comparison. Newton-John's voice goes up and down the scales of \\"Stranger's Touch\\" with flair and verve, exuding just the right blending of sensuality and innocence. Her fade-out vocals alone are glossy and unrestrained, creating an extra melodic hook before the song concludes.<br /><br />Not only is this set of particularly strong tunes built around a pair of solid hits (the ever-suggestive \\"Physical\\" and the also enjoyable \\"Make a Move on Me\\"), but they are also suited ideally for Olivia Newton-John's limited yet supremely elegant vocal range, making the ingredients rub together to create a highly winning formula that carries all the way through to the lovely, mood-setting conclusion of \\"The Promise (The Dolphin Song).\\"<br /><br />Olivia Newton-John had other hits and strong career highlights, but she was at her height of fame at the time of this LP's release, and the material justifies that heavy exposure. It is simply a strong set of pop tunes delivered by an excellent singer - a prescription record executives and the general public can both agree on.ral public can both agree on.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|I don't think this book is intended for Creationists or IDers, like some reviewers discuss. Those who are sorely in denial of evolution have already made up their minds and are too far gone to be spoken rationally to. This Dawkins' masterpiece is for those who don't necessarily deny evolution by natural selection, but who haven't quite articulated it to themselves yet. In short, it forces readers to think rationally about how science continues to answer questions that were previously filled with supernatural explanations. It is a mind-boggling, magnificent view of our existence, by way of billions of small evolutionary steps. Even a basic grasp of this Darwinian view of life should force readers to embrace their wonderful, extremely insignificant, existence as a cosmic speck on a speck on a speck on a speck. For an ego-centric Creationist, this is too wide a gap to comprehend.
B002BWP49M|5.0|You won't get a lot of things unless you watch the rest of the saga, and please read the books. It's not about the the special scenes, like in Harry Potter, this movie is all about the background story. I have to say I was impressed with Kristen's acting, she did an amazing job this time, perfect Bella, she nailed the character.<br /><br />I would advise to buy the complete saga and watch them in order if you want to see this movie.

1451629184|2.0|Rating this book was very difficult. As a person I find Jaycee Dugard to be very inspirational and courageous. I feel as though rating this book lower than a five was insulting to her story. However I had to remind myself that I was rating a book, not a life story, and thus the 2 star rating. It is well known that Jaycee only had a 5th grade education before she was abducted, and while I understand that she enjoys writing and it was part of her healing process, but I feel as though this book could have greatly benefited from a ghost writer. It was quite boring and repetitive.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are easier than others. its definitely addictive. found that some of the touch controls are a little more difficult to manuver but a good app so far.
0061928356|4.0|This book is beautifully written. The sections of the book about classism and sexism in India are both informative and heartbreaking. I love the way the story unfolds and most of the characters are so richly drawn. The only part where the book fumbles a bit is regarding Somer, who seems almost cartoonish in comparison to the other more vibrant characters
6305313687|3.0|I wasn't sure where this 1998 film was going, at least partly because of its weird quash of cinematic styles. We see lots of compelling black and white photography, ominous film score and, especially, an awful lot of slow-motion shots. Interspersed amid the b&w are many episodes shot in color. There's a deep undertone of violence from the opening moments when we see the star, Norton, interrupted while having sex in order to dash outside and shoot the two hoods burglarizing his car. We are then subjected to back and forth time shifting, on top of all the other movie-making gimmicks. At heart, the message is that hate kills. However, I was unconvinced that the white supremacist skinhead who went to prison for the killings would ever emerge fully cured of his racism, as we are expected to believe here. There's not much plot. Just a lot of family interaction set in a grim-looking Venice Beach far from the tourist magnet we normally see there. This is a preachy film. Worth watching, I guess.
B006RED4GA|4.0|The thing you want to know before going into a Ti West film is that he spends a lavish amount of time setting tone, developing the main characters and building up dread before a roller coaster ride in the last fifteen minutes. If you know that going in, you're less likely to stop paying attention too early, so you get the full payoff at the end. House of the Devil was like that and The Innkeepers uses the same pacing. West does some subtle and interesting things with perspective, especially with the audio, and as usual the actors are well chosen. Sarah Paxton believably disappears into the role of a geeky young woman who works at a hotel that might be haunted. The setup is this: The Yankee Pedlar Inn is about to close, and two longtime employees are determined to prove once and for all that a local legendary haunting is true. They spend the night and get more than they bargained for. West shows a gift for realistic characters having utterly believable conversations while the fantastic goes on around them. This is part of what makes his films so immersive. The haunting is also well translated, with just enough left unexplained to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. One mistake modern ghost films make is to try to explain too much about the ghost's motivations. West leaves enough to your imagination to keep you feeling creeped out after the movie is over. The score helps too, with a nice balance of cooing chorus and urgent strings. One thing I wish they hadn't done, though, was the little Looney Tunes musical cue whenever Paxton's character was about to have a moment of chagrin. Still and all, The Innkeepers is a highly effective little ghost story that will leave you thinking about the characters, and some of the things the characters said, long after the movie is finished.
1846142733|3.0|History books are a real problem ! Are they objectively reliable or an individual take on the past ? Ferguson's credentials as a historian at Harvard made me think he belonged to the first category but on reading there's a lot of the second. The book was made to become a TV series in the UK, and it shows. There's a fair amount of Flanders and Swan (\\"The English, the English, the English are best, I wouldn't give twopence for all of the Rest ...\\"), combined with a number of dismissive asides such as a swipe at \\"man-made global warming\\" being seductive to \\"unscientific minds\\", which makes you wonder what's going on. Interesting ideas, a brilliant mind, highly informed and entertaining ... but is it genuine, is it true ? I don't know. And as the pages go by, there's growing, uncomfortable feeling that this is history for an audience and it will evaporate in the morning. But definitely good fun.

0547258305|4.0|When you are as much of a fan of fantasy as I am you end up reading about a lot of awesome adventures, surreal magic, fantastical worlds, and thrilling battles, you also unfortunately read a lot of sexist crap. Women can do this, they can't do that. Women either marry or go into the convent or become a shrew. Women can't fight, can't defend themselves, can't learn certain trades, can't rule, can't lead, can't strategize, can't go anywhere alone, or do anything without men's approval. It. Gets. Grating. This coming from someone who loves fantasy but who also gets a little sick of being told what her gender can and can't do all the time.<br /><br />Then comes &lt;em>Graceling&lt;/em>. What am awesome, surreal, fantastical, and thrilling breath of fresh air! Graceling is set in a medieval era Europeanish world called The Seven Kingdoms. There are wonderfully complex politics at play and fiendish plots afoot and then we get to the people. Certain people within the various kingdoms are called Gracelings, these people have been Graced with a specific talent. Our main character, Katsa, learns at the tender age of eight that she has been Graced with the talent of killing people when she accidentally kills her step cousin who was making unwanted advances.<br /><br />She is then trained by her uncle the King and instead of being given a position of prominence in the kingdom for being Graced she is treated more as a lap dog that gets sent to do the dirty work. This all changes when she meets Po, a prince who has been Graced with combat skills. Plots are uncovered, alliances are threatened, politics come into play and soon Katsa finds herself involved in a quest to save a kidnapped child. Her special Grace is needed desperately, but is it in the way she expects?<br /><br />I loved this book. Carried all the way through was this fantastic feminist message that shined through Katsa. She was tough and spirited though granted she was a little wild at the beginning, but that's to be expected after being treated like an animal by her uncle's court. She was feared and mistreated more for her Grace than her gender, which was refreshing. While she was strong she also had true heart that made her endearing and human. The romance also was wonderful to read about. It was built up slowly and believably and remained respectful of them both, so rare in YA romance. It was a welcome addition to the story.<br /><br />The world she was in was amazing as well, and not just because of the fascinating concept of Gracelings or the complex politics of the Seven Kingdoms. Marriage was a choice for women, not a need. Men were permitted the luxury of feeling and even of crying when all was lost. Gender conformity was not an over-driving need as it is traditionally in fantasy and that was true straight to the last and I'm glad the author made that tough call. That is not to say that all was roses. There were still unwanted sexual advances and comments made about various young women, there were still attempts at forced/arranged marriages, and there were still kingdoms that chose not to educate or empower their women or teach them how to protect themselves. But for a fantasy book, a genre famous for brutally enforcing gender roles, this book was amazingly progressive.  It made &lt;em>Graceling&lt;/em> a wonderful and magical rare breed of truly empowering fantasy centered around a truly powerful woman.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|Watching Fringe has restored my faith in network (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, CW and the like) television.  Just when I thought smart, sophisticated, mind-bending television couldn't be found without cable, I discovered Fringe!    This show will absolutely suck you in and won't let go until you've had repeated viewings, annoyed your friends by how much you talk about the show, and left you in withdrawals until the next season begins.    Additionally, it's made all the better in this blu-ray release with tons of great bonus content and the picture and audio are beyond reproach!
0547260695|5.0|Le Petit Prince has been written by a French aristocrat poet and writer known as Antonie de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry and published in 1943.<br /><br />The little prince is the antithesis of human nature during the second world war with its loneliness, selfishness  and blindess of ourselves portraited by the boa constrictor.<br /><br />The boa constrictor has the ability of enchant and then spread the seed of the selfishness in another organism like the little prince mainly because he has not been \\"tamed\\" by the humans.<br /><br />Politically speaking the little prince is a good politician because he takes care of his little planet and its inhabitants for a common good.<br /><br />Fortunately the description of the human nature is not yet at the end but inside us there is the hope of a better world with a reasons and ideals.<br /><br />In my opinion another symbolism of the human race is the \\"baobas\\" i.e. a sort of Babel's tower were the humans won't be able to communicate between them properly for a lack of a divine guide.<br /><br />Cheers<br />IP
1452101248|5.0|I bought this cookbook on a bit of a whim, and I'm so glad I did! I have dozens and dozens of cookbooks and really didn't need another one, but I must have been feeling weak when I stumbled across this one. When I received it, I read it from cover to cover, and, although the pictures are amazing, I wasn't sure how much I would like it because the recipes require a fair amount of prep time and some require ingredients that I just can't find in nowhere Missouri. I had to give it a try, though, so I plowed ahead anyway, substituting where I could (onions for shallots, regular lentils for small dark ones, molasses for kecap manis). I started by making eggplant croquettes and black pepper tofu, which were absolutely amazing. I am the only vegetarian in my family, so the smell of scorching eggplants and frying tofu didn't do much for them (I could hear distant mutters about ordering pizza), but everyone loved the final dishes, and there was no more discussion about pizza. I was concerned that the recipe for the black pepper tofu called for 5 Tbs of pepper - it seemed like a LOT, and it was, but it was excellent. I've also made the Surprise Tatin, which was wonderful and looked exactly like the picture, which I count as a minor victory. Last night I made the lentils with broiled eggplant, one of the simpler dishes, which was enjoyed by all. It took about 40 minutes from start to finish and had excellent depth and flavor. I did add some roasted garlic, since I was roasting the carrots anyway, and I think it made a wonderful addition.   All in all, this is an excellent cookbook with recipes that the whole family can enjoy. I admit that my family is more used to vegetarian cooking than most, but it's hard to miss the meat when presented with such beautiful dishes full of flavor. And for those who can't imagine a plate without it, Ottolenghi often offers helpful suggestions for meant accompaniments in the header notes.

B006MHWXMS|4.0|Though this app does have some rough edges, such as having trouble syncing to google tasks, it accomplishes its goal perfectly. And, it is updated often. Yesterday, one review stated that there was a bug where January had 32 days. An update was released today to fix it.  So, it's a great app. It's interface it quick and simple to use, it can send notifications, and it is an all-around useful app.
B003U80I5G|1.0|This is the lowest quality DVD I have ever purchased. I just received it and watched it today.  Even the YouTube upload of this \\"Jane Eyre\\" is better quality than this DVD.  The red tone fades in and out during the the opening and closing scenes.  Much of the screen is so dark so often you can't tell what is happening.  I only bought it because I had the other 8 adaptations of this great English classic, most of which I really enjoy.  I think that even if the color and continuity were as good as the original broadcast 40+ years ago, this would still be the worst of the nine: worst screenplay, worst cast, worst everything.

The show only lasted a year. It is not heavy in the drama as many shows, and it has light hearted humor makes the show entertaining. The action is slow but not boringly.
0547581033|4.0|This story is absolutely darling and the illustrations are beautiful.  We plan to make it a regular part of our bedtime routine (daughter is only 3 months) and I fell in love with it the second I read it.  Not sure how I feel yet about the book size.  Another reviewer pointed out the large book would make it difficult for a child to hold, which is true.  (Since our daughter isn't holding the book yet that hadn't occurred to me.)  On the other hand, since I'm currently holding her in my lap, and reading by holding the book myself, the larger size makes it easier for me to hold the pages with my arms around her; rather than trying to turn tiny pages and support her in my arms at the same time.  So there are ups and downs to both size options.  I love that it's a board book since we plan to read it frequently and that will increase it's lifespan.  Guess time will tell if the size becomes cumbersome or not.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was really a great find!  I don't normally read this type of book but gave it a shot because it was...well... free.  I was drawn into the characters and laughed and cried right along with them.  I definitely suggest picking it up and giving it a shot, even if it's not your normal type of thing to read!

B005HJU7HA|4.0|Contrary to what some have written in their review about Part 2 of \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" as being the book of Mormon...It isn't. Before you believe what they have written, at least take a look at the Wikipedia article that talks about Part 2: [...]  The review that says the stories from \\"His Last Bow\\" are not listed separately in the Table of Contents is correct.  As for the actual content? I have yet to read it, but seeing as it's a classic writing, I'm sure it's fine. :)

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This Blu-Ray set is awesome!  I enjoyed all 6 movies, so what?!  Am I not a TRUE fan of Star Wars?  So he changed some things from the original.  Yeah it might suck but its Star Wars on Blu-Ray. My Blu-Ray copy of Dumb and Dumber has some scenes that werent on the original, but I would rather put up with those scenes than not have it at all and Dumb and Dumber is the best movie ever made. Superb Picture and Sound.  This will be a treasured part of my media collecction for years to come.

B003KMERDG|4.0|Not the best movie I've ever seen, but still entertaining.  Bernadette Peters is an absolute gem!  She alone makes this movie worth watching.  Bernadette can easily transition from comedy to drama in any situation.  Clint Eastwood, however, seemed a bit awkward in the comedic scenes, though he made up for it when it came time to take care of business.   Overall, I liked it and would watch it again.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|101 Games + 16 seems an interesting concept. However in reality it dos not live up to the ideal. The game play controls are very unintuitive and unusable in most cases. The annoying advert at the bottom however was the reason I uninstalled it. Three times in one game I mishit it and ended up in Amazon silk asking me if I wanted to buy something. I have no problems with free games having ads but please place it in an unobtrusive place where people don't hit it by mistake.<br /><br />The two games I played were interesting but difficult due to the controls not responding in a timely manner. I have played lots of games on the Kindle Fire but this is the first one I have had difficulty with.<br /><br />If they improved the game controls and moved the ad to a different part of the screen - I would download it again and give it another chance.
B001E45XT4|5.0|First, I saw this product at Best Buy. $90. I paid about $36 with shipping. You cannot beat that price.  Now, on to the review. I love this headset. If I am on my computer, it is usually on. The sound is amazing, and believe all of the reviews that comment on the bass; I oonts all of the time :P  I had one small problem when it arrived: in the left headphone, there was a loose screw, and every time that I would move my head, I could hear it moving around. With a quick flip of the head, it lodged itself somewhere inside, and I have not heard of it since. It does not ruin the sound.  Do not let that little thing make you think that this product is a piece of junk. It was a small problem, probably with only mine (I would not know, I have not asked around :P)  Do one thing: buy this product. I love it, and cannot praise it any higher!

B005MYEQ4U|1.0|This is an hour and a half I've wasted on a bunch of no talent \\"actors\\" working with a contrived, unfunny script.
0307593312|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Murakami. I've sought out even his works not published in the States, have a shelf dedicated to his books, and have given his novels as presents to good friends. I'd eagerly anticipated \\"1Q84.\\" I decided to purchase it as soon as I was done with my semester in university and sit down and read it through as a gift to myself. What a horrible disappointment. All the artifacts of Murakami's previous novels feature prominently in 1Q84, including themes of isolation, animals that might be communicating with people, surrealism, classical music, a fixation on naming each and every article of clothing and accessory that rounds out what are otherwise exceedingly flat characters, allusions to Chekov, and a plot that is written more like a \\"pirate's map\\" characterized by indirection, subtly, and fantasy. The protagonist, Tengo, could easy be the same character from Norwegian Wood or Sputnik Sweetheart: he is a loner, intensely introspective, physically fit, and a prolific reader and sometimes writer. These aren't necessarily qualities that detract from Murakami's work--they are his bread and butter and have worked excellently in his previous novels--but 1Q84 hinges essentially on their repetition, devoid of substance, and forced together with so little craft that the resulting \\"story\\" is so trite and pointless that it becomes a more a chore to read. I can't help but see 1Q84 as a gimmick of Murakami's talent; I feel sorry for any new readers who come first to this novel, such a repetitive and vacuous piece of literature is hardly worth the nine-hundred plus pages of paper it's written upon.

0307593312|2.0|I anticipated the English translation of Murakami's latest work with baited breathe. In other countries these three books were released separately but we are lucky enough to receive them all together as one solid work. It's important to remember that these are three separate books in a trilogy because as you trudge through all 924 pages some of the pain of reading this work can be subsided if you take a break between books. It also helps because it largely explains why each book recaps so much of what's happened in the previous ones and also why the three act structure of most books do not apply here. Every book starts off with a brand new first act.    I've been in love with Murakami's writing since \\"The Wind up Bird Chronicles\\" and have read all of his fiction and most of his nonfiction books since then. He's had some ups and downs but for the most part he's a very talented writer with a gift for blending the real with the surreal. Even when he set aside his love of magic realism, as in \\"Norwegian Wood\\" or \\"South of the Border West of the Sun,\\" the beauty of his prose, simplicity of his characters, and his love of pop culture make his books worth reading. He's mostly known for having the spiritual unseen metaphysical world come crashing down on his passive protagonists.    This brings me to 1Q84 and to what I belief is his worst book to date. Yes far worse than \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\" and \\"Dance, Dance, Dance.\\" This one book manages to capture all of the tiny flaws in his past works and magnify them ten-fold on every page. On the surface many of his trademarks are in full effect: pop culture song and film references-check, passive protagonists caught up in a mystery-check, a portal to a magic world-check, and an over-all philosophical over tone to the way characters speak-check. There are many more that I won't mention but trust me they're all here and where they were once endearing I now find them annoying, so much so that I forced myself to finish the book when time and time again I considered throwing the book out the window.  Murakami makes so many classic mistakes I can't believe this is the same author of \\"Wild Sheep Chase\\" or \\"Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World.\\" 1Q84 never quite takes off after the initial set up and there is so much wrong with the book I feel like writing a three part review just to make sure I don't miss a single beat. First and foremost any writing class will tell you to always \\"show\\" and not \\"tell\\" when writing. Over and over again Murakami insists on telling us every detail about a character without having the characters ever do anything to earn their own worth. There is so much inaction in this book you could probably cut each book in half if you left only the characters and their actions on the page. Instead we are treated to page after page of information, which includes a nauseating recap of past events, telling us how characters feel and their past lives, but all the while very few actions are taken by the protagonists Tengo and Aomame.  They are hands down the two worst protagonists in the Murakami family of characters.   Every character spends the last two books stuck in rooms. Tengo in his father's room. Aomame in her hide out, and Ushikawa in his apartment. When they're not sitting in rooms they're out taking walks and looking at the moon over and over again. It's maddening, frustrating, and I cannot believe nobody had the guts to grab Murakami and ask him if he seriously thought this was compelling fiction. In the end that's the books worst crime: the book does not engage the reader instead it spoon feeds you information and never allows you any room to dissect the characters or their actions.   His next major offense is inexplicably introducing a new narrative thread in book three seemingly out of the blue. Private detective Ushikawa is given his own chapters in book three and half the time he's busy figuring out what we already know about Tengo, Aomame, and the story thus far. What we're left with are two boring protagonists and a detective whose mystery we've already solved. 1Q84 is a work that falters at every turn.  Whenever the characters finally did act I found myself waking up , it was almost startling, \\"a character is finally doing something!\\" I'd say only to find that a few pages later Murakami returns them back to their dull state of sitting in rooms doing nothing.   Murakami is at a point in his career where no editor can tell him what to do and unfortunately that's the only way I can imagine this book made it passed his agent, editors, and publishing house with all of these mistakes intact. He's put a lot of work birthing what amounts to a still born baby of a book. It's sterile, dry, humorless, and never engages the reader. We never grow attached to Tengo or Aomame and the magic realism is never quite magical enough.    Worst of all the entire books romance is centered around one child holding another child's hand when they were in elementary school. I don't think anyone would fall in love with anyone else based on such a simple and superficial event. Murakami builds his romance on this premise alone and expects us to swoon as our protagonists search for one another claiming they are in love. Even if you gave in to this absurd notion so much of what they believe about each other is merely mental guess work and since they don't meet until the end, after a while you can't help but think to yourself how asinine it all feels.   The real problem here is that 1Q84 is the classic passion project gone wrong. Inspired by good ideas but ends up soul less and empty. 1Q84 is an alternate dimension of boredom.  This book is for diehard fans only; who love Murakami enough to endure this magnum opus of a disaster only to say they've read it and lived to tell the tale.

0312641893|5.0|I got an eGalley of this book to review through NetGalley(dot)com.  It was an excellent read, incredibly creative yet it still remained true to the feel of the original Cinderalla fairy tale.  It was a fairy tale with so much more added to the mix.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg who works as a mechanic and has been adopted into a family; she has a foster mother and two sisters as well as a faithful android companion.  All Cinder wants to do is fix things and build up enough money to leave at some point.  When the Prince stops by to have his android fixed, things start to change for Cinder.  Then when Cinder's youngest sister comes down with the plague, Cinder is blamed and sold off to research.  There Cinder finds out many things about her past and ends up embroiled in politics and facing off with the evil Lunar Queen.<br /><br />This story is part fairy tale, part steampunk, and part science fiction.  Cinder was a wonderful character she is capable and technically saavy and is constantly chaffing at the restrictions placed on her by her foster mother.  Prince Kai is also an intriguing character; despite his life of privilege he confronts things with an honesty that is refreshing and is non-judgmental until he knows the facts.<br /><br />The world created is an interesting and intriguing one.  This is a future Earth, the story itself takes place in New Bejing.  Humanity is facing a horrible plague that has been going on for years and can't be stopped.  In addition to this the Lunars, an alien race living on the moon, are ruled by a persuasive and evil Queen.  This Queen wants Earth for her own and seeks to gain entry into Earth politics by marrying Prince Kai.<br /><br />There are just a lot of very interesting elements here.  Cinder is a second tier citizen because of her cyborg status; so there is a lot of discussion around second class citizens and what it means to be human.  There is the plague; which is allowing questionable research to be carried out as well as forcing society to live under a veil of fear.  Then there are the Lunars who can take over people's minds and are constantly trying to take over Earth.<br /><br />There is just a lot going on and all of it is very interesting.  The writing is well done and the story is paced well.  In general it follows the original fairy tale pretty well; you have the wicked foster mother, the sisters, the missing slipper (in this case foot), and the Prince who needs a wife.  Unlike the fairy tale Cinder and Kai actually build a solid relationship and their falling in love is gradual and sweet.  They are alike in many ways and it is heartbreaking when any hope of a relationship between them is in jeopardy because of the Lunar Queen.<br /><br />There are a lot of surprises throughout the book, the story flows nicely but is hard to predict.  Things were wrapped up nicely in this book, but there is a lot that still needs to be resolved in the larger story.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this story.  It is a fairy tale retelling unlike any I have ever read before.  The characters are easy to relate to and engaging.  The world is creative and interesting.  The story blends together a lot of elements: steampunk, science-fiction, fairy tale, romance, alien invasion, and the question of the humanity of machines.  If you are a fan of fairy tale retellings definitely check this out.  If you are a fan of steampunk, fantasy, or science fiction I recommend checking this out as well.  It was just such an interesting story, I can't wait to see what the next book in the series brings.fear.

1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton  This one was a recommendation from a friend and at first glance, I wasn't sure.  The flowery designs and soft pictures of a country cottage looked exactly like somewhere I'd like to live but smacked of something Oprah would LOVE, which usually means I'd hate it.  But, I value the opinions of my friends and so I sat down with it.  Morton opens with a vivid scene depicting a four year old girl on a ship bound from England to Australia in 1913, hiding and waiting for someone to come for her.  Her descriptions are sharp but not overdone a la Anne Rice.  The story jumps from the little girl to the present where an old woman is dying and then proceeds to jump around and tell an amazingly intricate story from a number of times and perspectives.  Although at times the viewpoints did take some settling in, Morton's style is so highly descriptive the characters soon had their own personalities and the chapter jumps were no longer disruptive.    The girl on the boat, grown to an old woman who has died in our first few chapters leaves a granddaughter dealing with her own ghosts a mystery and a purpose.  This mystery doesn't give itself up easily to the granddaughter or the reader and held me until the very end.  The telling is beautifully crafted and reminiscent of The Secret Garden, Wuthering Heights, Dickens and some of my favorite fairy tales.  Check it out, you won't be sorry.  --HK Savage, Staccato Publishing
B002MJV75O|5.0|After reading all of the comments and reviews on the main page of the Dawson's Creek box set, I was nervous because a lot of them said bad things about the packaging. However, this box set turned out to be excellent and this is the best purchase I could have made. It was cheap and the whole box set came in the form of an album which was awesome for invoking some nostalgia in DC fans.   Best show ever!

B004XISI4A|4.0|Having adored books 1-3 and even liked A Feast for Crows, but felt that the pacing suffered (particularly for the geographical rather than chronological separation) I was really looking forward to A Dance with Dragons to kickstart the movement of the plot once more. I was overall pleased -the series gamechangers were quite busy, and progressing the plot nicely - and then, like a row of dominoes, everyone I loved fell prey to the UNNECESSARY CLIFFHANGER. I've read that a couple of sequences were reserved for the next book to facilitate getting this one out on time (hmm), and have since read a sample chapter that does offer insight into some of the latter events, but that doesn't feel like a good excuse to me - some threads at least could have been satisfactorily resolved without entirely removing fans' appetites for the next book, and certainly without the book taking significantly longer to publish. Oh well. Plenty of exciting stuff all the same, and I hope GRRMs withheld chapters will be dripfed in sufficient number to keep my crackpot theories afloat during the inevitably long, long wait for the follow-up...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really fun and a good way to pass the time. some things may get irritating but it just makes it funner
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is a great Christmas tradition in our family. Tho this is not my favourite, it is a good one. My kids and husband like it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game keeps my children occupied for hours. They love unlocking new games and challenging each other for fur highest scores. Fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really appreciate YouVersion for providing this app for free. It has a very nice user interface. I love the written Word. I really love the audio.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This works great for watching and last minute bidding when not at your computer. I was bummed that it doesn't have the ability to let you pay for won items.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I understand what others are saying about the sound quality, but we just turned up the volume alittle on our TV and found no difference. If you are buying this just to enjoy the movies than this is the product for you. If you have a home theater and want the best of the best and always comment on the clarity, sound, etc... than wait for the deluxe edition, but for the majority of us who just want the watch the movie it is perfect. Also, they are the full length of the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I Love this app! Very easy! Love this Bible. Very easy to navigate. The best part is that is Free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very addictive. I can't stop playing it. the variety of games is fairly good &amp; difficulty as you progress is fair too.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs. Zombies is one of my favorite Popcap games. It's so much fun and addicting! (: My only issue is it drains my battery fast and overheats my phone if played for too long.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I LOVE this cover! I had an M-Edge cover on my old Kindle, which was ok; I got a kindle fire for Christmas along with this cover (in tan) and it is PERFECT!!! The device fits perfectly; once I had broken in the cover a little bit, it laid completely flat.<br /><br />I am getting TONS of compliments on this cover. I love how soft the leather feels. It really does look like an old leather book. It's absolutely beautiful!
0439023521|5.0|No point in writing a long review as everything has already been said.  This is the first book I've read in a while that I truly couldn't put down.  Check it out, you won't regret it.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I purchased this app a while ago (10/1/11) on my phone and it worked great. Now they have made it such that my app that worked just fine is no longer able to be downloaded.   Amazon - Why should I purchase apps from your store when the Android market has the same ones and I have yet to have one taken away from me? On the same note why should I get a Kindle Fire if I might have to deal with the same issues?  UPDATE:  Amazon refunded my purchase, so at least they still have good customer service...even though the fact that this change happened still upsets me. I'm glad the Gamelof sale was still going in the Android Market so I was able to pick Uno up over there for $.99
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Case is lightweight and does provide decent protection for kindle fire.  However, corners already look \\"rubbed\\" and worn after only 2 weeks.
0307463745|5.0|I've been pondering the expression about \\"needing to take your medicine.\\" It's all about how the tough stuff is, well, tough. So a book that challenges you to rethink business needs to be dense, statistic-filled, and hard to read, right? Well, not exactly. Especially if that book is Rework.  37 Signals founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson have written a deceptively simple manifesto for entrepreneurs that is all about challenging conventional wisdom and the way that business ought to be done. It's written in brilliant one- and two-page bursts of ideas held together by big-picture business themes, much as the authors believe that you should focus on actually getting work done rather than spending all your time planning out what you should, could, or might do.  Or, as the authors write, \\"If you want to do something, you've got to do it now.\\"  As entrepreneurs themselves, Fried and Hansson \\"get it\\"; they understand that you can create a different path and succeed. They've done it, and we can too.
B0000Z0HMQ|1.0|This video, for some idiotic reason cannot be played on my DVD, or, my Laptop.. I pay money, and you send me garbage, made in some backward, 3rd world country!  Why could I not be sold videos that can played on my DVD AND my Laptop? You once sold me excellent first rate videos; now that I'm a customer, you've now resorted to passing on garbage to me.. KEEP THE MONEY! I never thought your people would stoop to thievery..!
1466401885|4.0|This book is very interesting and from the minute I picked it up could not put it back down. It takes you on this journey of love from a budding romance to the darker sides. Instead of focusing on one happy light hearted moment it takes you for a loop throwing you this way and that.<br /><br />Some of the plot seems a little far fetched and it is a little violent. At times I was wondering where the author might be headed for the romance, but in the end the book kept my eyes glued to the pages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the choices and ease of reading and listening.  would love to see more life application series. thank you for offering this for free.
0071762345|5.0|This is a very well-written how-to on social media marketing.

B004HO6I4M|4.0|I love this movie, the soundtrack, the story.  However, the movie skips quite a bit in the first 30 min.  This happen to when we Netflixed it a few months ago.  DVD manufacturer problem??
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really great. I am posting this because one... I want the points it promised. two it really is a good game.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|My 3.5 year old son loves this movie.  A great buy.  We have watched it so many times.  The DVD doesn't skip like my RIO one does.

B004Q3QRWC|3.0|Despite the promise of a sordid portrayal of the downside of fame and cost of life in the music industry it ends up being not terribly interesting. I've read many non fiction accounts of the industry from the same timeframe and locations as this book, most of which are far more shocking and out there than anything in this book.<br /><br />The most appealing two characters (Sasha & Bennie) aren't featured enough. The time shifts are disconcerting, and the jump backs occasionally feel like they aren't adding anything to what we already know, the \\"Sasha in Naples\\" chapter is particularly poor. Some readers will find the quirkier chapters irritating (a magazine article, one chapter which frequently dips into a version of txt spk created by the author, and a chapter in PowerPoint)<br /><br />It's very well written and a quick read, but for a novel who's title references David Bowie there's not enough sex, drugs and rock n roll. One to borrow not buy, to admire but not love.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This was a great game. It is very amusing and a great way to pass the time. I recommend it
B0055SWM08|5.0|there are games like this, but this one is more varied and very beautifully presented, great music too. zen like
B000NIWI9K|4.0|1st, this is a good Opera.  Fun to watch.  2 things strike me as missing.  The set is very modern and at times, only a blue screen background.  Aweful.  The worst part was the audio production/orchestration.  If you have a nice sound system and like to \\"crank up\\" your classical and Opera's.  This will shock you.  It sounds like the orchestra was surrounded by sound absorbing material with no ambiance or tone.  I was shocked at how bad it sounded.  It was played correctly, but lacked any sense of being in a concert hall.  FLAT.<br /><br />The singers and acting were great.  The English Subs were ok, but at times they went too long without any subs, leaving a viewer wondering what they are singing about.<br /><br />Since this is the only recent production, I purchased it, but it has no replay value, because of the Orchestra and Production Set.  It's a big turn off.<br /><br />BTW, the Overture is bad (don't you think?).  It doesn't sound like anything Mozart would have composed.  In fact, it is the most unappealing composition in the opera.<br /><br />PRODUCE MORE OPERAS IN ENGLISH (SINCERELY THE USA).  :)
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is amazing! I get all my local stations right on my Kindle fire. It's extremely easy to use too. I love this!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have watched all of the movies and most of the extras and it is all very nice. The picture and sound are excellent, the additional footage and background in episodes IV-VI adds a new touch and ties the series together a bit more, and the cardboard case is sturdy and should last a long time.  I am very happy with my purchase!
B005GVF95O|5.0|I think this is the cutest app. It makes me wish my baby was older to play it. It has beautiful colors and cute pics for the puzzles. It may not be for me but it's a great kids app.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Yesterday I wrote a review for a book (not one that I posted on KO obviously) that started off with the phrase \\"If I don't care about the characters, how do you expect me to care about their future?\\"  True...right? The fact of the matter is, regardless if the book you are reading is a romance or the latest Stephen King, if you don't make a connection to the people you are reading about (whether it be love or disgust) you will never truly enjoy the book.  Can you appreciate the plot? Yes...of course, but when the night turn into weeks, and the weeks turn into years you will forget about the book altogether. Why? Because you never felt a connection to it.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Disaster\\" by Jamie McGuire is the polar opposite of \\"emotionally challenged.\\"<br /><br />How many of you here know what co-dependancy is? According to Mr. Webster it is:  of or pertaining to a relationship in which one person is physically or psychologically addicted, as to alcohol or gambling, and the other person is psychologically dependent on the first in an unhealthy way.<br /><br />Now, here is a little known fact.  At the age of 17 I became aggressively codependent, so much so that I (after a bout of serious stress, and 1 missing person) had a breakdown.  Yep, right there in the middle of my football field I turned into a bottle of mush.  I then opted to leave town for a week and disappear into oblivion.  After that I stopped going to school, refused to get out of bed, and eventually found myself in a psychologist office begging to be hypnotised into forgetting my life.<br /><br />Why am I telling you all of this? Well, other than the apparent need to destroy my well rehearsed \\"illusion of sanity\\" for a great review, I felt it was necessary to explain what this book is REALLY all about.<br /><br />The inability to let someone go.<br /><br />  The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate percentage of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance between her and the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend America, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand. Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs--and wants--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the charming college co-ed. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his charms, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis' apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.<br /><br />First, let me start by saying that I stayed up until 4am reading this book, which...if nothing else...should tell you that I LOVED it.  This was not your normal love story.  As a matter of fact, take away everything you have ever learned about love stories and throw it out the window.<br /><br />Done? Awesome.<br /><br />Now, let me teach you something new. Life is not perfect.  A huge sum of us have a past that we are not proud of, parents that we would rather push off a bridge than spend a holiday with, or have zero faith in our ability to love.  We make things more difficult than they should be, we dwell on the negative, and when we finally DO find something worth holding on to, we tend to throw it away like yesterday's trash.  Beautiful Disaster is the love story of THESE people.  The imperfect people that pretend to live perfect lives.  It is not conventional, it is extremely irritating, and at times more emotional than is necessary. BUT...all of these things are what makes it so damn good.<br /><br />I cannot convey to you the emotions I felt when reading this book, If I tried, I would be lying. What I can do is tell you is this.  That regardless of your past, your current situation or the bright shiny future you have imagined for yourself...YOU will FEEL this book too.  Everyone loses things, distrusts people, and holds on to other things that may or may not be damaging.  We are human, these are human traits. What matters however is the journey we all follow when correcting our mistakes, or in this case...follow our hearts.<br /><br />In short, Jamie McGuire wrote a book so intense that it can't really be called a book at all but more a \\"series of lessons.\\"  A lesson on how to write good literature.  A lesson on evoking emotion, a lesson...in how to love the people that really need it.<br /><br />\\"So Misty...did this book have a downside?\\" Yes, they all do...but sometimes it's not about the editing errors or the occasional hop in plot, instead it's about the pounding you feel in your chest when you read it, the tears streaming down your face at the end of a heart-wrenching chapter, or the relief you feel when you finally reach that very critical last page.<br /><br />Sometimes a book just needs to be a book.<br /><br />So, if you love a good cry, like to be moved by the books you read, or just love LOVE then this one is a keeper.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: To be truly beautiful, you must experience the disaster first.gs that may or may not be damaging.

B003L77G06|1.0|Dear Seller,  I was severely unsatisfied with the product (Modern Family Season 2) that you sold me.  I love the show, and since it is not on Netflix and I am a poor college student, I decided to purchase it for less on Amazon.com.  I was extremely excited when I popped in the first disc, only to learn that it was \\"unrecognized\\" by the player. Not wanting my disappointments to get the best of me, I thought positively and inserted the second disc. It worked to my enjoyment and I watched all the episodes on that disc.  However, when I put in the final disc of the season, it also was unrecognizable. So in short, I am unhappy that I am unable to watch one of my favorite shows after paying for season 2.  Sincerely,  Disgruntled
B004WDRT1Y|3.0|Paying the extra money for 3D when it's really just 3 layers of 2D images is just not worth it.  The only part of the movie that they spent any time on was the 3D flying bird sequence at the beginning.  Everything else is flat layers of Foreground, Middle (main characters) and Background.  The cheap 3D is distracting and costs way more than it is worth.  The LG TV's 2D-to-3D conversion processing does a better job of converting 2D to 3D than Disney did here - and it's free with the TV!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|this movie may not have sold alot of tickets in the box office, but i love it. movies are out there to entertain, get our minds off things, laugh once in a while. they dont all have to be oscar winners, thats why we have cult classics. i also love the cast, great.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a great game! But you have to earn money which is hard, because the first group of games are very difficult. But it is very addictive.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Stop crying because you didn't get your &quot;adult app&quot; for today.  Of course this is for kids.  If you want a different app so badly then just buy it and don't whine about the free ones.  They aren't all for you.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|I want to say this.  I am firmly convinced that Chris Evans IS a super hero.  Sadly, he isn't much of an actor, and it shows in this film.  He just isn't convincing as a person, constantly displaced from the people around him (especially the stunning Hayley Atwell, who can actually act her butt off here).  Honestly though, Chris Evans is the least of this film's problems.<br /><br />`Captain America: The First Avenger' suffers from trying to do too much without placing it firmly in focus.  It opens VERY strong, establishing young sickly Steve Rogers' backstory very well.  As an origin story, this film gets it and it works it beautifully.  This is aided by the beautiful production design, recreating an era and a place that consumes every frame.  From the costumes to the set pieces to the brilliantly cloaked cinematography, `Captain America' promises to be amazing.  Sadly, after Steve Rogers makes his transformation and his first heroic act the film loses its footing.  This comes from rapid segments that feel like an excuse to show pointless action sequences.  There is no meat in these scenes.  Secondly, the reveal of Hugo Weaving's villain seems kind of anticlimactic (why does he wait so long to show his comrades something he doesn't seem so intent of hiding anyways).  All of these elements create a second half that drags pretty badly.  The film wares out its welcome before it is half over.<br /><br />Still, some of the scenes are expertly crafted, and the technical elements at play here are nicely composed (making Chris Evans a scrawny little twig of a man is not only mind-blowing but believable) but in the end, this is a film that only `half' works.  I just wish they had stopped while they were ahead.
0740748475|1.0|Calvin and Hobbes, Bloom County, the Far Side - all were part of the laugh track for my adolescence. So, when I saw this set I thought my 9 and 11 year old sons would get a kick out these comics after opening the package under our Christmas Tree. And they do! Though I had to correct my younger son's pronunciation of \\"Hobbes\\" they have torn into them with the love I expected. The art is great, the jokes still work, and they are (unfortunately) looking forward to our first real snowfall so they can go sledding and build snow men the way Calvin and Hobbes did.<br /><br />So why the bad review?<br /><br />I happened to glance over as one of my oldest was reading the first volume when I was startled to see a huge tear in the top of several pages. Upon closer inspection I discovered that the pages for the book were poorly trimmed. A huge chunk of the book failed to get sheared properly during the binding process leaving pages still sticking up when the book was shoved into the slip case. This resulted in a one and a half inch tear in a good thirty to forty pages with excess paper still sticking up above the binding.<br /><br />You would think that for the $150.00 this book lists for the publisher could have done a better job during the bindery process.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|In a beautifully honest look at the intimate enticement of Nazi comradeship, `This is England' tells the true story of young twelve year old Shaun; an impressionable `fatherless boy' being raised by his mother in 1980's England.  Shaun is a pudgy, oft teased young boy who craves the attention his deceased father cannot give him.  In the film's opening scenes we see this young kid thrash out at those who verbally aggravate him with a faux sense of confidence.<br /><br />Inside, Shaun is living in loneliness.<br /><br />That is, until he meets Woody.  Woody and his friends are a certain breed of skinhead; nothing too abrasive but more embracive of their new young friend.  Shaun is instantly drawn to the idea of friends and the thought that he could have something special and form bonds with these young people.  Woody takes young Shaun under his wing, and all is good and swell until Woody's friend Combo is released from prison.  Combo is abrasive and aggressive and hypnotically manipulative.  He comes home with a ravenous new agenda, one corrupted by racism and a neo-political viewpoint.  This permeates his every word, seething from his lips with an estranging quality.  Instead of being repulsed, like Woody and his friends (which include Milky, who is black), young Shaun is entranced.  Praying on his innate need to please his dead father, Shaun firmly believes that Combo can bring him closer to an intimate understanding of his father, but Combo doesn't even understand his own beliefs.  Combo is just as confused as everyone else, hanging firmly to a conviction he doesn't quite understand.  As their relationship grows, Combo and Shaun both begin to see a clearer reality that explodes in a sequence that is emotionally unsettling yet ultimately inevitable.<br /><br />With a sharp eye for realism, director/writer Shane Meadows uses his own life lessons to script a film that bleeds with a sense of purpose.  Every frame rests comfortably in an air of discomfort, using the awkward layers of honesty to flesh out a very raw and believable depiction of the devastatingly mental, emotional and physical effects of hatred and misplaced loyalties.<br /><br />Shane's brilliant direction is accompanied by a stellar ensemble that truly understands every nuance of emotional complexity within their relatable characters.  Young Thomas Turgoose gives a marvelous performance as Shaun.  The way he absorbs the charismatic presence of his cohorts is intensely believable.  You can see the little boy trying to fake being a `big man' in order to fit in with a crowd he doesn't fully understand.  Better yet is Stephen Graham.  His electrifying performance as Combo is breathtaking.  The way he gets the little things (fully fleshing out Combo's own naivety within his sharp outbursts and manipulated convictions is fantastic) just helps layer his every moment on screen.<br /><br />This man isn't evil, he's just confused.<br /><br />In the end, `This is England' is a powerful statement piece that plays out like so much more.  It is an intimate drama that unfolds like a personal love story to adolescence, a time of mistakes and misfortunes by most of all, a time of growing up, wising up and eventually becoming a man; your own man.o flesh out a very raw and believable depiction of the devastatingly mental, emotional and physical effects of hatred and misplaced loyalties.

0545323126|5.0|This is a good gift for kids 7 to 13 years old, both boys and girls. My children loved this book set, even though it doesn't have every book in the series. It was priced fairly, and my kids love the illustrations, which are cartoon-style, and the book is written from a kid's point of view. Very funny for them. The humor is age- appropriate, and the waiting list at the local library is very long!
B004LWZW24|4.0|The director of the first Saw, James Wan, teamed up with the producers from Paranormal Activity to create Insidious. They prove that, in capable hands, a horror film doesn't have to be gory or use lame special effects to garner some scares.   Although some have scoffed at the film's premise, stating \\"been there, done that\\", I think that Insidious takes some measures to separate itself from the typical ghostly, supernatural tale. It's a film that might not appeal to the horror/slasher crowd that must see copious amounts of gore--decapitations, body parts flying around, victims being hacked, extended periods of human torture, etc. While Insidious isn't exactly subtle either, the film definitely builds its frights and spookiness from the terrors of being possessed and the unknown entities that exist.  There are those moments when Dalton lay in bed motionless while unearthly things begin to happen. There's also a sense of dread as the spirits (or some may say, demons) come closer and closer to the Lambert family. In one sense, it is the \\"there isn't something quite right with this house\\" tale with some disturbing things happening in the family home, but, as we see later in the film, it explores another, scarier realm outside of the haunted house theme.   Not to say there weren't issues. The film gets a little over the top and silly at points as in the film's final segments. There's quite an emphasis for Wan to let us know exactly when we should feel scared, with the creepy music provided as a cue, almost a little too much.     Problems aside, though, Insidious is an effective, well-developed, creepy film that uses atmosphere and building tension to give viewers genuine scares. A definite fresh take on the spooky house and ghost genre.
B000683VI4|5.0|One of my alltime favorite movies and many of my friends love this story as well. Have watched this movie at least 6 times already.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app because it allows me to carry my Bible anywhere I go. I really like to read before work and the reading plans help me keep accountable by tracking my daily reading.
1600244874|3.0|CD is OK for Sedaris - I've heard better- package was a little crushed but that was a small factor.  Otherwise, happy with item and service.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When this book first came out my little sister read it - she was of middle school age and a highly avid reader at the time. She was so excited about it and couldn't put it down. She told me about it and,my being a high school student at the time, I thought most things my sister liked were lame. But years have past and I picked this book up (forgetting that it was the one my sister was so crazy about years ago) and was instantly hooked. It gets kind of cheesy in parts but just keep in mind the younger part of the age group this book was intended for. The brutality and the danger all seem real with Collins writing style. Its a great read (just like my sister said!) and I can't wait to read the next two in the series!
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and easy to use. just like playing with a deck of cards. ***** 5 stars *****, very addictive!
0307891372|5.0|This guide was a present for my boyfriend. It arrived in a timely matter. My boyfriend describes the guide as very descriptive, it has everything you need to know and more.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|Getting fluorescent colors on sketches can be art, and this app does just that. Not a serious app at all, but a fun one (for kids). Does what it says, and does it decently.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is ok.it gives u some fun every once and a while but you're not going to be on it all the time. its just a bunch of stupid. minor games that are stupid.and they have this system where you have to earn 90,000points to unlock a new game.(which takes like 15min.a waste ok you're time.so the app to me stinks but ill never delete it because its fun to go on it every once and a while.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Have tried most to all weather apps before running into this one, and have found this to be the One app to rule them All. Excellent weather reporting, precise clean layout, really have not found anything missing, lacking in this app till date. Not a weather buff, but need to know the current and forecast as a normal user. Provides all one needs to know on weather in and around. 5* app, a keeper on the phone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|how can you not like this, it's great to play when you're bored, and the time just flies when I play it over and over again.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Does the job better than any other transfer app used. Tidy and useful app for transfers in and out of the phone.
B0054N73EY|2.0|I heard some of their tunes on the radio and decided to take a leap of faith and buy this album, however I truly regret it. This is another Californication, all the songs are crushed resulting in loud all the time. There are no dynamics at all and even by today's standards this is pathetic. Please RHCP find someone else to master your work, someone who will do your music some justice.
B004LUS390|5.0|This by far is one of the best Sketch app with features on Android. Works well both on phone and tablet, good for note taking and for kids to do their sketches or whatever they're in the mood of. Would recommend this app for the creative ones, possibilities are endless.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|Here goes Hollywood putting there spin on the movie not following the original Comic story-line but in this case it actually worked but for one problem...........choosing Fantastic Four's Johnny Storm to be Steve Rogers.  The extra muscle he gained looked unnatural where Steve Rogers had a natural muscular built to him and too much humor was brought to the role just like in that other pathetic movie....Green Lantern.  Hollywood needs to take their time in finding the right person for the role like they did in  Thor.  But it will never happen!!
B0064BCNA4|4.0|I'm not knowledgeable on musical instruments so have no idea how this app would be for purists.   However, the follow me pattern key is indeed fun, I surprised my kids when I played Jingle bells and Happy Birthday to the tune, which was well worth the time purchasing and downloading the app. Full marks on fun.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I love this disc set. All the movies are in HD, but some of the special features are in sd.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Pros:  -Comfortable  -Rechargeable batteries. Not like the Xbox where you need AA batteries LOL.  -I've had mine for a year and batteries still lasts hours!  Cons:  -None.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|they just want your money$$$  there is alot of veriety but they really just want your money so juat play the games get lots of pionts and buy the next one
B004I8WD7S|5.0|The TPU case is snug and fits and has no excess room for the iphone to wiggle.  But the best part about this product is the screen protector they provide you with.  It's so easy to put on and there is no rainbow effect that you get from some other brand name screen protectors.  Other screen protectors will diffract the light from the iphone retina display, causing a strange rainbow/pixely effect when using the phone, but this screen protector is clear and does it's job very well without obscuring your screen.  The only downside is that oils from your hands still accumulate on the screen cover, but that is just normal.  This is one of the best protector/case that I've seen and at 8 bucks it's a steal.  I'm very happy with this case.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this Bible app, I've never read the Bible just to read. The thing I love most about this app is that it os so easy to navigate and they many reading plans they have available. Another great feature about this app is that it allows you to pick whatever version pf the Bible you want to read.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Love this game, too few like this on the market, but it's seriously waaay too short. .. .. .. ..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I have it on my phone and my Kindle Fire. I use it daily to do Bible study by using the plans provided in the links.  I actually have read my Bible more since finding this app and I have personally downloaded it to other peoples phones and pads.  it is so User friendly and provides all versions of the Bible, people who are intimidated because they do not know the books in order can put them in alphabetical order for ease. the makers of this program had users in mind
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is fantastic....for the avid photographer.   The reason I say this is because this backpack has room for the DSLR and for quite a few lenses. You can also see that it carries a tripod, has many different pockets for even more storage. It's perfect for someone who takes pictures of natural scenery and walks a lot (for hiking and bike riding this backpack is absolutely perfect).   However, if you don't plan on traveling a lot, I would suggest the Canon gadget bag. But for the price this is a great buy and the quality is legit. I just took it with me bike riding at the beach and it was comfortable and got the job done. The extra space was great for water bottles, keys, etc.
B0058ZPNOK|2.0|I'm a big metallica fan and i'm a big joseph gordan levitt fan so i was really looking foward to watching this, however  I watched half an hour of this movie and had to turn it off. it wasnt that the movie was bad i  was actually enjoying it but the little blond hair kid i taught was just really annoying so i had to turn it off.
B005GVF95O|5.0|Superman75, review it so I can go to bed. As for the game, if I were 2, I'd love it. Heck, Im 20 and I kinda love it. It has great graphics, lots of positive reinforcement and requires NO permissions! A++
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another classic Stephen King piece; I could't put it down and finished it in three days!  You will get sucked into King's world and long to learn what happens next.  Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun games. have many games to choice from. has exciting different levels to challenge you. try it out and have fun.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I got this for my grandkids. My,almost 4 yr old, grandson will love this game! My granddaughter is just over 7 months so it will be a little while before she &quot;gets it&quot;.  To the person who complained about getting the younger ones &quot;dependent &quot; on computers :  Get used to it. Kids as young as 2, maybe younger, are using these in some early childhood classes. I suspect that in the next 5-10 years, it will be the norm for kids in school. LeapPad, and Vtech already have kid versions of e-readers, tablets, and many more learning devices. The sooner kids learn how to use these electronic devises, the better prepared they will be!
