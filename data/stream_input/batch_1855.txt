B004LUS390|3.0|This app is just great. I love how theres many tools to choose from. but lately, every time I try working on a picture i have saved, it force closes on me and its getting really frustrating. Overall, This app is really great and is worth the 2 bucks.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My daughter and grand daughter had watched it first and it was highly recommended and I have to agree with them!!! It was a very good movie!!!
B007CMD5EC|5.0|It definitely takes some nerve to cover a tune with an iconic Van Halen solo in it, but John 5 pulls it off and even out-does Van Halen.  Amazingly fast and precise guitar work!  The material ranges from hard shred to really fine fingerpicking.  Its hard to imagine anything he can't do on guitar.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Shock, frustration, happiness, anger, peace, curiosity, disgust, betrayal,& unconditional love are some of the emotions you will truly FEEL when reading this book!<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is AMAZING!!! This book is AMAZING!!! There is no review that can do this book justice, you just need to READ IT!!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I honestly watched the movie before reading the book and loved it as well. However, I love the book even more! I feel like it's so detailed and really brings out the characters personalities. Loved it, must read!
0143117009|4.0|The book has some very interesting stories on environmental disaster/management. it is written in narrative format and helps you understand the environmental impact people have.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one. I also can't wait to see the movie. I hope it's comparable.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|This was given as a christmas gift however the person that received it loved it and added it to her collection.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is really really really!! fun!! I like going to people's houses and collect stuff like logs and stuff like that
B003L77GH4|4.0|This was given as a christmas gift, however, the person I gave it to loved it and has added it to their DVD library.
0393327345|5.0|I really liked this book as I like most of Palahniuk's books. How ever I watched the movie and was completely unaware that there was a book until a couple years after. I do like the movie more so than the book. Reasons why because Tyler Durden (in my opinion) is more likeable in the movie, and a few other minor grips.<br /><br />These minor set missing set pieces do not take away form the novel by any means. It's a good read but not for the faint of heart. There are some things in the book that I wish they could of made it in the film and vice verse.<br /><br />Fight Club was Palahniuk's first book and He did a very good job and Palahniuk's writing does not change in his later works and I wouldn't have it any other way.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I didn't expect much from this movie but I really enjoyed it.  Very funny on many levels. Well worth it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had no problem at all with this application. I have a nexus 7, and frequently make use Amazon, and find the services they provide to be outstanding and of great quality. If you like to read books, the kindle app is the way to go. Only regret is not getting it sooner!!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie really held my interest.  Was a very good story well written and interesting based on a true story.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Bought to read with my granddaughter, excellent story for young girl and self esteem.  Age old story  - that focuses on being a good person rather the things you may have or wear.  Would definitely recommend to all.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This is one of those apps that has little point.  On the other hand, it is well made, graphically cool, and amusing.  At free, it's definitely worth it.  The paid upgrade doesn't add much more to the app.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|This movie is more of a narrated intro to a video game than a movie. The Resident evil franchise is just not trying any more. Unless you are a die hard fan, save your self the time and pass on this movie
B005K0HDGE|2.0|[[ASIN:B00A1N2GHQ Exit Darkness, Enter Light: Book One of the Earth Cycle]]<br /><br />Finished reading the book last week. I will assume anyone reading this knows the basic premise of the book to save time if you do not I would not bother reading this.<br /><br />The first 200 pages concerning Jake's initial more personal motivation for going back and preventing the injury to Harry Dunning and the murder of his family is very good. Once this event has concluded one reviewer stated this could have been the end for them and they would have been very satisfied. I am inclined to agree with that.<br /><br />The pardox for me is that the book becomes boring and tedious when attention is turned to the reason why most people will buy it, the central theme. Preventing Lee Harvey Oswald assassinating JFK.<br /><br />The books middle section then shifts into one part love story, when Jake meets the character Sadie and also a love story about early 1960's America, and one part amateur espionage with Jake monitoring the movements of Lee Harvey Oswald for years. The first part of Jake settling into his new home town of Jodie, developing a romance with Sadie and generally living a normal life as a teacher is ok if very corny at times. The Lee Harvey Oswald detail is a hell of a slog. It basically involves Jake sitting in his living room listening to Oswald's every move and following him from residence to residence. You get to understand that Jake cannot just kill Oswald due to a small reason of doubt that Oswald may not be acting alone and JFK could still be murdered anyway. Still it does not warrant such a drawn out intricate analysis of what Lee Harvey oswald did for about 4 years. You are 600 pages in before you get to the 22nd November 1963. Lets put it that way. I could have shot Kennedy myself at this point.<br /><br />The alternate present day that Jake returns to, in my opinion is just a contrived and lazy idea with no real level of detail say compared to say Lee Harvey oswald sitting on his porch in 1962. It is simply quickly run through because it has to be.<br /><br />The actual ending I could see coming a mile off and as King thanks his son in the afterword of the book for coming up with the ending. I would love to know what his plan was.<br /><br />In conclusion the first 200 pages are about 4 stars and the rest about 2 to 3 stars.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I watched the movie because someone told me that  &#34;Aroura &#34;was on a building in one of the night shots of the city from a helicopter and then, on the map on the table at 2 hours into the movie, you see Sandy Hook on the map. He points to it and says something about bringing it down.<br />I find it remarkable that the two worst gun violence events in our country were referenced in this Dark Knight rises.<br />Is anyone paying attention?<br />One more event that they needed to get public support for disarming the people of this country.<br />Shame on the people who made this happen!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I actually enjoyed this movie when I first watched it on a theater. Sure, the &#34;inconceivable&#34; factor still abounds, but that was expected. What really took me as a surprise was Jeremy Renner's character: finally, a spy movie where an equally competent agent does not betray the team for pretentious reasons. Plus, the female agent in this movie kicks arse! Lastly, the humor was actually pretty good and not pompously delivered.<br /><br />On the other hand, Amazon.com has provided another exceptional service. I was actually expecting to receive the package sometime after Christmas day, and it was a real joy when it arrived a lot sooner than expected. Moreover, the website provided me a free (limited) access of the streaming movie version. Naturally, I immediately watched this awesome movie and another one from Amazon. I feel so blessed with this holiday already.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|This film literally flew by before I even noticed....the pace is excellent, and overall the movie is carried by the awesome performances from every main character in it.<br /><br />It's a rather simple film, but personally I found that to be one of the main qualities that made it work.  Both the individual characters, as well as their individual relationships with each other was perhaps the best aspect to Killer Joe.  Just enough plot to keep you around in order to witness one helluva awesome performance by Matthew McConaughey.<br /><br />McConaughey's performance in the last 20min. or so of this film is truly brilliant as far as I'm concerned.  He doesn't always deliver, but when he does it's always well worth the price of admission.  I feel he did as good of job in Killer Joe as the last great film I watched of his which was Lincoln Lawyer(5 star film imo).<br /><br />I'm sure lots more people will rank this movie 1star, and describe it as horrible given it takes a certain depth upstairs to appreciate.  For the simple viewer, the rich artistic aspects will most likely be missed by them in this film, thereby making this movie pointless or stupid to them.<br /><br />Overall money well spent in terms of the $3.99 rental fee.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I have heard that this movie was based on a popular soap-opera TV show in the years before I was born, but this movie is actually pretty good for its contemporaries. While it may not endure as a classic, the beautiful images, scenery, witty writing style, costumes, and music--have made this movie a little unique on its own. The movie's story is definitely centered on Barnabas, with the rest of the (Collins) family members as his supporting cast. I was actually thinking of a comedy with Gothic scenery before watching this movie; so, I was a bit more amused when it was slowly turning into a gangster-style movie. There were lots of poetic moments (e.g.) a strong, ambitious and determined woman as its villain) and satirical dialogue writing, but it was sort of a letdown when some of &#34;twists&#34; towards the end were revealed in order to &#34;finish&#34; the movie. I thought that the storytellers had probably tried to cram as many characteristics from the source material as much as they could, but it didn't effectively work out because the movie has been about Barnabas and his arch-enemy Angelique since its beginning. I had mixed feelings at the end because I felt really sorry for its villain and the family whom she had tried to destroy for two centuries. Sadly, the planned mixture of comedy and serious elements of power-play (and especially that out-of-this-world character revelation towards the end) just didn't blend well for its &#34;blood is thicker than water&#34; message (sorry for the intended pun).<br /><br />On the other hand, I feel so blessed with this holiday with another of Amazon.com's exceptional service. Not only I have received a free (limited) access of the streaming movie version, but I also received the package a lot sooner than expected. The expected delivery date was sometime after Christmas day; so, imagine the surprise and joy when it arrived to my doorstep before the aforementioned special day. So, Amazon.com definitely blows out the highestratings scale for its customer satisfaction service.
1451695195|5.0|AMAZING book,  you won't be able to put the book down. I was a believer before ,  this book would confirm a non-believer to believe that there REALLY is a Heaven and Hell
B004LQA6MQ|3.0|Parts of it were like a capital 1 commercial, very cheesy.  Looks like just a payday for Sigourney and crew.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|My youngest (9) would watch it again. My older child said: It was kind of depressing that Disney made a book series about these fairies and then totally messed up the movies.<br />It wasn't terrible, didn't have violent scenes or images, or any scenes that were scary like some other Disney movies.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I just love both these actors. They can do no wrong even if the writting and directing is flawed. I thought this movie was surprisely funny. I have seen Tommy Lee in very funny roles and he delivers like the pro he is and I just adore the cander that Miss Streep delivers. Was very happy and very much enjoyed the movie. Would recommend.
B00633W614|4.0|Good, old Jeffrey Archer, can't be beat. It leaves you opened at the end so you have to buy another book.
B0085YNML2|3.0|This is a good strategy game but it is boring as most of the levels I played looked the same and if you miss a step there is no jumping back and you have to restart the level instead.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King is a pro at writing, a real pleasure to read. I'm only part way through the book and can't wait for the ending.....
B007N9FKCY|2.0|I like mario style games and this one was basically a clone of the good old days, the biggest drawback for me was a lack of good controls. Tap to go and no jump/double jump controls is too basic for a game like this and in turn makes it frustrating to play. If the controls were updated this game could be much more enjoyable.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I had ordered this movie with the expectation that is was an original movie not a copy someone else had made. When I opened the case I had found it to be a copy which is not what I wanted.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I rated this book low because of the horrible ending and the morally corrupt antagonist, Amy. I absolutely hated Amy once her true character was revealed. It's difficult to believe that she could be such a hideous person and still escape consequences. The protagonist wasn't much better. The exposition and rising action was good and keep me reading. However, the climax and resolution left much to be desired. I'm disappointed that I bought this using my gift card. The most expensive kindle book I've bought was a waste.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love her singing and her rise above a difficult early life.  Always order prior to release so I am sure to get a copy as soon as itis

0545265355|5.0|I just finished the Hunger Games Trilogy. I rarely cry when characters die in a show or movie they have no real development to capture the audience which is me. But books have a way of capturing me and making the world so real. These books are excellent at capturing the reader and diving into the harsh unforgiving world that the Hunger Games exist in.<br />Not only did they make me cry repeatedly because the characters have such life such pathos but the descriptions of events are so real. The feeling of hunger is felt. I feel again the gnawing pain of an \\"empty day\\" the hunger I have felt before and hope to never feel again. They have fascination with every little detail of food, especially good food, which fills your mind when you are coming back from being half starved.<br />Being taken from the first person view of Katniss only makes the reality of pain, hunger, and confutation all the more so.  You become trapped within Katniss' mind not knowing what is real or not.<br />I recommend these books, they are not for everyone, but they are wonderfully written and sometimes painfully heart filling so.  Some scenes are predictable some characters are just too beautiful to live.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie it does not do the books justice by half. These books I recommend for young adults to adults who want an expertly crafted story.

B002QNLP2G|5.0|A superior film about a true story made with the help of the real person it celebrates. Anyone seriously interested in playing classical music and/or Holocaust survivors and their families will be touched to the core. Outstanding performances by the entire cast. Unforgettable supporting role by Sir John Gielgud as a music professor.

B009NQKXYK|4.0|Between the astounding visual effects and intriguing plots, it's impossible to take your eyes off this movie. The disappointment comes at the end, however, when its larger mysteries are left unresolved and you realize that you'll have to wait for the sequel.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|my child really enjoys it  this is a great child game.it downloaded fast with no problems the color on it is great
B000FBJAEG|1.0|The plot had potential but the writing was so stilted and awkward, especially dialogue.  The characters were very one dimensional despite efforts by the author to fill in with background information.  I love this genre and had heard great things about Balducci's writing but there are so many better series and options out there.  I do plan to read one more Balducci novel from a different series to see if this was typical or the standard for his work.
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Could be the best live album since The Who, Live At Leads. Most Definately worth a listen.<br />Can't go wrong with this one.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It's mind blowing what the artists behind Pixar animation can accomplish with digital tools.  A few minutes into the film and you forget it's animated.  The color and detail are stunning and more importantly the story is good for both genders and all ages unless you're a particularly cold-hearted grumpy sort.  What I particularly liked is that this film is 100% female-positive and empowering without being preachy/feminist to the point of irritation.  It just flatly states that boys/girls should have equal opportunities in life to choose their dreams and their paths.  The story avoids the cliche father/son or boy/girl and instead focuses on mother/daughter in ways not usually seen in films.  Moving beyond the &#34;marry who you have to and love will follow down the road&#34; to an exploration of children needing to rethink their blind rebellion at all costs and parents move beyond blind adherence to legacy traditions that may be antediluvian.  And beyond all that, it's a reference quality HD movie to show off your HDTV/Blu-ray to those who still question the value of HD anything.
B000BNI99K|2.0|I like the music but was very disappointing that they did not put all the music on one cd instead of 4.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|This guy is an American treasure and yet you never hear him on radio.  Why?  He is a great storyteller and musician.  And while this is no &#34;Perfectly Good guitar&#34; it is truly another awesome set of songs done by a master musician.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer is great.  You can't beat this for the price.  It's super easy to install (velcro) and it holds 2 drinks with plenty of room in the center for other goodies like keys, cell phone etc..  I would highly recommend this.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|CD.  Not me.  Dr John has come through again with a set of songs that moves him further along his long and stellar career.  I really like this one.  His ability to overcome some spotty production is what makes him a great artist.  So forgo the nay sayers and enjoy for yourself.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This man had a vision I am sure of it.  But I don't think what he took back from his vision was the truth about Jesus Christ and His Kingdom.  Eben was healed for sure but he came away with a very New Age belief system.  If you are a true Christ follower you will be extremely dissappointed.  His book is more about medical science. There is very little written about what he encountered and what he learned in his vision.  The one thing that he confirmed in his journey is that there IS an after-life.  The questions is...will you spend it in God's kingdom or in the &#34;wormy&#34; area he went back and forth in.
B0033AX26I|5.0|Top notch musicians, as I have stated in my previous reviews of their music.  I cannot recommend the Chieftains enough to people who want to hear things other than the tripe on radio.  These guys are top notch musicians - give a listen and enjoy.
B00887490Y|3.0|It's an OK film with a good story.. Jessica Biel is one of my favourite actresses so that made it worth watching too.
B008G59IBI|4.0|Uno was the best of the lot, so far.  Although this CD is fun to listen to, some of the songs are forgettable.  Overall, it is a really good CD but just doesn't have that &#34;it&#34; to award it the 5th star.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|What a film?<br /><br />Fun, satirical, and for me hit all the right buttons. I enjoyed it very much.Will most likely watch it again at some point.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|Patti has come through the years as an artist that cuts through the nonsense and tells a story.  She was never really a singer in the classic sense, but boy oh boy can she tell a story.  And that is why I like her and this CD so much.  Listening to Patti Smith is like curling up with a book - except in this case the story is being told you via music.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An interesting insight to a very different creative but not a very nice person. I enjoyed reading. I love apple stuff.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Wanted more Jet Li though.  Even though I rated this one 5 stars, the original was a little better.  But the one-liners and over the top &#34;acting&#34; was enjoyable.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I am a huge fan of comic book related movies. This one will not let you down very fun to watch.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Lovely and inspiring, a tribute to outstanding talent.  We recommend this album for your collection of memorable songs, or as a great gift to others who matter to you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|having so much fun playing this with my daughter. she is able to see her favorite pony characters that she spends so much time watching on Tv. so I get my Tv back and she gets her ponies.

B009NQKXYK|1.0|A poor movie with a sad premise.  Something unexpected is found out so we shouldn't have any faith in anything?
B007PKDW44|5.0|Great album. I first heard &#34;Warrior's Call&#34; on a local radio station and immediately fell in love with the music and vocals. The rest of the album was interesting, to say the least. No tune the same.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I am still getting used to it, but from what I have played so far, it's a pretty fun game. It seems a little pointless at times -but maybe i just haven't gotten far enough in it.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies of all time. Superbly set in London in the not-too-distant future, the film addresses one of humanity's biggest fears - that there is no future - in a thoughtful and exhilarating way. Several excellent \\"long-takes\\" also qualify as cinematographic masterpieces. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I didn't see a difference in between this Angry Birds and any other version that was out there. It was a decent game, and it was exactly what I expected it to be.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I loved this so much, I bought one for my sister's<br />Kindle too. It's holding up really well. The only thing<br />I don't like is that it is rather expensive. I got my mine<br />&#34;used&#34;, but was actually new and in original wrapping.<br />I saved $10 and am not disappointed. Makes your Kindle<br />look like an rare antique book. It holds your Kindle securely<br />I highly recommend this cover!
B0090O07RS|3.0|This brief 71 minute concert is said to be the best The Doors ever recorded.  I never actually saw them live but certainly remember the directional change they and others had on modern music.  The producers of the Blu ray transfer that I watched should be commended for their efforts to resurrect this filmed version.  The original film was directed by keyboard player Ray Manzarek.<br /><br />Aside from an unusual amount of shots from \\"right field\\" the overall work is decent.  The audio work was very good.  The audio engineer in 1968 was Bruce Botnick who also did the mix and restoration work on this disc.  Botnick notes in his booklet notes that lead singer Jim Morrison had dropped acid just before going on.  I suspect that wasn't the only thing he had been ingesting.<br /><br />Frankly his performance was pretty poor.  He spends a lot of time dancing around the stage, while his band mates play the same refrain over and over, waiting for him to return.  On one song he nearly nods off standing at the mic before screaming \\"wake up.\\"  I don't think that was aimed at the audience.  Guitarist Robby Krieger also appears high, floating around Morrison with mostly background strumming.  His one brief solo is good not great.<br /><br />John Densmore on drums and Manzarek carried this concert and I suspect the band, at least on this night.  Densmore didn't seem to miss a beat and certainly had a bead on Morrison.  The more I listen and look at this band, I tend to give more and more credit to Manzarek.  As the keyboard player and without a bass player in the band, Manzarek handles the beat on the lower octaves as well as alternate as the lead instrument with Krieger.  I suspect everybody was stoned but Manzarek had that little grin on his face, suggesting \\"I can't believe we're playing the Hollywood Bowl.\\"  This was a big deal at the time.<br /><br />While my comments suggest I didn't like this concert, I did.  I just think it could have been better with a more coherent Morrison.  For me the best songs came midway through with \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" \\"Horse Latitudes,\\"  \\"A Little Game,\\" \\"The Hill Dwellers\\" and \\"Spanish Caravan.\\"<br /><br />It is evident that this aging film required some serious video noise reduction.  Even so, the clarity is less than great, especially on the many distant shots.  There is new material added to the original version and some of it was edited out for a reason.  Certainly on the mid-range and close-ups the picture is very good.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option as well as LPCM stereo.

Even so, the clarity is less than great, especially on the many distant shots.  There is new material added to the original version and some of it was edited out for a reason.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not much of a reader but I thought that this book  was awesome! The way James writes is phenomenal. I would give it a 10 if I could, and will read it again and again!
0307730697|5.0|I bought this book as Christmas gifts for my three older boys, two of which are in the military and for my husband. I was concerned that it might be full of profanity, being a book about military operations, so I had to planned to just look through it carefully when I received the books. After I started to read the first few pages, I was hooked on the story and read the whole book. Instead of finding it full of profanity, I found it full of inspiration.  This book is about an amazing man who overcame poor decisions, struggled with those demons for many years and overcame tremendous obstacles to become a true American hero.  I thought about this book for days after I finished it.

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I hardly ever give a bad rating, but I just thought they could have did alot better job on making this movie. There was too much Bane and too little Batman.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is addicting because I always want to break my record.  And I want to improve with the free stuff from the store, with the points that I earn.
B00000JFV9|5.0|I love this CD . Curtis Mayfield pours his heart & soul into every song.Whether you are a fan of the movie or not you will love the way that this music sounds. Curtis Mayfield is super talented. He wrote, produced, arranged, played on this entire sound track. Why are the most talented always the most underrated.  Give me your love is a beautiful love song.. and Mary J .Blige used this same soundtrack from Curtis for one of her songs on the My Life cd!I know because I own that also. Freddies dead and Pusherman are great songs, even if the subject matter might not appeal to all. This is reality.. or was back in the 70's. The music goes well with the movie, and is easily one of the best movie soundtracks that I own!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is Angry Birds, I don't think I need to put a review on here, the game is exactly what you expect and there is a reason why so many people enjoy playing it.
B00797MB0O|1.0|worst movie ever - unwatchable. Made me hate myself for stupidly watching this movie.  Waited to see if it got better... should have licked a toilet bowl instead
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very good book well worth the purchase.  Amazon kindle is a great way to enjoy books.  This is a good action book with a good message.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had never tried this,but I am addicted to it now!<br />i purchased another angry birds game today,and no doubt will buy more!
B005COO1X6|5.0|After reading a short synopsis on this short story, I knew it was a must read. Through the eyes of various characters who stumble upon a muddy vehicle due to unrestrained curiosity, they quickly discover the horror that awaits them. Stephen King has no qualms on sacrificing the unlikely victim. I was left satisfied, even with the abrupt ending, after all, what better way for a child to be the true Samaritan?
B008XG1X18|5.0|I especially enjoy the History and Annimal sections.  There are some really obcure facts in the History section like the not well known Tulsa Riots of 1921, and the Russian woman who holds the record for the number of births.  Check it out.
B009MF56GC|1.0|Bought this especially since it had the UltraViolet version but beware...it does not work if you are Canadian.  Oh sure, there is extra-mini fine print on the box but when you try to redeem it, it says it won't work since you, even if you did pay with American money, you are not in a compatible country.
0345803493|5.0|Awesome book! I did not want to put the book down until finished. Enjoyed reading this book, very good plot. The author did an awesome job, I would love to see her write more.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I have 3 small children and do not enjoy taking them to the movie theater. So i waited for this one to come out on Blu ray well worth the wait. No complaints I pre-ordered it and it shipped when it was suppose to.
0553381407|5.0|I bought this book thinking it would teach me how to be a better parent by showing me what I was doing wrong. It was the most difficult book I have ever read because the truth came as a shock to me. I was stunned to find out that my own mother was the toxic parent and I was her victim. I also learned that she is a sociopath who has left me with PTSD which is why I was not a very good parent to my own children. I learned about how my mother has betrayed the trust of every single person around her including my babies and me. I realized that I was a victim as well as the bad guy but not to the extent that I believed I was. I had to read this book twice to absorbe all of the information. I was not emotionally strong enough to handle what I learned about myself and my parents the first time I read this book. I am glad books like this exist. I have gone from being an abuse victim to being an abuse survivor.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Great family movie!! We all enjoyed it fun for myself and the kids. No complaints on anything I pre-ordered the movie and it shipped the day it was suppose to.
0345337581|5.0|I was blown away by how many things I could remember and the long lists of information I can now store in my head and recall at any time. These two men really know what they are talking about. The way they teach you to remember things is so much fun and it's easy.
0470901071|5.0|Grandson not able to accept hard cover books.  Will try in the New Year to find these books in paperback but new.  He cannot get used books.
B0040GR01M|5.0|I am surprised this cd is not full of holes from the laser reader in my cd player. Three Days Grace  is an excellent band. I love their music.
0375714839|5.0|Persepolis is one of the GREAT book that I have ever read. This book is a good book for everyone who wants to know about Iran.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|This is a great album, I loved all the songs. The music is nice and the lyrics are poetic. Patti has still got it!
1439156816|2.0|I was hoping the book would be a guide on how to be a good writer. While I'm encouraged by the biographical portions of the book (even he has a stack of rejection letters), I found his advice on writing to be somewhat stilted.<br /><br />For instance, he discourages people from making notes on their ideas - well, what if someone has ADD or is really, really busy? I tend to be forgetful of some pretty important things and keep a frantic schedule, so I rely heavily on notes, not just on writing ideas, but to keep the day organized. Plenty of other writers have plotted their ideas  with good results (J.K. Rowling, for instance, whose writing Mr. King respects).<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a huge, detailed rant on every little thing I found wrong, especially since another person may find this to be a valuable resource. Maybe his advice works for him and a lot of other people, but it wouldn't work for everyone. I'd say enjoy the book, but don't make it your bible.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I like Norah Jone's voice. This is a pretty good album, although I think &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; is still her best work.
1400052173|5.0|This I a book worth reading. It is very interesting to know the importance that she has had and how tragic it must have been for her family.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is INCREDIBLE, &amp; I mean who wouldn't LOVE to feed our FAV CHARACTERS &amp; their families, building our very own Ice Age Home, and taking a peek of other's unique places! Get this APP, Sooo worth it

I do have my beliefs that work for me and I do enjoy how someone came to where they are today.This was a very quick read and I enjoyed his take the different faiths that he came across.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I was told about this book by my son who said his teacher loved it and said it was a quick read. My son knows how I am constantly searching for a great book. So I decided to give it a try. I was hooked . I loved every page and the whole butterfly affect ( which Ive always believed in ), was just too cool. It is a quick read if you are an avid reader.I have recommended it to everyone I know who reads, it was just that good.
0525952926|1.0|I am a big fan of historical fiction, and enjoyed Follett's earlier WWII novels, but the Follett trilogy novels are silly and immature<br /><br />Here is the politically correct narrative and all you need to know:<br /><br />Liberals, Socialists, Union Activists- patriots, heroes, humanists, have great sex, and are a force for good throughout the century<br /><br />Conservatives and Republicans- racist, evil, selfish, cheat on their wives, and are responsible for everything bad throughout the century, including the rise of Nazism<br /><br />Follett manipulates historical facts and turns them sideways to fit his narrative. If he cant manipulate a fact to fit his narrative, he just makes one up. We get way too much Follett  political opinion stated as fact<br /><br />Follett spends 1,800 pages in the first two novels trying to pointlessly prove his flawed narrative. Somewhere early in the second novel, he realizes he is wasting the readers time, and just packs it in.<br /><br />If you want a great historical fiction read, try the Woulk books on WWII<br /><br />This is a cheap try at imitating the Woulk novels, but comes across as an amateur attempt worthy of a high school creative writing class<br /><br />Cannot wait for the 3rd novel in this trilogy, where we will learn the unions put a man on the moon, and liberals and socialism defeated communism and freed eastern europe<br /><br />please save your time and money and avoid this preachy nonsense
0446563048|5.0|I have received this book when I visited Zappos headquarters in Las Vegas a few months ago and bought 2 more for Christmas to spread the message described in this book. It changed my life. I strongly recommend it if you want to find a way in your life or answers to some of the questions you may ask yourself.
0553573403|4.0|Over all, I found the entire \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series beautifully written and compellingly immersive. I miss the characters and the rich and wonderfully imgagined world already. Martin created and wrote it without going \\"over the top\\" as some lesser fantasy writers tend to do. As nearly all critics have said before me, the motivations of the characters almost always fit within the confines of the real world as do the outcomes of their decisions and actions. They were perfect for the world as we understood it then (at the time the series was begun) when we thought ourselves jaded and too worldly for happily ever afters. I think perhaps that pendulum is swinging back the other way again, as pendula tend to do,  but at the time of its inception the series had all the gritty realism anyone could desire.<br /><br />I am a voracious Fantasy Fiction reader. I read several books per month, most of them Fantasy. Thanks to my Literature Professor, Dr. Diane Warrick, who had the honor of writing the Forward to one of Asimov's final books, I learned to read Fantasy and Sci Fi without shame, and actually with some pride. She taught, and I paraphrase here, that it is far easier to write well about a world that already exists than to create one, literally from the sky down. Any criticism I have of George R. R. Martin should please be read with that in mind.<br /><br />The issues I kept stumbling over, again and again, throughout the series were medical or psycho-social, all but one about female characters. I'll get the non-female one over with quickly. Having one's tongue removed does not remove the \\"voice box\\". While that could depend upon the manner in which it was done, in most cases, the \\"voice box\\" remained and sound could still be produced, so laughter and basic sounds are still possible, just not \\"normal\\" speech. Some root of the tongue would have to remain in order to protect the airway to to allow swallowing, otherwise death would occur.<br /><br />From female biology to their psychology and motivations, Martin just seems to have \\"issues\\" with women. Obviously he's male, so this should not surprise me, but given he seems very attached to \\"the lovely Parris\\" who I assume from pictures on his web site is not a canine, I would think he only needs ask if he has questions. Clearly he has access to the Internet. Even those women he would seem to portray as heroic either adopt \\"male\\" characteristics or are strong to the point of sadism. I would give examples but do not want to do the \\"spoiler\\" thing. Even rape, which as an Army veteran and history buff, I fully realize has been a tool of war throughout history, is treated as a very trifling, even jocular matter. In one instance he even has a highly unlikely female character (not in this particular book, but later in the series) suggest that another female character would benefit from \\"a good raping.\\" I assure you, NO woman would EVER say that, probably ever, and certainly not under those circumstances! Poetic license only takes an author so far, and then you're into the land beyond belief.<br /><br />In this first book he also has Catelyn, after making love to her husband of fifteen years, thinking to herself that she hopes to become pregnant. Though it has been three years since the birth of their youngest, she thinks to herself that she is not yet too old to give him another son. Too old? She wed as a teen! The woman is at the very most in her early thirties! She has at least fifteen years of fertility left to her, probably more.***(see note at end please) Assuming Martin is sticking to the facts of real life pre-modern era child-bearing, women died young IN childbirth before modern medicine, but healthy, fertile women often had as many as 12-14 children...sometimes more. They rarely all lived to adulthood but once \\"proven\\" an otherwise healthy woman could bear children well into her forties if she did not die of other causes; she didn't become infertile in her young thirties unless her husband brought home a nice venereal disease from his favorite whore house that is.<br /><br />This leads me to another error of biology repeated over and over again throughout the series. Martin has women reaching menarche, or flowering as he so uncharacteristically romantically puts it, quite prematurely according to human history. While older, usually much older, men took little girls to wife at age 12 or younger, to join houses or in other property deals arranged by families throughout history, it was often many years before they \\"flowered\\" as Martin puts it. In many cases they didn't know they HAD flowered until they became pregnant. \\"Innocence and experience make the best relationships\\" is far from an original idea. While he is such a realist in men's other motivations, be they covetous, cowardly or cruel, Martin grants them much undeserved dignity in their treatment of female children. Old men who married very young child brides seldom if ever waited for them to blossom, flower or certainly give any kind of consent before \\"bedding\\" them on their wedding night or any other time. While I find Martin's world far preferable to the real one in that aspect, it is decidedly false, and that falsity stands out like a missing nose when he makes such an effort to stick to bloody reality in all but the magical areas of his story telling. Even the magic is more real than the universal chivalry of the male aristocracy toward child brides.<br /><br />This was Martin's world to create and he chose to create a world in which women are universally treated and spoken of with less kindness than dogs and horses. I also do not understand why he chose to write with such zeal of non-consensual pedophillic and/or incestuous weddings and relationships and and an entire world wherein the only requirement for a man to rightfully and righteously bed an innocent girl is neither age nor consent, but simply \\"moon blood\\" ...a world in which women are not even safe from brothers and fathers and have absolutely no legal recourse and are hung as murderers for defending themselves or running away. It makes me wonder ...what exactly are the author's feelings about women, and little girls.<br /><br />***  (The casting of the HBO series was NOT helpful where \\"Cat\\" is concerned. In fact the casting of some of the most major roles in the series was just unbelievable..literally unbelievable. I do ADORE Jojen Reed though! In brief: CATELYN 30ish not 50-ish, SANSA beautiful, shapely, with thick burnished copper hair, TYRION is supposed ugly and grotesque in countless ways, and he's one of the most handsome characters in the series, JOFFREY tall, handsome with long golden curls and a full pouty mouth and flashing green eyes, not squinty little eyes and cruel twisted thin lips....and RENLY tall, well made and BLACK of hair and beard--which is so central to the plot! Ser Ilyn Payne was tall, hard featured, and had his TONGUE, not his teeth removed...but the book was no better, because in the book Martin seemed to think that made him incapable of sound,which is false. ..but the casting by HBO overall was beyond atrocious.

B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Solid movie, hd quality was ok played through my ps3 with a strong wifi connection. Netflix seems to be better.
B00AFEY354|5.0|An exceptional coming-of-age drama incisively adapted and directed by Stephen Chbosky. &#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; (2012) ranks among the finest films about teenage survival, with excellent portrayals from Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson (who proves there is life after &#34;Harry Potter&#34;). Chbosky has remained faithful to his 1999 best-seller — creating a timeless cinematic work.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Watched this movie while setting at an airport. Kept us entertained not to mention made the long delay more tolerable. being able to watch movies this way is incredible.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My granddaughter loved this! She got really involved in waking the giant. Lovely graphics, easy to read text. Will look out for this next year!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Based on the instructions of this book I have abandoned trying to format my forthcoming book, Creative Genius, in Adobe InDesign and format it in Microsoft Word. The book is easy to follow as a step-by-step guide. It's worth way more than the price... which was \\"0\\". Yes, it's free. Every Kindle publisher should use this to avoid clunky looking ebooks.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|In my opinion, yes. I like Jason Statham's action movies. I know it is a hard comparison with the legend Charles Bronson<br />but this updated version is such fun to watch. I own both movies and like them both but I have re-watched this<br />version more than the original; it is just more fun to watch.
0679746048|5.0|I fell in love with the movie and knew I had to order the book as soon as possible. The item arrived in perfect condition and sooner than expected!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Super funny.  More edgy than Glee. It's kind of surprising these actresses can sing this well. Shows the steamy, underside of glee clubs.
B000031XCR|5.0|I'm totally enjoying this CD.  I had this CD years ago Ian's I see that they replaced two of the song with two other songs that I'm not familiar with; that's okay because I have about five other Celine CDs and those song are on the others.  Celine is a great diva.  I love the CD.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Do you want to watch a movie about your parents having sex? If not, don't watch this movie! I gave it three stars because it was very well acted. Top performances, but talk about uncomfortable. Awkward!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been hooked since season one, This season is really good as well.<br />I cant wait till the mid season break is over in Feb so i can continue the story.
B009157BWU|3.0|This did not hold the attention of my 2 or 3 year olds. The monkey was really cute though! I'll try again when the girls are older.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! Keeping the Bourne story going and look forward to more. I would recommend it highly for action adventure fans.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I am a big fan of Seth McFarland and Family Guy, so I was expecting non-stop hilarity.  Unfortunately, this movie was like a 2 1/2 hour episode of Two and a half men--all bong scenes and fart jokes.<br /><br />A waste of my $5.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|My only problem with this game is that some items are hidden behind the menu bar. You have to use the help or hint button to find those.<br /><br />However, for 99&cent; its still a pretty good deal.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I did not want to watch the movie without reading the book. Now that the book is awesome, i am afraid if the movie would fail on me.
B00005JM02|5.0|I bought this for my nephews and nieces to watch when visiting. I have to admit I watched it also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun.  totally recommend!!  keeps you busy in a good way love winning points and opening up a new level
B00002N9ER|5.0|I owned these before, had them in my truck I drove over the road. So I ordered a set for my pick-up truck to mount my Mag light to the dash for easy access.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|It was an OK movie!  Plot was a little show and special effects were ok as well.  I saw on big screen. When first came out.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Love this show, never seen the first season so I wanted to start from the beginning. Alot of violence tho.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I've seen all the others and couldn't wait for this one. The plot just didn't take off. The characters were fine.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Read The Silver Linings Playbook in less than a week.  It was engaging, funny, poignant, and extremely moving.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Paul Gilbert is at the top of my list of guitar players I thoroughly enjoy.  It's a big list but definitely I think he's up there. I have everything he's played on (including weird snippets from the mid-late 80's when he was at GIT. Suffice to say big Paul Gilbert fan!<br /><br />At any rate, the album didn't disappoint.  It's got jazzier leanings and I know Paul loves classical so this album seems to incorporate more complex musical pieces.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea... I love pure, loud, rock and roll and this album didn't have me doing air guitar while driving but, there is some really great music incorporated in there.  I experienced it not unlike &#34;Get Out Of My Yard&#34; where I didn't love the album the first 20 listens (yep... I listen to them over and over and over....) but I would put it down (and listen to something like Steve Morse/Flying Colors for a bit) and then come back and listen again and like I say.... the more I listen, the more I enjoy.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I went into this movie as a big Marvel fan, an duly expected to be biased towards liking it...to the point I was almost trying *not* to like it.  Regardless, it was a very enjoyable film!  Well told, executed, and pulled together.  The camaraderie on-screen is well-played, and Ruffalo's Hulk is possibly the best take on Hulk so far, in any medium (sorry, Bruce Bixby).
B002WY65VU|5.0|greatest zombie movie EVER!! I love this movie, even my daughter loves this movie and she's 8. its soooo funny!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD.  Anyone who says otherwise is doing something wrong.  I love it.
B007HO392S|5.0|cd was great. bought this for my daughter and she loved all the music it shipped very fast and we received it in perfect condition
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This is one movie in a long line of thoughtful and entertaining animated features of Batman. This older Batman shows that he still has the spirit, if not the physical talents he had in his prime, to fight for Gotham. Batman is my favorite superhero; he kicks tail with nothing but determination. This movie exemplifies that.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This is a great gift, and a fun way to spend an evening with friends and family. It is a resource management game and if you have a competitive spouse like I do it is a fun game to see who can best the other. I highly recommend this game.<br /><br />Con: The game likes to fall apart and the tiles don't stay put very well. I have just become aware of a Kickstarter company looking to solve that problem. Look into it at the link below. You might have to copy and paste. This is an opportunity to get in on a cool porject as well.<br />Link: [...](you must copy and paste if you want to go there)<br />Also on a side note I am in no way affiliated with the kickstarter
B00138KOHC|4.0|This is a good album. It isn't as over the top as most Queen releases, and maybe some people don't like that. What you get here is very straight ahead songs with some great vocal melodies and very good guitar work from Brian May. Is it their best? Probably not, but it is one of their more consistent releases.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|No need for review on this one! This movie is awesome and for 10 bucks it is a steal! I love it!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is extremely addicting, and it's a lot of fun. I play it way too much. I'm on my 134th Mission Set, and my high score is nearly 850,000. Obviously, I've played a LOT. Having said this, some negatives: (1) the opening tips are ridiculous, since they're so obvious, especially when you've played it a few times; (2) the Mission Sets are way too repetitive; (3) many of the Missions involve bumping into trains, signals, bushes, etc, which I find annoying; and (4) The Daily Challenges are so easy that they hardly qualify as challenging. Finally, the number of UFOs you have to get for the character Yutani is ridiculous.  I hate Yutani LOL. But, it's a free game, and I can live with the ads. Even with these negatives, the game is fast, fun and a real test of your reaction skills. A great app for the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />After I wrote the above, I went to play two days ago, and lo and behold, my game progress was gone. I had to start from scratch. Yet I had about 145 mission sets complete when this happened. Funny, the train when the kid is spray-painting shows 849,xxx, the high score I had, but I had to completely start over anyway. So I deleted the game from my Kindle. I really liked the game, but this was too much. So I'm downgrading my rating to three stars. Oh, well, it was free, and I got a lot of fun from it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is soooopp much fun! I can't stop playing it! it has awesome quality on the Kindle Fire!!!!!! LOVE THIS APP/GAME!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was great. I am looking forward to reading the next one. It does have similarities to 50 shades of grey. But foe every similarity there is a difference. It is a great story and a  great read.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Liked movie. I have seen better 3D. Ok, ok, ok, ok ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok.
B003M696QS|4.0|All I can say is that I am very grateful scientists such as Pim van Lommel are taking NDEs seriously, and asking questions about the implications for this research. We need more thoughtful and open-minded scientists like him, who risk criticism and ridicule from colleagues who would prefer to ignore such inconvenient evidence. I'd really rather give this book 4.5 stars, with five stars being reserved for only my favourite books of all time.
B005M5PENG|5.0|I wasn't able to see the first season and when I watch it, I was an instant fan of the show.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a game that anyone can play. My four year old brother loves this game. Even my dad plays it, although he is more fond of Where's My Water.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very imaginative tale spun by a master.  The story keeps you guessing till near the end.  Illustrates the abuse of power by government agencies in &#34;wrapping up&#34; legal cases.
1619696010|5.0|Very well written and obviously documented. Similar to Michael Lewis's books such as The Big Short. If only everyone would listen to this! Should be mandatory in business schools and for ALL Congressmen.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Enjoyable game, some slight glitches but the creative puzzles are fun, but not confusing like some games. Look forward to playing the sequel.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I love Doyle's Sherlock Holmes writings and have all the books already.  However, seeing this collection I had to have it.  That said, while the content is thoroughly done and enjoyable, the table of contents is poorly done. Thus, I have given this book 4 stars.  Certainly a small quibble, but it really should have been done better with more distinguishing characteristics.  I still highly recommend the collection, even with this minor annoyance.
B004SBX112|1.0|Never down-loaded, bought & paid for but didn't load.  Very disappointed.<br />Tried numerous ways to get into this game, wouldn't down-load or open :(
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Here we are at the end of 2012.  I noted that scenes missing comments were from 10 and 12 years ago.  The copy that I just watched is complete.  Good quality.  The only thing I wonder about is the opening titles.  But of course this is not EON.  I am glad I bought it.  I wanted all of them. (Including Niven's Casino Royale)  Five stars for meeting expectations.
B001G8XON0|5.0|I love the movie, I love the extras, the blu-ray is perfect and so is everything else. Giving this 5 stars.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|If you like quiet movies and understand the financial world and trading, have a keen sense of the way big money works, you won't be left behind in this movie. Subtle performances. No attempt to \\"fill\\" the storyline with motivations, no romance, no idealism. Elegant and well acted. No scene chewing. I quite enjoyed it. Tempted to hit it with 5 stars. Might after a second viewing.
B005C0DHIK|4.0|The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is that the production could have been better, especially the audio, even with his limited equipment. Otherwise this a movie that anyone that uses energy should see.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|From the beginning, I knew that the action ride would be good.  Having watched Gina's career as an MMA fighter, I knew that butt would be kicked.  She's was good to look at and not a bad actor.
0316069434|5.0|Just excellent. This author is just the best in the world. No one over, no one besides. The king in fiction.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Although the special effects were not outstanding, they met my minimum standard for this type of film and I would recommend it.
0385535147|5.0|A novel written by john grisham. You always expect something clever from john. He still does not dissapoint you. never.
B007X16GFC|3.0|I'm on the fence with this one.  The base story was good but there were too many if's, whats, and you've got to be kidding aspects of the film to flip me over the fence.  But, I like Wahlberg and would probably recommend it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|We love Scotty and his first album is excellent!  I purchased our copy as soon as it was released and ordered them for everyone for Christmas this year!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple but effective, well-designed, looks fantastic on Kindle Fire HD and it's free. What's not to like?! I use this app all the time and highly recommend it it for the Fire.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Great DVD of a classic movie. Colorized DVD is great. Much better than watching on TV with commercials every 10 minutes.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Wow.  Our local elementary school did a book study with this book as part of a parent education series.  Amazing insight into the mind and how it impacts your child's development, picture of success and future achievement.  I bought it and read it for the sports psychology aspect, but can see it being a valuable addition to the parent library.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|What a waste of time.  I lost 45 minutes of my life that I will never get back watching a disturbingly inane video that is suppose to be witty and humorous!  I wonder if the critic was otherwise employed and his/her 6 year old wrote the glowing review?  Don't waster you money or lose time on this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great quality. did not lag. liked how the background changed with the seasons. 100% worth the download. not one of those games that you beat in one day and forget about
034580404X|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Sweetest Day & she can't put the books down. She absolutely loves them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|additive game to play with family. we love taking turns trying to get more coins to play the rest of the games.
B0060D11OU|5.0|A terrific classic! My entire family loves this to watch this one over and over. It is great for all ages.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I'm not good chess player, but it seems good to me.  Seems like good AI. I used an opening that won the game in 6 or 7 moves, and I immediately used it again as a test, and it thwarted me. So I like it.
B003Y5H556|4.0|I am a big fan or horror films especially vampire and werewolf film and this is a above average film because it keeps you wondering who the werewolve is until very end and the action especially in the last half is very good.<br />I like it especially becauseb it keeps you trying to figure out who it is and then when you think you know, the werewolf kills that person, so now you start again until that person is killed and so on.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I have the older Atkins book and purchased this as a refresher and so it would be on my kindle.  I've been an Atkins diet advocate for years and it is also recommended by my doctor for healthier living.
B008H6GH8I|3.0|This is not what I thought it would be - another movie with the same actors especially Milla Jovovich which could not ever be replaced in this series plus it has computer generated scenes and actors. The movie was boring in comparison to the others and what I really wanted was retribution which was a result of my stupidity. #1- I should have known what the name of Milla new film was before I ordered, #2- I should have read the synopsis and who were the actors, and # 3- I should have have know when the cover said original CG motion picture that cg mean't computer generated.
0696204800|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. The blocks have four inches, but can easily be adapted for other sizes. Who wants a source of inspiration for their projects, this is the ideal book
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Goes to show that ridiculous premise can great television if well written, acted and produced.  Well done Walking Dead 3 entire production team.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game has been a lot of fun to play.  I like puzzles and trying to figure things out.  My six year old son likes to try solving the smaller grids.  He is starting to grasp the solving strategy.  We enjoy doing this together.
B004A2U4V4|5.0|He's a legend and every song on here proves why. Going on 30 years and still shows he knows how to put out amazing music
0316069434|3.0|A good story, but slow moving early on, and lacking in the intensity, drama, psychological power, and intrigue of earlier works.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Digital restoration and blu-ray outstanding.Friends who viewed the film couldn't believe the quality. Sound track and other features added to enjoyment.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Amazon.com is a place where people come to whine often. They whine about bands not being as good as they were 20 eyars ago, they whine about one movie in this boxset being not as good as the others. WHINE, WHINE, WHINE. This is a great boxset! It has plenty of extra features on a seperate blu ray. You could wait for the seperate releases for sure but a true fan wants all the movies!.  These movies look great too, with fine remastering done on them. The price is high but the films will probably be 15.00 when they come out seperately so it will be the same anyway.  If you don't know what this series of movies is then here's the scoop , they are a tribute to the movie serials of the 40's. And they are all good imo , yes even the last one. (which is the least of the package in everyones opinion). So grab some popcorn and enjoy these timeless adventures , which were also loosely based on a real archeologist. (well the first one was!)
0486219577|5.0|This purchse if for a Christmas present, but I know my artist granddaughter wil love it.  Happy Holidays to all!
B0060D123K|3.0|Yup, shoulda read the reviews- this is NOT the version you remember form TV as a kid. But apparently that version doesn't exist. Bummer.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|the app is great and it does change some of the pictures to make it a little better<br />some of the effects has pictures that you can your own pic with other effects or stickers
B00917IQFY|3.0|I thought reuniting the old band would inspire a harder rocking effort, but this sounds more or less like all of his recent albums. That's not entirely a bad thing. Despite the fact that his last masterpiece was 1996's Acid Bubblegum, Parker's more recent albums have been worth a listen. This one isn't really as good as his last, Imaginary Television, though.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Bought this and was amazed at the originality, a mix of Jason mraz and Dave Matthews with his own twist. Appeals to all with a fresh new take. Would recommend this to anyone, even a country music lover, he shows multiple sounds and his diverse talent. I call it a home run for a first album!
B0000057C5|5.0|Is a product worth buying.<br />This and other CDs of the band are great.<br />In the style of banda there is not no other similar
B004SBQGHS|3.0|This seems to be something for young people. I bought it because I had heard so much talk of it. My Kindle was new and I didn't know how to order so I bought it twice by accident.
1934030198|5.0|Simply because it is a product worth buying.<br />Found nothing to discredit the purchase. It was exactly what I expected.<br />Yes I recommend to anyone who likes the same kind of activity I do.<br />Sportsman, rocker and good about life.<br />It is noteworthy that the reader must take into consideration that a complex activity like sport we do not exempt under any circumstances, the assistance of a technician to assist in the development of training.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There is so much emotion in the last book that wasn't really there in the first couple (maybe because a lot of the emotion was confused). This series is a definite recommend. It's Just amazing.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Don't know why people like this movie so much.  Can't remember anthing about this movie I liked.  In fact, I don't remember anything from this movie at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get better...it did...can't wait to read the next one. Only takes me a few hours per book, but I just can't seem to stop. Just an amazing storyline and one of the best series books I've read in a long, long time.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I read the book before watching the movie.  I thought if followed the book pretty closely, but I wasn't thrilled with the book either.  I though it was very predictable.  After all, when the main character in the book is the narrator, you pretty much know how things are going to turn out
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love this movie! It's not just for Dr. Seuss fans.  I still tear up at the end of this movie, and I have watched it several times.....Because:  &#34;Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, it's not going to get better.  It's not.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|1.0|nothing really to say about it. face book is face book. I returned the actual kindle I dled this on.
B00003CXE7|5.0|THE DVD HAS AN EXCELLENTE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY, MORE THAN EXPECTED TO BE HONEST. THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE. RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE. THX.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|I really like the movie but was disappointed that the extras(directors comments, etc) would not play. That was<br />the main reason I bought the film which I had viewed many times in the past.<br />Since I had opened the DVD i could not exchange it although I would not have known the extras would not play until I did open it.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This movie was recommended to me, I bought it.  Nice movie, I enjoyed it. And the price was not bad either.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the ending of this book, but otherwise it wasnt a bad book. But i would recommend reading this book.
B000A2H812|3.0|overall the CD is just ok. a little repetitive. if you liked the Everything is Illuminated movie I suggest you buy the soundtrack since Gypsy Punks is featured and has the best songs on the soundtrack.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|The less you know about this movie, the more you will like it. It is in a foreign language, is for mature audiences, and is not your run-of-the-mill story. That is all you should know. Prepare for a crazy ride which I can only compare to a few David Lynch films
B009329ZF2|4.0|Plot moves well with some surprising twists. However, although the aliens were supposed to be an &#34;advanced civilization&#34;, their weapons didn't outclass ours.  But you shouldn't be picky about this movie - just sit back and enjoy it
B0080XN3C6|5.0|I love this album. As a lot of people, I was introduced to Kimbra via Gotye, and even though I really liked the song and their portions I saw a snippet of her performing [[ASIN:B005WLIP04 Settle Down]] and I wasn't sure if I was truly going to get into her. But I finally listened to her entire album and I love it! Just about every song as it's own funkiness and creativity that is so different from the monotony that is currently playing on the radio, or the same of everything that is being sold in stores. It was really refreshing and I am so glad that this album was created.<br /><br />Favorite tracks (in no particular order):<br />Two Way Street<br />Old Flame<br />Home<br />Cameo Lover<br />Plain Gold Ring<br />Sally I Can See You
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I loved it. Great movie, but not for kids. The bear makes movie.  I think its a great date night movie.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|this movie surpassed my expectations. The action scenes are as good as the prior Bourne movies plus we get to see some amazing free-running in this movie. It seems Jeremy Renner is the new hot commodity in hollyweird. He has taken over two blockbuster franchises (M.I. is the other)
B001KPYNR0|5.0|Simply one of the Best !!! very moving  wow what a song I want every CD's now !!! Brilliant  and so glad I got this one
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous season that I missed when on TV, this is a perfect way to watch at my leisure.  I absolutely love this series, am ready for January 2013 when the next season begins!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you have not seen the youtube videos, then you've missed some good music and entertainment.  Cello wars is a good start.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I used to play this game when I was in elementary school so it brought back some great memories but after playing it for about a month the game froze and my whole profile was deleted. I deleted it afterwards. Bummer.
B0095T3H2U|4.0|I thought this was a really good movie! I don't enjoy most comedies that are \\"R\\" rated and thought this was the cleanest  R-rated comedy ever! I think they should have cut-out some of the \\"relationship\\" conversations that dragged, but even if you do not like watching most of what is on television (like me) about never-ending relationships, I still thought this movie was very entertaining!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire and I use it everyday. Very simple to use and loud so deep sleepers like myself still wake up.
0399226907|5.0|This book has been much enjoyed by everyone I know, parents and children and grandchildren included! The cardboard makes it really robust and the simplicity of the images and word repetition makes this a forever loved book for children - they never forget it!<br /><br />Only down side was the size of the book is much smaller than previous versions we have read or had - bit small really. Perhaps Amazon should have put the dimensions on it or maybe I did not see this...
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I hate that Hollywood has no original ideas anymore and has to remake everything. I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But being a Kate Beckinsale fan I had to see it, and she is featured much more than Sharon Stone was in the original movie. In fact, she is the main villain.<br /><br />The movie is action packed. It is really one big chase scene. It did not disappoint as an action movie.<br /><br />However, also as an Arnold fan and a fan of the original movie I have to compare. This movie replaced the Mars plot with a kind of dying earth where only the UK and Australia are inhabitable and an elevator connects them through the planet core. Kind of dumb. In the original you are left wondering if it was real or part of the Recall fantasy.  In this movie it is  pretty much assumed he was a spy all along  and the Recall experience just helped him remember. It lacked any kind of imagination or psychological twist.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The Marware Vibe case is attractive and durable.  After getting tossed around in my tote every day, its condition is still perfect.  Best choice I could have made.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I adore this movie. It is funny yet musical yet romantic. The actors all did a great job.  The movie itself was well worth me buying it and reasonable threw Amazon.<br />I have watched it several times and never tire of it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This was the first book I read for Gregory. It was so enjoyable that over the last 2 months I read all her books. This is a smoooooooth book, well researched. I always love it when history comes to life as vividly as this. Read it, you will not regret it. Merry X mass
B004VMUS9G|5.0|can set it to do anything on any time. snooze and disable are well placed. loud, and effective with alarm sound choices!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Didn't want to put this down, love the wise-cracking John Corey character, even if he is just a little unrealistic.  Seemed like some things in the story got glossed over, but understandable since it's already a long-ish book.  Highly recommend.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I often allow my grandchildren to play with my kindle. With my permission, the child downloaded this \\"free app\\". As she played, unbeknownst to me, she was able to access, without the account password, \\"in-app\\" programs that cost from 9.99 to 99.99 dollars just by hitting download. The visa bill was over 120 dollars. This is a deceitful and dishonest practice by a company that has targeted children with a child's app. In these financial times, these charges could financially devastate a family.  Beware what you may be downloading.
B007THA4FI|1.0|The writing was not what I expected. The characters were confusing and I had a hard time keeping focused on the book.<br /><br />Nothing like the writing style in Harry Potter books.
B000YHG72E|4.0|We went to great lengths to find a rental, as they were all but sold out a week before Christmas.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Does everyone remember the perky Claire Danes from My So Called Life...that is pretty much a precusor to the talent and projecets Claire has chosen. Oddly enough I wonder if she tattoo'd here eyeliner on because that is serious eyeliner! I watch because my friends tell me to.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I'm ready to take a life altering backpacking trip now!  I especially loved the story of Cheryl's life interwoven throughout the trail in tune with each obstacle she faced.  The characters that came in and out of her life each played a special part in creating  well told story of transformation.
B009329ZF2|3.0|For the record the Hawaiian Islands need a force field if just for all the garbage they get from the mainland. In other news did you see Alex Skargaard's O face that was a punt photo shot and well...really storylines for board games have we learned nothing from Robin Williams in Jumanji
B00284G2IA|5.0|Excelente concierto no debe faltar en ninguna coleccion de los fanaticos del grupo el fin de la era de Tarja
B007BVOEPI|5.0|While I enjoy the Fun in this dysfunctional family or families its the scale to which the show is done that makes me watch plus there is leather and furs who doesn't like men in leather pants ...who?
B0030B1WBM|3.0|It was good enough to entertain the kids, but the adults found it a bit tedious. The original story of the Grinch is great, but to make it into a feature film, a whole backstory of the Grinch's childhood was added.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|It was great was great to see Michelle Pfeiffer again on the screen but somehow she played this like it was Grease 2. I think it was a good introduction and I really hope there is a sequel if anything just to see what the wolf girl does...<br /><br />Oh and Johnny did a great job too bad he didn't have a better stunt man.
0783225849|5.0|Our story boarding class story boarded this movie for our final project.  It was nice to see the movie again and study it.  A MUST for any film or video student.  The use of shadow, light, shots, etc. so perfect.<br /><br />Loved the Collector's Edition special features interview of those who worked in or on the film with &#34;Hitch.&#34;
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Everyhero gets a sidekick except Penny isn't the sidekick but the victim of poor writing and don't get me started on Scarlett Johanssen lines...bummer I thought this would be good the next one is coming and well...I might wait till it is available on Amazon.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this move!  Spouse and I watched it last night and love it.  Have wanted for a long time.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is ton's of fun! Whenever I have a few minutes where I'm not doing anything it's  a lot of fun to play a quick game!
B005HSL626|5.0|this is honestly a very good game.its fun free and addictive!I love the background and different swords you can get. this game ks GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love this CD......beautiful music. I originally purchased it for \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" and \\"It's a A Wonderful World\\"...I was surprised at how much I like the other songs...even the ones in Hawaiian.It's very sad that this man died so young, but he left behind a beautiful legacy with his music.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|The toy arrived and was much smaller than shown on web site. The toy does not look like $100. The boys opened them and we were all disappointed
B009E3EY38|5.0|The music is just awesome....was almost like a step back in time...now if only they would tour.  But since that's not going to happen this DVD is the next best thing.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This album is one of the greatest ever made in my opinion.<br />Certainly with Phobia Breaking Benjamin's best albums.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the delivery, earlier than the estimated time.<br />All together a perfect purchase
B004KBSQOW|3.0|I was looking for the CD with the combination &#34;Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World.&#34;  So hard to tell just from the song titles on all the CDs.  This was not the one.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is a unique movie.  It is a great mixture of hard laughs instead of a few light chuckles once in awhile and real drama.  Most attempts at comedy-dramas take a half-assed approach to both sides. This movie seems to push hard in both directions.  The vulgarity is abundant and does not pull any punches, but it is all relevant.  The movie settles down and becomes quite serious at times but they still find away to slip off color jokes in to hit your with a hard laugh randomly.  I'm quite sure there will be at least some sort of follow-up to this movie.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Sci Fi For Laughs & Love and Mass Insanity for control of Mars!<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch does a wonderful job, while trying to remain alive on Mars; as he is a from Virginia-Earth.<br />I will not say more.  Check it out.  I believe the Tomatoes People got this wrong, then again--I am a<br />huge sci fi fan.  Enjoy  John Carter
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been waiting for another Colleen Hoover book since the moment I finished Slammed and Point of Retreat. This one did not disappoint. In fact, I think it blew Slammed away, and I adored that book. I read about 250 books a year, most of which are entertaining (I can always find something about a book I like), but usually predictable and a bit simplistic. To call Hopeless merely entertaining would be a travesty, and it is ANYTHING but predictable or simplistic! Hoover has such a wonderful way of building characters that are complex and real. The dialogue is natural yet inventive. It flows without feeling forced, and her stories never feel rushed like she is sprinting toward the finish line of an end. Hopeless is like an onion, peel a layer off thinking you have it all figured out only to find that there is so much more underneath. Layer after layer of amazing writing and storytelling, twists and turns that will keep you captivated and emotionally vested in the characters. There are not many books that have me uttering \\"wow\\" as I flip the pages, but I repeatedly did just that on my journey through Hopeless. It really is a journey, and I have to say it once again...Wow.
B000I9YX06|5.0|More Sci Fi,  YES-----I just love it<br /><br />This was a break thru movie for FX, Will Smith was at his best (at that time).  I really<br />enjoyed this movie.  Sorry, my movie reviews do not include story plots & spoilers - -<br />what would be the fun in that!!!  (you can real the cut and dry on the Amazon Page as<br />well as Wikipedia.  Enjoy the Show!
B008AX18Y6|4.0|A great character interestingly presented in the third person. Very well written as one would expect from such a prolific and well known author. However I found too many words not usually used and  unnecessarily &#34;flowery&#34;, but probably due to the author writing in a language that is not his first. Some of the chronology appeared a little out of sequence. Overall his courage and adherence to his convictions raised admiration.
B000GT4H0Y|1.0|This is a great old movie  (Sci Fi)  However, I do not own it.<br />If in fact I did purchase it, I never received it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I liked this novel but not as well as some of Grisham's previous books. I was disappointed in the ending.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|nice little books for my Kindle.  Not much to say, Journals.<br />I have only used one book, soon- I will need a second book.

0486407217|4.0|The patterns are helpful in seeing how Victorian clothes were put together.  The styles are good selection to start with, but more elaborate designs do exist.  I guess the may have been chosen for practicality in theatrical costuming as they require plenty of fabric and work without, say, embroidering chenille roses to attach to the gowns.  Once you master all of these patterns, you may want to go on to spending even more on fabric, trim, and time.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|I usually don't appreciate Jane Austen fan fictions, but I will make a guarded exception for this movie. The whole plot of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been changed here, but I thought the reasons for the changes have some merrit, and so I found myself willing to TEMPORARILY suspend my love of this classic book and entertain an alternate reality for the Bennett Family. THIS IS NOT \\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE\\", but a commentary on how sometimes \\"the grass is greener on the other side of the fence\\". The foundational point of this storyline is simple and well taken, the story is interesting and tolerably well acted, I rooted for the characters, and found the ending to be satisfactory for this \\"alternate reality\\" tale.<br /><br />The writer(s) of LOST IN AUSTEN are not trying to do a modernized remake of Jane Austen's beloved story, but are instead, pointing out the irony of how multitudes of modern women are in love with Austen's period tales of romance, when Jane herself, hated the suffocating constraints that were placed upon women in the society of her day. These very novels that have captivated women of today were actually a scream of frustration from a woman who would have dearly loved to find a door to the freedom that comes along with living in our modern times. In her novels, Jane Austen was able to become mistress of the fortunes of her heroines, but Austen's personal stark reality was that she was stuck in a cultural trap from which she never escaped. Some of today's women may well wish they could escape the harsh realities of our life and times, but the Regency era was rife with problems of it's own and freedom was reserved for only a privledged few women who were lucky enough to \\"catch the right husband\\". It could be argued that the fantasy world of Jane-mania is foolish, and that most of us wouldn't like it if we could actually go to Jane's world and cope with the situations we would find ourselves in.<br /><br />To make it tolerable for Amanda Price, a few unrealistic concessions to the \\"Modern\\" outlook had to be incorporated into the story. I will not spoil it by telling what these concessions are, but will only warn you that if you watch this movie hoping for another remake of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, you will be sorely disappointed - just be prepared to enter into a story where everything is changed from the novel that you love. This was very thought provoking to me and I think it reminds us that we don't know what we are craving when we wish for a different reality than has been given us.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE????  I love Jane Austen stories and have read/watched each one many times over.  Just like Amanda Price, they are always new to me.  These stories never get old and I am sure that there will always be days when nothing but a \\"True Jane\\" will do.  While LOST IN AUSTEN is very watchable and I liked it for a one time fling, it will never be in the same class as a real Jane Austen.  Once was enough, and I doubt if I will ever watch it again.  The true test of a really REALLY great story is when you still love it after years and years of re-reads.  I cannot say that about LOST IN AUSTEN, or about any other Jane Austen fan fiction I have ever encountered.  There is simply nothing like a \\"True Jane\\".c concessions to the \\"Modern\\" outlook had to be incorporated into the story.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|After a lot of friends insisted I read this, I caved in, hoping I'd been judging it wrong from a distance.  I was disappointed to have been correct, however.  The writing is amateur at best, all the &#34;mumbled&#34; and &#34;muttered&#34; that people are doing.  The story had potential, I felt drawn to know more, but I felt like Anastasia was beyond naive.  People who blamed Twilight for being about an abusive relationship have another thing coming from this book.  Many loved the book for it's steamy scenes, which became repetitive and tedious (it took all of one magical kiss for her to start having orgasms left and right.)  Just wasn't for me!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My whole family-kids and adults-love this movie. It captures the magic of Christmas in such a delightful way. enjoyable for all.

B00A23MVHA|4.0|Good movie for some laughs, but it draws far too much on the Family Guy-style randomness to be a classic
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great, entertaining read. More bulk could have been added to create a richer read, but the plot was well written. There are so many unanswered questions but I love Eva and Gideon. I especially love Eva, the main character. The love story here is classic, and I could read these books over and over again. The Crossfire Series from Sylvia Day is my favorite ever (next to the classics like Jane Austen), and I challenge anyone who says it isn't a great set of characters, a great plot and exciting settings.
B000001FO4|5.0|Good price. Fast shipping. Great quality. Futile obligatory semi interviews.<br />They bother people<br />Rock on. Go on with your job a really good one!

B008ENNXQI|3.0|Some things just shouldn't be changed... Names of main characters were changed and the types of the characters were changed and some of the good guys took on a more bad character role. The other changes were good however do overall good movie for families

1401223176|5.0|I was referred to this comic by a website that is written and maintained by nerds for nerds and was told that, while it had some things that people may not enjoy, on the whole it was superb and featured a large cast of batman's most cherished foes. I became instantly engrossed in the story, art, presentation, pacing, and writing. It took me not long at all to finish because once I picked it up, I was essentially unable to put it down.<br /><br />As someone who rarely, if ever, reads comics, but is a long time fan of comic book heroes and villains I can refer this product to anyone who has at least a passive knowledge and understanding of the Batman universe. Perhaps someone only familiar with the Adam West era or the late 80's movies would be somewhat lost, myself having grown up on the mid 90's cartoon show in addition to these other sources and doing very mild research was able to recognize and understand virtually all the events and characters and plot points presented.<br /><br />Overall, great book and totally a worthy price!
B0015GDVTU|5.0|Por qu&eacute; las personas esperamos a que nuestros seres queridos mueran para darnos cuenta lo importantes que son para nuestras vidas?

B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you already own the Alien movies in DVD or are considering upgrading to Blu-ray, this set will certainly not dissapoint you. All four movies are presented in flawless HD Blu-ray picture and sound, including additional versions and material within the movies and additonal discs. The book like case offers a beautiful presentation of 'pages' for each disc with scene pictures from each movie. The additional material truly adds depth to the whole Alien saga, from production, storyboards, interviews with cast and crew, storyline concepts, just about everything that made the Alien saga the classic it has become.<br />Price wise it was a bargain to get this set at the price offered here at Amazon. You might not find a better offer anywhere else for this collection, even more so if you get the movies piecemeal which will not have the added discs and bonus material included with this set. If you enjoyed this movies at the theatre or on DVD, then you owe it to yourself to add this set to your Sci-Fi collection.

B001FB55I0|4.0|Very nice presentation in Blu-ray format, with some added bonus material and features. Only one slightly extended scene int the Director's Cut version, but nevertheless entertaining in either that or the Theatrical Version. If you like the extra bonus features included in most movie formats these days, then you'll enjoy this one over the standard DVD version.
B0086700CM|1.0|When I played it .I thought it was a good game but when I  got to a high number of  coins. I had to download it again it ain't  a good game.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|what a dreamy vegas-setting book. Probably something people had dreamed of after their one-night flings on Vegas. It wasn't a bad book, it was cute. The way the author combined both point of view was quite good although there are parts that get confusing sometimes like you don't exactly know who's pov it is. The plot was laid out pretty good too. Its like the author took the reader step by step.  The only thing that bothered me about this book was how little information there is about the girl's life. I mean okay, we know what the guy does for a living, well at least we have a sense he's in the business and he's some rich guy. But what did we know about the girl? she had some kind of work using the computer, but for goodness sake, there's so much work out there that uses a computer! The author simply focused on their compatibility concerning their similar views about no love involve and their marriage could work. But it didn't consider the other factors in life that's different between the two characters.  I mean sure, it hinted it sometimes that the girl will be viewed as a gold-digger but the main focus was their similar views about relationship and what they look for.  Sure that was nice that it had such a nice focus, but it would have been nicer if the author had included some other factor about the character's relationship that would make it possible or impossible to work. Other than that, I liked the book, loved the story, loved the characters as well as how it ended.
1421550644|5.0|The paper quality is fantastic, the books are well built and solid, the inside bonus color pages are incredibly vibrant, and the poster is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />While the sound effects are left in their original Japanese state to preserve the art, there is a glossary of sound effects, listed by page and panel number, in the back of each book.<br /><br />As a big fan of the anime adaptation, I am very happy with the amount of detail covered in the manga version, and I am very happy with this box set overall.<br /><br />If I were to complain about anything with this purchase, it would be that Amazon didn't even bother to put any padding in the box they sent it in. There was about an inch of space for the box set to move around in, so the corners of the box set sleeve were slightly dented. It was hardly noticeable, but it is something that could have been easily avoided. I received the package within two days of purchase though, even though I ordered with regular shipping!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Hard to beat the last one, but this one is close if not equal in it's own way. Fun music, yet great lyrics and such.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|The general negative reviews here (other than &#34;I bought the wrong version&#34;) seem to be that this movie could have been more. It could have been a better and deeper story.<br /><br />You know, Pixar isn't trying to go for a super serious story; they were going for a fun Scottish-themed adventure about a strong princess, her relationship with her mother, the shift in her worldview from her parents, and the dangers of bringing a witch into the fray.<br /><br />It had a very fun story, an interesting back story, fun characters, and beautiful effects.<br /><br />It isn't my favorite Pixar film but it's a wonder to look at, a fun story for a pre-teen to teenager, and a warm film with very light scary scenes.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Love the watch.  The bezel is sensitive to the touch but I am out to run and keep track of mileage not play with the watch.  It is a great tool for keeping pace and tracking mileage.  It is great for training and recovery from injuries.  It keeps you honest when you need to take it easy and recover.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I really love this book. I gave it a 5 star rating because it's so full of action, you can't put it down. I would recommend it to people that don't get highly attached to characters in books. I get so attached so it makes my heart break at certain points. But it's suitable for mostly anyone...I would strongly recommend it.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|The resident evil franchise has always lacked a terribly believable story, but I still loved each of the previous episodes. They were all at least somewhat connected to each other. This one is barely connected to the previous episode. It's so detached that they have a long narration near the beginning so that you can figure out what is supposed to be going on. The fight scenes are also terribly repetitive. I have never been so bored watching a zombie movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love this series of Harry Bosch books, and Michael Connelly continues to make them can't-put-down reads. I hope he continues the series for a long time.

1451695195|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  She made it sound like the best book ever and after reading it, I have to agree.
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|This was a cute and weird story about Santa being missing. It's worth a buck, but I wouldn't pay more than that because there is no replay (hence only four stars).  If you redo a chapter you get the same list of things to find. The extra mini games were fun and different than other hidden object games I've played. That was nice and unexpected. Short game - finished it in about three hours - but fun.

B00AB0AXU6|4.0|Tough, beautiful women. Big guns. Things getting blown up. Macho guys. Monsters scary enough to make you soil your pants. Deadly gadgets. Yeah, it's a Resident Evil movie.  And just in case you've spent the last two decades in a coma, this movie franchise was inspired by Capcom's video game of the same name that was originally released on the Sony Playstation console in 1996.  It was one of the original survival-horror games that defined that genre, along with the likes of Silent Hill and Parasite Eve.  Now, here we are living in the Playstation 3 generation and the Resident Evil video game franchise continues to delight players with each new edition.  And the movie franchise never fails to scare viewers with each new sequel.<br /><br />The story takes place at the Umbrella Corporation's main underground research and testing center, located in the frozen north of Russia.  This is where the giant business entity took prospective clients in order to demonstrate the power of their new bio-weapons.  The underground facility consists of very realistic environmental recreations, complete with disposable human clones.  Both were designed in order to be able to not only run simulations, but also to provide a controlled environment on which to demonstrate the effects of the T virus on an urban setting.  This is where clients such as Russia, the U.S., China, Japan, and their respective governments viewed the simulations prior to signing away lots of money to Umbrella.<br /><br />Having been knocked unconscious on the deck of the container ship from the last movie, Alice wakes up to find herself in a holding cell.  Through the interventions of Ada Wong and Albert Wesker, Alice manages to escape her prison cell.  Ada tells her that Albert Wesker no longer works for Umbrella.  What's left of the giant corporation is now under the control of the Red Queen.  The remaining employees now take their orders directly from the corporation's supercomputer and its artificial intelligence network.  Wesker, the former CEO, has sent Ada to help Alice escape from the massive underground facility.  He had arranged for a team of mercenaries, led by Leon S. Kennedy, to meet with them near the exit and take them out of the country.  The problem, and there is always a problem, is that the Red Queen will do everything in her power to keep Alice from getting away.  If you have been a fan of the franchise, you will recall that Alice has special abilities that the corporation would like to further research.  Red Queen activates and releases all of her bioweapons in order to stop Alice and Ada from escaping.<br /><br />Along the way, franchise favorites make their appearance in one form or another.  Johann Urb and Binbing Li play their parts, Leon and Ada.  Sienna Guillory returns as Jill Valentine.  Oded Fehr, Michelle Rodriguez, Colin Salmon, Shawn Roberts, and Boris Kodjoe return to reprise their roles.  And ofcourse, that adorable franchise mainstay, the Licker, is back.  And this time, much larger and much more powerful than in the past.  Toss in a couple of sack-masked, axe-wielding Tyrant T-103s into the mix for good measure.  And the Las Plagas parasite just to spice things up and you have got yourself non-stop action.  Over-the-top, if you ask me.  But fun to watch nevertheless.<br /><br />This is a must-see for anyone who is interested in the continuing saga that is Resident Evil.  This is perhaps the best movie to come out of the franchise.  A lot of people who have not kept up with the series will probably come back just to see Michelle Rodriquez back in on the action.  And they will not be dissapointed.  She plays a much bigger, dual-role in this movie.  Lots of chick fight in this one.  And Milla Jovovich, along with Kate Beckinsale and Angelina Jolie, have proven herself to be just as capable an action star as the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li.  The woman even did most of her own stunts in the first RE movie.  She looks good in her black, skin-tight outfit.  And we finally get to see Alice go up against a parasite-infected Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), which could be the chick fight of this year's cinema.<br /><br />I rented my movie at XBox.  I also frequently rent from the Playstation network.  I could just as easily have watched it on Amazon.  There are no shortages of how to get your movies these days.  Still, I am considering buying the Blu-Ray version.  There really is no substitute for owning the actual media and having it in your library.k, skin-tight outfit.

Reading with your child is one of the greatest gifts you can give him, He is strong in reading in school, and I know he will always remember this when he has his own child someday and I know he will pass it on.  I wish they would write more quickly or do a second series by the same writer, sure it would be great.

1401307957|5.0|I had hoped for just some art journaling ideas, but it turned out to be also a story of a brave life journey aided by the sketching. It also motivated to get started even if you feel you have no talent.  It reinforced that the journal was for your thoughts, joys, inspiration and not perfection for other eyes.  Really glad I bought the hard copy instead of Kindle edition.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Superbly writen, Blood Song is a safe choice for George Martin's fans.<br />The fantasy here is dry, serving as a sauce to a dickensian tragedy.<br />The characters are tridimensional and realistic.<br />Is a fantasy with the classic fantastic realism approach, using the allegory to reach the public with questions about human behavior and conflicts.<br />So, work as well to someone who looks for a light realism as to someone who looks for a more complex/adult fantasy.

B000GCFG7E|5.0|I would recommend this book.It was a great read. Kept moving,was very fast paced. I really like the action and descriptions.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This soundtrack was different from his Bourne series.  It's more lyrical and inspiring.  I play it so much I'm afraid I'll tire of it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I would recommend this book.It was a great read. Kept moving,was very fast paced. I really like the action and descriptions.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|I knew that \\"The Terminator\\" would be re-issued, and with a better remastering effort. I knew this because the last known re-issue of \\"The Terminator\\" on DVD had many extras. Like additional documentaries and the making of the film, etc.... The first issued Blu-Ray of the film actually looked no better than the first issued DVD (it appears to be the same unimproved source copy) but however, it also excluded all that extra material that the last known DVD version had so you will be more anxious to buy the film again, later, that will include all those already existing extras.<br /><br />I believe this was their plan to double dip the consumer to resell this movie again, on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />You gotta ask yourself. \\"How many times have I bought this same movie over the years, with the promise of it being somewhat more improved?\\" (your purchases of the past included VHS in several re-issues, Beta, Laserdisc, DVD again in several re-issues, BD, etc.) The Blu-Ray has been issued twice already, and now, here comes the third re-issue on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />It's ridiculous how they do this to us. They give as little as they can on the first release, and then they improve on it just a little more, with a hope to re-sell it again. And then again.<br /><br />You watch, three to five years from now, you will probably be buying \\"The Terminator\\" yet again, because they will again do something more for it to make your current copy inferior to it. They will always add a little something more to a re-issue to make you want to buy it again.  Even things that they already have on film, that they will just wait to add to a future re-issue.
B009NOVCU6|5.0|Great songs, cool packaging. The two new songs, Doom & Gloom and One More Shot prove the Stones still got it. A must for collectors, or a great collection for newbie fans.
B008CP93S0|3.0|This movie has some funny moments but overall it's not that great.  With two really funny people as Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd I believe they could have done so much better
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|The characters never raelly develop the plot just wanders around. Its a shame, Tom Hardy had the potential for an epic preformance given a better script. Why is Gary Oldman even in this movie. His character is introduced and just vanishes. He sure sells the trailer though. Watch the trailer and skip the feature.
B009MO5960|2.0|No plot worth deciphering.  No character worth caring about.  A repeat of just about everything of interest in the previous movies, only out of context, unsurprising, uninspiring. From the previous movies, did you like the Red Queen?  Got'er, but washed out and dull.  Did you like the hall of lasers?  Got it, except no one gets hurt (if that spoils your movie, get a life.  Seriously).  Michelle Rodriguez's two facial expressions?  Well you get one of them.  The flip flying fighting, shooting, and slo mo bullets?  Got it X 10.  It is so Matrixy CGI, even the live actors look computer generated.  Topped off towards the by an endless chop-stick, flying, flipping CGI Kung Fu fightfest that only does one thing: it makes you appreciate the subtlety of Kill Bill's Kung Fu fights.<br /><br />How bad was this movie?  Honestly, I can't fully plum it's depths, I kept nodding off.  My 9 year-old son kept waking me up until he started playing video games with his smartphone during the last half of the movie.  And, we like the RE series!  It was so dumb and dull he said we should not keep the disc for our RE collection.  Like he says, name a good fourth movie in a series.  What a ridiculous waste of money, talent, and computer bytes.  This high end of the action movie action is reaching(ed) the point of CGI saturation.  It's boring.<br /><br />Oh, and the most jaw-dropping part of the movie is it ends with a set up for a sequel.  Not a subtle open ended ending, but five minutes that will be the first five minutes of the next movie.
B005Q4CM0Q|5.0|The movie arrived in perfect condition before expected and plays great. I've watched it twice already and have had no problems.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|This app lets you hide live and recorded gameplay from various videogame players and professional leagues.<br /><br />It is very basic but gives very few options with regards to screen size, saving favorites, or subscribing to channels.<br /><br />Viewing on a Kindlle makes the quality drop, but the app on the iPhone looks fine.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Great movie for the hopelessly romantic!  I had to watch it a couple times to catch the timeline involved.  The time difference is still somewhat of a head-scratcher for me, but it did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|Neil comes out with a record that will stand the test of time! I'd say his best album since Beoken Arrow. If you're sick of where today's music going these days, then \\"Drift Back\\" with Neil and the boys today! Distortion-laden open-chord nirvana.
B0086449YA|5.0|Great CD, a little nautical, a little terrestial, irish tunes and of course awesome guitar riffs!  A very good buy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can only say this is one of the most heart wrenching and heart warming story I ever read. This is a beautifully writen book and I feel its a must read. This author did a great job.
B000T433CO|2.0|it was tastefully presented...language & sex scenes were appropriate for all ages.  I only finished it to punish myself for wasting money.
B003XF1OJK|3.0|The Book itself is very well written and the story line is able to keep you interested to the last. There are no lengthy irrelevant pieces that every one would agree were placed as page fillers. We all have done it in our own personal writing.<br /><br />One thing that did bother me was that there isn't a consistent continuation to the Halo universe as a whole. We have \\"Contact Harvest,\\" that explains how exactly the first contact between Humans and Covenant happened, how Harvest was destroyed and how some of the Humans were saved from the invaders. My understanding is that \\"Fall of Reach\\" was written after \\"Contact Harvest,\\" so the author should have made an effort to read the previous books to understand the universe.<br /><br />Also, there are also constant errors with the military system in the story line. You have non commissioned officers ordering around regular officers and so on. Author, just because a rank has a \\"officer\\" in the name, does not mean he/she is one. CPO=Chief Petty Officer is a non-commissioned rank and they are below the rank of an ensign which is the lowest of an officer rank.<br /><br />Little bit more research and not being lazy is my advice.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is amazing. the graphics are great and the powerups are very usefully especially since you can upgrade them.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|If you've seen Gilmore Girls you know that you can't just watch it once, nor twice. I don't even think three times would suffice. This collection is perfect. Its so fun to relive the episodes and having the whole collection together is perfect. Got it for my sister and she loves it.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|There's seems to be a curse when it comes to to the last of a superhero trilogy. We saw it in the third Chris Reeves' Superman movie and in the original Spiderman trilogy with Tobey Mcquire. The Chris Nolan Batman movies I'm afraid suffers the same fate. The second Chris Nolan Batman is without a doubt the best Superhero movie ever made (The Dark Knight). These shoes were impossible to fill with the late great Heath Legder's brilliant Joker probably the best movie villain of all times. Unfortunely the Dark Knight Rises is a dissapointment with a hardly discernable villain in Bain played by the gifted Tom Hardy whose motives and visage are ill defined. The plot has mores hole in it than a swiss cheese factory and the twist at the end makes no sense. Rest easy dear Heath you will never be surpassed.<br /><br />Regards<br />Perry Greenberg
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|One of the best hidden object role playing game I played since big fish mystery  raven Hurst.. a well done job. We need more like this. I also like that you get to try it before you have to pay. The game is very long we'll worth the money. Crystal clear very easy on the eyes.  SCARY game. I just loved it.  We'll done. Great story. More need more like this.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|good for entertaining for a while. more or less got it out of curiosity. hate having min required words to make review!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This movie is the sequel to all the other Bourne movies; however, it takes us to a far reaching journey that involves the creation of Super Humans. Not your regular Bourne movie.<br />I had hopped that it was a true sequel to the originals, but was deseponted. The ending is anti climatic.<br />If you are bored, this is fine.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Always a John Corey fan. This book isn't on a par with some of his others but still a good read.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|We sat down with the whole family (8 year old and 11 year old) and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was surprisingly engaging even for us parents.  I recommend this for all families with children especially those who have not yet reached the teen years.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|It is another Christmas present. specifically asked for. So I know it will be liked as well the other 2 movies
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I got this for my grandsons  who loved it.  I, as adult, thought it was very good.  It had a lot of laughs and held your interest.
6305280762|3.0|For a new dvd, i was not impressed that it didn't come sealed like the other 2 movies I bought from other sorces on Amozon.com. This move is a present and I am wondering if it is indeed a new movie. I haven't had time to check it out to make sure it plays and at the same time with it suppose to be a new movie, I don't think it is right for me to play it to make sure it works. Cause in my eyes it then becomes a used movie. Since I don't buy a lot fom here I am going to just deal with this copy and hope that it plays fine for the person I am giving it to for Christmas.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|This movie was alright, but I don't think it cfan compare to the original with Charleston Heston.  They changed this story too much from the original and it just didn't &#34;Have it&#34; compared to the original.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoy the writing style of Michael Connelly and especially like his Harry Bosch character.  The story was interesting because  Harry kept  searching until he found the culprit
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Glorious! I am an instant fan like everyone every age. Attended the Season Three screening and loved watching it with the group.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I've read all of Tom Clancy's new releases, usually in collaboration with another writer and find the books OK. Haven't found any that really get me like Rainbow 6, or Patriot Games did, but I will continue to read them unless the political side gets too far right, then I will hang them up.
1419705849|5.0|Like all the series, the writing style definitely appeals more to the boys than parents, but I'm glad to have something he really wants to read.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I've been a huge fan of Steely Dan for decades, and Donald Fagen, obviously, has had a big influence on &#34;The Dan's&#34; material - this album shows his musical thinking, and it has a lot of the same excellent qualities.  I can't really give the CD five stars, because Fagen's 'solo' writing lacks some of the magic that has occurred in his collaboration with Walter Becker; however, it's still very worthwhile listening.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book allows me to learn more words. Also I enjoyed the narrative and how the story develops. Katniss is the heroine and she has to grow and and learn so fast the rules of manipulation in order to survive.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book I have read it 4 times  and very different than my normal books I have read in the past
B000002ADT|5.0|the cd arrived in promised time. quality is very good as described. This is a most enjoyable cd. I am glad I got it.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Best comedy movie ive watched in a while! was rolling around laughing. Very crude and not for anyone 15and under.. Loved it tho! Definatley recommended to see:)
B001QWBM62|5.0|If you do any type of recording, especially if your producing a &#34;show&#34; for an audience ie. Podcast, Webcast, YouTube Channel etc...<br />Then you owe it to yourself and your viewers/listeners to upgrade from your crappy laptop mic or headphone mic to a ZoomH4n.<br />I'm a standup comedian who also is producing a podcast and this has been an amazing upgrade for me to record my live shows and also to do interviews. When you ask a &#34;celebrity&#34; to do a quick interview for your podcast and you have one of these with lavalier microphones then they immediately take you seriously. Look and sound Pro, turn every recording into something you're proud to present to others. For the price you will not buy a better and more powerful piece of equipment, this baby with some skills/learning in Audacity and you will be giving even the guys with their own purpose built podcasting studios a run for their money. Enjoy!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|excellent movie. although the ending was left open to ones imagination of a possible addition movie coming out at some future point.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|I have a 32&#34; on the bedroom wall and when I added the HD cable receiver and went to hook up the HDMI cable, I found that the HDMI port was too close to the wall.  Bought one of these and it fixed that problem perfectly.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I love the killers!  It has their typical sound with a different twist.  I'm glad they put another album out!
B00AH8U3UC|4.0|Still love the series. Just not as bright as the previous seasons. The story-line feels tired. Duchovny saves the show though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So grand to have the weather report ready at my finger tips exactly when I'm looking for it. Better than waiting on the tv weather on the eights or the laptop to boot with lots of newsfeed distractions. The current conditions on top with details at each swipe or tap... hourly, daily and more specifically to my location than other news sources.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!!! its a great way to pass the time. some games are challenging..but thats what makes it fun! I highly recommend it!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|overall good song choices.kelly has a good voice.wish deluxe cd/dvd was usa version.also price was good.five dollars.recommend to new old kelly fans
B0050R0XPA|5.0|This is the third winter village building I purchased, and the attention to detail is amazing. One thing worth mentioning is that the building isn't &#34;closed&#34; in the back; it's open so you can easily see all the detail inside the post office. There are lots of mini figures and accessories that come in this set. The gazebo with the musicians is a really nice touch!<br /><br />The set comes with several stickers you need to apply to the truck and building, which I'm not crazy about. I like when the bricks are printed or don't need additional detail from stickers. I highly recommend this set as an addition to your holiday village display!
B008K9UZY4|1.0|Says it will run on Transformer tablet but is just old school graphics blown up for tablet - I want my money back and will delete the app. Bad playing experience for anyone that uses modern games.
B004ADH1RI|3.0|Not PG. Strong language, albeit in Spanish subtitles, with content innapropriate for children: MArijuana, Cocaine, Heroine, sexual .........' '***T'.  Might consider this for the younger kids.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|This watch looks great, but it does not last.  The band broke within a couple weeks and the time is not reliable.  I would have been better off buying a watch from a cracker jack box.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Interesting take. I read the book first, and though I wish there were some more accurate pieces from the book in the movie, I think they still do a pretty good job. It was action packed, and kept you riveted throughout the film. I feel that all the actors did a great job.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This first morning this went off it about scared me too death!  It truly will wake you up!  I love the bright display that is easy to read across the room.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Maybe it's because I love Tommy Lee Jones, but Josh Brolin AS TLJ? Shut the front door! This is a great movie to wrap up the series. Unexpected twists and great performances from the actors. Lots of cameos.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong any way I can get it....Free and on my kindle is just AWESOME.  I tend to get board easy, waiting at appointments, so this is perfect!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Excellent writing. Beautiful camera angles. Not better than the first, but definitely a very good movie. Once again, another winner from Guy Ritchie.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love my little pony!except for the little problem next time I went on.. when I was trying to get on it the second time it didn't work! I was so devastated!.but I still like the game.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great five star story - a mystery really as it unfolds and surprises you. Starts a little slow but eventually pulls you in so you cannot put it down. I can't wait to read another of her books. Treat yourself.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|It is very beautiful but it not working on my kindle fire hd somehow.Plus I also think it is worth a dollar also the cheats are very helpful too.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Like so many others that use it; I love this stuff! Used it for a new cooler I bought (Zalman 9900MAX) on a phenom II Hex-core over clocked to 4.0ghz with other variables over clocked to a far reaching extent. Cool temperatures idle and full load. I have reviewed the 9900MAX so feel free to look up my review of it as it goes into depth on temp and such with my setup.<br /><br />Pro's: competitively priced<br />Effective heat desperation<br />Good for more than one use<br /><br />Con's: None<br /><br />Other thought's: I used the dot method with the application
034580404X|5.0|I read the first book and decided I had to have the trilogy so I could read it whenever and the books arrived in a nice time frame!
0446554995|5.0|A great story as expected from these authors. Pendergast always comes out on top. My hubby liked the book too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is good for all ages. Children will see me playing and askto play so i switch it to an easier difficulty and let them play. The highest difficulty is really challenging. If you like thinking games, you will definitely enjoy this!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its fun.<br />But the price of points is a huge drawback.<br />Tutorial would have been nice.<br />But if your looking to kill time this is the game
B003UYUP58|5.0|Gives a broad historical look at cancer research and insights into how research works...the good and the bad.  One gains great respect for the efforts that so many scientists have made over the years...and hopefully will continue to make until we rid ourselves of this scourge...
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Like my review on the other Borne movie, this is one of my favorite series. A DVD either works or it's defective. Mine works and I got it at a great price from Amazon. Shipping gets an A+. Highly recommend
B005721W9O|5.0|One of the all-time funniest movies.  Will be enjoyed best by those who grewup with the original &#34;Start Trek&#34; television series.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie series. The DVD worked like it should. Not much to go wrong here. It either works or it's defective. Mine works. Great price from Amazon and great shipping time also. Highly recommend.
0865478767|5.0|Bellos' exposition of the issues - and resolutions - surrounding translation, interpreting and moving across cultural divides is both extraordinarily well researched and presented in a fashion that any reader can enjoy and understand (no academic jargon). I recommend it especially to the monolingual reader for its educational and entertainment value. The multilingual reader and professional translators will find experience many &#34;ah ha&#34; moments as phenomena that they have experienced are explained.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I've caught bits and pieces of this film on cable for the past year and wanted to be able to watch it all in one sitting.  Parts of me got really disturbed and 'squeamish' over the subject matter because the film is about the destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria and most of western knowledge at the time, which no doubt set us back at least a thousand years.
B004M5HKIY|4.0|I love this, but the text for Kindle and the original text from the printed book are both in there and fighting each other. It makes for a confusing experience. Some of the pictures are overexposed and washed out. Many pages are repeated. It could be better, but it is still delightful to read on Kindle.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|It is insane to charge this much per episode for a show that many get on basic cable. I guess I supported the pricing by paying it though.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have read all three of the 4-Hour branded books and this one doesn't disappoint.  I consider myself a relatively experienced hand in the kitchen, but I still came away with new knowledge of the culinary arts.  What I appreciate most about Tim's writings is that he writes from experience, not just a bunch of research chewed up and spit back out to the reader.  I trust Tim's advice because I know it has worked for him.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I first started reading the series, I was told that it was geared to young people not older people like me. Well everyone, think again because these books are for everyone including ol' geezers. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and loved the way it ended.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|My lil one loved it and so did we. Plenty of laughs for both the kids and adults, a must see
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies ever.  I'm like a child again when watching this movie. It's just a beautiful heartwarming story that will be a classic forever.
B005ZMTAXQ|3.0|Good but not better than the original Toy Story. My children love Toy Story so it is a nice change from the original...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know from the rampant sale of this book that I would be stormed by those who completely disagree with me but this book is definately not for me.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|If you have watched a version of A Christmas Carol (A Muppet Christmas Carol is my personal favorite) and enjoyed it this is a must read.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was extremely apprehensive about watching this show with my husband and son.  I am not really into the whole zombie thing and tend to avoid shows and movies of the sort.  I will say that I forced myself to give this show a chance and quickly found myself asking, \\"what happens next?\\"  Love the characters and how they work together to overcome their perceived fate.  I've never been so excited to see a zombie get its butt kicked!  You end up rooting for the characters, feeling relief when they prevail, and sadness when they perish.  Can't wait to watch season 2!!!
B00AMS38YU|4.0|Sit back, relax... Nah, that won't happen.<br />Really exciting and engaging. Harkens back to \\"Quicksilver\\". (15 words)<br />Don't have much else to say except I'd like to not have to say anything, just put up a rating. (35 words non-parenthetically)
B008A1TIOK|5.0|Would highly recommend this recomposition of the classical music of Vivaldi's perrenially popular &#34;The Four Seasons&#34;.  Delightful, surprising, imaginative and relaxing.  I can't get enough listening time for this one.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|...Have looked at all the different types of multi tools for belt or pocket carry...<br />..leatherman,Gerber,and SOG...etc...ranging in price from $59.95 up to $181.99.......<br />...They all have their pros and cons...BUT for the money and the quality and everyday carry...<br />..I picked this model...Why because after recieving it,used it to remove car battery terminals on the side...<br />...Loosened a nut on the bottom of my sink,cut open some heavy tape on a wooden box and some twine...etc...<br />...Found this multi tool was quite good and effective for these simple but neccessary jobs...Plus I like the rubber side grips...<br />...It came oiled just enough to let you know it was there but not too much,and a good reminder to check it every month or so...<br />...It is a very good everyday pocket tool,or if you want on the belt with the nylon pouch it came with...pouch could have been<br />...a little more heavy stitched or heavier duty nylon BUT for the money not bad...All in All I would recomend this product...
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this solitaire app because it reminds me of the classic windows 95' version. but I think the developers could have made it a little more challenging. I've won every random game I played so far. But that said, this app stays true to classic style and I like it!
B00124HT8O|5.0|Forever Changes is still one of my favorite albums, and it amazes me now how I keep going back to it, and how much I respect this highly original work of art. I believe that it is one of the best folk-rock albums of our era, and personally like it better than most albums of the past forty years. Like everyone says it fit the times perfectly: the summer of love, Viet-nam, psychedelics, long hair, blues and rock and all the rest. We forget how new all this was, how radical and different. Just a few years back people were listening to insipid pop music-- that is the white people were. Does anyone remember Bobby Rydel and Paul Anka? And like everyone else who adores the album it is a startling and dynamic mix of music and poetry. Mr Lee and his partner Bryan McLean wrote  lyrics that were ahead of almost everyone else: enigmatic, lovely, revolutionary and with some vivid imagery that perfectly fit the passion, angst and turmoil of the times. Also amazing is how well this album has held up: it is still fresh and new! Most albums of the time are dated, sometimes embarrassingly so. Frankly I do not know how they accomplished this album at such a young age, Arthur Lee in his early twenties. I read the book about Love, and examined almost everything that has been written about them, and tried to understand what went into making this remarkable work of music. I have come to the opinion, right or wrong, that it was a surprising combination of people who were just right for the album and the time. Of course there was Arthur Lee who wrote most of the songs, his inspiration, poetic genius and musical sense, also the producer who I  believe added the strings--which many people of the time scoffed at; they are beautiful and fit the album perfectly; the other members of the band who with the combined energy, and led by the fiery Lee, exceeded their talents: including the lead guitar player, Johnny Echols, Brian McLean who added a lyric gentler influence to the sound, and the others.What a joy it is, to listen to it. I remember the day I first heard it. I was a naive white middle class kid on the verge of great changes: about to plunge into the new world of the sixties. My friend Jack, who was in a fancy prep school, somehow heard of it. We were Easterners, and Love rarely played in the East. He played it for me in his room and I was enchanted. My taste in music, at the time, was pretty basic, though I loved the Stones and the Beatles, but this album Forever Changes touched something deep in my soul which has stayed me since. The band then broke up and Arthur Lee went into a long decline and never produced anything remotely as good. But he survived a prison term and came back to a glorious revival, for a few years before he died of cancer. He did it, he and his band mates: they created a masterpiece.
B005OJTVAW|2.0|it is very difficlt to use- it is diffcilt to put kindle in it and not as easy as covers you can fold or use to stand up
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Uplifting,beautifu, and inspiring are the words I use to describe this movie. The magic of music and the power of hope beyond reason.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Everyone knows that there are bullies we have to contend with. The show helps give views on how we as individuals can take courage and be a superhero in our own right.
0307592731|5.0|My wife has read me snippets and I really think I'll love it too.  She insists that I must read it which I fully intend to do.
0140557741|5.0|This is my favorite gift when I don´t know the taste of the person. Everyone I gave like so far, independent of the age.
030758836X|4.0|I had been eyeing this book for quite a while before I finally caved and read it. It had a great pace to it and the writing style, while not amazing, kept the story flowing. There were just a couple things I wish I had been warned about:<br /><br />1. Don't read at night: I can't tell you how late I stayed up saying to myself: \\"One more chapter. Just one more.\\" and end up still reading after fifteen chapters. Be prepared. Most of the chapters end with a surprise or cliffhanger, so you will have a hard time putting the book down.<br /><br />2. The Characters: God, what an emotional roller coaster ride the other put me through with the characters. I hated him, felt so sorry for her. I felt sorry for him, hated her. Felt sorry for them both. Hated them both with a passion. It was a lot of flip-flopping of opinions and it did wear me out a little.<br /><br />3. The ending: I actually found the ending a stroke of creativity. Some people say she takes the easy way out, but I think it made it a tad more realistic. There isn't a big twist at the end. There isn't complete resolution. Life goes on to the outward world, but inside to them, it is clearly unstable. With that ending, I remained frightened for them both long after I flipped the last page. Genius.<br /><br />It's a great book, and one I'd definitely recommend a strong spirited person who doesn't mind coarse language, intense plot, and insanity.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I buy a Tom Clancy book as soon as it comes out in order to read about tomorrow's world news. At times, I think I am reading nonfiction. This time in Threat Vector, Jack Ryan continues as President of the USA.  Jack Ryan seems more like Paul Ryan the VP candidate, so not all of Clancy is prophetic. Oh well. Now every time I experience a computer glitch, I wonder if some world power is sabotaging cyberspace. What next, author Clancy?

0071636080|2.0|My daughter bought this for me for Christmas and I wish she had saved her money. To give the feel for the paucity of content in this book, I read it in about three hours during a family get-away weekend. I've given hundreds of presentations in my life. I admired Jobs skills in presentation but if I expected to learn them here ... well I didn't. The entire book could have been summarized in ten pages. I can learn more about Job's style watching a YouTube video than reading this book.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Christopher Nolan's first 2 Batman movies were among my most favorite movies of all time. Thrilling, exciting, action packed and great story as well as cinematography, so it goes unsaid that I could not wait to see this movie.  I was sorely disappointed.  Its was so slow and dragged out for over the first half of the movie I could barely manage to make far enough into it and experience what Nolan did in the first movies that made them great.  But the first half of the movie ruined it for me.  Anne Hathaway, Christian Bale, Michael Caine ( peachy) and Gary Oldman [ Caine and Oldman are  actors on my personal top 10 list of actors ]  and Morgan Friedman were of course fantastic as usual.  One thing that constantly bothered me through the whole movie is that Baines Voice always sounded like it was done in a recording booth. Even when they were in concrete areas and everyone elses voice was reflecting and echoing as you would expect,  Baines voice sounded like he was in a far off studio. His voice , even if modified and electronicly enhnaced, would still echo and bounce around like any other sound would in certain enviroments. Then of course the usual batman grumble mumble you can barely understand, and its just annoying.  Its really made it seem cheesy for me.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I really respect and like Christopher Nolan and the cinematography was as usual, great,  not because of the movie was all that great.  In my opinion.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is a thrilling movie and one of the most thoughtful science-fiction movies ever made.  Jodie Foster is superb.  Mathew M. is also at his best.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|We enjoyed the film very much.  Visually very good with good acting.  The animation was smooth, and the graphics were excellent.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I NEEDED TO WATCH A COUPLE OF EPISODES THAT DIDN'T TAPE SO I DOWNLOADED THIS ON MY KINDLE HD.  WITHOUT HEADPHONES THE AUDIO WAS A BIT LOW SO I USED HEADPHONES WITH GREAT IMPROVEMENT.  THE VIDEO QUALITY IS GREAT.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Having seen the other Snow White movie that came out about the same time I must say that this is more enjoyable.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|This is without question the worst recording I have ever heard of this beloved musical. I have been a fan of Les Mis since it first came out with the London Cast Album with Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean. The only redeeming thing about this disc is they at least let Colm sing the meager few lines of the bishop who forgives Valjean and sets him on the path of righteousness. Okay now for the review: The lyrics have been changed in some songs which is a sacrilege in my eyes, this musical was perfect \\"as is\\" why do they always mess with it when making a filmed version? The singing is awful. Anne Hathaway cannot sing without sounding like a lamb. She is flat a lot and drags out the songs to make them even more dramatic which is unnecessary. A few people have jumped all over me saying that this is a live recording to go with the film and that once I see the finished product I will understand it better but the problem with that is that this is a musical and as such should be, well, musical! Russel Crowe is just not listenable and Hugh Jackman is only a tiny bit better. His version of Bring Him Home is the worst one I have ever heard. How can they take one of the most beautiful songs and the centerpiece of Valjean's character and massacre it? I will see this though on video next year. I cannot express how disappointed I was when listening to this soundtrack, what a tragic waste. If you want to hear Les Mis in all of its pristine glory I suggest the Dream Cast recording. These roles belong to Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, and Philip Quast. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH!
B008RZCYGI|5.0|I first read this book in college, where I used it extensively!  I'm in the process of writing my own book and I need to pick this up to review and use as a reference.  It contains all the style issues that you may encounter in your writing.  The perfect book to pick up for the writer in your family!
B009HELT3C|1.0|It was very predicable. Stale. Corny jokes. Slow moving.<br />They should just have shelved the series and ended it years ago.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Where is Do You Hear the People Sing?????? That is the most inspiring, the most moving song in the entire show yet inexplicably it is missing from the sound track.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had been waiting for the price to come down on this set. I seen it at over 100 bucks to start. There was no way I was spending a 100 bucks for a movie. I kept checking back and it kept going down in price. When it hit 25 bucks, I finally got it. It works great in my Panasonic 3D blueray player along with my LG 3D TV with my Sony 3D capable sound system. It looks better than it did on the big screen.  Very good quality. Thanks Amazon.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game. It is really entertaining. I believe that everyone should buy it. Well worth the dollar. Plz buy it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I first seen thee guys on youtube. Someone sent me a link to one of their songs. After sitting and watching several of their videos, I had to get their CD. Great music!! Great CD!! I will buy more of their CD's.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Clear graphics. Good game. Would have liked to have seen more versions in app. Quick to load; no force closures.
B004GYY714|3.0|Works well in some areas and some not so well, but has good sound in those areas you can use this in.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game. When I started playing this I couldn't get off of it that's how good it is. I reccomend this.
B00A83075M|5.0|I took my nieces to see this movie today and we all loved it!<br /><br />I've read reviews on other websites where parents were concerned there was a message that it was good to be bad.  I'm not sure what movie they were watching, but that is NOT the takeaway at all.  The actual message of the movie is to be who you are.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys animated movies, movies with great messages, and anyone who loves video games.  This is a great family movie!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I am not able to get on the internet a lot and so i was just on and thought about this and im here now . The D-pads where very very screwed up and it was skipy with the analog sticks. On cod you can't snipe at all and you can not  focus your gun it moves everywhere and its major annoying i would recommend getting a 3rd party controller that is better build than this cheap heap of plastic.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting. With surprise ending that was quite satisfying. Enjoyable read. Recommend it highly. Worth the money. You will enjoy.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Perfect for busy dads! It really made it easy and fun to learn how to intuitively make great dishes from whatever you have available!
B003M5D65Q|5.0|The Lego Star Wars-Rebel Trooper Army Pack was asked for by a child connected with a Charity Organization we are involved with.  I checked the item when it arrived and it was exactly what the child asked for, so I'm sure he will be happy.
B000I9X67W|4.0|There was a lot of lagging in this movie. Good Movie ! Most likely will enjoy it . Nice Bands .
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is easy and a great way to take your mind off things. You must react fast regarding eye,hand or brain coordination
B00A757EFW|4.0|I FREAKIN LOVE THIS GAME!!!! IT JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL!!!<br />but.... on little prob.... the control thing is just not the type of controlled thing you would like if your a fast player sooooo kinda keep the movement of the controller and sometimes it will end up in a completely fifteenth place then where you put it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this daily.  It is a  great app to have; and easy to use as well.  The alarms are nice tones and I like the way the snooze button works also on this app behind much larger then the dismiss button.
B003BOUKRU|5.0|If you like Celine Dion then you will really enjoy this Blu-Ray.  Many hits and ballads, all done in Celines special way !!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent story telling<br /><br />Vivid imagery and plotlines. .<br />Strongly recommend this novel because it will hold your interest from the first paragraph of chapter one.
B001CQONKY|5.0|Finally got the last of the original CSI.  Really sorry somone screwed up by bring in Ted Danson.  I tried to enjoy the show, just couldn't, not a big Ted Danson fan
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Total fun 3d movie, this is the way 3d should be made. Nnot like the red and blu glasses version that people still get tempted in to buying
B00A429YF6|5.0|A wonderful cast.  A great story line will keep you wondering, just what a great life we have when you open your mind and deal with life in a new point of view....
0316227706|5.0|I have dogs who swim, one of them is a chocolate Lab rescue.  I knew by her excited yip after she gets out of the water<br />that life is good for her.  I was amazed that some breeds and mutts wouldn't go in the water such as my Beagles.  The pictures<br />and the names of each one of the dogs stretches my imagination.  I hope I see more books with pictures of our wonderful<br />aqua dogs from Seth Casteel.
B000F3UAFC|4.0|interesting story to say the least.  Well worth the time to watch it ona rainy day.  At least that's whatwe thought
B00A2XU9IS|3.0|L'app è molto ben fatta ma la traduzione in italiano è assolutamente penosa e fatta con i piedi (era meglio il traduttore automatico)
B00A17AD36|5.0|HES THE MALE SADE, I THANK GOD FOR THE ABILITY TO HEAR EVERY TIME I HEAR HIS BLESSED VOICE YOULL LOVE IT REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE AND THE LYRICS ARE DEEP TOO LIKE I LITERALLY CANT NAME ONE SHALLOW SONG
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is so naughty and nice!  This season's villains keep on getting creepier and creepier.  Good quality CD an price, too!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I have loved LZ since I was 11 years old in 1971.  To see them perform again, was a dream I had all my life.  Never was able to see them live in the US because I was too young to make it to any shows.  This CD/DVD was one of the best gifts I have received this Christmas!  The concert was a true LZ quality performance and the price was worth every penny.  Rock On!  Chris Nestor Roccapriore
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Haven't been blown away, instantly, by a sound in a long time. Right out of the box, An Awesome Wave snapped its snaggleteeth into my head. With great force. I'm in love.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game seems intended for children but is VERY addictive and fun even though u just point and click and there isn't much to it...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app allow you to watch YouTube videos but also lets you download YouTube videos right onto your Kindle Fire HD, in High Definition!. TubeMate is a slick easy to use app. I use TubeMate to watch YouTube videos over the YouTube app.<br /><br />The reason is because if there is a link in the description of the video, the YouTube app does not allow you to click the link. TubeMate does allow you to click links in the description of YouTube videos. That's a must for me.<br /><br />Not much I can really add to this review except if you are not using TubeMate, you're missing out.
B005Z28M58|5.0|Of course this is a 5 star rating! How could it be anything else? My daughter has the whole collection and I get to see each series before I pass it on to her. Loved it and I'm sorry it's off the air.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used Avast mobile since getting my Kindle Fire HD and I can't complain at all. Folks, don't let anyone tell you any different, you do need security for your mobile devices. I have found this one to be quick and effective. It takes up little space and is easy to use. Try Avast mobile security, you won't be disappointed.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I cant open this app but it looks fun I have my little pony and it works but not this please someone help becaues this is not opening
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is the best App killer available right now, in my opinion. You can set the apps it kills and how quickly it kills them. I like to check it from time to time to make sure I'm not loosing a lot of battery juice on apps I am not using. The fact is that some apps will start running on start up or for no reason. Having an app killer is absolutely necessary and this app killer is the one I use and recommend.<br /><br />Some android items have a task manager on them. If you have a task manager on your android item then you don't need an additional task killer. For us Kindle Fire HD users, this is an easily managed and well behaved app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I beat this game in about 30 minutes but overall I love this game so much that I played it 14 times
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This is a fairly small micro reader but that's what I wanted. I use it all the time and it's works well. It can look confusing so a couple things to remember. The actual reader must have the copper pads face down and the micro disk slid in the sleeve on top with it's pads also face down. Once the disk is pushed in all the way, flip the reader over so the pads are now face up towards you. Now slide it into your USB port, pads first. I could wager that some people are getting a bit confused about how this little reader works.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|i love it. the idea of having birds fightinh in space is very interesting. the gravity of stars changes the orbit of flying birds.
B000068PQ0|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and haven't yet heard it.  However, I just saw the live musical debut at the La Jolla Playhouse under the same name and it was FABULOUS!!  The music was wonderful which is what prompted me to get this as a gift.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|My daughter loved this movie and we could not find our copy of the DVD I purchase a couple of years ago.  I ended up purchasing this since it was on Bluray and included a regular dvd as well.  This is a funny and touching movie.  Cindy Lou is so sweet and the Griche's one-liners are pretty good,  Max steals the show.  Enjoyed the movie overall.
B00005RYKU|5.0|what a cool movie, you've got to watch this one, well done, grabbed my attention, and wanted to watch several times , thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awsome book. Ready for the next and final one. Hope you enjoy it as much as i did<br />Thank you
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Saw this movie and decided to buy the dvd, I love this high-action movie, and all the actors and actresses, a wild ride through the streets of Rio, anyone who loves action movies will enjoy this one, thanks
B00006CXSS|5.0|The ultimate WWII movie, and I watch it at least every couple months. Sometimes I only watch certain ones. Nothing bad to say about this one. David Swimmer, of Friends, does a great job in a very tough role that is really out of character for him after watching Friends for years. This put him in another light, and I hope he does more &#34;Non-Friends&#34; characters. Amazingly, many of the chose actors resemble very closely the actual veterans.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Husband wanted it and we watch \\"walking dead\\" together. Now we can watch it anytime we want. Can't wait. We have season 1 and waiting for season .
0792839730|5.0|Very fine movie, tons of stars, and good dialoge too. Equipment is very close to authentic as well. Great picture. A must have for any WWII library. Also, I suggest &#34;The Bridge at Raemagen&#34; to go along with this one.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After hearing the hype I decided to read it for myself.  needless to say... it didn't disappoint ;)  great romance and I can't wait to finish the trilogy.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Awesome, to say the least. Hard core, and Hard Corps. Of course, R. Lee Ermey makes it. But still a good move overall.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Really thought I would like it, however the app freezes and pretty much does not  work. I would not recommend.
B004478AS4|2.0|at the risk of sounding superficial i found the book awkward and trite.  the characters were never whole so that i cared about them.  there was plenty of gore but the shallowness of the individuals who caused it or were damaged left me uninvolved.  the flatness could be attributed to the unsophistication of the tribesmen, but there was too much of the noble savage and too little humanity to involve me in their lives.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I think this is a great game but the pictures are misleading. The graphics are not so good, and the objects don't render from a far distance. It is still fun but gameloft should fix this. 4 stars.
B007THA4FI|5.0|getting into the many characters took some effort.  once there i was wholly involved in a really good read.  rowling adhered to the commitment she made the reader at the beginning, and even as complicated as the story became she neatly resolved all of the issues satisfactorily by the end.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It's hilarious and interesting, and has a really great soundtrack. Aside from that, it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time that is actually clean (maybe one or two dirty jokes, but definitely still family friendly), and it's still great the fourth time (which is how many times I saw it in theaters - and I never re-watch in theaters). My man, who is a huge movie buff thought it would be a stupid girly movie, but even he enjoyed it and approved of all the cinematic stuff as well. Overall it's a great film for family movie night, or a night in with the girls.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Well made and interesting, except for the plot, which is the same old thing that has been trundled out time and time again.  My goodness with all that money available, you would think that Hollywood could come up with a few new ideas,  Apparently this is not possible.
B000002AGY|5.0|Concierto de aranjuez my all time favorite.All musicians this CD top of their game.Sir Roland sounds better each time I hear him.
B007USWCXS|4.0|I thought that the movie gave  a good view of people who live on the margins and the friendships that they establish between themselves.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great app, love playing with my ponies everyday.wish it didn't take so many gems and old at higher levels. My grandaughter got me into it.
B0030B1WBM|5.0|Jim Carrey...no one could have done what he did in this movie to bring the Grinch to life.  I couldnt tell you how many times I have watched this movie.  I do recommend it!!  Ron Howard did really good.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It was AWESOME. I would recommend this to any Aliens fan. I must have.  I haven't watched the special features yet but I don't think I'll be disappointed.
1419705849|5.0|Good short read for elementary and middle school age students. I would recommend the whole series of books to kids who like to read comic like books.
B00AMS38YU|5.0|This was a great movie. There was tons of action. No boring or slow moments... The acting was also done well.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Super intense!! Loved how it was fast paced. Kept me reading all day and night! I rate the book as a 5! Loved it!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Excellent Value, price is right, great addition to my library fat a price point that anyone can afford. I highly recommend this collection.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I am a big John Mayer fan.  First time through a little disappointed because it is so different than his other albums.  However, after listening to it again fell in love with several songs that I just keep replaying.
B00689J512|5.0|I'm a fan of Rihanna and this is a great album. I will add to my collection asap from her new album.
B000002A46|5.0|This Christmas album its a classic!! It's holydays again, the perfect time to purchase this cd! This is my Christmas soudtrack!

B003HE2B6C|5.0|This one brings me so much memories! Really nice! I've crossed the country to see them now I'm 27 yrs old 'cause when I was 13 my dad didnt let me do it. I'll never forget this tour!
0802130208|5.0|During high school there were always people who had their own special version of looking at the world. That Ignatius is 30 doesn't really matter. He is one of those guys who try but fail, who think the whole world is against them and that they are the chosen one to end it. Yet they always get into the wrong situations.<br />This book is great! Hilarious situations and great descriptive writing. Too bad he only wrote two books...
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This product is amazing! Beautifully made and high quality! I love it! Everyone in your family will too. Go for it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My husband and I live by this alarm app! It's the best alarm we've found that actually wakes us up. Lol! We especially like the Rooster Alarm! Lol!
B0063GORYU|2.0|The only enjoyable part is the one suit game but that gets boring.<br />You can only win the two suit game once out of 20 tries.<br />The four suit is impossible.<br />It is not fFUN!
1451650728|5.0|Despite J.J. Abrams reboot of the franchise on the big screen I am a still of a fan of the original story lines and characters developed in Star Trek Next Generation, Voyager, and Deep Space Nine. Author David Mack makes these characters jump out from the page with a excellent mix of character development and fast paced action. After having read his previous Star Trek Destiny trilogy I was thinking were is he going to take these characters next?<br />This story starts out in high fashion with the return of one the series most beloved characters who you thought was gone forever. David Mack brings him back in a way that will pull at your heartstrings. What it all boils down to is that this is the beginning of another great saga in the Star Trek universe and I wait with baited breath for the second and third installments.<br />A must read for any long time fan of Star Trek..A+
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Typical Clancy book with an interesting Cyber plot. Further story about jack Ryan Junior with his team at Hendley. recommended read if you like Tom Clancy's books.
B0038LB4TE|4.0|The whole series has been great, and this is among the very best. I love that each time there's a fresh new plot, and sufficient mystery intertwined with the 'can-Jack-be-beaten' set of baddies that keep you hungry for more. Now at number three on my 'Jack Reacher' hit list!
B0016Q6CQI|5.0|The musical episode has always been my favorite episode. The songs are catchy and when I found this, I was elated. I can now eing along to the songs anywhere I want.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|A year ago I picked this up at the local bookshop, read the jacket and went within a whisker of buying it. Instead I a) got hold of a Kindle and b) wisely decided to start at the very beginning of the Jack Reacher series. Both decisions having paid off in spades for time and money well spent.<br /><br />I still rate Killing Floor and Tripwire more highly, but this was well up there with Child's best. Perhaps a little more predictable than some others but otherwise all the best Reacher ingredients on show - engaging story, strong characters and of course the don't-mess-with-Jack justice system!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just finished this book. Very few if any slow moments, This is classic Vince Flynn. If any if this is true I know why we are in the shape were in. The characters are believable, the story line is scary. Our hero proves that he is human, having had my bell rung four times I especially feek bad for him. That waking up wondering where you are is not a good feeling. He gets his man and the old man is on his way out. Nobody lives forever. I highly recommend this book. With winter upon us this will pass those long nights by the fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so fun and I can never stop playing it is so much fun so that's why I gave it five stars
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Gets the job done at an excellent price. Appears to be well made; good grip (both for one's hand, for removal, and in the connector); easy-to-see color markings. No problem fitting them into the female connectors on my A/V receiver, tuner, TV , cable box or DVD. (Not at all sure what other people were complaining about.) Would recommend to others.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Movie depicts long standing marriage which has lost intamacy and now resembles the comfortable old shoe stage.the wife Meryl Strryp not sarisfied and longing for love and intamacy signs she and tommy lee jones, her husband for marital counseling. The laughs , the tears that bring them back to a new and more intimate and loving part of their. Life is laughable and enchanting
B008G33PMI|3.0|Tarja is one of the biggest named artist in Symphonic Metal and this cd does her justice. the songs are great.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Action not as good as the original, weird ending, okay for a boring evening at home. I don't have four more words.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Fact:  JAck Black can act.<br />serriously Jack Black can really act and this is one of the few movies that can truely show it.
B003VANOFY|1.0|It was broken... it didn't work as I purchased it, It was claimed to be like new but it wasn't
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Absolutely love this album, no need to skip over any of the tracks -- have to listen to them all!
B009GESJH2|3.0|Not Bad, Not his best stuff.  Entertaining.  Just doesnt move you like some of his other works.  Some songs are good and would probably come out better in a live performance, where he is very entertaining.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|Still have my OG white vinyl copy, and the folks at the record company saw fit to make my dreams come true in the form of the 180 gram reissue...thank you.<br />God, I know you exist because this prayer was answered...I'll be good from now on.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This a fun and challenging game. I have not solved one yet in the recommended moves but have enjoyed playing it
B008A40XWS|5.0|You know who Joey and John are...you KNOW their ensemble is the greatest. You understand their music because it touches you so deeply. Quit reading, and start buying...<br />Now.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|The storyline was predicable but overall was good. I have always like Clint--he is the main reason I rented this movie
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Entertaining, great conclusion to the trilogy. Could've been shorter, and there should've been someone better than Hathaway as catwoman. Well worthy the watch
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly, as always, makes us believe in Harry Bosch's war against indifference and inhumanity in the worlds of past and present Los Angeles. His portrayal of the LAPD is definitive, realistic and always even-handed. Worth reading on several levels.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I mean, all is great, but Hathaway is the most impressive, and her song is definitely the highlight. Crow is underrated
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This has to be the best TV show that i have ever seen.  I have never gotten involved in a show before...can't wait for Sunday nights .  I have gotten others hooked on this and have loaded it out to them
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|The expected Disney quality and content. Great for all ages and budding animal protectors. Beautiful images and story for anyone as well as a great way to donate to the cause.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|i liked it but there was nothing really special about it...not the BIG CD that Scotty McCreery debuted with but i hope there will be more to come.
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|Bomb ass movie! What else needs to be said? Buy it. Share it. And the world might be a bit better.
0525953728|4.0|u need to read this when u have the time for the details and no distractions.  I was perfect while home from knee surgery
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved and hated the book. Loved it because it was so good. Couldn't stop reading. Hated because there is still another story to read. This series is great. Hard to put the book down.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Good read, well written - loved the characters.  a non-typical story that moved along.  my only compliant was that the h seemed older than her age - a minor item.  highly recommend!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Would recommend to anyone who likes mystery and future happenings.  Enjoyed it a lot. Finished the book within two days of reading especially when I don't have much time to read. Read it and you will enjoy it.  On to the second book.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|The kid is entranced! In a good way!<br />This thing dererves all the great reviews it already has.<br />If youre reading this far, you might as well buy it already.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because I absolutely love this book. I love how they made Katniss confused about her feelings with petta. I would recommend this book to my friend Lily because she loves the first book.
B002RT2BXQ|1.0|In recent years as Ayn Rand became more and more known in public discourse I have often wondered why I had never heard of this so-called \\"classic\\" film, The Fountainhead.<br />As soon as the opening credits ended I soon learned that this was a hopelessly didactic series of characters exchanging speeches at each other in long winded, completely unrealistic dialog.<br />The line that the world was engaged in an orgy of self-sacrificing made me laugh out loud.<br />First, I am admirer of pre-war New York City Architecture as the overwhelming majority of people today are. So, the structures this leading man advocates are, today, also, regarded as eyesores than triumphs of individualism or anything other than, perhaps, corporate greed since they are cheaper to build than pre-war style buildings.<br />Second, the concept of building a building or, say, writing a book or making a movie without any concern whatsoever that anybody in the world beside the author or architect will enjoy it is absurd. Creating something without even considering if others will enjoy it would be like sending Christmas gifts at people with no hope or desire for the receiver of your gift to ever want to use this gift.<br />I can easily imagine Ayn Rand wrapping her own books and other unwanted things out to people who do not wish to read it as fulfilling her Christmas shopping, if she exchanged gifts with people at all. She would only be concerned if she liked wrapping the gifts, not if it will soon enter a garbage or be sent to Goodwill.<br />Third, towards the end, the lead character is far more like Timothy McVeigh than some kind of an adorable hero.<br />But,I am glad I saw it only to know what really happens when right wing nutjobs attempt to be creative.
B004SBX112|5.0|Love the ad free version. I love the different seasons. Great game! A lot of fun for everyone. I play all of the Angry Bird games.
B000059GEI|5.0|An exciting musical with a cast the type that would be impossible to put together in the same film.  The same old story but well presented.
0385341008|1.0|I enjoy this literary format--The Lady of the Decoration by Frances Little, and its follow-on titled The Lady and Sala San, are favorites of mine that like this, are stories written in the form of treasured and illuminating correspondence.<br />I really wanted to like this book and to be able to pass it on to my mother who served during WWII. This one though is just too cute for me. As another reviewer wrote, the writing is in spots distractingly \\"clever.\\" I love wit and wordplay and really miss the days of letters coming in the mail--I should have been able to adore this book, but I finally came to kind of dread \\"opening\\" another letter from Juliet. Sadly, the story didn't illuminate for me the real issues of postwar England and the coastal/island life challenges so that it came across to me as a bit counterfeit.<br />I took two runs at this book, several months apart, just in case I might later find it as charming as other reviewers have.<br /><br />Oh well.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie and enjoyed it--but one always gets more pleasure from reading, since it has so much more detail that they are unable to include in a film.  I cannot wait to read the second book!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A much needed addition to the discussion of personality types.  Susan Cain brings insight and wisdom to the subject of those of us who stand quietly on the sidelines.  I especially liked her recommendation to parents of quiet ones.  I wish my mom and dad had read this.

0316069434|5.0|I really don't understand how Connelly can keep producing the HARRY BOSCH tales at<br />this pace;  nonetheless,  once I started his latest (as with 98% of all of the others),  I just<br />couldn't put it down.  He has a special knack for 'sucking his readers in' and holding them<br />there.  This tale's plot is NOT perfect (especially when the female agent investigating him<br />shows up to save his butt),  but it's good enough to earn him another 4 1/2 stars!<br /><br />What are we Heironimus Bosch fans going to do when he retires?  I really hate to think of<br />that sad day.
B007X70NVO|5.0|For sure this documentary addresses what is effectively the Rossi era... The new young guns are given their just deserves but they are all still overshadowed by the great accomplishment of the rider of the last decade. Who is the fastest? 2013 Rossi and Yamaha will attempt to reclaim that title.  Regardless of what happens..Rossi has made his mark and no one or no thing can erase that!!!!!!

B007FOH7UU|4.0|I had LOVED Keane when they first came out with Hopes and Fears.  Couldn't listen to it enough!  Next thing I bought from them was Perfect Symmetry, and didn't care for it at all.  After reading reviews of this current cd, Strangeland, it sounded like Keane has gone back to a sound more similar to Hopes and Fears, so I'm giving it a try.  Haven't actually listened to it yet, thus only the 4 stars.  However, the cd did arrive very quickly,as promised after I ordered it and is in perfect condition.  Looking forward to hearing it!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Show is done well, like the new swing on things modernized. The surrounding cast of characters are great also. Will watch more.

B001PB3RU8|4.0|This cd was a great Black Friday deal.  I had only ever heard one song off of it, previous to buying it.  But I love that song, Dog Days Are Over, so much that I bought the cd.

B004L35GAQ|4.0|I heard \\"Sail\\" and \\"Kill your Heroes\\" on the radio and was intrigued, so i decided to buy the CD.  Wow, this is my new favorite CD!  Every song on this album is good, there is not one song that I skip when listening to it... granted there are a couple of filler tracks with a quote or short choir rehearsal that I skip when repeating the entire album.  Each song has it's own personality... the album is so diverse, you won't get bored with it!  The only complaint that I have is that the album as a whole is too short, which explains the reasonable price tag.  Still, I believe it is well worth it.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|Call me a sucker for movies like this, but I quite enjoyed In Time. The acting definitely isn't the best, and there are some parts of the film that drag, but the premise is so intriguing (if unsettling) and the film is shot so well that it makes up for it's downfalls. I thought Timberlake did a fine job as the lead and I found myself thinking I wouldn't be opposed to seeing more of him in future roles. Overall I think the movie could have been much more than what it is, but it was still a fun and interesting flick. If you're a fan of sci-fi or thrillers, definitely give this one a shot.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|This Three disc set includes the first three Rambo's of the franchise:Rambo-First Blood(released Oct/82),Rambo-First Blood Part 2(released May/85) and finally Rambo 3(released May/88).I had not seen these films since their theatrical debuts way back when,and I must say I was totally impressed at the quality of the prints here.These films have never looked better.Of course all three were financial successes at the box office and propelled Mr Stallone into a major star.Looking back into the 80s,Vietnam had been on the minds of the public for some time.There was of course the rethinking of the vilifying of the vets who came home.But the focus in the news had shifted from the debacle it became,to MIAs left behind.Also in the news was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and its peoples continuing struggle against the Russkies(that's when the West backed the Muhajideen fighters).These three movies took pieces from the news of the day and incorporated it into their product.Chuck Norris at the time was doing the same,and also very successfully.And of course Mr Stallone would utilize small touches from each of his Rambo films and incorporate them into his very successful(see my review)2008 sequel.<br />Rambo-First Blood starts the series out with a bang.John Rambo,a highly decorated Vietnam vet,is traveling through Hope,Oregon when he gets stopped and literally driven out of town by the chief of police(Brian Dennehey),just for how he looks.He takes alot of abuse,but returns to the town and gets arrested.In jail he is again abused while being held and he finally can't take anymore.He breaks out and is on the run.The State police and National Guard are called out to assist in the manhunt.This gets the attention of his former commander Col.Trautman(Richard Crenna),who comes in to assist them and put a bug in their collective ears as to who they're dealing with.His presence is less than accepted by the Police Chief and they are,more times than not,at loggerheads.The final battle comes down with a confrontation between the police chief and Rambo.As Rambo is about to get vengeance the Colonel arrives to stop him and convinces him to stand down and surrender.The film ends as he is walking amongst the police cars.<br />Rambo-First Blood Part 2 has John taken out of prison by Colonel Trautman and delivered to Thailand.There he is in on a secret operation to determine whether or not there are still Vietnam vets alive and held prisoner in that country.He is given orders not to engage the enemy but take pictures only.He meets up with his liaison(Julia Nickson),who escorts him into the jungle location of the camp.When they arrive the camp at first looks deserted.Upon closer inspection the camp is populated not only by Vietnamese soldiers but by Russians as well.On top of that John has discovered captured American prisoners.One is tied to a stake,whom he frees and flees with.He makes it to the rendezvous point and just as the helicopter is about to land,they get orders to abort.On board is Col.Trautman who is held at gunpoint after objecting.It seems the pilot and escort are just paid mercenaries.John gets captured and tortured and is forced to send a radio message to his superiors.As he tells the man who ordered the Chopper to return,that he is coming for him,Nickson has sneaked into the compound and assists in John's escape.They flee and Nickson gets killed.John commandeers a helicopter and returns to the camp to shoot it up.He gets all the American POWS and they fly off.However the Soviet camp commander follows him,forcing him to land in a riverbed.John plays dead just long enough,then gets up and fires a bazooka,downing the Soviet commander.John returns to base and shoots up the base office equipment.Then he deposits his knife within inches of the head of the man who ordered the abort.John walks off into the jungle.<br />Lastly Rambo 3 has John eking out a living in Thailand,living with Buddhist monks.One day Col.Trautman appears asking John toassist him in going into Afghanistan to supply arms to a contingent of the Muhajideen.John refuses.Col.Trautman goes it alone,and he and his men get captured.Word comes back to John and John goes into Afghanistan to get his old boss,being held in a Soviet prison.He meets up with a group of freedom fighters who agree to help him,but back down when the camp is destroyed by Soviet aircraft.He must travel to the prison with two rebels,a boy and an adult.John gets in but his presence is detected and things get too hot to stay,so he flees,temporarily.John is wounded but stays the course and returns to get Col.Trautman.John hijacks a Soviet helicopter and he,the colonel and some rebels,flee.However they can only get so far as their chopper suffers heavy damage.They go down and John and the Colonel flee on foot into some caves.They are followed and they have to dispatch about a half dozen Soviet soldiers.Once out they are confronted by an entire Soviet battalion consisting of soldiers,armoured vehicles and tanks.They stand for a moment assessing their odds until John decides to go for it,and they fight.Just into the fight they hear a rumbling.It is a huge contingent of rebels on their way on horse back.John,the Colonel and the rebels take on the Soviets,with John taking down a Soviet helicopter with one of their own tanks.The film ends as the two say goodbye to their rebel friends.<br />Everyone likes a hero and John Rambo was one of your quintessential types in that category.A lone wolf,with a dark,dark past,just bubbling below his calm demeanour.If pushed to the limit he would act so his foe would not be able to react,ever again.Once in the zone,John Rambo is almost indestructible.He is loyal to himself,those around him and to his country.We feel empathy for just those qualities alone.But Rambo is also an ex Green Beret with very specialized training and with a myriad of decorations to his credit.It is made plain that it was own government that made him into what he ultimately became.So again we empathize even more.It is a marvelous character Mr Stallone portrays and I cannot think of anyone else who could have filled his shoes like he did.Keep an ear out in Rambo 2 when John is talking to his Vietnamese liaison.He tells her that he is \\"expendable\\".He goes onto explain to her what that is.We all know now that Mr Stallone did not forget that line and has since put it to good use.<br />Technically speaking the films are in their original w/s a/r's of 2:35:1 and clear and crisp.Each DVD has their own featurette,cast and production notes and commentary.<br />All in all a winner of a boxed set and at a reasonable price too.I first bought the newest set which includes all four movies but I could not get a set without scuffs and scratches.So I turned to this set and it is fine.Any Rambo buff will revel in these films that are presented in very clean form.The films are edge of your seat,stand up and cheer films that will keep you watching again and again.Highly Recommended.assist him in going into Afghanistan to supply arms to a contingent of the Muhajideen.John

B000000WZ4|5.0|Songs of Faith and Devotion is their best.<br /><br />WOW 1997 a lifetime ago.  This CD is very dark, but very beautiful.  AMAZING CD.<br /><br />Lots of layers.  Lots of different styles.  Has a lot of Industrial(as another reviewer stated).  Plus their label gave them plenty of promotion on this CD with lots of TV exposure.<br /><br />I love all the songs on this CD and still is relevant and not dated.<br /><br />I've purchased DM CDs and seen them live after this CD but they're not the same.<br /><br />My Love affair with DM ended with this CD and it's a beautiful \\"ending\\" for me.<br /><br />I actually met Dave in 1998 in NYC in a restaurant and he was very gracious.  Great guy.  I have a DM tattoo btw.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Little Women.\\" It was one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book, it is one of my very favorites. It's a million times better than the movie! I loved how Louisa included so much about \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" Throughout the book I found countless truths and beauties that I shall always remember. Loved it! :)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|For me this is just an ok game.  It starts off being fun but becomes more difficult & then I become frustrated. Besides, if I'm going to use my time to play games it is better spent with something like 'Words With Friends'...at least I'm learning something besides how to kill pigs.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This Is An Appropriate Game For Everyone To Play. Also It Is A Fun And Active Game. Everbody Should Recommend It.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|After my wife and I both read the book, we decided to give the movie a try. The books were great, and &#34;the movie never lives up to the book&#34; is an understatement in this case.  No character development, slowly moving plot, and important facts left out from the book made this movie a dissappointment.
B009ZE27US|1.0|if you like this app that's your opinion but if getting really tired of these gag/ripoff finger games... in other words don't buy this game its just a waste of space

B00992CF6W|5.0|Probably the best game ever.... If your a first timer buy this because the xbox version and the computer version cost more. the game you build anything you want and you mine to get the materials you need to build. there is monsters that can kill you so he careful. runs great on kindle and fun but about 4x better on the xbox and computer so if you like thus version buy the xbox and computer versions. for all you people who don't like minecraft please leaves a game LIKE minecraft that's better and I will be quite

B005Q1W10A|4.0|Not at good as Season 1, but it still had the season-ending episode that warmed our heart.<br />Looking forward to Season 3, but don't like Shirley McClain. Violet is the real star in the show.<br />Others are favorite characters, too, however.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Looks great on blu-ray! A must have for a fan of the show. You won't be able to stop watching it.

B005STGKI4|5.0|excelente disco, recomendado y no debe faltar en tu discografia de la banda. Son dos vinilos sin desperdicio, no duden en adquirirlo!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am addicted to the Homeland series. It is a gripping and suspenseful series that has every theme imaginable. Each segment hooks the viewer into watching the next . The acting, action and story plot are relevant and up to date to make the story seem so real and believable.  What is most inviting about this series is that one can never figure out what will follow as the twists and turns always seem to shock . This is first rate thriller.
B009P25TQE|5.0|I love his music, this cd is different from the others and I was surprised when I first listened to it, but loved it too (I've listened to it a thousand times in a month!) It is impossible not to relate one of his songs to your own life. Great job!!
B008HT4FUW|4.0|I will only buy products shrink-wrapped. Love the story and play<br />an episode while I exercise on my treadmill. Looking forward to<br />Season 3.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone is playing this game....it is a lot of fun and hours of entertainment.  It can be frustrating at some levels but it  makes you want to accomplish the levels....truly a fun game.  Strategy is needed...offers some learning as well.  I think everyhone has purchased this game..If not, give it a try.  You will like it too.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|It is hard to choose between 2 stars \\"I don't like it.\\" and 3 stars \\"it's okay.\\" 2 and a half stars is more appropriate.<br /><br />This movie has a decent but convoluted plot which was intriguing at some points but mostly I just wanted to get to the end.<br /><br />Average script (lame at a few would-be poignant points).<br /><br />Average acting by many supporting actors.<br /><br />There were creative futuristic set designs.<br /><br />The cinematography and special effects were well done.
B005ZUR724|5.0|It's a GREAT game although right now it's been down for around 5 days now for kindle fire! So I'm all bored right now on my kindle....it says there's an update but doesn't let you update it. I don't know what to do.....hopefully they get it fixed soon.=(
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Joyce has created a memorable character in Harold Fry. The depiction of his uncommunicative marriage and wife Maureen is sympathetic too. I was a bit nervous that the 'heart warming' and 'charming' aspect of the story might mean this novel is slight, but not so. While the reading journey is thoroughly enjoyable ( a lot easier than Harold's own epic journey on foot!) there is plenty of food for thought. In particular the danger of stagnation, withdrawal, regret, passiveness, contrasted with a sense of possibility and joy in breaking out before it's too late.<br /><br />I agree with reviewers who have suggested the plot line involving travellers who join Harold is a bit of a distraction. But all the people he meets along the way do add to the richness of the story.  This seems destined to become a feel good movie. Give yourself a treat and read it first - highly recommended.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I saw commercials(etc.)...Looked great!..but installed it and you can barely tell what's going on when playing:( I thought it would waste time while &rarr;&raquo;Order and Chaos would fix their stinking update problem for us&laquo;&larr; O'well ill be sad till the fix it:( I'm nit satin don't try it out but if you saw what I saw ... it's not what you think.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|A very fun and addicting game. The only game I bothered to purchase- I definitely recommend this game,a great time waster for when your waiting or bored!
0143122061|5.0|Great book synthesizing data across history and the globe ... along the lines of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". You can get the reader's digest on TED.  [...]
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Just love her voice - good price and quick ship.  Package was sealed and in excellent condition.  Glad I can still purchase CD's since I do not use an Iphone or MP3!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it had a way of really bringing the reader into the story. It made me feel like I was living the story along with Hazel and Gus.
0547848412|5.0|[[ASIN:0547848412 Life of Pi]]<br /><br />Few novels make you giggle aloud.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is such an ingenious, improbable fantasy and so belly-laugh funny that I began to giggle at the first mention of Richard Parker, the 450-pound Bengal tiger who shares Pi's adventure on the rocky seas and, I hope, went on to have a long, glorious life in the Mexican jungle, siring many cubs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the best game i have ever played I love this game do much and I used yo playbit on another device but I broke it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I am a Kindle Fire HD user who purchased this game (the first time) a few weeks ago. Right around the time I was getting into it, there was an update that screwed it all up for me. I had paid 6.99 for the game, not counting what I had spent on runes. When the update hit sometime last week, I try to log in and I get a mssg telling me to update the game to play, only you cannot update. You basically can't connect to the game. I read somewhere to uninstall & reinstall. Tried that. Didn't work. Did a full uninstall (took it out of my Kindle/Amazon content completely) & then purchased again. Didn't work again. Finally, I got fed up & put it on my cell phone (21.00 now + runes). It's glitchy on my cell phone, not near as lovely as playing it on the Kindle. Today I contacted Amazon b/c after reading reviews it seems some ppl think this is Amazon's issue. Not so. I was informed that they are waiting on the update from Gameloft. When I told them I contacted Gameloft multiple times & that their customer service sucked, I was told that it wasn't the first time they have heard that. So, I am not the only person angry with Gameloft and their lack of response to my inquiries. If they could just send me an email saying, \\"Hey, we're sorry but it's going to take ___ days & then you should be good to go...\\", then I would feel like an important customer. Instead I get automated responses or something like 'We are aware of the issue, sorry. Please log in later, it should work.'<br />I will say that when this game was working for us Kindle users, the graphics were not bad (a few glitchy things here and there, but overall you can't beat it). It is a fun mmorpg, similar to WoW but portable and less details. It was pretty rad. There are guilds, quests, dungeons & now they have PvP.<br />Gameloft needs to interact with it's users more. I have emailed & tweeted to them multiple times, but other than 3 responses (2 in which were automated & one that I mentioned earlier) they can't give me anyinfo.<br />I find it hilarious that the game is now 99 cents after so many people are having issues. They can draw some more people in to make up for the loss of us Kindle Users lol.  Amazon is refunding me the 6.99 I paid the 2nd time. Gameloft ignored my requests for a refund.<br />If you buy this game & need a refund, go through Amazon. Also, if you are using Kindle & cannot play, KEEP CONTACTING GAMELOFT! Email them, tweet them (@gameloft)- whatever it takes so they know we want this game running. I am worried they are going to forget about Kindle Users :( Uh!
B000088E6D|4.0|The songs on this CD were those which I enjoy very much and Buble's singing was excellent.  It was bought for someone as a gift.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I  purchased this CD for my niece she's a huge One Direction Fan I asked her if she liked it and she said it was really good and liked all the songs on the CD. I made her very happy with this CD Thanks for having it on your site.
B0094M4NBW|5.0|Mad max with a dose of reality minus the nra is the formula for this film. one of the few movies me and the mrs both enjoyed.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones is one of my favorite series.  So well written and entertaining.  The characters are great and interesting.  Makes you want the next season to become available right now.  Highly Recommend.
0060935464|5.0|Book was in very good shape.  Delivery was very fast.  I had just watched the movie on TCM and wanted to add the book to my library.  Thank you!
B009POCG0Y|4.0|I love Matthew McConaughey and he does a great acting job in this DVD.  The storyline is a little out there but the actors all show a good performance.
1609611543|4.0|Very helpful.  Also some good recipes. I could probably have done with less technical information at the beginning but I did understand it as I read it - just got a little dull at times.
B006ZZANDI|5.0|all excellent, and I received the product in Venezuela, waiting times were set, many thanks, recommended 100%, thanks, success and blessings.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its allmost the same but with easier game play and more upgrades its almost like temple run but it wont go insane when you play in a weird postition. I love it and it is so much fun plus it has missions and it connects to facebook. its fun for all ages. most fun ever
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the best series ever.  Couldn't save and stretch out over several days/weekends and watched in one weekend!  Wish they had made 20+ episodes per season. Now the wait till season 2 on DVD.
B009PEKRY6|4.0|My initial impression of the album is that she's super-talented, and will only continue to surprise me. This may sound weird, but she sort of bridges the gap between Christina Aguleira and Adele in my iopinion. Looking forward to hearing more from her.
1451678193|5.0|I read this book as a young boy. I remember how much I loved it. So I look forward to rereading again.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I miss the Spartacus from the first year, RIP, ....very good series with a real addictive story line(s)...Thanks Amazon for delivering the best of the best. Cant wait for season 3 to start ...
B003YBUSMW|5.0|This is an awsome addition to my XBOX 360. It makes it much more real. It brings the game onto the road.
B008OTTSX4|2.0|There is no way that Flaming Lips should ever be associated with Deep Purple in this or any other world - I'm not even certain they should be allowed to do their own music, they are so bad. Some decent material on this CD, but the recording quality is very bad and with some of the bands, I expected much more than I received. Yet another reason why I will never purchase a tribute album ever again.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|In the middle of the game it stops. Then it will start up again with the numbers that were called. Not much fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is addicting and some what fun I mean any age can play also I like how u can progress  I had it be for on my old kindle loved it
B009AMANBA|5.0|Superb acting by Daniel Day Lewis.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed by entire family ranging form ages 10 to 60.<br /><br />Despite having already watched this in the theater, I am looking forward to adding to my DVD collection.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Wonderful casing, I loved the inside map, but I missed the animated shorts that appear in the blue ray version.
B0012GMZDG|2.0|not my taste<br />a mistake for me<br />too hard<br />lack of melodies<br />i'll get no emotions with that music<br />bad purchase
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I decided to try taking a few sample videos and now I am not able to delete them. Does anyone know how? Like everyone else,, I don't really want to take a photo of myself so taking pics of someone else is awkward.
B000I0QKDS|3.0|better than the other that i have purchased.<br />it's not my typeis artist of music<br />i'll have purchase to discover th
0689505698|5.0|Retells the story in a more modern setting, tongue in cheek of course. Great for kids who have heard the classic version already-opens their eyes to new possibilities.
1400069289|4.0|I am not a big fan of reading business related books but this one was a page turner. It kept my interest all the way to the end.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|I always been a fan..was eager to hear this new album..and I can honestly say Tip is back..he has redeemed himself with this one!! If you love T.I. you'll cop this album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun games. You play for points to unlock more games which I like. There is something for everyone. A must have!
B001NEK2GE|3.0|It works as advertised and is very easy to program.  My problem is I think I am too old.  I need a normal keyboard.  I keep punching the wrong keys with gets my parties upset when I am not fighting right.<br /><br />Do I like it, yes.  And if I was younger, I would probably think it the best thing since Halo 4 (my generation sliced bread).  I recommend it even if it is not working well for me.  I especially have problems as it seems to be made for use by the left hand (they do not make one with the thumb controls and joystick on the other side for use with the right hand), young people must be better at training their left hands.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie was made for 3D and it shows.  It was like watching a whole new movie with the excellent 3D effects!  Definitely try the 3D if you have a 3D TV, it's worth it!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is a great book and has all the scenes they keep cutting out of movies to keep them in the time constraints.
0783231032|5.0|This movie is a great holiday classic. It is based around DEC 1941. The movie has a great cast, and has some trully funny moments. We miss you John B! They need to make a sequel.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining and longer than other games. Loved it! The plot was actually interesting and I couldn't put it doen!
B009ANP48G|5.0|The best Step Up movie in the series.  Each dance sequence surpasses the previous one.  Amazing choreography.  So much action, you will want to watch again and again.<br />As far as actual product, the multiple video formats allow for viewing on any device.  Video and sound quality are excellent.
B00APUQRPC|1.0|Love Clint and love baseball movies so i was very disapointed that this movie was not good.  Three more words
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|It's a Bejeweled clone with some kind of terrible story mode. What a crappy game. I can't believe I paid money for this. Shameful.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|I did not expect this movie to be good but it was bad beyond what i expected from Will and  Tommy.  Waste of money..
B004WE01YA|5.0|I love this movie and was very happy with the 3D version.  It was extremely well done and my son enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's hard to beat these Disney combo packs as they come with every possible version of the movie you would want.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very good.  I hope to soon learn more about this world and how all of us are connected together.  Soon.
B008E374PO|5.0|This CD is full of infectious pop songs that my 10 year old son loves to listen to (and sing along to).  I'm really glad I bought it for him.  I have to admit I'm a little tired of listening to it every time my son and I drive anywhere, but there's only one song on this CD that is annoying to listen to. Simple sugary pop music - if you like that type of music, you will most likely enjoy this CD.  I do not see this getting much play a few months from now, though.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again. What else needs to be said.<br /><br />Just wish he could write them as fast as I read them.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is the first book of five, and it is a truly fascinating start to what is going to be a great series. In this book he mixes facts with his own fiction, and you are soon drawn into the lives of people in various countries around the world. It is a book that everyone should read, and as soon as you get to the end, you will feel that you just cannot wait for the next book to arrive ......
B0025VLELQ|5.0|This movie was one of the first ever uses of CGI in a motion picture.  That bit looks a little dated but otherwise this movie holds up well.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Not really my kind of game but I really enjoyed it. Its fun &amp; challenging. Glad I actually tried this. Thanks
B005HSG3U6|2.0|I replaced another kindle cover that I liked but the cover surface wore out, so I saw this on sale and thought I would try it. It does NOT stand up for reading despite what the picture shows, the elastic that holds it closed is already stretching out of shape, and the top cover that goes over the kindle surface is very thin and flimsy. I didn't pay much, but it isn't worth much either. I will probably soon replace it and now I know all the things to look for. The only good thing is that because it is so thin and it fits better in my small purses, hence 2 stars instead of 1.
B008X77K8W|5.0|this group of songs on this album is as good as it gets. quality Lyrics and the heart spun voice of a Kentuckian at his best.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|It is very dark but not to a point that it scares children it does get a bit depressing and somewhat boring but it is well written but its crazy what the kids go through its just agonizing to see how these kids are able to survive the impossible! It is very interesting in its own way, I recommend also reading the crazy autobiography of lemony snicket. It isnt for everybody but it is very charming and different and unique for its time
030758836X|4.0|This was an amazing book.  Very hard to put it down.  Nothing was totally predictable.  I think it was very exciting overall and thought provoking too!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great show.  With some of the same people behind the scenes of 24, how can it not be great!
0316069434|3.0|the plot was convoluted and it did not hold my attention the way his other novels did. Usually I was not able to put them down, and this one I could not finish.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Simple put this is one of the best and most accurate zombie books I have ever read and that is for the fax. They cover everything from how people survived and food to the mental aspect of survived and how they got the moral to fight back. All in all great book and definitely worth the price.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This tale moves along at a good pace.  I found it hard to put down (even at work).  The strife within the department seems real life like it is so often in the real workplace.  There's always someone trying to torpedo the best investigator.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|ME ENCANTO LE DOY EL PUNTAJE MAXIMO DE 5, UN PRODUCTO DE BUEN CALIDAD Y LLEGO AL TIEMPO ESTIMADO<br />Y EN BUENAS CONDICIONES.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|Because I totally loved that movie in the movie theater it was a must buy. The virtual content of the disc is quite wide and I enjoyed it all. It works great on my ps3 in the Czech rep. so I guess it will work all around the Europe too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best app ever u can play all kinds of favorite games I love it I love wishing I totally regimens that game its easey
B001FB55H6|5.0|A nice edition with a lot of virtual content and bonus features. It works great on my ps3 in the Czech rep. so I guess it will works all around the Europe too.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Recommend this item to all to put on kindle. It really comes in handy when need to get on and check items on facebook. Love it.
B001F7MSF2|5.0|Very lovely set. The statue and the &#34;notepad&#34; looks really nice and everything is made of a solid material. The movie itself and the virtual content is pretty huge. And a message for you guys from Europe - it works on my ps3 in the Czech rep. So I guess it will work all around the Europe.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Game is very fun to play. Recommend this game to all ages. Can't wait to do more of these games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a really good start to the trilogy.  I couldn't put it down!  Highly recommend reading this one for sure, and of course don't forget about book 2 and 3
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Would recommend this to others. Good for all ages and whole family likes this game. Can't wait to play other games.
B009NPLIFE|5.0|This show is the pinnacle of teen melodramas. Alliances come and go, the purest of motives give way to scheming, and every scene ends in disaster. One of my favorites.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Recommend this to all to watch. Really like the Jesse Stone series. Would recommend this to all to get . Love It.
B008966SLM|5.0|pretty good, the more i listen to it the better i like it. lovely voice wish i listened to him more growing up
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love this movie, it still makes me cry after all these years. Such a great story and catchy songs, my kids still sing it word for word. This version had extra/extended scenes that added to the story in a good way. Love it!!!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|knew hugh was a musician, didn't know how talented. shared with many friends who also love it. great old time blues
B000F8O35U|5.0|I remember this when my children were growing up, now my grandkids love it. The seller had it to me in 2 days via standard mail! That was awesome because It was a birthday gift. Dont need gramma not showing up without a gift!
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Movie came sealed and properly packaged and arrived quickly from order date.  Good movie as well, however not a big fan of the sequel.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|This movie didn't play very well  it start then stop and the last half hour we never got to see because the movie stop and didn't start back again.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Ought one for myself and a friend, we both love it! I have been a long time fan of Enya's. she never fails to take me away with her beautiful voice and music? A truly spiritual experience.

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I believe in brief Amazon reviews since most of us are simply trying to make a decision, so I'll get to the point.  This is simply a must see movie.  I think it's my favorite movie from 2012.  This movie exceeded my expectations on every level.  It's a great SciFi movie; original plot, amazing effects, solid cinematography, plenty of action, and superb acting. It definitely ranks up there with Inception, The Matrix, etc. What makes it a must see is the story which doesn't completely unfold until close to the end of the movie.  A great gift just in time for Christmas or as an addition to one's video library. You won't be disappointed...buy it...rent it.  Five stars.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Jack is smart, strong and surprisingly sensitive in this thriller.  One learns about weaponry and combat tactics all the while trying to anticipate the direction of the story.  It was fun and satisfying to read.
0345803493|5.0|It is the most exciting book that I ever read, as I read it I feel like I am right there with the character very exotic love it!
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Only 40% through as he is so detailed about every day, practically, of his life, so to me it is slow reading.  I'm enjoying it very much and after the holidays I'll really dig into it.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|song were great! But the story seemed forced. The songs made the movie worth watching. Pay me and ill watch it again.
B0087HT36U|4.0|it is pretty fun to pass the time with. my wife got turned on to it after I downloaded it for myself and took it away fromnme
B008YWY0HK|3.0|* Lot of great scenes in the animation<br />* Characters are a treat, very creative, will have kids think and imagine lot of things<br />* Takes kids to a different world, though I disagree with an earlier comment regarding the independent part. Kids have to understand parents do things for a certain reason, if all kids become independent at young age, then why parents or teachers? May give a wrong message to the already confused kids of our generation.<br />* Songs are nice, soundtracks very good
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|so much fun to eat and grow.  very addictive to play and the fun of eating people and other sharks is very cathartic
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This story addresses some fundamental questions facing humanity.  True to the book, well acted, scripted - total package!  Can't wait for the next one.
034580404X|5.0|I Love this book set really good I am not really a romance reader but it makes for good reading. I can see why its a best seller.Plus it arrived really quickly.So I will recommend these books to people I know and the price was good to.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie left out all the good parts that made the original so good. Good FX, but that is about all. The movie never even went to Mars.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|The Twilight Saga has always managed to perfectly match songs with the drama, suspense, and romance that plays out onscreen, and this final soundtrack for Breaking Dawn Part 2 continues in that tradition. From the upbeat \\"The Antidote\\" to the heartfelt, moving \\"All I've Ever Needed,\\" the songs draw forth the emotions of the storyline, but are also just fun to listen to. Perhaps the most notable song on this particular installment is Christina Perri's \\"A Thousand Years-Pt.2.\\" I highly recommend this album not only to avid Twilight fans, but also to anyone looking for a great collection of music.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This is something that could happen to anyone and it helps to realize some things that can prevent this.  It keeps you on the edge all the way through.  A very good movie.  I hope that this helps parents realize that things like this can happen to their family.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|The songs on this particular soundtrack are absolutely stunning and beautiful, and they fit so perfectly with the story of Edward and Bella that any Twilight fan is sure to love them! However, one must not be an avid fan of the series to appreciate the stunning collection of music gathered together for this soundtrack. While there are upbeat, lighthearted tunes, such as \\"I Didn't Mean It,\\" \\"Northern Lights,\\" and \\"Sister Rosetta,\\" it is, hands down,  the ballads that make this album so remarkable. Christina Perri's \\"A Thousand Years\\" is a perfect caption to Edward and Bella's epic love story. However, I have to say that even that comes second place to the lyrical beauty of Sleeping At Last's \\"Turning Page.\\" Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 is superb!
B006G8SXKE|5.0|This is a classic well worth studying along wit the French original. Much to say for our times. It was way ahead of its time. Some footnotes are original by the author, and some are from the editor, and some from the french edition, but they are not distinguished on the Kindle edition anyway..
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The trailer looked good but I was worried about the length which is nearly 3 hrs. The pacing was bad and at parts it dragged so bad I kept wondering when is this gonna end? I wasn't crazy about Bane's heavy accent because it was difficult to understand him. The so called \\"epic conclusion\\" is an epic disappointment and failure in my mind. Nolan should have quit while he was ahead with The Dark Knight which was way better. I was excited about the casting of Anne Hathaway as Catwoman but they didn't give her the screen time and character development Catwoman deserves. Overall I would red box it for cheap or go to the library and pick it up. Not worth paying to see it that's for sure.
B005R7FOPC|5.0|The English translation is great, but this is well worth reading in the original as it is difficult to translate the different styles of the different letters into English. The classic work uses letters between the characters for everything--there is no other text. It leads to a deep and psychologically subtle work hundreds of years ahead of its time.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|This is a pretty good album from one of today's Pop frontrunners. Adam Levine's voice is distinctive. I don't mind explicit lyrics but in some of the tracks such as &#34;Pay Phone&#34; the vulgarity just seemed unnecessary and detracted from the song.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season did not disappoint! Lots of surprises! I wish there was a little less Andrea, as they just don't make that character likable at all. The zombies can have her. :)
B00124BNF4|5.0|This is one of the lesser known but great rock groups of all time. David Byrne's music and lyrics are years ahead of its time and shows why they are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I really enjoyed iy.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|Hugo rules...and apparently I need some more words before I can submit this...so I'll say that Nat is great as usual too.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|Awesome!  Beautiful girl, voice and the complete package. If you like pop music you will not be disappointed with this one.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I didn't read much of this book and what I did read I read in the hopes that it would get better and then I gave up. I used to love John Grisham's books. All of them.
B000N3SSVM|5.0|I have been a fan of the Knife for sometime. I bought this for the free DVD of the live show. It was everything I expected and more. Nothing less from the Knife.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|good game for those bored trips our long street trips on bus<br />my daughter loves it n so does my girl all around nice game needs more weapon
B009MO5960|1.0|Giving this film one star is far too generous!!! I don't know how Milla could have promoted this film with a straight face.<br /><br />Let me say this up front.. Both my husband and I are HUGE Resident Evil fans. While this series may not have been top notch as far as acting, directing and script up until this last chapter, the previous films were high in entertainment value, fun, full of action and well delivered for \\"being what it is.\\" No one walks into one of these movies expecting perfection; this is the Zombie Apocalypse, not Shakespeare! But at LEAST make the storyline somewhat entertaining and believable. This last film is an utter embarrassment! The acting was HORRID and in my opinion, this was a result of a bad script and terrible direction. Even the CG was crappy. There are some decent sci-fi/horror writers and directors in Hollywood. Fire the yahoos that put this disgrace on the screen and find replacements quickly before this franchise goes the rest of the way down the drain!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie is exciting to watch.  Great action and story line. The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat during the entire time!
B00755646W|4.0|I love Madonna! Just wish there would have been extras, especially with a blu-ray release, not the sellers fault, mine!
6304712944|3.0|O.K. for a special edition, nothing extra. was expecting a little more hooray. Have seen Camelot many times and enjoy most of them
1595827684|5.0|For Mass Effect fans, this book is highly recommended, provided with great picture and detail from Mass Effect 1-3 , from the characters , weapons, aliens, landscape, with hard cover to protect the pages inside.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I read it every year before Christmas to get in the Christmas spirit mindset. Always a delightful tale to read and enjoy.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love sci-fi series, but firefly has the best stories, plus the crew, and the story from each member is so great, too bad they didn't make any sequel for a great series like this
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Enticing charecter development! A page turner. I didn't want it to end! Will start the next one today  and the third after that!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Loved the quality of the movie on my computer. With the right speakers you will be able to enjoy one funny movie! That's some teddy bear
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really liked the seventh book in the wimpy kid series. I chose this rating because I liked the unexpected plot twist. My favorite part has to be the part when Greg is talking about Manny 's imaginary friends. But I want to know one thing, what happened to Holly Hills?
0789325772|5.0|I love it-Just what I was looking for my daughter. She is looking forward to using it in 2013-Thank you.
1449410243|5.0|Matthew Inman awesome sauce.<br />I bought this as a gift, and want a copy for myself.<br />A bunch of cat themed webcomics, plus drawings with words you have not seen yet, as the title describes.<br />Quality.
B006ZE66P8|5.0|Still a little spooky but toned down just enough to read to kids; true to Charles Dickens story without all the extra details.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is perfect. The characters, the lifestyle, and the demons. Supernatural rules the world and Clare writes the rules
141659521X|5.0|what can you say about Vince Flynn?  He is so current and yet puts a spin that keeps you riveted to the last page.
B001NLL93W|5.0|As always, Clare's writing is perfect and her imagination takes you on a journey to new places and teaches you how to kill demons and fall in love.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A quick read. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who wants to feel good about love
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book, just like the others, opens up your imagination and makes you want to be a shadow hunter and fight demons.
0805028846|4.0|Good book for basic pop-up construction.  Photos of finished projects with step by step instructions and templates included.  Easy to follow.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Nora, Nora, Nora. Always able to steal my heart with characters. This book is great. Dogs, terror, fear, and love. A great buy
B00003CXBK|5.0|Such a fun movie. Miyazaki does such a great job telling stories with a spirit that's both whimsical and heartwarming.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is filled with many great actors.  It is auctioned packed.  There is also several funny moments.  Loved it!
B007SGM084|4.0|I bought the trilogy and really enjoyed it. The second book was a little repetitive and could of used a broader story line. I have recommended this trilogy to others.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|It made me remember the political events of my childhood in a new way.  History becomes so much more personal when you know something about the personalities involved
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I could not put the book down! Her painfully honest account of her eating disorder gives you a greater understanding of the hell that is too many girls' reality.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was a good book but for some reason I didn't seem to like it as much as others I have read by her.  Someone else will probably love it and I do recommend you read it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is an entertaining movie which we enjoy watching overand over.  The humor in it is something my kids and I could grasp. Steve carell, Julie Andrews as the mom what a cast
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is one of my favorite literary characters and Michael Connelly makes you care about Harry.  My only problem is he doesn't write them as fast as I can read them.  Once again Harry is the champion of the unsolved victims in LA and this book really keeps your interest from beginning to end.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I own all of RE series from amazon and i loved every single one. Except this one.<br />This is a over budget B movie, compared to the other RE films, the effects suck and are down right visible at nearly every stage.<br />The producers should to taken out back and beaten for this tragedy. Or better yet, forced to watch all the movies before this one then make them watch this movie.<br /> In time i will own this just to have the complete collection.<br />After this i think the series has been over done and over worked.<br />Watch it to finish the series yes. Buy it, only if you have to, to complete your collection.<br /><br />With the end of this movie, let the series rest in peace where it belongs.<br /><br />P.S.<br />The special effects  look like they are from 1990's<br />Edited for spelling errors
B0087JTAKW|1.0|Ridiculously boring story of Father Time.  Fortunately it is short but don't waste your money.  Needless to say, a complete waste of time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Working for Steve Jobs, I can tell you that there were some factual errors.  However, to keep this short and not boring, I must say that this is a well-written book.<br /><br />As we all know, this man was a genius.  A comprehensive look into his genius and sharing of his personal life make this a must read.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good alternative when there is nothing on TV. Amy Adams is so cute, Clint same as always. Justin Timberlake delivered a fabulous performance for a novice actor. As always, John Goodman is a gem. If love acting, John and Amy are the reasons to see this movie.
B003CSV7TK|4.0|This movie is very touching. Definitely an old classic. Has a fantastic message--not about Santa its about Christmas spirit and how if makes people act. Good and nice! Maybe more people ought to watch to be reminded what Christmas really means. This was the first time I have seen it and will be watching it again.
B0060D196K|5.0|This version is as true to the book as any other version. One scene in this movie that is missing from all the other versions is the scene of the ghosts flying through the air, and the changing face of the Ghost of Christmas Present. Although Jim Carrey has been known to over-act, he treated this work very seriously. He plays many parts, which is not apparent at all. The Ghost of Christmas Present is rich in detail and color; the way he and Scrooge peer into the present is closely follows the book. Many civic virtues are demonstrated in this work. A+.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|way too drawn out with little action involved. some of it was entertaining and real-life like but not filmed well.
B0031SCV46|5.0|This keyboard auto-maps itself awesome with Reason 5. Very nice and responsive keyboard. Lovin it so far! Time to make some beats!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Told in a unique voice that captures both the individual and collective experience that is one's life during high school, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a powerful, tender, and quirky look back at those years that stick with us for all of time.
B004LROUNG|4.0|As always a great story from Grisham. While it is a great drama, parts of it had you laughing out loud!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|A fun game but it's not without it's problems, it tends to shut down when trying to attack a rival or even visit an ally. Otherwise a fun time waster
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album by Imagine Dragons is a solid 5 star, this being based on a 1st albums only. A lot of the songs are up tempo, uplifting, and just rocks. The lead singer has a great voice and it works well with his lyrics. I recommend this band to rock and alternative fans. Give it a try and most likely you will enjoy them.  They bring something fresh to the music scene. Enjoy!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great surreal storyline. Pretty challenging to get through. Took several long- playing sessions to solve. Great way to \\"waste time.\\"
B008PNBU30|4.0|Has a bit of a slow start but builds up well over the album. Any fan will enjoy this album
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|HOPELESS has everything a great novel needs. I will definitely remember this gut wrenching story for years to come. I will read this again. This is the time when I wish I could unread a book just so I could experience it all over again for the first time.
B000ELJBAA|5.0|He is the main, or all of Pink Floyd's guitars. The group wouldn't have become the supergroup that it did wihout his songs.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's just like having your Kindle on your desktop and it works the same. It's nice to see it on a large screen
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I guess if you've been around 50 years, you must be doing something good. I don't care if they are ugly as sin.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Excellent book, totally re-affirmed innate spiritual experiences & clearly highlights what the true nature of I Am -All that IS.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|This is a solo LP of the guitars of Pink Floyd. Which one is Pink, or Floyd? I don't know but without him they would never have made the fame they've made.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Purchased as a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Have to admit that this grandpa likes their sound also!!
B003TVMIDO|5.0|What can you say about John Lennon? He's great and to have this collection of his solo career is great.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have had a few backup chargers and this one is a good value for the price.  Like the two outputs and choice of 1A or 2A.  Charged my iPhone and Kindle Fire HD in a very short time and still had three lights on showing reserve power. Slightly heavy, but 8400mAh it was expected. Good backup for the price point.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I've missed her, but I'm glad she's back. I don't think I've seen anyone that puts herself into her show more.
B00337KM2S|4.0|Great movie at a great price. When I see a deal like this I can't resist and I did not.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|The beautiful, talented, intelligent, Diana. She is the hottest one in Jazz now. Elvis C. is one lucky guy. Great.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Cute game to pass the time. My kids love &quot;playing&quot; with the pets. Need to be able to earn hearts without friends, should make it easier to level up solo. Need to make more pets available with intake coins and not just gems or bling
B007XNAPX4|5.0|The main man for Genesis who went on to have a great solo career. I received this fast and in great shape.
B00005V9IL|5.0|This movie is one of the most underrated Sci Fi films of all time! I have loved this movie since I saw it the theater years ago, and now my children love it too!
B000002JSR|5.0|In my opinion if you go to Webster's dictionary and look up rock n roll, it should say &#34;see Led Zepplin&#34;.
B00A31UXLW|3.0|Not one of Connolly's better ones.  Think Harry Bosch should retire permanently. Plot lines are beginning to loose  re4al credulity.
B00006J9OT|5.0|She is the hottest one in modern jazz. She is another great Canadian talent. I love to go to her shows.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A lot of repeating more of the same '' did like the story line ... Like a soap opera I guess
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The best rock n roller from Canada. He is great solo, with Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young and back to solo.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Just purchased my first Blue-Ray player and this disk has a great picture and wonderful sound.  I couldn't believe it how great an experience I had.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|This book is a great read for anyone wanting to make changes in their life.<br /><br />All written before NLP and The Secret and other more modern ways to change your life, manifest abundance and more.<br /><br />The author was clearly well educated in religion but do not let that deter you from reading this book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I haven't been watching the HBO series, but after reading the book I want to buy the DVD series. I love this
B0021L8V0M|2.0|Well, first let me be fair in saying that I am no longer a fan of Jolie due to the whole Jennifer Aniston/Brad Pitt situation.  I used to like her and enjoyed her movies up until that point, so my opinion may be a little biased. I know it's kind of stupid and none on my business, but I just have no respect for her anymore (I was never a big fan of Pitt's anyway...so  no big loss there).  That said, I think the movie could have been somewhat better and believable.... there were parts in it, like when Jolie went down the elevator shaft... I don't believe she was wearing gloves... do you know what that would do to your bare hands?!!!!  Also, when she stabbed one of the characters... I believe she walked away with blood just on her hands???  Oh, yeah... her 'disguise' of fake teeth and colored contacts... yeah, I'd NEVER have recognized her..... :{  I didn't find Jolie believable in the part.  I think someone like Zoe Saldana or Eva Mendez would have been better as a 'tough guy.'  I just didn't buy it with stick figure Jolie.  Either way, I thought the twists in the plot were kind of dumb as far as Jolie's character.  I thought Liev Schreiber and his character were probably the best in the movie.  With all the hype about the movie when it first came out I expected WAY better.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love the Jack Reacher books, I have read them all.  Haven't seen the movie yet, I am not happy with the casting of Tom Cruise....
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I liked this movie despite all the bad reviews. It was entertaining and had a decent story. Overall I'd say it was well worth the $3.99 rental. I'll wait until it gets cheaper before I buy it but I will add it to my collection eventually.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Pros: Entertaining and satisfies the urge for a exciting, action packed adventure.<br />Cons: Not sure if Blu-ray format is necessary for a film where all action sequences are blurred.<br /><br />Another &#34;the most dangerous game&#34; type movie, this one targeted at a teen audience.  It reminds me of a TV show called Endurance.  Hunger games is action-filled and has many entertaining action scenes.  Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job of portraying a strong, athletic, and emotional hero.  Josh Hutcherson also is excellent in portraying a complex character who is witty and fully aware of his surroundings.  There are several forks in the plot which do not connect, or do not connect well together, but one enjoys this movie for its action.<br /><br />One gripe that I have with the film, is with the cinematography.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that more and more action films in the last few years have adopted a new style when filming action sequences.  It involves shaking the camera profusely, causing disorientation, and all frames in an action sequence are blurred due to motion blur introduced by camera shake.<br /><br />Shaking the camera, not to be confused with panning, is something that students are taught to avoid when they go to school.  Holding the camera steady as one pans, or moves about, is fundamental to filming.  Devices such as steadycam are readily available to help reduce camera shake.<br /><br />A splash of camera shake here and there can be a fun and interesting style of filming to multiply the sense of a chase, for instance, but I am not of the opinion that this style is necessary on all action sequences in the entire movie.  It seems that in this movie, camera shake is added to all shots except for ones which require CG.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I think this may be their best album yet!!! I highly recommend buying, it is worth the money! Love it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love the show and think this season is great so far! I would recommend it if you are a fan.
B004WR125O|4.0|Ok its just a basic wireless device.One item transmits a signal and the other item (this one) receives it,using a specific frequency range similar to a  radio station. The fact that it has the Onkyo name doesn't mean its better for the use with its brand of receiver.Its small so if your unit fits tight in a cabinet or entertainment center with doors on the front like mine (its closed when not in use),then its a good buy. I didn't test the range for any further than my entertainment center is from my computer room,which just happens to be back to back with a wall in between,so it is about less than 5 feet to transmit and receive the router signal.It works perfect for me for that.But there are cheaper and /or better devices that will serve you if you research them on sites like NewEgg, (blatant plug for a great company) that may have a longer range and a gain antenna attached.It depends on how far your unit is from the router. Read the reviewers and get a feel for the product from someone who sounds honest and has no stake in a sale. This is a good product make no mistake,and it works well. Just make sure you get the range you need for your setup. Some research will tell you that you may need a stronger signal from your router or a better receiver for that signal to your stereo unit.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Funny and light-hearted, and I also learned a few things.  I always look forward to reading and watching more from her.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|ThatGameCompany is a unique gaming company to say the least. You feel as though the company takes a softer more emotional approach to games than is predictalbe in today's games. If your looking for an experience with fantastic music than YES this is your game!! Journey IS that game. I found flow to be just ok,but not much fun for me. It felt like a companys first try at a different genre,and it didn't do much for me. Flower was different in that it doesn't tell you what to do or how to progress,you just instinctively know to move around and discover the landscape while creating beauty as you flow to soothing music. JOURNEY is the current pinnacle to the companys obvious attempt to &#34;move&#34; its player,and I must say it works.This type of thing doesn't appeal to everyone. If your a hardcore shooter/ gamer or sports player with constant blood,hard htting blows and extrem action on a consistant basis,then this is not for you.But don't give up on this title without looking deep.This took my emotional side to a place I wasn't expecting to go.The controls are simple enough for a novice to use. I actually wanted this little character to succeed in its journey. You don't know why you must go,but you must. You don't know what is there when you get there,but you don't care because the JOURNEY is the experience,not the end reward. Once  I started I could not put it down as I tried to figure out what I was,where I was going and how was I ever going to get there. From start to finish my senses were lifted with one of the most beautiful music scores on record. As a matter of fact this score and composer was nominated for a Grammy coming up in Feb. of 2013. Its a first ever for this type of game! To say its just classical music is unfair,as its the driving force behind the emotional tie to the game.The game is about an experience for the senses. Visually your gonna just love this title's graphics and flow of design unique in its own way. But the graphics,gameplay and musicalscore bind you to an experience that if you let yourself relax and feel it,you won't forget it soon!!
0375851569|5.0|How can one complain about Dr. Seuss?! Its a great set of books for a good price. The little one loves them!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I waited forever for this to come out on kindle!<br /><br />its just as good on the kindle as the apple app<br />cant wait for the next game by these guys!
B00493E1GI|5.0|What can i say. Love it. Part of my secret single behavior.  Its not rocket science. Just entertainment and beautiful things to look at.
B009O2XY12|3.0|it's ok gets redundant after awile but for free it's decent and gives me some thing to do. The End.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Delightful. I couldn't put it down. The characters were likable, fully fleshed out and realistic. the romance had just the right amount of yearning. only complaint was the application of modern morals in places but that is no deal breaker.
1451695195|5.0|What an incredible read this was. An amazing and inspirational journey to and back from the heavenly realm where perfect, UNCONDITIONAL love awaits . Wonderfully written with much heart and soul.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This web series was amazing, so when it became available for preorder, I jumped all over it.  This product in and of itself is amazing. The extended scenes are awesome, the additional features are cool. But most of all, watching Master Chief outside of CGI is amazing. I even like Laskey's story.  I've been a Halo fan since Halo CE came out.  Any Halo fan should like this.  If you are a fan of Sci-Fi in general, you'll probably like this, but if you aren't familiar with the story of Halo, you might get a bit confused.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Darker, the book was good, a little strange but still very good.  I would tell<br />others to buy this book amd to share it in a group setting.<br /><br /> Carrie
B00447G29S|5.0|I love the Polar Express and this same movie was $50 at Best Buy! Great movie with a great price
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther  Not one of DeMille's best efforts. Lion's Gate was much better. Looking forward to better in the near future hopefully.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Debería ser en español porque no todas las personas saben tanto inglés como otros que son expertos en este idioma
0446401307|4.0|The Overlook starts with Bosch and his new partner investigating a murder of a doctor who had legitimate access to radioactive materials. There is great fear of terrorism as he digs deeper into the case but it is not at all as simple as it seems. Unfortunately his relationship with FBI agent Walling is at its low and FBI is offering him only so much help. His new partner takes a while to get used to.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|There was reasonable doubt in the guilty conviction of an innocent man condemned to life in prison run by corrupt officials. What else is new; it's not just in Mexico or some thrid world country where this happens (hopefully it won't happen to you or me). The details of this movie are astonishing, at times unpredictable and filled with surprises. A colorful example of how the American system of justice however blind can be dumb and perverted.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I don't usually like musicals in movie form, but this was rather fun. Tom Cruise's performance though made the film.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie was exceptionally well done.  The acting from the entire cast was something special.  Based on a true story about how a prince in England who had a problem with stuttering overcame that problem with courage, sheer will-power, and the support of an unconventional speech therapist.  He eventually become the King of England and gave many speeches at a very dark period of history where his subjects looked to him to get through it.
B002N7P23I|3.0|The American version is MUCH better, despite what the feedback here shows. To my mind, the positive ratings here must be the result of some concerted effort to \\"stuff the ballot box.\\"<br />Why is the American version better?<br />Better pacingI Too many boring little interviews in this original version---MUCH better pacing in the one with Jennifer Carpenter (despite the dubbing, you can tell she's the better actress, too).<br />(I also don't remember yawning at about the :25 mark in the American version.)<br />But, hey...YOU decide.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very, very good movie, pretty much the best of the buch of marvel lately, thor, captain america and iron man. Not talking about the amazing spiderman, if you read something good about that movie, most likely the studio pay for that review, is just awful, there is no way someone really liked the amazing spiderman or said it was better that the tobey maguire movies, anyway.<br />The avengers is well written, good actors, and truly pays homage to its source, the comics books, highly recommended.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|That Amazon put a product like this Kindle cord into the market, have the cheap Chinese piece of garbage fail and cause a fire hazard, and then charge for a new one to replace it, is a ripoff.  You can usually depend on Amazon but not this time.
B00425S1H8|5.0|worked great. older chips did not work w/ W8. This one does. No issues with it whatsoever. Shipped fast,arrived in great shape.

B000FA5SMK|4.0|Nelson DeMille injects plenty of humor into this novel.I found myself laughing out loud a few times. The story moves along at a quick pace. As the evidence collects, you find yourself trying to figure out who did it before Detective John Corey solves the murder . Nice plot.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|this cd is worth the $30 and i play it non stop enjoying the cd beats. makes you wanna dance and dance more with every time you play this cd. true clubkid dance music.

B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Great game has many levels. Works great on the samsung vitality. Had alot of fun figuring out the whole game. Would recommend.
B003Y01JL2|5.0|Great album :)
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The Hunger Games is a greatly moving and tear shedding movie. It's basically highlighting that love and compassion can make you stick your neck out for someone ( in this case, Prim). I think that the changes in the movie, such as how the Cornucopia was a golden horn, but in the movie it was irregularly shaped and slate gray ,made a bit better to me (because I like when the movie is a little different than the book, to me it makes it more suspenseful), but left me wondering exactly whether it really was better or not. Perhaps those small changes are made to make it easier for the actors. The movie was GREAT and made me hope that humankind will never be as cruel, dictating and corrupted as in the Hunger Games.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I pretty much love any Reacher novel, although I'm highly disappointed at the casting of Tom Cruise as Reacher.  This one did not disappoint.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Well, where to start? I have always been a fan, but so utterly disappointed. Love Milla and was glad to see Michelle R. back.From crappy cg effects, horrible voice over for a character who is supposedly speaking english( can't even remember the characters name, nor care). Seems like someone was in a hurry just to make another movie and made no sense. Milla deserves more, she even looks disgusted in this. Just not seeing the point of why this was made other than to make lotsa money of the coattail of a very lucrative series....such a shame. I only gave it 2 stars because of most of the actors, what a waste of $3.99 to rent here.......
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love a good psychological thriller, this one leans to a different level.  Many of Flynn's novels point to the true side of a dark or diseased nature and often end with a lesson on some unusual mental illness.  This one was a page turner.  I like it better than Gone Girl .. reading her &#34;Dark Places&#34; now.  I believe she visits some dark places in her novels.  They leave you food for thought.  My only warning is that if you have had any experience with any of it, you will be affected.  Really liked this book.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This is how I imagine the apocalypse really happening--if it's zombies of course. I like that it seems to take regular people; not super joe or his affiliates, and show how it might be for them. They have all the annoying traits that real people have, and just have to accept them and overcome. Always an enjoyable watch--plus I love Woody, lol. :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started slow, got addicting and surprise but weird ending.......but it probably couldn't end any other way.  Format was different but characters were well built.  Twists and turns ... liked it
B004ZQGB9E|5.0|This set is fantastic!  I can't stop listening to it.  They sound quality is excellent and surpasses the Japanese imports - a feat I thought impossible. I will definitely be buying vols. II and III.  The demos are interesting, though not necessary.  Still, they only add and not subtract from the over all product.
B00005QX8O|1.0|DVD was for European DVD players. Why would any one sent this format to an American address? Why, Why Why?
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love pink ver nice,  Nice for a girl.  Would recemmond it to you. What could be better for a young girl
B000VZYMDU|5.0|Roy Buchanan was quite probably the best and yet least known guitar maestros ever. I very personal favorite. Sweet Dreams is the signature song on this album.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Constant gap between the phone screen and the screen of the case. Followed installation instructions twice and no difference. Because of the gap touching the screen is very unresponsive. Highly dissatisfied.
1423124960|5.0|I love the short stories there the perfect length for my 3 yr old niece who loves books and there's a lot of brilliant pictures on every page in this book that everyone can enjoy!!
B003719GGS|4.0|Somebody handed me the &#34;original&#34; book a few years ago while I was still married and it made a lot of sense.  Unfortunately the damage was done.  Being single again I purchased my own &#34;Men's Edition&#34; as an ebook to understand and correct my behavior before moving forward, and not repeat it.  It isn't a dating book, nor will it help you with a new relationship.  However if you have an existing relationship, are still communicating, and willing to adapt, I think it can help.<br /><br />Much of what is discussed is simple, sometimes too simple.  There is elegance to the simplicity of &#34;5&#34; languages, and sometimes the scenarios are a bit eye-rolling simple, but the stories are told in a non-threatening and straight forward manner.  An important point is that you can change you, not the other person.  Hopefully there are enough stories that you can see yourself, because you just may be half of the problem.  Through your change, maybe it will be reflected back in a positive way.  This book helps paint a picture of what that might look like without requiring reading between the lines.<br /><br />This is an edited version of the original.  I guess the idea is that guys need a smack on the head or something.  It differs little from the original - other than to provide examples focused on and from a guy's point of view.  It is a good read and I found it interesting.<br /><br />Whether you are trying to renew an already good relationship, or revive a cooling one, this book is worth a read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because you really have to just think sometimes on how to get all pipes connected just right.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Stutters and off time on occasion, too slow, or to fast  otherwise fun.  Can,'t read the chat. A good thing there are some really gross comments & nasty junk.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Time travel, monsters, mystery, and affection for family and friends...all are present in this broad stroke of fiction. The vintage photos are a work of heinous.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|'m a big man, I can admit when I'm wrong. Sure, \\"Tattoo\\" sucks. It's the worst song on the album and it's slightly embarrassing...but everything else on A DIFFERENT KIND OF TRUTH works. Maybe the songs are recycled from decades long since past, but so what? They were still re-worked and recorded by the Van Halen of today, and they don't disappoint. It's like it's 1984 all over again: big choruses, crazy solos, thumpin' drums, super-bravdo, etc. Van Halen don't reinvent the wheel so much as get it rolling again, and thank God...because rock was starting to get so dismally boring. \\"Blood and Fire\\" recalls the pure adrenaline of \\"Panama.\\" \\"You and Your Blues\\" is like an update of \\"Unchained.\\" Van Halen shouldn't work in 2012, but somehow they do. My favorite track, the one that gets the most play at the gym is the stupidest: the frivolous \\"Stay Frosty.\\" Why does \\"Stay Frosty\\" continue to get played? Probably because it's a straight up rocker that's fun and funny. While I was busy being jaded, Van Halen was busy partying. At a certain point, it's easier to just give-in and love them. So you win guys, A DIFFERENT KIND OF TRUTH rules.<br /><br />Check out [...] for my other Top 10 albums of 2012.
B00007EDY5|5.0|This purchase was money well spent! It saved my sanity during my semester of studio lighting class. Very reasonably priced, too.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|I am completely and utterly in awe of this album. Long, meandering, and epic, PSYCHEDELIC PILL was the one album this year that could have been released in 1968 or 1970 not no one would have blinked. Not because it sounds like it's from that period in time, PSYCHEDELIC PILL is truly a record out of time: intensely personal and yet also very distant and spacy. This is a folk record. This is a jam-band record. This is a singer-songwriter album created by a full band. \\"Walk Like A Giant\\" is the work of an incredibly powerful wizard, hurling lightening bolts of rock. I had no idea Neil Young still had it in him to create such a potent work of pure genius. This doesn't even sound like a comeback it sounds like he never left. Those who scoff at the albums longer cuts, of which there are a few, are missing the point. Like I said in my original review: \\"the album opens with \\"Drifting Back,\\" a 27 minute-long song that's acts as a kind of sonic air lock, decompressing the listener into the album's atmosphere. Or perhaps a better metaphor would be that's a time machine. I like that better because PSYCHEDELIC PILL sounds like lost 1970's record, with the lengthy \\"Drifting Back\\" serving as a trippy time tunnel to the past.\\" The free flowing extended jams are the destination, not the journey. PSYCHEDELIC PILL is an intricate album that I predict will endure as a kind of sonic evergreen, which will be studied and appreciated for decades to come. Do yourself a favor and check out this once-in-a-generation masterpiece.<br /><br />Check out [...] for my other Top 10 albums of 2012.
1848507836|4.0|Beautiful insights but a bit reduntant... I am thankful for this beautiful account of Afterlife and its relevance to our life on earth.
B007F39498|5.0|I was listening to Little Steven's Underground Garage and Little Steven (who is more than a little biased, being in the E-Street Band) talked up the record and played \\"Easy Money.\\" Before I could dismiss WRECKING BALL outright, I heard \\"Easy Money\\" and became instantly hooked. The whole album has a very electric-folk/Old-Timey feel to it. WRECKING BALL is Springsteen's recession album, which while not much fun, does provide an excellent palette for a rough and tumble artist like The Boss. \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" and \\"Death To My Hometown\\" are great, hardscrabble songs that could work for The Great Depression or the late 2010's. Through it all, Springsteen remains a symbol of art nourishing us through the hardest of times. These are the times when a bard of his stature is most desperately needed. He didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Check out (...) for my other Top 10 records of 2012.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I enjoyed the imigaes the book and characters conjured up.  Additonal commentary was unappreachiated but tolerable.  Many memories were made and hours filled with adventure when I read this as a child and was very refreshing as an adult.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Pound for pound, LONERISM has more cosmic-freak-out-otherness than any other album on this list. If you've ever wanted to get high without drugs, grab a pair of headphones and take this album into a dark room. Close your eyes and prepare to go on adventure. Imagine Oasis and The Flaming Lips doing a s*** ton of LSD and then merging into one band: that's LONERISM. \\"Endors Toi\\" and \\"Elephant\\" shatter your mind and then blow away the pieces. I really liked BEARDS, WIVES, DENIM by Pond, which is essentially Tame Impala, but overall I think LONERISM is the stronger, more accessible record. But don't take my word for it: go sit in the dark tonight with this album.<br /><br />Check out [...] for my other Top 10 albums of 2012.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is an excellent conclusion to the trilogy. Great performances and characters. Heard about the length of the movie but it didn't seem too long. Loved it!
B0094OLJD0|5.0|Who knew that teaming up the dude from Talking Heads and that weird indie-chick St. Vincent would yield such a good harvest? The bombastic lead track \\"Who\\" is real stunner, but it's the one-two-punch of two unlikely freaks getting together and letting their freak flags fly that elevates LOVE THIS GIANT beyond \\"Who.\\" This is Byrne's strongest post-Talking Heads work, hands down. It wasn't that I'd written him off so much as I just didn't bother to really think too much about David Byrne at all. LOVE THIS GIANT re-establishes Byrne as a relevant artist with a lot more to say. I wasn't super familiar with St. Vincent prior to LOVE THIS GIANT, but I'm learning. That she's half his age and still manages to hold her own in the presence of such a legend is no small feat. I still get chills every time I hear \\"Optimist.\\" So, in summary: the triumphant return of one of rocks most unlikely superstars plus a rising indie-songstress plus crazy horns equals LOVE THIS GIANT. It's a record that you put on and feel refreshed, challenged, and puzzled by.<br /><br />Check out [...] for my other Top 10 albums of 2012.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I actually listened to this audio-book and absolutely loved the book and the readers performance.  I couldn't wait for my commute home so I could listen more.  I loved that it has King-worthy creepiness but not so over the top (Duma Key) that it belongs in the Horror or Fantasy genre.  The only negative about the book is several anachronisms that were surprising since I thought King always put a lot of research into his books.  Nevertheless, minor flaws that didn't  detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.
1476712042|5.0|I was hooked in the first chapter. Could not put it down. I am a true fan of this book and author. It was passionate and fiery. I gave it 5 stars and cannot wait to read Walking Disaster.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Even in their mid 60's, Led Zep is still amazing. GREAT concert! Sure, it isn't 1972, but Led Zeppelin still sounds incredible. Jason B does a great job on percussion and his dad must be beaming with joy from up above. To the members of Led Zeppelin, thank you for all the great music and memories you have provided me in the least 40 years.
B009POCFTG|4.0|First off, I will say this is the first time where I've absolutely hated every character that was portrayed in a film. However, on that note, every actor in this movie especially Matthew McConaughey gave such brilliant performances and I have to say almost Oscar-worthy that prevented the movie from crumbling. William Friedkin still hasn't lost his touch as a filmmaker even though audiences haven't given such praise since his movies are off the wall crazy and have no plot. After watching this movie, you will be asking yourself, what the hell just happened but you can see how that contributes to the darkly comic nature of the film. Like I said, the film's major problem is the plot because there is no plot and the pacing of the movie is extremely slow. I wouldn't even say there is an ending because there is no resolution. But the performances alone outweigh its problems and for that, I can only recommend it as a rental.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|I first heard FCA when I was 15 yrs old in 1977. Classic album, historic. Listening to this dvd brought back many good memories. Mr Frampton still sounds great and his guitar playing is till top notch. The band sounds great. also. I highly recommend this DVD to all. Thank u Peter Frampton for all the great songs and memories. May u rock on forever!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I first got this puzzle on my phone, but it was hard to hit the little squares ;-) I was so intrigued I immediately got it my Kindle Fire (any tablet would be fine). If you like logic puzzles this game provides hours of entertainment - keep your mind sharp and enjoy a peaceful break from your hectic day. Five stars!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very interesting plot and will keep you playing all day! Highly addictive and I cant wait for part two!<br />Money well spent
B003NVN1C2|4.0|It is a great concept for a post-apocolyptic themed movie. It doesn't give much hope at the end, but that is one of the reasons this movie is so powerful, it shows truth.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|awesome<br />awesome the game is really suspenseful and exciting. I love it! can't waitfor more. following the clues. is cool!<br /><br />_
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I haven't played them all yet, but so far they're fun! The first game I played was super easy to get points.
0847835073|4.0|Everything is Better in the world because this Book exists. I can finally take Monica Home with me. Still would have love a little bit more.
B009G8GRX6|2.0|Not really in line with the louder and harder sounds on the two albums above but if you like their more discoesque stuff, this could be more up your alley.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love the characters , the story, and that is not a Cinderella story, she is not perfect and he isn't either. I would recommended !!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Always been a fan of &#34;Phantom&#34;, but takes the performance to a new level. The best part is the Grand Finale, where Sara Bright man sinds with four past Phantom's. Michael Crawford also makes an appearance but doesn't sing.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This movie has much excitment, action and wishful thinking for the teen in you life.<br />  RATE it 5 stars for everyone
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|IT takes up a lot of room on your kindle fire. If you have the HD one you will be fine. But there is sooooo many ads in the free one it is annoying. I deleted this off my kindle.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Movie was just ok. Selma Hayek looked fabulous and Benicio was his usual creepy character. It was a bit cheesy, but because of the plot... I am not surprised.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|It is worth the money! My 2 year old plays with this app every day. It really helps her learn how to doctor the animals.
B000000XB8|5.0|CCR being one of the great 60 th and seventies bands with hit after hit,the band produced some of the greatest songs ever. Tom Fogerty his brother John Fogerty , Stu Cook and dough Clifford being 4 great musicians. I love it
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My daughter goes to sleep to this app every night. We have the full version and love it. Although the free one is great too. It is a worth a purchase, if you have a child that is hard to get to sleep.
B009A9ETFE|5.0|If you're a fan f HIM, then you need this collection. All the best and a little extra. Most fans these days missed out on the debut of And Love Said No compilation album of greatest hits, but that was a decade ago. HIM has only gotten better and this album collects the best of their entire twenty year career.
B003C5FMEE|2.0|Not criticizing the artist, just didn't connect with this cd like I would have liked.  May try again but will be more careful<br />to review the tune selection.
B003WMX3SY|3.0|Damn nice case and looks super, I am running all of the 18 fans, only thing I didn't think about it takes in so much dust and dirt, I have to air out my computer every week. Not much fun! Okay for a kid for looks light show lol that's about it. with all of the color fans running looks like Christmas time. And I did get it for a nice low price.<br />Tracie Bobb, Philadelphia, Pa.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was used as a gift and has been highly praised.  Recommend it to everyone and may we not be afraid<br />to take what we hear to heart if it may apply to us too.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book puts heaven in the context of science. It is a great read. I just wish it was longer. I will be coming back to this book over and over again!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I am not sure were Phillip Phillips came from, but you can tell that he definitely has some Dave Matthews influence in his music and lyrics. True, nobody can be Dave, however if you like his genre then you will like this album. The music grows on you until you find yourself singing his songs throughout the day, not even knowing it.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Used this as an exchange gift at our family Christmas gathering, can't wait for their review on the movie.  I really like it.
0307352145|4.0|Do you prefer substantive, one-on-one conversations to parties and small talk? Are you enervated by group activities and energized by solitude. Thin-skinned, shy, self-effacing and empathetic? Better at writing than speaking? If so, welcome to the club--of introverts. Susan Cain's revelatory investigation of introversion, \\"Quiet,\\" gave me a new prism through which to view my own hyper-sensitive soul, helping me to better understand myself and giving me some tactics to better manage my introversion in a culture that generally rewards the backslappers. With pertinent allusions to recent research on the subject (ah, substance!) and interviews with introverts and researchers, \\"Quiet\\" gives voice to a seemingly overlooked but basic determinant of human behavior.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Christmas gift and exactly what I thought the person on my list would like.  Came in a timely manner and pretty sure the gift was well received.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I was tempted to buy for my collection but didn't since I don't rewatch my movies often enough.<br />I expect a sequel to &#34;Prometheus&#34;.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Only after I had read it I learned that is was for teens.  I loved it and have bought the second in the series.
B002BWP49C|5.0|love all of the movies in the twilight series<br />always been something about vampires....<br />wonder what that is .... the imortal thing?/???
B009E3EXMU|5.0|\\"Celebration Day \\" is fantastic ! There was no way I would've been able to be @the show in London in '07 . Led Zeppelin is just as powerful today as they were 30+ years ago ! From \\"Good times , bad times \\" , which said to the<br />world : \\" Hello , we're Led Zeppelin and we ROCK ! ... to \\"Rock and Roll \\" , they drive through some of Zeppelin's most iconic tunes like a classic muscle car  with the unmistakable rumble of a Bonham engine . I've always considered myself to be too \\"laid-back \\" to be fanatical about anything , but the cIhemistry betweenthem is undeniable . I have to amit ... I am a FAN !!! Thanks for releasing the dvd & cds ,so that that historic reunion could be experienced by the rest of us !
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Put forth in very credible terms. Doesn't seem likely it is a fabrication. Even an old atheist was impressed! Worth a read......
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book is aimed at people who are into the details of living and surviving on Mars. The writer seems to have good knowledge of what would be involved and most of his facts and ideas are based on reality.
B007P6VM04|5.0|There are some really great tunes on this disk, some very inspirational, and great driving music (not sleepy).  Obviously of the broadway musical genre, they'll keep you moving.  My wife ane I are waiting for the next season, mostly for the music.  Unfortunately, we're thinking the TV show has gone the way of many high budget broadway ideas and achieved failure to launch.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|It has nothing to do with the other Bourne films. It was the worst film I have seen lately. The story is absurd right from the beginning.
0307586901|5.0|This book not only has wonderful craft projects for all the holidays, but it's beautiful to look at as well.
B00992CF6W|3.0|just bought minecraft-$6.99!?!?!?!?. fun but very lacking.for such a price wouldn't you expect the full version. Well for this keep dreaming.
B001J9AQA0|5.0|I actually bought Science and Faith (their second album) first and have since become a huge fan! There are few current groups out there today that have the writing and vocals that truly move you. Highly recommend!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|started watching the 4 latest episodes because several co-workers are crazy about this show and talk about it frequently.  One fan said to watch  years one and two and I would catch up.  Was hooked and am looking forward to the rest up til this year.  It is interesting because it is such a dfferent topic from all the other crime and comedy shows.  It is very dark and the writing keeps you guessing and allowing one to come to several different conclusions about the action.  I find that so many shows on the pay per view channels have this quality and more freedom to explore off the wall themes.  I can say that this show sometimes gives me the creeps, especially the opening sequence starting with Dexter killing an insect on his arm.  I fast forward this intro.  This does not deter me from watching the rest of the shows.
B00A3AYI50|4.0|Much better than expected! I bought this on a whim based on the single home but was impressed with the rest of the record as well. Worth a listen.
B00932A2MC|3.0|But it was fun. Reminded me of Transformers. But I enjoyed it as sort of a sunday mind numbing lay on the couch and watch movie.
B009EANE3M|5.0|These guys continue to impress. Strong writing and music with no signs of slowing down. I don't think you will be disappointed.
0061992860|5.0|Bought it for my friend Kim who was admiring my personal copy. My copy is much bigger in size (square, not content) and this one was very compact and perfect for the paranoid like me (and perhaps Kim at this point).
141659521X|5.0|Good story in the long running series which comes back to present day after the last two stories were &#34;prequels&#34;  Wish there were more Mich Rapp's in the world  Book was preordered and was received when promised.  Love ordering books 2 at a time to get freee super saver shipping
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I chose this under pressure, having been accused by friends of having a closed mind. I have almost finished the book - only bought this morning - but have yet to read anything of literary merit. I guess there are many younger readers who would find it fascinating, but for those of us who are old enough, it's only a very poor imitation of early Harold Robbins style
B0079L2XTE|5.0|The movie was incredible, but just as impressive was the music: everything from classical, to Earth Wind and Fire. Definitely an enjoyable CD.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I actually was blown away by this book. I loved it and would read more by this author. Feel good book, quick read.
1906694176|5.0|These book really keep me wanting to read more about Lisbeth and Mikael.  The writing is amazing!!!! A page turner!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Super build up to what I thought was the ending, and then another build up, ending with an explosion!  Definitely my kind of book.
030745455X|5.0|These book really keep me wanting to read more about Lisbeth and Mikael.  The writing is amazing!!!! A page turner!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|my son really loves being able to build the houses on this game. very good game for children his age(12).
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game!! The picture is so clear on my Kindle and he enjoys the graphics...I would definitely recommend..
B00AMBH70S|3.0|If not for Renner in this movie I would have lost interest early on. Story line created strictly for the sake of the action, and not a very good story line.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very enjoyable movie...loved it! Something for everyone to enjoy...I love British humor and Maggie Smith is one of my favorites!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I liked the game but it will be a never ending project if you don`t spend a lot of money. You earn money as you go but not enough to get very far very fast. I go back every few hours to catch up on things. Another thing you have to have a Facebook account or another social network or you can't fulfill all the tasks at hand.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV today. If you haven't watched it yet, start from the beginning.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app so much. After trying many white noise apps I had my first dream in years. I had no problems falling asleep after years of long suffering sleepless nights and many prescription disappointments. The sound loops are hardly noticed. I would have to be searching for them to even hear them. Thank you so much for this app<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Sleeping in Chicago
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Enjoyed the book. I normally don't spend that much on e books though but a friend told me I had to read it. I enjoyed it but their were cheaper book  out there that I enjoyed more.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The perfect ending to an all engrossing series. Books to read over and over. New elements to pick up every time you read it again. Definitely a series for everyone to read!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book of 2012. Their is no way to not like this book it was amazing. This book took you on a rollar coaster with no ending in sight... I just finished the book and my emotions are still all over the place. You CAN'T regret reading this book.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|If you enjoyed their first cd, you will also enjoy this one. This is one of my favorite bands and they keep producing good music!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Well this product was wonderful. It was just like the one I actually bought from Apple. But the cost was  three quarters less.  I was really Pleasantly surprised. Pleased with the result of buying this product through Amazon.com. I'll definitely be purchasing more products in the immediate future.  Happy Holidays
B009AZZEU2|5.0|What can you say it awesome Soundgarden!  Buy it buy it buy it! This was a great return for this iconic band.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Have always loved his music and so that makes $3.99 a deal I couldn't pass up...<br />GREAT buy. Love this album!
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I've always loved using the opera browser. I have it installed on all of my pc's, my laptop, and now my tablet. It is almost always faster than the &#34;stock browser&#34; that is installed that is installed all pc's. Since I've used this browser almost since it first came out, I am always looking forward to installing it on any of my pc's. I am glad that there is a mobile version for tablets as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is probably the best book I have ever read. Recommendations to anyone that likes to read absolutely fantastic books.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this cd. It just has a different group singing typical Christmas songs. I enjoy listening to how different groups add their own touches to the classics.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|While the action sequences are good and the aircraft drone scenes are awesome, they don't save the movie. The acting is ok, but the parts written for the actors didn't leave them a lot to work with. The ideas and themes of the plot have great potential. Maybe the movie just tried to do too much in too little time.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Another cd I bought for my nephew. He really enjoys listening to this and said he was glad that I told him that he can have music on his 3ds. This is the 2nd cd that I have put on his 3ds and he wants more! Anyway, this is a great cd with a lot of new songs that he hasn't heard of before. A great cd to buy.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Although some knowledge of quantum mechanics and relativity may make it more interesting, it is not absolutely necessary. Dr. Krauss explanations are clear and, what is more, motivates the reader to look for more information about the subject. At the same time Dr. Krauss debunks many creationist and intelligent design myths.
B003Y3UNZW|5.0|I bought this cd for my nephew. He likes listening to Katy Perry and he said that sometimes he wished he could listen to her music on something other than the car radio. Since he has a nintendo 3ds, it does have ability to play mp3's. All I did was transfer this cd to his memory card for the 3ds and he is able to listen to this cd any time he wants! Now he wants more music! Lol!
B008QE9XD2|1.0|When the reviews for the film came out and described it as a farce, I vowed never to see it.  I am a DS purist, in fact, I own the entire series, all 26 volumes.  I loved it as a boy, running home to see it twice, once at 3:30 and another at 4:00.  The show was escapism at its best, especially for a primary school kid.<br /><br />I loved all of the original actors in their varied roles.  No one, not even Depp, whom I consider the best actor on the planet since Pirates 1.  He did a good job in what was asked of him, but he's no Jonathan Frid.  And Angelique?  I don't even know the blonde's name who played her here but there is no woman on this Earth better that bringing Angelique to life than Lara Parker.  The question asked on the boys of my generation is this:  Ginger or Mary Ann?  I say that question is incomplete.  Throw Angelique in that mix and, to me, the answer would be a hands-down Angelique.  Lara Parker is one of the most beautiful daytime actresses I have ever seen, enough so to jolt the heart of a seven year old boy!!<br /><br />I guess I am the purest among purists but I was disappointed that this movie didn't stay true to the original \\"intent\\" of the series.  The first movie, The House of Dark Shadows, was really just a jazzed up version of events we had already seen in the series, we'd seen it all before, but it took some of the blood and gore to higher levels. It was exciting and fun!  Even a 2012 remake of that, with a few tweeks, would have been ok.<br /><br />I guess I am nostalgic for the old days, but this movie did not do it for me.  With a $100 million plus budget and todays special effects, the write story line could have been the scariest thrill ride in the last decade.  The result, old purists like me would have been talking about it non-stop and legions of new fans would have come on board.<br /><br />Talk about the making of a new film franchise? This could have been the next monster, pardon my pun.<br /><br />And my mood for this reviewisn't helped by the fact that Jonathan Frid died earlier this year.  So, for the little kids who grew into adulthood, one of the special memories of our television childhood, Barnabus Collins, is gone.<br /><br />I could say the same about Andy Griffith, too, but that is for another review.<br /><br />Just Damn...
075669812X|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew for Christmas. He is really into the whole ninjago thing and he loves to read. He already has a couple of these books and said he would love to have more of them. I know he will enjoy them!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it was free so it is totaly worth the money, but it is a bit addictive, so there is that.
0525953728|5.0|Best book ever.  I was captured from the beginning to the end of this book.  Most wanted man in the world gone what better story is there? None!
0761171703|5.0|I am not a dancer. I am not a photographer. I am a simple Middle School Teacher. I was floored with emotion after receiving this gift from my husband. I could not put it down. I read it cover to cover - fine print and all. The inspiration for really living life this book reveals is exactly what I needed in my own life and for my students. Thanks to all the artists who persist in making this world and our culture a wonderful place for the rest of us.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I liked how the story wasn't left to just one film and they could branch out to other films. I never read this comic. I did read other Marvel titles. I'm sure most knew how it would end. Looking forward to the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i really really like this game and i hope they will add fun run someday that way i can beat all my friends.
B006O6F932|5.0|I bought this for my 7 year old neice as she loves Monster High. Everything was as decribed and all of the other reviews assisted me in making my decision. The price on Amazon was the best price in the marketplace so, as usual, it was a pleasure working with Amazon. I would recommend this product to anyone with children in this age group and Amazon to everyone!
B009HELT3C|4.0|It's like a double feature for a summer matinee, a romp through the Sci-fi world if aliens co-existent with the human race.<br />Nice CGI, good story and Josh nailed it with his portrayal of Agent &#34;K&#34;!<br />A good finish [?] to the MIB series.....
0307887898|4.0|This book is a must-read for anyone serious about starting a business. It is well written and covers the ground very well. It does not go into operational detail too much, but that is ok given the purpose of the book.
B00425S1H8|5.0|My husband got an older snap on auto code reader that had a serial port adapter to connect it to the computer. Serial ports are not on his laptop so he bought this item to turn it into a usb adapter. The drivers installed quickly and his reader was up and running in no time. It works great.
B009AP2G26|5.0|relates to everyone love  it keep up the good work its getting good and the way its goind is good also
B00114RKT8|5.0|I really like historical movies!<br />nicely done. The story was well presented and acted. Slavery is a human tragedy that should never be tolerated! How many of you are slaves to taxes and interest on debt? Stop feeding the monsters, banksters and government thugs!
B0040HERTY|5.0|This is the best DIE HARD! Great movie!!<br />Yippee kayeee. I ended up watching this right after expendibles 2 and finished off with this.<br /><br />Would rent again
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|It's a must have!! if you like macro photography your gonna love this one, at the beginning it's hard to get a good focus but after a few shots you find the way to do it, this one is definitely a lens that i carry with me all the time.
B005LAII12|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Ahhh... Marky Mark. I have to admit that I was originally attracted to this movie because I love when Wahlberg takes a break from his serious movies to loosen up a little bit. Then I saw the first, mature audience, trailer and I wanted to see this because it looked like it was going to be a great movie with or without Wahlberg. Thankfully it was.<br /><br />As most of you already know the film starts with a young John Bennett who is kind of a loner. No one really likes him so he doesn't have any friends. He's kind of the outcast on the street. Well one Christmas he gets a teddy bear which he calls Ted (very original John). Ted winds up being his best friend and then one night he makes a wish that Ted could really talk to him. Then the next morning, as luck would have it, Ted was alive. I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the movie but fast forward twenty years later and we have the John (Wahlberg) and Ted (MacFarlane) of today. The movie's premise is simple enough. John's being an outcast makes him befriend this teddy bear which makes him unable to become a mature, functioning, member of society. That's where Lori (Kunis) comes in.<br /><br />Even though the main story was a little cliche at times I still found it enjoyable. However there is a side story that I found extremely corny, unenjoyable, and kind of predictable. In short there's a man named Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) who was in love with Ted when he was a little boy, but his parents said there was no way he could have him because there was only one Ted and he belonged to John Bennett. Well Donny has a son named Robert (Aiden Mincks). Donny vowed that he would never let his child down no matter what he wanted and, of course, Robert wants Ted. The entire thing felt forced and it seemed like they were just trying to add something to the story that wasn't entirely necessary.<br /><br />One of the main elements that grabbed me while watching the movie was its pacing. Now there's two different forms of pacing when it comes to comedy films. The comedy and the story. In terms of the story I think it could have been a little better. Sure in the beginning they give you John's back story, but we never see when John started becoming somewhat of a screw up. And why is Donny such a weirdo? A lot of the information just seems kind of thrust at you. In terms of the comedy I think they nailed it. They start out immediately with small things like a kid getting beat up and John comes out to say if he could play with them. Then everyone, even the kid getting beat up, say something along the lines of \\"Go home Bennett no one likes you.\\" Then they work their way up to things like John and Ted doing cocaine with Sam Jones.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - While I don't agree with the \\"Funniest movie of all time\\" comment on the back of the box, Ted is still a very enjoyable film. Filled with a lot of laughs and a touching main story that is sure to make you fall in love with not just John and Ted, but Lori as well. I would definitely recommend checking this out if you're looking for an entertaining movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the most most most fun game i ever played in my life I love it so much it is fun
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app beats the stock calculator that came with my galaxy note.<br />I needed one that did percentages and this does that and tells you in English.Very nice
B000005J48|5.0|Very talented musicians, not just Piazzolla.  The music is full-bodied, complex, sometimes confronting, often really beautiful, presenting the full pathos of tango. Lots of melody and the rhythms - wow! It needs to be listened to several times in order to hear it all, and then  it becomes quite a favourite CD.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|In this set, viewers will get all 8 Harry Potter films, in Blu-Ray and full HD quality.  If you enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and don't want tons of special features, this is the set for you.<br /><br />The blu-ray discs do have some basic special features but, do not have the huge amount that the special edition collector sets might have.<br /><br />This set is a great buy.  Every movie for a minimal price.<br /><br />Now, in terms of quality, there are some issues with the set.  It isn't that all of the movies aren't in 1080p, however, the earlier movies were filmed at a time when HD and digital technology was in a newer stage.  So, the earlier movies, while they are scanned or transferred at 1080p, lack the polished, smooth and crisp look that the newer, more modern films have.  It isn't a problem per say, just a reality that a purchaser must be aware of.<br /><br />The audio is great and the newer of the movies are absolutely stunning in HD quality.  The older movies do have some benefit from the transfer but, also some drawbacks as the older CG technologies do not appear to blend or composite quite as well, though only really noticeable to people who look for that kind of thing.<br /><br />The stories are, as they always were, well told interpretations of the book series.  One must always keep in mind that every movie based on a book is just that, an interpretation.  One cannot expect a perfect transition.  Although, in my humble opinion, Dolores Umbridge is just as awful, even with the more limited violence and cruelties compared to the books.<br /><br />If you and your family are fans of the Potter series, this is a great way to get all of them in the best condition and quality possible at a great price.  Don't miss the opportunity.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game. just like the real game except I don't like the coins dropping off on the sides but still fun.
1591391105|3.0|Like one other one, it isn't bad but the style didn't meet my need.  Not bad advice, but nothing that made me change direction or improve my current circumstance.  Maybe I didn't look long or hard enough but I did not find it engaging.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I am thoroughly enjoying the Outlander series. I have followed Claire & Jamie for over twenty years of their lives. I'm on book six and loved them all. Some were a little slow on story development but soon drew me right in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good price for the final book of this wonderful series. Loved reading and finishing this book. Thank you amazon. Glad I purchased this.

0385738765|1.0|Okay, I read the first book a while ago and absolutely loved it! I mean, the idea seemed really original and it was fast-paced and awesome! But when I read the second book, I kinda wanted to throw the series away. The ending was AWESOME but the beginning and middle were just a little too lackluster for me. Although the last book, The Death Cure, is THE WORST BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF BOOKS!!! I would suggest to anyone that wants to read this series to read the first one, then stop. I haven't read the prequel to the series yet; hopefully that's good. This series reminds me a lot of the Hunger Games trilogy: the first book was AWESOME! the second book in THG was actually my favorite, which is different than this series, but the last book in both of the aforementioned series were TERRIBLE!! The Death Cure=horrible The Mockingjay=horrible

1849904251|5.0|I am very happy with the shipping for this!  It came only one day after the earliest initial date!  It's just in time for Christmas which I wasn't expecting.  I do not know much on the actual show but, I flipped through the book and it looks like a hardcore fan would love this.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I agree with everyone who said this album isn't radioheads best or doesn't do them justice. I was pissed off for months.  Now I can't get enough. That's what radiohead is all about. Break the mold at any cost, get used to it. Thom Yorke and co have once again jeopardized their fan base for a unique project that says \\"hey music world, suck it we're better than you.\\" Creativity at its finest, get over it
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this game.. it is very amusing and time consuming.. it is berg interestingly. interesting . mobbed it very much
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|always felt S2S was his best post-Ronson work of any sort. loved his concert from 72 (also a must own), but the Nassau show included in this pack is worth the weight of admission (though $65 seems steep!). best live bowie (and i own 4). sonics are wonderful as well.
141694737X|5.0|I got this and one other book for my 19 month old god daughter & she loved it!  She had a great time lifting up the flaps and seeing the different animals.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Wow is all I can say about this movie. I was captivated the entire time I couldn't bring myself to even look away. Tom Hardy is amazing in this. Be warned...there are many scenes where he is naked. And I don't mean just naked. I mean full front NAKED. And not just a glimpse...huge fight scenes while NAKED! It looks painful. The way this movie is done is amazing from the script to the editing to the acting to the filming.  I'd have to say this movie is perfect.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I have officially gotten hooked on Castle and have now watched all of the episodes from the pilot through the most recent.  I love that Castle & Beckett are officially together now & it's been interesting to see how their relationship changes their partnership.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I don't understand why this movie didn't get more attention but I thought it was REALLY GREAT. At times it was a little slow I guess but it had everything: emotion, excitement. Acting was great. I was so impressed with Tom Hardy it made me want to see every other movie he was in. Just a great great movie.
1469220660|1.0|I have nothing good to day about it I really just want my money back this should of been the actually book
B00943SQCI|4.0|Like most of the movies Johnny stars in, this is a fun and irreverent romp. With an outstanding supporting cast (and many of the 'Usual Suspects' in Tim Burton's movies) this movie is a must-see for Depp fans.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Since this book had gone viral I decided to give it a try, however after finishing it I was left completely numb. Not necessarily in  a good way either. While James manages to have you turning page after page hoping that the characters will have some redeeming qualities, I can say that reading this book was not a good idea. Essentially the book consists of 90% sex and repetitive adjectives. If the steamy scenes are enough to keep you interested, you will read the entire book. However, the sadist relationship between the two characters is violently<br />disturbing. No one changes in the end.. this is not a love story to be sure. It's a very sad tale of emotional, physical and sexual abuse that does not lead to any positive changes for the characters. I can say for myself that I hardly survived reading this book and to keep my hopelessly romantic state of mind I will not read the rest of the trilogy. Perhaps the sadness and emotional after effects of this book is what you can attribute to James' ingenious New York Times bestselling status.
B005T87QCI|3.0|atom is on the cover of the. game so he and Zeus should be in the game and on the product info it says they're in the updated version but I can't find it anywhere but its still fun but barely.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Expendables was released in 2010 and is written,directed,starred by Sylvester Stallone.This is one of the biggest ensemble casts of all action actors from the 80s and now.The cast includes Stone Cold Steve Austin,Dolph Lundgren,Jet Li,Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke,Randy Couture,Gary Daniels,Terry Crews.<br /><br />Expendables are a private mercenary group when CIA,Navy Seals,Marines cannot be called.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|A good time. Nice to have a comedy that has equally as much talent. Light, funny film if you just need to kick back. Entertaining, talented and fun. Cast is tops. Would rent again.

B008BDZOZY|5.0|As a Talking Heads devotee I was pleased to see this come out.  The wonderful beat, vocals, etc. remind me of my college years at RISD.  I really enjoyed the brass.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|the music is great, and I don't usually like musicals that much.  film is really pretty good - not profound, but some really funny lines.  Fresh characterizations.  The intensely snarky commentators for the acapella competitions is definitely a high point.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|What attracts me to Tim Ferriss' books, including \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\", is the pleasure of being provoked.  Much of life is routine and repetition.  Any book that makes you stop and start thinking about new possibilities is worth reading.  It made me laugh, think, imagine, argue, doubt, and plan.  So I don't plan on eating pigeons or crickets, but I do plan on learning languages and cutting down on my e-mail.  Pick and choose, Tim throws out dozens of ideas and challenges.  What is better than that?<br /><br />Here are some other books that have made me stop and think, and consider new ideas:  Taleb's The Black Swan; McDougall's Born to Run; all of Warren Buffett's writings; the writings of Peter Drucker; Machiavelli's The Prince; Kurzwiel's The Singularity is Near; Keegan's A History of Warfare.  Just a sampling, and diverse, but all thought provoking.<br /><br />Is Tim Ferriss in the same league as these authors?  Why not - like them, he looks at the world with wonder.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Outstanding soundtrack!!! Action-packed,even in the slow scenes. The visuals were well done. Tom Hardy is WONDERFUL opposite Christian Bale. It is long, but it holds your attention the whole time.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|i bought this for my 14 year old grandson and he really loves it... he loves it so much that my son has now bought it for some of his friends.
0316044695|5.0|This book grabbed my attention with the first paragraph. The author tells his own story of being the only survivor of four Navy Seals on a mission. His ability to add humor to a gut wrenching story of gruesome training to become a Navy Seal is unmatched by any other book. The emotions elicited when reading about their training, their mission, the deaths of his Seal friends and his fight for life as the Lone Survivor, will never be forgotten. The book has provided me with a new appreciation of what these guys do for our country. I challenge anyone not to like this book.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Ladies you will LOVE him and this movie, guys will love the action.  It is Thor and a love story in one!  I'd recommend it for anyone.  Young kids may not get it, but I don't remember and blood and guts!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have just recently happened upon Patricia Cornwell's novels with the character of Kay Scarpetta. So far I have enjoyed every one of them. Can't wait to read more and happy they are available on Kindle.
B000YHG72E|5.0|An awesome film for the entire family.  There are all kinds of films out there during the holidays.  This one is sure to be one that should be on your list.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|...And it was good.  Captain America was by far my favorite character.  This movie encouraged me to see the others.  All are a good movie night.  ...And &#34;spoiler&#34;  --- the good guys win.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|After all the hype, I was sorely disappointed in this film.  Pointless, sad movie. I don't think it's watchable at any time.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|la la la la la. i hate this review process. I want to just give it stars and move on.
B000001FLA|5.0|I love Trilogy! Growing up as a guitar player, I was never that into Yngwie; and so I never owned Trilogy until now. Wow! I think I really missed out. This CD is easily as good, if not better than, his first 2 solo releases. I`m glad that as I expand as a musician I get to fill in the gaps and hear the tidbits I missed along the way. Rock on Yngwie the King!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|i watched this a while ago and can't really remember all of it. i think i liked it. end of review
B000002OVJ|5.0|I had not heard Live at Leeds since I was a kid, but I knew it was a good CD. But I didn`t know (at least as my present self) how great of a CD Live at Leeds is, and therfore how great of a band The Who were. They were truly incredible! I guess sometimes memory fails the issue when it comes to art, music, and sensations. I`m sure glad I bought this CD. You might be too.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|cartoon that was not what i expected. the previews don't really give you an idea of what it is about
B000005RPX|5.0|I think it is great to own a couple of alternate nights of the fantastic 1972 Japan recording that became &#34;Made in Japan&#34;. Granted &#34;Made in Japan&#34; is the best of the 3 available nights (not counting the night in Tokyo on August 17th, when Ritchie and the band were very &#34;off &#34;). Nontheless, the other 2 alternate nights (Osaka-August 15th and 16th) were great. They add a fresh color and variety for those of us who have been listening to &#34;Made in Japan&#34; for decades. Thanks for digging these gems up from the vault, guys. Good job!
B007SSDS24|5.0|I just want to give this stars and move on but i have to write a review? i give it 5 stars
0316228532|5.0|After some months have gone by and the buzz has died down, I still dont understand why everyone hasnt loved this book. Rowling dazzles with a plain story turning it into a book you cant put down. She has clearly passed the test.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|just let me rate it with stars and leave an optional review if i want to take the time. i liked it
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Very good DVD and CD set.  Everything looks and sounds crisp and new instead of dated like the original bootleg tapes apparently did.  Watch the DVD I just couldn't stop thinking how those people who paid their minor door fee back in the 80's to see Muddy Waters suddenly found themselves treated to the Stones too.  Talk about the most bang for the buck.  This is all very cool
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Awful.  Being a Tim Burton film it had its moments--some interesting visuals, a few fun and/or dark moments--but on the whole it was poorly written and entirely forgettable.  Ultra-loyal, die hard Burton fans might find this worth watching.  If you're one of those, you know you have to see it.  For your average fan like me who's grown up loving most of his films but still doesn't want to waste his time or money on a bad movie, you've been forewarned.  I think this might well be Burton's worst film to date.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|This was a stupid movie.  There are smart movies and stupid movies, and this one was stupid.  Jennifer Lawrence's acting was good, but the story and script were not very interesting.  I felt like there was alot of mind control in this movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Okay, it wasn't just Anne Hathaway who made this a good movie. There's something of a twist at the end that we didn't notice until it happened, though there is a visual hint. Overall, a good enough story and not an over-reliance on special effects. We are not huge Batman fans, but we really enjoyed this. There are certainly worse ways to pass a couple of hours.
